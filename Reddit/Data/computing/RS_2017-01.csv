I like to think that I have a pretty strong resume for a computer engineering student, but I'm having trouble deciding on what to focus on. Here's a little bit about me.

- Undergraduate junior majoring in computer engineering, minors in comp sci and math

- 4.0 major GPA, 3.96 cumulative 

- Been working on research regarding computer vision and robotics since sophomore year of college in a lab at my university (mostly C and Python programming)

- Completed an internship on big data analytics last summer, going to work as an intern for computer vision/autonomous robotics at Lockheed Martin this summer

- some interesting side projects, like iOS development, computer games controllable through hand gestures via webcam, and writing a multicore processor for assembly on FPGA boards

- programing skills in C/C++, Python, Java, C#, Matlab, Swift, Assembly

- worked as an undergrad TA in a few different classes (introductory C, data structures in C/C++, diff eq)

But my extracurriculars are a little lacking. I guess what I'm asking is, do you think it would be better for me to relax a bit on side projects/internship stuff, and focus on extracurriculars/research for graduate school, or should I keep doing what I am doing? Currently I am only involved in my college's ambassador's program, but my research/courses/side projects take so much time that I rarely have time to sleep or see my friends, let alone join tons of clubs. I also wonder if my decision to pursue internships and make industry connections will be perceived as worse than constant focus on research."

All your help was awesome!

All of you answered my question perfectly and gave me a ton of useful resources. But then you went above and beyond! One of you sent me a keyboard over Amazon, which I've been using ever since. One of you sent me an internship program in NYC (didn't get in, but ah well!). One of you even offered me a room in your apartment! I felt too bad to take it, but I really appreciated the offer. Maybe be a little more careful taking strangers into your homes, Pythonistas! Haha, just kidding.

Coding's helped me keep my sanity these past months. I've been working on a ""world creator"" of sorts. Builds a procedurally-generated (I hope I'm using that term right!) world from the ground up, including the terrain and climate. Got me reading all sorts of weird books in the library, that's for sure; topics I've never considered before. Maybe I'll share what I've got so far once I clean it all up a bit! It's quite messy at this point.

Sorry for ranting, I'm feeling quite excited right now and I wanted to share it with someone! I'm getting off the streets this week. I mended my ties with my family and now I'm gonna take care of my grandma, who's become very ill recently.

Hope you all have a great New Year's Eve/Day!"

After that my working profile is pretty sad i only work shit jobs like clerk groceries store, steward and waiter (im 24)

I plan to go back and complete higschool (at least) but to do that i need a decent job with set on stone work hrs or set on stone day off so working for restaurants is not a option

Looking at my job market in my city, iven aming to job like departamental cloth store, receptionist, office assistant or whatever other job that offers good working hrs (not really looking to much into howmuch money they pay) but the problem is that all this jobs ask for higschool and above some even want finishd collage on top of 1 or 2 years of experience and FEMALE ONLY (literally getting told NO because i have a dick) and im feeling cornered to go back and work in restaurants.

We also have big boys hotels in my city that hire people all the time, sometimes they just list jobs and say ""send resume"" i was thinking to send mine and just put in there ""looking for whatever job this is the list of jobs im interesting in"" and hope they give me a call offering me something but not really sure if is a smart thing to do

The interviews that i already did in the past my experience is pretty much the employer talking about the job im applying for in a bigger and more complicated way of what it actually is and telling me lack of experience and shit and just getting told no

My GPA is pretty bad (2.6) so unfortunately I can't get into grad school. I have had a few internships that aren't relevant to my field at all (one was in publishing, the other was event coordination and marketing), some research experience (I worked on an econometrics project with a professor), volunteer work, service industry jobs and random campus jobs I held as a student.

I have been searching for the past year, started to get more aggressive in my search since July. I have probably submitted around 700+ job applications (combination of sending in resumes + cover letter, applying on company websites and sites like LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, StartWire, Indeed, Craigslist, etc). I tried connecting with alumni from my school, and even thought I was going to get a part-time job doing remote data work through that connection but that didn't work out. I tried going to career fairs and networking events but nothing came of those either. I tried asking my professors if they knew of any leads but they ignored me. I've redone my resume and cover letters multiple times and made sure everything was perfect and up to date. I am getting desperate and helpless with each rejection I get. I see all of my peers getting these amazing jobs on LinkedIn and I constantly wonder what is wrong with me. 

I have a few skills. I know how to use SAS and Stata. I am fairly competent with Excel, I know basic VBA, macros, pivot tables, powerpivot, vlookup and all that jazz. I have been working on improving my Access, SQL server, R, and Python skills these past few months as well through tutorials on Lynda. I've also been volunteering as an SAT tutor these past few months too so I have something to explain my resume gap.

I have had a few interviews (mostly phone screenings) but they never seem to go anywhere. I realize I probably don't interview well and am working on improving that. A lot of jobs I apply to are out of state, as my area and state in general is terrible for job opportunities right now. That might be a factor too as I'm sure most employers have hoards of competent local candidates competing for those positions. I've applied to mainly entry-level analyst jobs but I've since branched out and am looking for anything, at this point.

I would greatly appreciate any help and advice at this point. I am nearly 50K in student loan debt, desperate and don't want to be living in my parents house forever! (Although I am grateful for their support!)

Also, I'm in the US if that helps!

5ldgz3,1,2016-12-31,HELP SO HARD. (25m) changed with (28f) and super scared.,Anatidaephobiaaa,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5ldgz3/help_so_hard_25m_changed_with_28f_and_super_scared/,"First time posting. Met a guy (25m) that was amazing when I(28f)absolutely was not looking for a relationship. He wanted my four year old, fatherless, son to accompany us on one of our first dates. I tend to listen to everything and glean a lot from what people say. Over time, he showed me that he was a person that genuinely cared about others and had a big heart. I fell head over heels for him, and so did my son. Fast forward five months later. He owns a string of businesses where we live, and one of them got broken into. Two weeks later, it happened again. Two weeks later, it happened again. As this all was happening, he started to withdraw, from me, specifically. He had a tattoo internship that he'd been excited about, and he got over that as well. For a while, he also wanted to kick out his roommate, a close friend. Just because he was ""over it."" I know he has bad anxiety (and doesn't want to see a dr about it). He had a fucked up childhood (poor and beaten by his mom, moved around a lot), and later on he was cheated on or used by every girl he dated. Now, I'm no angel. I can be argumentative, and I can be annoying. I don't like making decisions about where to eat (though I tried to fix that), and I love just being together. I don't care if he's doing something else, I just like having him around (which he later said felt like pressure to focus on me). He had originally showed my picture to friends and they'd said something along the lines of, ""how the hell did you pull that off?"" He, himself, said I was miles out of his league. When he was sick, I went way out of my way to take care of him. Meds, homemade chicken noodle soup, tea with honey, you name it. He wanted to do a juice fast (I knew they were bullshit), guess who suffered with him (even though I work out a minimum of five hours daily and he didn't)? His goal was to lose a certain amount of weight and keep it off for a year, but he didn't know how to cook or take care of himself. Guess who went grocery shopping and meal prepped at all hours of the night for him AND HIS ROOMMATE so he could meet his goals? I wake up around 330 am everyday because I have swim practice. I can't count the number of nights I stayed up until 130 with him, making food for him, or just talking to him because he couldn't sleep. It all seemed like after the break-ins, he was crazy stressed. About a week before Christmas, he invited me over to help him plan out things (which I love to do), and stay the night. That night, he looked at me and said, ""I don't think I can do this."" 
Me: ""uh... do what?""
Him: ""be in a relationship. Dating.""

He told me that he's better off being single, that he loves me, and that he doesn't want to date anybody else. He's repeatedly told me that I am, hands down, the best person he's ever been with, but he needs to focus on him. 

So here's my problem. We really don't talk much. He knows a dr in an urgent care found a mass in my abdomen less than a week after he dumped me, just before Christmas. He said if I needed to vent to anyone, he was there. But he doesn't talk to me. Part of me wants to wait for him to figure his shit out and realize what a dumbass he's being. Another part of me is terrified that he's not really the kind, caring person I was sure he was. Most of all, I'm heartbroken. I need surgery to remove what turned out to be a malignant stromal tumor in my small intestine, and I wish he was there to hold my hand while I freak out over the results of my lymph node biopsies, which I won't get back until after surgery. I'm healthy, I'm fit. I'm not someone that develops problems. Yet here I am, wishing the guy that I thought cared could just stop focusing on himself long enough to be there for me.
Do I keep waiting for him, with the faith that he'll eventually regain his sanity? Or do I just stop? "

Please. 


I don't know where you think you are, or who you think you are, or when you think you are, but whatever you think is wrong. 


Your names are Dr. Lily Jacobs and Dr. Simon Yao. You are brilliant particle physicists. The year is 2072 and you have to snap out of it or we’re all going to die. 


Maybe I should back up. Maybe if I tell you about what’s going on something will jog your memory. God I hope so. My name is Evie, Evie McCray. I’m an intern at Protech, working for the Division of Matter Transfer. In laypeople terms, we call it teleportation. I work for you two. Or at least I did. Right now the whole division has gone absolutely haywire, but I’m getting ahead of myself. I started working here three months ago. It’s part of a college research project for me, the worst part is, I’m not even a particle physicist, I’m an analytical chemist, but this was where I could get in for an internship. In any case, when I started, you two were damn near finished building the full size machine. Again, I’m moving too quickly.


Dr. Jacobs - you started working for Protech five years ago, directly out of your PhD. Your thesis was on the transmutative properties of neutrinos, and you’d been working in an underground lab studying how subatomic particles (when present in sufficient quantities), can transform neutrons into protons. Then, the newly transformed atoms can be heated to incredibly high temperatures to promote electron activity, and you essentially change one atom into another. That’s a lot of technical jargon, but it essentially meant that you could change carbon into nitrogen using physics and chemistry, which is a pretty huge deal. Anyway, you were hired to run the Division of Matter Transfer after the higher ups were impressed by your publications. The idea was always to make a system that could safely transport perishables to high risk areas. You are brilliant, and kind and funny. You were always my favorite person to see every day. Your mother misses you terribly, and I’ve been taking care of your dog for you.


Dr. Yao - you’ve been working for Protech for much longer than Lily - I mean - Dr. Jacobs, nearly 10 years. You started off engineering nanites that could take genetic material and clone it almost instantly, before moving on to cloning inorganic and non-living materials. I’m not really sure how it works, you never really explained it to me. You started working in DMT at the same time as Dr. Jacobs was as Chief Engineer. You built the machine that made the magic happen. Your family is in Cleveland, but you don't talk about them much. We were never really close, but you're the smartest man I ever met. 


I suppose now we should get to the good stuff, but I’d like to preface with we never intended for this to be used on humans. It wasn't in the design plans, we weren't even sure that the small scale machine was safe to transport food until we got the people from the FDA involved. But it was safe, and we built a bigger machine. A huge machine in fact. Big enough to transfer 100 tons of grain from our lab in Seattle to our partner lab in Savannah. Everything was set to go, but when we hit the button to start the process, the particle beam warning light came on. There was a bad connection between the transmitter and the power source, and we had to fix it. So, the three of us went down. I wasn't allowed to touch anything, seeing as my most important function to this point was proofreading emails. So the two of you got your hands in, and for lack of better terminology, fiddled around. We heard a loud electrical noise, smelled copper and you were gone. So was the grain. 


We called Savannah to see if they’d gotten you guys and/or the grain. They hadn't, but something showed up. It smelled wrong and it oozed some sort of thick, black, pasty substance. The chemists who looked at it were stumped. It was as though everything holding the grain together decided it didn't feel like it anymore, and so all the protons, neutrons and electrons slurries together, and the charges all faded. That’s never happened before. Charges aren't supposed to fade. Protons and electrons repel one another, they don't commingle into some sort of sludge. The scientists who weren't wearing protective gear when they encountered whatever came through started to feel sick. They smelled what they described as an “electrical smell.” Within two hours they were puking up black slime. Within four hours they were dead. Whatever that shit was, it was toxic. It also doesn't burn, dissolve or interact with the substances around it, it can't, from a chemical perspective. 


We assumed that you two were part of the sludge, and that you were unfortunate victims of a scientific experiment gone wrong. The problem was, the sludge didn't go away, but it did expand. It started to reduce the things around it to slurry as well, until the lab was essentially a black pit. The smell at that point grew too strong to block it with standard protective gear. And the black shit that people were vomiting up was the same toxic muck. The government is currently trying to lockdown the site and prevent anyone else from going near it, but there have been reports around Savannah of people who work in sewage coming into contact with it. Those people take it home, and it’s spreading. The doctors here estimate that once 100 people are infected, the resulting spread will be enough to start an epidemic, seeing as nothing seems to get rid of it. We’re at 23 now. About 15 minutes ago we got a call that the sludge had leaked into the water supply. I won't be surprised if half of the watershed is infected within the next 48 hours. 


It turns out that there is some silver lining. You guys aren't dead. You got trapped, in my head. It’s amazing what a brain activity monitor can tell you. At first we thought I was having a seizure or something, but there’s three sets of activity, three separate brainwave patterns, and most eerie, three separate heartbeats, although your two heartbeats are fainter. We don't know exactly how this happened. But I can tell you this. Whatever your life is, it's not real. Those people in your house are not your family/friends. You don't live in the house you’re in. You don't have the job that you remember going to every day. Whatever life you’ve carved yourself is a fantasy, something that will take you away from what’s really going on. It isn't real. 


The heartbeats have gotten fainter, as my brain is treating you two like an infection, cutting off oxygen and resources from the parts of my body dedicated to feeding you. You won't live long if we can't get you out, and neither will I. The black sludge is dangerous, contagious, and highly suspect. If you’re there, you’re the only people who can fix this.


So please, wake up.

I'll be in engineering, and was wondering if there are any other engineers who have any advice from what they have seen. My salary should be in the upper half of the 25% bracket, from what I have seen. I'm not sure what that will adjust to after taxes.

I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm graduating in electrical engineering soon and applying to specific jobs. Problem is, I've had a lot of engineering internships from completely different fields. I wanted to make sure I exposed myself to as many different engineering fields as possible while in college (better to try then, than when you are graduated), and I'll never regret that decision.

What I'm having a hard time deciding is if only certain internships should stay, or if I should keep them. Also, some of the internships lasted longer than others. On average though, each lasted 5-8 months and I never had more than 3 weeks between them. Here are two reasons why I'm having a hard time deciding:

1. If I remove an internship, I will have a few months of a gap (either in the summer or school year) in my resume.

2. I worked a lot of jobs while in college (7, to be exact). They all gave me unique skills that I feel make me a good candidate for several of these jobs. One gave experience in dealing with the technical support and maintaining customer relationships. Another gave me great software development experience and the Agile development process. Another made me better at multitasking. Another made me better at understanding how control systems worked. Another gave me good experience with technical writing. Another gave me experience with machine learning (hot word for many many jobs right now, and will continue to be). And...you get the picture.

So, how should I go about deciding which internships and/or jobs should I remove? I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything they may find as useful to their team or company.


Thanks in advance everyone, I really appreciate it."

I wanted to major in computer science, but my parents did not let me, because they said there's no jobs and they are all outsourced, and that my marks were too high to go into computer science (I had a 99% average), and that I couldn't turn down acceptance into the best engineering school in my country, and that engineers made 200k/year (which now I obviously know is not true), etc. So I had to major in electrical &amp; computer engineering, which I regret.

However, I want to get into computer science and be as good as I can be. Currently, I have a 3.9/4.0 GPA in my program, so I should be able to get into grad school, but know very little discrete math and theoretical computer science.

So my question is, what should I do? Should I shift my current undergrad degrees focus from computer engineering to electrical engineering, and then go back to school to get a bachelors in CS, or go the computer engineering route and try to get into a CS grad school? Apparently the latter is possible, but I'm not sure what my best options would be. I'm in my third year, and have taken all computer engineering courses so far. Such as compilers, operating systems, hardware,

EDIT: My gut opinion is that I think it would be best to focus in electrical engineering, and then get a double major in theoretical math and theoretical computer science, then go into grad school, which would probably give me the best of both worlds.

I will have no student loans after completing my degree, because I have landed an internship position, and can likely use the money I make to pay for my next degree as well, since I currently live with my parents.

Thanks!

I've been working on getting rid of these bad habits and trying to make my code more legible and easier for other people to look at and immediately understand. 

I saw a story here on reddit posted by a intern who always had to have his code be rewritten by a senior developer. Every morning he would come in to the office and find that his original code had been commented-out and rewritten. It wasn't an issue of functionality; it was always a problem with readability, efficiency, or conforming to generally accepted standards.

We are really good at some things, and really lacking in other areas. One of the latter is asset tracking.  
We have asset tags, but we do not use any asset tracking software. The asset tag number is in the computer name. The only way for us to know who a computer is assigned to is that our help desk software scans the network every day, and fills in the logged on user. We also use another product to manage computers that also pulls the logged on user. There are 3 obvious massive flaws in this; 1) the computer needs to be online and 2) the user needs to be logged on and 3) logged on user is not always going to be 100% reliable in telling us who the computer is assigned to.  
I have a security role, so while this isn't exactly my area, it totally is at the same time because accurately tracking our assets is absolutely part of being secure.  
I've brought this up before, and have faced resistance from both management, who don't seem to understand the importance, and coworkers, who don't want to deal with the extra work (yeah that's right, scanning an asset tag in is a real back breaker).  
My question to all of you is - what product would you recommend that is low cost (to please management) and easy to use (to please my coworkers) so that I can convince them to use it. I know that spiceworks is free, would anyone recommend it? I used it at my very first job as an intern years ago so I don't remember it too well.

I'm sure you all remember [the contest](https://redd.it/5j0v6c) we've been having over the last two weeks; here are the winners!

***

**First off are the game categories:**

##Best Patch

**[3.12 - Ullustrious Sage](https://redd.it/4qhgu5)** was the winning patch. It was the start of the 2016 Summer of Smite, and introduced Erlang Shen, as well as the new Thorns and Phantom relics. It was also infamous for removing Golden Bow and Throwing Dagger from the game. As controversial as it was, people thought the removal of those items outweighed the negativity that Erlang Shen received, and voted it the Best Patch of 2016.

##Best New God

**[Amaterasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIUhRqUzES0)** won this category by quite the margin. She was the first god added in 2016, and heralded the release of the Japanese pantheon, as one of Japan's most iconic deities. She set a new standard for accuracy to lore and respect to culture, and is still beloved almost an entire year later. She was followed by Skadi and Jing Wei by votes in second and third, respectively, to round out a trifecta of female characters voted as the top three Best New Gods of 2016.

##Best Event

This year's **[Season Ticket](https://redd.it/49qm79)** was added all the way back in March, and has been handing out rewards to thousands of players months later. At first there was some controversy, with a new chest added, featuring recolours of the most popular T3 and T4 skins; but with patience, we were able to see the full potential of a year-long event. As /u/dadnaya put it: ""450 gems for a bunch of skins + announcer packs + music theme + avatar + wards + enig chests"" It was such a popular topic of conversation, even /u/SmiteRobot got involved in the discussion. It was hands down, the Best Event of 2016.

##Best New Skin

There were so many great skins added to Smite in 2016, but nothing stood out quite like **[Gemini Agni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJC_cFcvtyA)**, which was so popular, it sparked a discussion in the nomination thread about whether or not it's pointless to ask people's opinions when you get the same response every time. The submission thread probably wasn't even necessary, based on the multitude of very popular posts about the skin, including [Gemini agni the best skin in the game atm.](https://redd.it/572ri4), [Why does Agni have some of the best skins in the game?](https://redd.it/584dqf), and [Gemini Agni sets an entirely new standard](https://redd.it/57eems). It wasn't exactly surprising to see /r/Smite vote Gemini Agni the Best New Skin of 2016.

***

**Now for the subreddit categories:**

##Best Discussion Post

**[What book do you like to read during Xing Tian's ult windup](https://redd.it/4l0xb4)** was a joke /u/PufTheRedditor made in regards to Xing Tian's ultimate being nerfed in the windup department. It was an immensely popular post, and got hundreds of very humourous responses, including a gilded response that earned an honorable mention in this competition. You voted, and you named it the Best Discussion Post of 2016.

##Best Suggestion Post

In August, /u/UpstreamPwnage suggested a **[DJ Khaled Announcer Pack](https://redd.it/4vo97d)**, detailing all the important phrases the DJ could record. It got thousands of upvotes, and responses from /u/HiRezAdanas, /u/PonPonWeiWei, and /u/ScottGandhii. Eventually, it led to Scott directly [tweeting @djkhaled](https://twitter.com/ScottGandhi/status/760274072672563200), but that's unfortunately the last we heard of it. Obviously, it was voted the Best Suggestion Post of 2016.

##Best Media Post

/u/Bowmance nominated **[this video](https://redd.it/47se79)** of his, titled ""Got drunk, clan member wouldn't answer my skype so I sent him this:"". You'll have to watch it yourself, but let's just say it includes a fantastic vocal performance fueled by alcohol, with Smite-related lyrics, so congratulations /u/Bowmance for the Best Media Post of 2016.

##Best Art Post

/u/RobDraws' **[Sylvanus El Bandito Skin Concept](https://redd.it/42rm1w)** was the winner of this category by a mile. His post is still the highest-voted post of all time on /r/Smite, and was just recently turned into a real skin. /u/RobDraws has been a very popular skin concept artist on this subreddit for a while now, and of course, we congratulate him for the top post of all time, the honour of having a concept made into a skin, and of course, the Best Art Post of 2016.

##Best Strategy Post

**[The Overarching Conquest Guide](https://redd.it/4gv1o1)**, submitted by /u/branmuffin17, was exactly what it sounds like. The /r/Smite post linked to an extremely detailed guide for Conquest that covered everything from the basics to advanced strategies, for all five roles, including builds, tier lists, and even VGS information. The article has seen numerous revisions, and was kept up to date for the entire year, so no wonder it was /r/Smite's Best of 2016.

***

###Honorable mentions

* Based on [the response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/5j0v6c/official_best_of_rsmite_2016_competition/dbcf350) that Erlang Shen got, I'd say he's by far the worst god added in 2016.
* /u/Schileru was an intern at Hi-Rez this year, and he brought the subreddit a lot of joy this year with three very popular posts, titled [Guys I'm learning so much working at Hirez!](https://redd.it/4q5vph), [Battleground Of The Gods](https://redd.it/4qxkhu) and [Awh Hercules](https://redd.it/4z0tbe), with a similar style and theme. The most recent post was a very close second-place nomination for Best Media Post of 2016.
* Unfortunately, /u/dadnaya's nomination for ""Best Strategy Post"" which simply read ""Envy strat"" was invalid, but still got more votes than some of the legitimate nominations. I think [we all know what he was referring to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO2ah9HYoZM).
* It was suggested that next year we add a ""Best Comment"" category. In the meantime, I think it's worthwhile to point out [this fantastic response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/4l0xb4/what_book_do_you_like_to_read_during_xing_tians/d3jeje9) to the Best Discussion Post of 2016."

5lezvy,2,2017-01-01,26M4A - Milking a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lezvy/26m4a_milking_a_starlet/,"Good morning, DPP! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

Elizabeth Gillies, Daniella Monet, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lawrence, Cara Delevigne, Jenette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Amy Lee, and Kate Upton. I'm also open to other suggestions.

Kinks: Lactation, mild breast growth, nudity and ENF, humiliation OR shame (feeling humiliated absent being made to), name calling OR romance and tenderness, blackmail OR cuddling, anything vanilla.

Limits: Non-human or extreme changes, blood, toilet, vomit, beast, incest, under 18, extreme violence, snuff."

Hello guys,
First of all, I'm a big noob. This is my first PC build. The PC build draft is very similar to ""The Crusher"" (/r/PCMasterrace).
I want to build a low-mid-range PC for 500-600 Euros. The PC should allow some low gimp works, business works (MS Office) and games like League of Legends or CS:GO (decent video quality, 50 FPS+).
I will purchase my parts in germany (considering mindfactory.de).

PC build:

CPU:
Intel Core i3 6100 2x 3.70GHz

Motherboard:
MSI H110M ECO Intel H110
(Is it possible to add a additional sound card on this Motherboard)

Memory:
8GB Avexir Core Series yellow LED DDR4-2400 DIMM CL16 Dual Kit (2x 4GB)
(Any performance disadvantages with 2x4GB instead of 1x8GB)

Storage:
120GB ADATA Premier SP550 2.5""
(I have an external hard drive with 1TB capacity. So I think 120GB is ok for the start.)

Video Card:
4GB XFX Radeon RX 460 Double Dissipation active PCIe 3.0 x16
(There is also a 2GB version. What would fit better?)

Case:
Corsair Carbide Series SPEC-01 (CC-9011050-WW)

Power:
550W Seasonic G Series Modular 80+ Gold

DVD:
LG Electronics GH24NSD1 DVD-Writer SATA intern

Would be nice if it is possible to upgrade a sound card for some audio studio works in the future, but it's not really necessary. What is your opinion? Any suggestions/improvements? Love you all. Thank you for your help. :)"

**128,162** subreddit explorers *exploring* for **5 years!**

Happy New Year's day, everyone. There are some big changes at how Subreddit of the Day works. So this felt like a really good time for us to feature ourselves as Subreddit of the Day so we can go over those changes with you. I know what you're thinking. We could've just made an announcement as a sticky post. And I probably will sticky this post for a while. But we don't want to take away any attention from the sub that we'll be featuring on any particular day by making a second post. That never goes well and it's really not fair for the featured sub. 

#New CSS

Everyone's been complaining about the CSS on this sub since we released this version. We now have brand new CSS that is a lot more easy on the eyes. It's still a work in progress, but we hope that you see it as an immediate improvement. I would like to invite you all to turn your CSS back on and see for yourself. You can give your feedback in the comments. Please let us know what you think. Also, special thanks to /u/hatefullyemployed for designing it and also to /u/kate_4_president for lending a hand. 

#Changes to how features are written 

Here's the old way that  Subreddit of the Day (hereinafter referred to as SROTD) works. Our writing staff find a sub that they like, interview that sub, write an article about it, and then post it. This is a very time consuming process. It often takes days or weeks. It's a lot of effort for very little payout. We know from our last survey that few people read wordy features. We had to be honest with ourselves too. It turned out that we don't even usually read them. What most people do is read the headline and then click the link, and then maybe they'll read the rest of the feature. 

Anyways, although SROTD has never missed a day, we've come very close to missing days in the past where there was no post ready and everyone's scrambling to find a sub, interview them, and get the post up. 

We've streamlined the feature process to do basically this: Summarize the sub, say what's good about it, and show what's good about it. Some still have mod interviews. We know you all like those. But some don't really need it. We've done away with character limits. Posts will be as long as they need to be in order to capture the essence of the featured sub. 

#Special Guest Writer Program

This is the change at SROTD that I am most proud of. It really is. It's another that we've been doing for months but have made no official announcement. 

It used to be that only mods and staff wrote the features. We allowed nominations, but those were often ignored if no one here was familiar enough with the topic of the sub, or if no one here even liked it. 

The special guest program lets the person who nominated the sub write the feature. Usually these are the mods of the sub, but sometimes they are also fans of the sub. So far two of my favorites to come from this program are the [TOTALLYNOTROBOTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3me941/september_25_2015_rtotallynotrobots_a_place_for/?ref=search_posts ) and [EnoughTrumpSpam](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4o7fxj/june_15th_2016_renoughtrumpspam_i_dont_think_we/?ref=search_posts) features. Both are fantastic, and are better brought to life by people who actually are members or mods of those communities. 

This program has been so successful that in December 16 of the 31 features that we did were special guest features. You may have noticed that the byline on of the posts said ""written by special guest writer."" This month's calendar is already filling up with guest features as well. 

Part of this was a response to mods complaining that they made nominations which were ignored. They weren't wrong. So we're giving everyone a chance to tell us about their own community (or their favorite community) in their own words. 

Same restrictions apply as always. The community must be about a month old, have at least a few hundred subscribers, and must have an active user base. That's it. There's also our sister sub, /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay, for the really small ones. So, check that out. 

#SROTD Archives 

Some of you may have noticed that we've been running archive features. Over the years several people have joined the intern program and left us with interviews and incomplete write ups of a number of subs. We're finishing, updating, and editing these to get them ready to go. It's unfair that some mods have been waiting for years for their features to get done. This is part of our effort to turn that around. 

#Mission Statement 

We've changed our mission statement. It used to be ""bringing the awesome."" The problem was that not all subs are awesome to everyone. Some are in particular disliked by a number of people. So it had to change. Our mission is now to explore unique reddit communities, to spotlight them, to discuss them. Reddit, to me, is the most awesome collection of communities on the planet with a great diversity of viewpoints. So ya, when we feature GunsAreCool or TheRedPill some people will find those to be awesome and might be upset that we're talking about them at all. But they are a part of reddit culture, and are fair game. 



#Nominating a Sub

Turn on the CSS for this sub. You'll see a big, beautiful ""nominate"" button. This will give you a ""form"" to fill out. The more complete it is the faster it will get posted. We have a new commitment to customer service. While you'll get an automated response, just reply to it and a real human will help you. If you're a mod of the sub the feature will get scheduled very quickly. If you're not a mod, then SROTD staff will need to obtain permission from the mod team before moving forward. 

#Write SROTD

Check the link in the sidebar to join the intern program. That's the path to becoming a permanent writer and eventually a mod here. You will be expected to meet some quotas. Or, you can use the aforementioned nominate button if there's only one sub you'd like to write about.

5lf3qg,39,2017-01-01,Creepy middle-aged married man won't leave me alone...,Gullefis,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/5lf3qg/creepy_middleaged_married_man_wont_leave_me_alone/,"Hello people of Reddit. First things first, Happy New Year!


This is my first post but I’ve been told by a few people that you’re all pretty awesome, so maybe you can give me some advice… 


I’m a 32-year-old woman. I’ve always worked hard and even climbed the ladder at a previous job of mine to become assistant manager despite never having completed my university degree. I never had the self-confidence to finish my degree (I am terrified of failure, so I have often just given up as I’ve always found quitting easier…) but not having a degree has always bothered me. I think deep down, I’ve always known I am capable and just need to believe in myself.


Anyway, a year and a half ago, my 7-year relationship came to an end and with my dad being terminally ill, I moved home to help my mother take care of him. My parents have always encouraged me to get an education and a year ago, after many months of research, I found an adult education course that would give me the equivalent of a two-year degree in just under one school year. I was amazingly lucky because not only is it a local course and I received a grant to pay for it but it’s really interesting and there are lots of jobs in that domain around where I live so I should find work after!


When I discovered this course, I had to wait a year and then pass 2 separate exams and an interview to even get picked (there were only 8 places). Needless to say, that when I started in November 2016, I very much deserved to be there.


With it being an adult education course, we are a very eclectic group of people from all different walks of life: 3 women in their early twenties, me in my early thirties and a woman and 3 men in their forties.


I’m a very bubbly character. I smile a lot and am genuinely interested in the people I meet. And I was no different to the people on my course. 


There is this man on our course called Stan. I obviously didn’t realize he was a creep at first and therefor treated him no differently to the others. I was smiley, polite and was interested in what he had to say. 


He claims to be 46. He looks a lot older. He is your stereotypical middle-aged man. He is bald on the top of his head, wears glasses, has a paunch belly, is shorter than me (I’m 5’9 or 1m75) and wears crisp-pin-striped shirts under woolly jumpers or turtle-neck woolly jumpers with corduroy trousers. I feel bad saying this, because physical attributes aren’t all that is important, but the man is not attractive. He has been married for ten years and together, they have 2 children. Physical attributes aside he is very serious and reserved. When he does speak is voice is quite softly spoken and hesitant. But there have been a few moments already where I’ve noticed that Stan has a short fuse and is quite intolerant of certain things. He’s not a funny guy and he’s not charismatic at all… 


I am single. And to be fair, I am very happy about it for now. I’ve had opportunities to date people since the end of my previous relationship but I feel I need this time to focus on me so I don’t want to be in a relationship right now. 


Anyway, here’s what happened: 3 weeks after the start of our course, I went home one Friday night looking forward to the weekend ahead of me. At around 8:30 pm I got an email from him. It read “Please do me a favour, from Monday please don’t ever speak to me again. I promise to avoid you as much as you avoid me”. I was extremely confused as we’d always been friendly to each other. I thought that he was angry with me or offended by me for some reason. I emailed him back to ask what I’d done and even called his mobile to try and talk to him. It went to voicemail and I left a message. I was really upset because I didn’t want anything to spoil the course and I certainly didn’t want any kind of conflict. And certainly not with Stan who, up until that point, I had thought was a nice man. The thing was, I KNEW I hadn’t said or done anything. Not even behind his back (I’m not like that). So, it was very strange to send me such an email. I mean even if I had offended him, we’re adults, surely it’s just easier to ignore someone you no longer like and it’s very juvenile to send a “I’m not your friend” type of email…


Anyway, I went to bed and slept in very late the next day. When I woke up I had two emails from him. The first one was a forwarded email with homework a colleague had sent to all of us but who had misspelled my email address so I didn’t get it. Stan had noticed the mistake and forwarded it to me. Again, if he were mad at me to the point of asking me to leave him alone, would he bother doing that? The second one was in reply to my email saying he didn’t mean to spoil my weekend. He didn’t want to tell me why but if I really wanted to know he would tell me but in private and not in an email. At this point I understood what he was playing at and couldn’t believe the immaturity and manipulative nature of his behaviour. I replied saying that nothing could justify him sending such an email to me and therefor I didn’t care what he had to say to me on Monday and that I too felt that we should stop talking to each other.


On Monday I ignored him completely. But he was deliberately trying to make conversation with me to try and extend an olive branch of some sort. He had gone out and bought a book for me (which I looked at and gave straight back), asked me how my dad was… I wasn’t keen on making a scene so I answered a strict minimum but I was very cold.


That night he sent me another email apologising for what he did and asking me if he could explain to me why he did what he did. I replied saying that I appreciated his apology but that there was no need to explain and that I’d rather just put it behind us. You see I had understood his reasons, but I was not interested in him at all and felt that if he just dropped it, it would be less awkward. I wouldn’t have to outright reject him, which is never easy to do…


The next day I was feeling very sick. He came up to me during the break and asked if we could talk. I again said that I really appreciated the apology but that I didn’t want to go over the details and that we should just not worry about it. I could see he was desperate to tell me but I just ignored it. I mean sheesh, we met 3 weeks ago, and he’s bloody married with two kids! What’s his deal?


Anyway, by lunchtime I was in a bad state and had to go to the doctor who sent me home for the rest of the week. For the entire time I had off, I felt physically nauseous from the moment I woke up until I went to sleep. It was a nightmare!


And when he found out I was sick, it was nonstop emails: “I’m really going to miss you” “I will take all the homework for you” “please tell me you’re ok, I need to know”… Needless to say that I didn’t want to reply to him: First of all I was too sick to be replying to all these emails and secondly, I simply didn’t want to encourage him. Sometimes I had to reply, like when he sent me things I’d missed in class. It would have been rude not to. But I still kept the messages short. Then the class went on this field trip to visit a company I had at one point thought about doing an internship for (we have to do a 2-month internship in March). He went up to the boss (I did not ask him to do this) and spoke to them about me for an internship. Apparently, they were interested. The problem is he also spoke to them about himself despite NEVER having been interested in that company before! This company isn’t too far from where he lives with his wife and he obviously had visions of spending two months alone with me and being able to stay late in the evenings because it wasn’t a long journey home… The man is delusional! There’s no way on earth I will do my internship with him so now I can’t go to that company anymore… :(


While I was off sick (5 and a half days) I was receiving roughly 2 emails from him a day. I only replied to a couple of them. So, eventually, on the Saturday (a mere 4 weeks after starting the course) and after me not replying to his last couple of emails, he sent me an email explaining his behaviour. How he has developed feelings for me and (wait for it) how he has fallen in love with me! He didn’t want me to think he was weird or unstable. And when he avoided eye contact, he wasn’t trying to be arrogant, he was just trying to protect himself from his feelings. There was no mention of his wife or children. They obviously weren’t a huge factor in his decision making. He felt he needed to tell me. I “deserved to understand the behaviour of the people around me”.


I was mad! It made me really angry! Not only is this man married with two kids and his blatant disregard for them is nothing short of shocking! But we had literally only known each other for 4 weeks! And it’s not like we had any kind of friendship. We didn’t hang out after class and we didn’t really talk during class either! And here’s this 46-year-old (supposedly) who is behaving like a love-sick 12-year-old! “Don’t ever talk to me again” and then “I love you”… My gosh!


And what does he expect from me? Does he really think I will date someone like him?


Well, I didn’t hold back in my reply. I told him I had no feelings for him whatsoever. I said that his behaviour was selfish and just made me feel awkward. I reminded him he was a married man who should be capable of managing his own feelings and I’m not responsible for accommodating them. I said I never wanted to speak about this again and that I wanted to keep contact to a minimum.


Since then (it’s been about 3 weeks), he keeps staring at me in a love-sick-puppy kind of way and it’s totally creeping me out! One day I arrived at school after lunch. I was about 20 minutes early for class as I pulled into the car park. There is a park next to our school and Stan often goes for a walk during lunch break. When I pulled in, he was about 100m away (roughly 320 feet), with his back facing me walking in the other direction. He obviously hears my car coming and turns his head to see who it is. Normal enough, I’d do the same. Except when he sees it’s me, he just stops and completely turns around to face me and just stares at me longingly with his head slightly tilted to one side. The shivers ran down my spine. I turned away for about ten seconds (tops) to park my car properly and when I look back he had completely disappeared. The man is a freak! 


We’ve had ten days off now for Christmas. He sent me a text on the 24th which I ignored. I realized afterwards that he sent it to me from a different mobile telephone number than the one he gave to the rest of the class. Obviously, he might just have bought himself a new phone. But I can’t help but think he’s bought himself a second phone so he can keep his texts secret from his wife… I’m back to school on Tuesday and I am totally dreading it. I am furious that he has made me feel so uncomfortable that I no longer enjoy going to school anymore after I waited so long to get in. I need this degree! He doesn’t. He’s said so many times and even the teachers were surprised he wanted to do this course because with his background, he’d get a job in no time…


I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with the head of school because I don’t want people to know about it and I’m worried that they wouldn’t even take my side. They might say I’m being harsh on him or I brought it on myself by being polite to him. Plus, he’s backed off with the emails so they might say that I’m just misinterpreting his stares or that it was just an innocent text message to wish me a Merry Christmas and I’m reading too much into it…


But I do wish I could tell at least one of my classmates. It feels so isolating being in that classroom when he stares at me and makes me feel so awkward and yet the rest of the class is completely oblivious to it. Like he's abusing me right before people's eyes and they have no clue. It feels lonely...


Maybe I just need to vent. The man is a total creep! A pig! He’s lucky he even got someone to marry him in the first place and yet he so brazenly disregards her and her feelings… The worst part is I think he believes that he is the victim in all this: His wife probably doesn’t understand him and now his feelings for another woman have been rebuked. It’s all about him. He doesn’t care about the betrayal to his wife. He doesn’t care that a messy divorce would be devastating for his two young daughters. And he doesn’t care that he creeps me out and makes me feel sick and uncomfortable. He’s all “Me. Me. Me”.


I literally feel physically sick when I think about him. I think also, that the fact that since I moved back home, I have been pestered by 3 married guys to go out with them that I just have no patience for it anymore. Before I wouldn’t have judged someone I didn’t know as there could be many reasons as to why someone cheats but actually, now I just think it’s pathetic and gross. Man up and leave your spouse if it’s that bad! You only live once so don’t waste it with someone you don’t want to be with. But if you decide to stay with someone then have some bloody respect!


There. Rant over.

Firstly, let me apologise for the garbled response I gave in my daughter’s last post, a year ago now. I simply wanted to let you all know it was over, but I’ll be honest, I posted that before I realised it was a single part of her ‘story’. I thought the writing I saw on her phone was just her calling a friend for help. Forgive me, I am not the most technological person. I have managed to find and read the previous posts on here. I’ve linked them at the top of the post, in case you want to understand more about what I’m going to tell you, but please remember this is her version of events. I’m sure it’s what she believes, but she doesn’t know the whole truth. 


I should have ignored my instincts and told her the real truth from the beginning, but I ignored advice, buried both our heads in the sand. I have spent the last year, since that awful night, running, hiding, crying, and every second I’ve mourned not only for my family, but for the daughter I lost.

I don’t doubt you all think I am a monster. I suppose I am. But you have to understand, things are not as black and white as they seem. I loved my daughter, she was my whole world, the reason I woke up every morning.  I protected her for as long as I could. Then my wife got ill. They called it cancer, but I know better. She took something from someone she shouldn’t have, invaded someone she should have left alone. Apologies, I am getting ahead of myself here. Let me start at the beginning.


I met my beautiful wife 35 years ago, both aged 20 and working as interns at a fairly successful accountancy company. I never thought she would look twice at me but somehow she feel for my charms and we loved each other almost immediately. Life was perfect for the first few years, I would go so far as to call it blissful. 


Until that night. Until the night I came home from a night out unexpectedly. A little worse for wear, preferring to go home to my beautiful, vibrant wife rather than continue to watch workmates attempt to kiss and fondle each other, the inevitable embarrassment to follow on Monday bothering them not a jot.


I unlocked the door uncharacteristically quietly, eager to prove I was in fact, not drunk, and definitely sober enough not to wake her from any possible slumber. The house was in darkness, so I crept up the stairs, and opened the bedroom door, smiling at the thought of her beautiful face. She wasn’t there. I checked the kitchen, the living room, no sign of her. I began to panic, and even in my slightly foggy state, I knew something wasn’t right. 


I entered the garden through our kitchen door and saw a flickering light in the window of a battered shed at the bottom of the garden. I opened my mouth to call out her name, but something stopped me. Muted me. I walked quietly towards the shed, the dusk-born dew covering my shoes. I approached the window, and there she was, crouched on the floor, her forehead pressed to another’s, a man’s forehead. Rage engulfed me so, that I failed to see the blood until I threw open the shed door, screaming her name. 


Her face wasn’t her face. I mean, it was her face, but it wasn’t. It was dark, so much darker. She was covered in blood, her face glistening in the light of a single candle. She stood slowly, never taking her eyes from me. I saw them change from dark black, her eyeball made entirely of pupil, to her soft blue eyes, back to the eyes I have loved for years. It was as if she shrank before my eyes, became so small, that my first instinct was to hold her, to breathe in her scent, let her head rest on my chest, but as I moved towards her I saw him, properly for the first time. 


A man lay at her feet, perfectly still, his eyes wide, his mouth wider still. He was dead, I knew that. And I knew my beautiful wife had somehow killed him. Silently, wordlessly, I spent the night cleaning the shed and driving a dead body to a deserted spot, and burying it in a shallow grave. It sounds like a bad film doesn’t it. It still, even now, doesn’t feel real to me, that first time. Like I was watching it unfold from somewhere high above. The more often it happens the more normal it becomes though, almost acceptable. 


That night we didn’t speak of it. I held her all night, watching her breathing slow as she fell into a deep sleep, resting on my chest in our marital bed. My mind ran wild as she sank further into the deepest slumber. How on earth could I help me wife get over this? Come to terms with the fact that she had murdered someone, no matter what the reason might be?  


As she woke the next morning, she began to speak.

5lgr32,1,2017-01-01,"Startup philosophy: just go for it, or wait until you have the right resources?",tangerto,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/5lgr32/startup_philosophy_just_go_for_it_or_wait_until/,"I've THOUGHT I've tried to launch a startup before-- only to realize I really had no idea what I was doing and didn't have the knowledge to legitimately get it started. 

And I've come to realize, many months later after making side projects that built up the skills I WOULD have needed, that I could've much more efficiently started that startup now, now with the added bonus of previous experience. 

So now I face a dilemma where, as an engineer, my skill level and awareness of what I still have to learn are around the same spot, and I can decently build out most prototypes I think of. But with grad school apps approaching and summer internships (I'm a junior in college), I feel like it might be better to voluntarily wait until I've had more experience and met more people who could help me before I decide to pursue something by myself full time. I heard a story once of some people who were trying to crack a code, and their current computer hardware would do it in 10 years. However if they waited 7 years for the hardware to improve in quality due to Moore's law, the computer would do it in 2 years and finish the whole process 1 year before the initial computer. I'm thinking the same may apply to starting a business.

So obviously there are going to be two camps: the just do it and fail hard camp, or the prepare well and go into it full force with a plan camp. But I'm thinking it's a moderate mix of the two. What are your thoughts?"

# Story time

## Back story

23 year old former graduate student. I've sort of been fat my entire life and didn't understand how large I really was. I'd never not been fat so I didn't have anything to compare myself to but I knew in the back of my head that I was overweight. 

I'm sure many on reddit have the same back story but I didn't learn how to eat healthy growing up. My parents just didn't know (still don't, but I'm working on that) how to. With the exception of a brother I have in the Army, every adult in my family is overweight. I grew up eating the *standard American diet* which consisted of lots of macaroni and cheese, frozen pizzas, and fast food. Processed junk basically. I rarely ate vegetables and almost never at actual fruit. Neither of my parents can cook. 

One thing that makes my story a bit different is that I was born with a club foot so one of my feet is 4 sizes smaller than the other (its also quite wide, 6E). I couldn't find tennis shoes to really fit my feet which made it difficult to run. For these reasons I never played sports as a kid (only hiking and backpacking which you can do at any weight if you walk slowly enough) and didn't have any active hobbies. 

When I got to college I continued with the bad habits I developed as a kid: I ate out for almost every meal either at the dining hall or a fast food place on campus. My cooking consisted of different varieties of macaroni and cheese or frozen pizza. I would rationalize the food choices I was making because I was ""too stressed and busy"" to learn to cook something healthy. I then tried to make myself as busy as possible to justify the fact that I was eating poorly, it was a bad cycle. 

By the time I finished a masters degree in 2015 I was 5'11"", almost 300 pounds, and depressed. I hated the way I looked in pictures. I didn't want to go out in public because I believed that every time someone looked at me they were judging my weight. 

## First attempt: Summer 2015

After I graduated I had an internship in a different city. I was unhappy and fed up and for the first time had a bit of disposable income and free time so I bought a fitbit. I didn't know anyone in the city I was living in and the ""fitness center"" in the hotel my employer put me up in for the summer consisted of a few treadmills and an elliptical. 

I forced myself to get up early and use the elliptical. To break up the monotony of doing the same movement every day for my morning workout I started with the couch to 5 k (C25K) program by running on one of the treadmills. I still didn't have proper running shoes (and was about 275 pounds) so by the time I got to week 6 or so my knees hurt so much after each workout that I had to take several days off to recover after each run, which wasn't sustainable. By increasing my activity I was able to lose about 15 pounds over the 3 month summer internship. At this point I hadn't changed my eating habits but did change how I rationalized the poor choices: instead of eating the food because I was stressed I rewarded myself for working out and being active. Different justification but same result: I kept eating shit food. 

## Falling off the wagon

I started at a new school for a PhD program in the fall of 2015 and became busy and stressed again. I went back into my old eating habits and began to rationalize my poor food choices. I argued to myself that I didn't have time to workout again, I had too much work on my plate. I started a job that semester helping researchers with their statistical methods and I simultaneously took and taught courses so I justified ordering pizza every Friday night because I was tired and *deserved it*. 

During this time I knew something bad was happening and couldn't bring myself to step on the scale at all. I gained back the 15 pounds I worked so hard to lose over the summer. 

## Second attempt: counting calories

I visited some friends in New York during the winter holiday and of course that meant taking a lot of pictures. There was a moment where I was looking through those pictures being sad about how much I weighed that I had somewhat of an epiphany and had the thought that ""there are loads of people out there who lose weight, if they can do it, why can't I?"" So I started doing some research into weight loss methods. One of the methods that seemed to have some research backing it up was calories in/calories out. The method made a lot of sense to me: ""If you burn more calories than you eat you'll lose weight"". That science is so simple that even I understood it. 

So I started tracking all my food in the Fitbit app (I was still wearing one daily). I slowly brought my eating down to 500 calories below the TDEE that Fitbit estimated for each day. I started doing a variant of Stronglifts on M/W/F with a friend and doing cardio on the elliptical on T/R. Some weeks I was even motivated enough to do cardio on the weekends. I went on a few Saturday morning hikes (the only time we could squeeze it in, I'd be back at work on Saturday afternoons). I even started teaching myself to cook from YouTube videos and cookbooks. Through this I lost about 30 pounds in 3 months. 

Over summer 2016 I worked another internship. I didn't have easy access to a weightlifting gym or my motivating lifting partner like I did at school. Being in a hotel again I didn't really have a kitchen to cook with. So I sort of just maintained for the summer. I jogged a bit but didn't lift at all and I stopped recording everything I ate. Strictly speaking I stopped recording during finals but I didn't pick it up at all over the summer.  I also didn't bring my scale so that's the second break in my weight log (see pictures). 

## Third attempt: eating healthy

I didn't want to obsess about recording everything I ate for the rest of my life. For me that wasn't a sustainable lifestyle. I worried that I would eventually stop recording and gain again. So instead I did research and tried to teach myself what healthy eating looked like  so that I could learn what a healthy diet looked like without needing to rely on recording myself every day. I read books and research papers, watched documentaries and talks, and cooked a lot. Some I will recommend and think **everyone** should read are The China Study by Campbell and How Not To Die by Gregor. 

I've spent the last few months eliminating processed foods, cooking/preparing for myself, and eating fruits and vegetables as much as possible. I started dating my girlfriend about 8 months ago and she's been such a huge motivation on this journey. She grew up eating home cooked food almost exclusively and has been teaching me to cook. If you had to put a label on our diet we aim for ""Whole food plant based"". We aren't vegetarian at all (she occasionally eats red meat/chicken and I occasionally eat fish) but we try to eat mostly plants as much as possible. 

I aim for lifting 2-3x/week and jogging 1-2x in addition but I don't always hit those goals. Sometimes we substitute rock climbing instead. My current numbers are (starting in February -&gt; yesterday): squat: 95 -&gt; 225 5x5; deadlift: 135 -&gt; 225 5x1; bench 95 -&gt; 155 5x5 (I know I know...). 

To summarize this period I've lost 40 pounds and my rate of loss (see graph) shows no signs of slowing down. 

I'm not sure if this is the optimal diet for me and I certainly plan to be more active this year as I start a full time job (I dropped out of grad school, it wasn't working out for my mental/physical health at all). I just wanted to share my story and let out that there is an alternative to obsessively counting calories: eating as much whole food and plants as you want. I know that reducing the consumption of meat and processed foods (pretty much everything not in the produce section of the grocery store) isn't for everyone, but it's working out great for me and I wanted to throw it out as another option perhaps not seen frequently on this sub. 

I'm certainly not where I want to be with my weight. My goal weight when I started was 250, then 200, and right now is 188 (to make it 100 pounds lost) which is about another 30 pounds. I don't think that will be my final goal weight, but I can't remember a time when I was that low so I'm not sure how I'll look. I'll adjust when I get down there so expect another post from me in about a year. I want to continue to increase my lifts as well. 

# Example meal plan 

Breakfast: oatmeal with fruit OR homemade granola with yogurt and fruit OR eggs and toast and fruit

Lunch: vegetable and rice bowl OR vegetable curry with rice

Dinner: out for sushi with the girlfriend (the raw fish kind, not the deep fried kind) OR noodle soup like pho or ramen OR stir fry with rice

Snacks: fruit and occasionally nuts/trail mix. 


# Workout schedule
Stronglifts 5x5 on 2 day spit, aiming for 2-3x/week:

A day: 

|Workout   |Sets   |Reps   |
|---|---|---|
|Squat   |5 |5   |
|Overhead press   |5   |5   |
|Deadlift   |1   |5   |


B day: 

|Workout   |Sets   |Reps   |
|---|---|---|
|Squat   |5   |5   |
|Bench   |5   |5   |
|Rows   |5  |5   |

Jogging for about half an hour, aim for 1-2x/week (seriously though go to a running store and get legitimate shoes for your feet).

5lgwjf,91,2017-01-01,I want to drop my CS major for something else.,Fossana,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lgwjf/i_want_to_drop_my_cs_major_for_something_else/,"I'm a sophomore in college, but I took college courses in high school. I currently have a 4.0 GPA at a midtier school, and I'm pursuing a degree in computer science with a focus on software engineering and a degree in mathematics, for now at least. During the past year I developed an educational iOS game for a professor, and he is trying to take that to market and use it for research.

I don't like compsci at all. I originally got into it because I knew I would be good at it, and I always wanted to be a game developer. By game development I really mean having a large say in the design, but that's unrealistic, and I don't even like playing games anymore. I used to be addicted to games but now I only play then if there's a social element or a monetary incentive.

Anyways, I took a class last semester that was a better reflection of what a CS job might actually look like, and it was awful. Every time I look at potential CS career paths or look for an internship I get filled with incredible dread. I want to do something meaningful and adventurous, and I don't want to stare at a screen for 8 hours and then stare at it when I'm done with work just because a lot of the things I like to do involve a computer. I want to do something more social.

I'm thinking about doing biology. Medical research would be my dream. Frankly, any science seems more interesting to me than CS, but the job market for biology looks scary.

I don't know what to do. Math is my strongest talent by far by the way."

I simply believe that I cannot do it. I have considered dropping out but I really love all the subjects and want to be a doctor and the few friends I have say that I'll make a good doctor. I'm hoping you can tell me about your battle with depression and how you overcame it or about somebody you know that did poorly in medical school and went onto become good doctors. 

I'm looking to make some friends as well. Self proclaimed geek who has built his own PC, loved to read (have difficulty now), enjoy good movies and TV shows (just finised The Man in the High Castle; Breaking Bad is all time favourite). Come say hi!

#/r/SubredditOfTheDay

**128,162** subreddit explorers *exploring* for **5 years!**

Happy New Year's day, everyone. There are some big changes at how Subreddit of the Day works. So this felt like a really good time for us to feature ourselves as Subreddit of the Day so we can go over those changes with you. I know what you're thinking. We could've just made an announcement as a sticky post. And I probably will sticky this post for a while. But we don't want to take away any attention from the sub that we'll be featuring on any particular day by making a second post. That never goes well and it's really not fair for the featured sub. 

#New CSS

Everyone's been complaining about the CSS on this sub since we released this version. We now have brand new CSS that is a lot more easy on the eyes. It's still a work in progress, but we hope that you see it as an immediate improvement. I would like to invite you all to turn your CSS back on and see for yourself. You can give your feedback in the comments. Please let us know what you think. Also, special thanks to /u/hatefullyemployed for designing it and also to /u/kate_4_president for lending a hand. 

#Changes to how features are written 

Here's the old way that  Subreddit of the Day (hereinafter referred to as SROTD) works. Our writing staff find a sub that they like, interview that sub, write an article about it, and then post it. This is a very time consuming process. It often takes days or weeks. It's a lot of effort for very little payout. We know from our last survey that few people read wordy features. We had to be honest with ourselves too. It turned out that we don't even usually read them. What most people do is read the headline and then click the link, and then maybe they'll read the rest of the feature. 

Anyways, although SROTD has never missed a day, we've come very close to missing days in the past where there was no post ready and everyone's scrambling to find a sub, interview them, and get the post up. 

We've streamlined the feature process to do basically this: Summarize the sub, say what's good about it, and show what's good about it. Some still have mod interviews. We know you all like those. But some don't really need it. We've done away with character limits. Posts will be as long as they need to be in order to capture the essence of the featured sub. 

#Special Guest Writer Program

This is the change at SROTD that I am most proud of. It really is. It's another that we've been doing for months but have made no official announcement. 

It used to be that only mods and staff wrote the features. We allowed nominations, but those were often ignored if no one here was familiar enough with the topic of the sub, or if no one here even liked it. 

The special guest program lets the person who nominated the sub write the feature. Usually these are the mods of the sub, but sometimes they are also fans of the sub. So far two of my favorites to come from this program are the [TOTALLYNOTROBOTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3me941/september_25_2015_rtotallynotrobots_a_place_for/?ref=search_posts ) and [EnoughTrumpSpam](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4o7fxj/june_15th_2016_renoughtrumpspam_i_dont_think_we/?ref=search_posts) features. Both are fantastic, and are better brought to life by people who actually are members or mods of those communities. 

This program has been so successful that in December 16 of the 31 features that we did were special guest features. You may have noticed that the byline on of the posts said ""written by special guest writer."" This month's calendar is already filling up with guest features as well. 

Part of this was a response to mods complaining that they made nominations which were ignored. They weren't wrong. So we're giving everyone a chance to tell us about their own community (or their favorite community) in their own words. 

Same restrictions apply as always. The community must be about a month old, have at least a few hundred subscribers, and must have an active user base. That's it. There's also our sister sub, /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay, for the really small ones. So, check that out. 

#SROTD Archives 

Some of you may have noticed that we've been running archive features. Over the years several people have joined the intern program and left us with interviews and incomplete write ups of a number of subs. We're finishing, updating, and editing these to get them ready to go. It's unfair that some mods have been waiting for years for their features to get done. This is part of our effort to turn that around. 

#Mission Statement 

We've changed our mission statement. It used to be ""bringing the awesome."" The problem was that not all subs are awesome to everyone. Some are in particular disliked by a number of people. So it had to change. Our mission is now to explore unique reddit communities, to spotlight them, to discuss them. Reddit, to me, is the most awesome collection of communities on the planet with a great diversity of viewpoints. So ya, when we feature GunsAreCool or TheRedPill some people will find those to be awesome and might be upset that we're talking about them at all. But they are a part of reddit culture, and are fair game. 



#Nominating a Sub

Turn on the CSS for this sub. You'll see a big, beautiful ""nominate"" button. This will give you a ""form"" to fill out. The more complete it is the faster it will get posted. We have a new commitment to customer service. While you'll get an automated response, just reply to it and a real human will help you. If you're a mod of the sub the feature will get scheduled very quickly. If you're not a mod, then SROTD staff will need to obtain permission from the mod team before moving forward. 

#Write SROTD

Check the link in the sidebar to join the intern program. That's the path to becoming a permanent writer and eventually a mod here. You will be expected to meet some quotas. Or, you can use the aforementioned nominate button if there's only one sub you'd like to write about.

He is the guy who came out of nowhere to run as an anti-Trump candidate during the election.

I got a note from a friend who follows this stuff like me,  and here is what he had to say:

The Hill has up a new story up about this irrelevant, obnoxious, Mormon moron, ""Former independent presidential candidate Evan Mcmullen, slamming President Elect Trump.

The first comment to the story says this:

SmartProf • 2 hours ago
The Hill has run 6 McMullin articles this past month.

Decided to check if that was true.

Dec 10: (The Hill) McMullin: 'Trump is not a loyal American'
Dec 14: (The Hill) McMullin: GOP knew about, ignored Russian meddling in election
Dec 17: (The Hill) McMullin returns fire on Trump for 'McMuffin' diss
Dec 22: (The Hill) McMullin mocks Gingrich for backtracking on 'drain the swamp' remark
Dec 27: (The Hill) McMullin: The GOP has a problem with racism
Dec 30: (The Hill) McMullin: Trump 'siding with America's greatest adversary'

And from last month:

Nov 1: (The Hill) A totally plausible path for Evan McMullin to become president
Nov 14: (The Hill) McMullin slams Bannon appointment

As I understand it, The Hill is an American political journalism newspaper and website published in Washington, D.C. since 1994.[3][4][5] It is published by Capitol Hill Publishing, which is owned by News Communications, Inc. Focusing on politics, policy, business and international relations, The Hill coverage includes the U.S. Congress, the presidency, and election campaigns.[6]

So why is the Hill giving so much coverage to an irrelevant nobody who has never served in the House or in the Senate, nor in any elective office, and who got less votes for President than Bernie Sanders? Heck, you're giving him 10 times more coverage than you gave him when he was a candidate. The Election is over. Evan McMullin got his butt kicked on November 8th even worse than Kasich or Jill Stein, but for some reason The Hill finds it necessary to publish whatever this asshole says 6 times in the month of December, and now on day one of 2017 they gave the moron another Front Page story and Headline to rip the President Elect:

Jan 1: (The Hill) McMullin blasts 'Authoritarian' Trump

Who is Evan McMullin's gay lover at The Hill is what I wanna' know.

Seriously The Hill, and Ab Stoddard specifically, why do you guys give this embittered irrelevant asshole so much ink? Are readers out here dying to hear what this colossal irrelevant loser has too say? C'mon. If you want to criticize Trump, then cut out the farce and just start criticizing Trump yourself, instead of providing soapboxes for irrelevant shitheads you can hide behind who'll do your criticizing for you.

Cowards.
----------------------------------------

Now,  I had noticed this,  as well as this guy's continuing anti-Trump posts on Twitter.  So I went to Wikipedia and looked at his biography.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_McMullin

Note that he had a LONG history with the CIA, including 4 years as an intern while at Brigham Young.  Note also that he was very skilled in getting extremist Muslims to work with the US. (This is not a plus in my opinion.)

Note also that he worked for the UN in refugee resettlement.

Then magically he is a senior advisor on the House Foreign Relations Committee.

Now,  here is what I think needs to be answered:

Who hired this guy to work for the House Foreign Relations Committee?

Who is now funding him?   As far as I can tell, he is unemployed.

If McMullin hadn't run for president,  would we know about his CIA and UN connections?  Nope.

How many other CIA or UN loyalists are working within our government?

Where do McMullin's loyalties lie: to the Constitution or the CIA?

Why is he trying to undermine Trump?

What is the game plan here?

I would welcome any centipede's help in figuring this out.  I don't know what's going on,  but it sure looks shady to me.

ALSO:  What is The Hill's connection to the CIA and why are they pushing this guy's narrative?

She was gushing about all the great experiences she had doing the art internship and meeting interesting people.

Ted and Robin, then, had a bet over whether Lily was being sincere or just faking it.  As it turned out, she was *faking* it and actually had a bad time there, all around:

* She did badly at her art internship
* She actually just met one weird-in-a-bad-way guy
* The whole ""pining for Marshall"" thing

I'm sure some people were glad to see that outcome, so as to see Lily be ""punished"" for leaving Marshall.  Then again, there are probably those who wanted her ""I'm so fulfilled from having new experiences and finding myself"" act to be *real*.

Where do you fall, in terms of your opinions about the writing for that part of the story?

5liaqk,5,2017-01-01,My family line is in danger of dying out... advice?,letrainfalldown,Sororities,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/5liaqk/my_family_line_is_in_danger_of_dying_out_advice/,"So I'm an alum of a chapter of a social STEM/engineering sorority that was only installed about a year and a half ago. My family is the only line that does not originate from a founding mother/member (there are only 4 in alpha class), and my little is thinking of dropping. I, and my little, have noticed that our line is where they tend to put the ""strange"" ones, or the ones who don't quite fit in with the rest, with one little at a time (there are no twins in our line). 

My little has repeatedly voiced concerns to me that she doesn't feel like the other members value her or treat her like a sister. I totally understand where she's coming from as my experience was not too different from that, but I also know that you get out of a sorority what you put in and that these kinds of things are fairly common. I'm really close with my little and she's also close with a few others, so she definitely has felt like it's been of some value to her (she also got an internship out of it too!).

My little also has a little. If my little drops, my grandlittle won't have a big anymore, and she too will likely drop (especially since my little says she too is part of the ""strange"" line of girls), effectively ending our line. 

My main concern is that my family line will die out and then all that will remain are the founding mothers and their lines, which in my opinion, already have most of the say in how the sorority is run. I feel as if our family brings quirkiness and diversity to the sorority and I feel like it wouldn't feel the same without our side. I joined this sorority partially because I wanted to have a say to creating an organization that would last generations to come, and I guess we ended up being the quirky ones. That's cool with me, but I'd be pretty upset if our family's legacy died. At the same time, I do want my little to be happy.

What do the rest of you think about families dying out? Has it happened to anyone else? Am I putting too much importance on the family line and I should let the chips fall where they may and let everything happen on its own?"
5lide2,2,2017-01-01,First-year sophomore...when should I start looking for an internship?,LoveYouDarling,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5lide2/firstyear_sophomorewhen_should_i_start_looking/,"Hi, guys. Here's some background: I took a lot of AP and dual credit courses in high school and got a lot of elective/prereq credit. I knew I had a lot of credit piling up, but didn't think about the effects it would have on my college career until I looked at my degree audit today and saw I was listed as a sophomore. It gave me a rude awakening-college is moving faster than I thought it was, and sooner rather than later I'll start having to worry about getting a job.

I just completed my first semester of actual college (all prereqs). I did pretty well-I made the Dean's List-but I haven't taken any major courses yet. I will this upcoming semester, but it'll be an introductory course. 

So my question is, when should I look for an internship? I've always been told to start looking junior year, but since it's sooner than expected I don't know if I'll have the requisite knowledge for the job. Should I wait or just take the leap?

If it helps, I'm majoring in CIS and plan to get an IT job."
5lii2i,1,2017-01-01,26M4A - Milking a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lii2i/26m4a_milking_a_starlet/,"Good evening, DPP! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut.

5lj1jw,0,2017-01-01,Why I love Blizzard and the Firelord - Personal,Hogger18,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5lj1jw/why_i_love_blizzard_and_the_firelord_personal/,"Hey all, wanted to make a post about my relationship with Blizzard (yes, I plan to talk a little about me) and my experience with Ragnaros and how he has re-ignited (HA) my childlike wonder to video games.  

So a little bit about me. I consider myself a huge Blizzard fanboy. I got into playing World of Warcraft with my neighbor who became my best friend through our shared love of the universe Blizzard created. Ever since then, I grew to love Blizzard and everything they created. To back up a little, my childhood was not one that was filled with video games or television (Im mid-20s). My parents believed in the philosophy where kids were meant to play outside, not indoors with video games. But after getting to watch my friend and his dad play WoW together, I knew it was just something I had to be a part of. So I got my first job cutting lawns for neighbors so I could front the *hefty* $15 a month fee to play. And the rest is history. 

I have days on months of played time for each of my characters in that game, so much time spent in front of a computer, I decided I wanted to make a career out of it. In college I am majoring in Computer Information System (will be graduating this semester!) and have loved every minute of it. Freshman year I remember waiting anxiously to receive a beta invite to play one of Blizzard's new games, Hearthstone. I spent all waking hours I wasn't studying or practicing (I swam for the college team, done bragging now :D ) watching streamers play the game (Kripp, Trump, you know who you are). A similar story with Heroes, though this time I got in the beta! 

But as any of you guys/gals know, things don't always stay the same. I started taking internships during summer/winter breaks and trying to balance working/social life/working out during this period of my life meant I had to cut out some things I loved. Primarily, video games. I spent less time with guildmates and more time with other obligations. My interest in games just seemed to dwindle. I remember thinking, ""You didn't even *buy* the latest expansion! The last time you HC raided was 4.2 (IMPORTANT: 4.2 was RAGE of the Firelands starring the most badass Hardmode boss fight I've ever encountered)."" 

So lately I've just been a *filthy casual*. Playing some here and there, bouncing from Hearthstone to Heroes to Overwatch and back again. But to the crux of my post, Ragnaros.

When I saw Ragnaros was coming to the Nexus, I went ahead and pulled out the old Visa and said goodbye to $15. I had to have him. And let me tell you, best $15 I've spent in a LOOOONG time. I'm directing this to the design team for Heroes, I have had the greatest time playing this character, thank you. Playing Rag and hearing his voice lines takes me back to those nights I was up at 3am just to try and down Heroic mode before any other guild on our server (we were 4th :p ). His kit feels amazing to play with and he feels like the Firelord. Molten Core is my absolute FAVORITE ability in the game. Taking over a structure and becoming a huge raid boss brings back the feelings I had back in my raiding days. I've spent more time playing Ragnaros than I have playing video games in the past few months and it feels so special that it is because of him. 

So to sum it up, thank you Blizzard for everything. You guys have more of an effect on people than you realize (hey, maybe you do realize, I dunno) and you've shaped my life in a way I would never imagine any other gaming company doing. I hope to see more of the powerful forces I knew from Azeroth enter the Nexus. "

5ljgs8,0,2017-01-01,"I've (24M) been hooking up with a woman from work (38F), but she's getting married to my boss (45M). Worried about losing my job if he finds out.",happynewyearfml,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ljgs8/ive_24m_been_hooking_up_with_a_woman_from_work/,"I started working at this company right out of college as an intern and since I fit really well with the place and liked the work, I stuck around and am trying to work my way up. I know I'm young and have many career possibilities but I really don't want to ruin this one because I'm grateful it's worked out as well as it has. I'm making a good salary and actually like my job.

A few weeks ago I joined a team for a project that included this woman ""Erica"". My boss ""Dan"" had introduced us before and I'd seen her around since then but had never had any contact with her. We ended up working really well together and getting along, flirting in a subtle way sometimes. I found her very refined and attractive and eventually our relationship evolved beyond just that of friendly colleagues. We've had sex about a dozen times, including a few after the project ended, and sext/snapchat when we can (she doesn't want my boss to accidently see anything). 

(For history, Erica and Dan apparently actually met here themselves around the time I started working here but I wasn't working under Dan then and didn't really know either of them. They got engaged in September but didn't make a big deal about it at work. Then a couple months later I joined the team and Erica and I started a sexual relationship. And I'm certain that for both of us it's only sex, no feelings involved, and FWIW Erica has hinted I'm not the first guy she's done this with. They're due to get married in May or June I think.)

So now the problem is that, yesterday we met at the office to briefly hook up (I know, I know... but obviously her place isn't an option and I still have family staying at mine). We assumed no one would be there because of the holiday. But a couple times during sex we thought we heard noises like someone moving around in a nearby room, and when we left I noticed there was a big pile of paperwork missing from one guy's desk. I noticed because it's been a joke for a couple weeks, ""when is ""Fred"" gonna get all that done?"", and maybe he did before the weekend or took it home before and I just didn't notice then....

But now the more I try to remember if I saw it there Friday night or not, the more paranoid I am that he stopped by the office last night and what if he heard us? Which even if he did I know he couldn't have seen us but if it gets around that someone was having sex in the office on New Years eve and Dan hears, and then remembers Erica went out that night... well yeah I'm just worried.

So I'm just wondering if there's any kind of pre-emptive damage control I can or should do just in case he finds out? He doesn't SEEM like the kind of guy who fires people at the drop of a hat, he's only been my boss since the summer but he seems like a pretty good guy. But both Dan and Erica are pretty high up in the ranks in the company and you never know what people will do when they're upset. 

Also I've already texted Erica that it made me nervous how he could have gotten caught last night and that I want to scale things back, and I think she'll understand, so I'm not gonna be stupid and make the same mistake twice. I'm just afraid I could have put my career in jeopardy. And even my friendships too. There's a few people there I've become decent friends with who I'll get drinks with after work sometimes, including that guy Fred, who I originally bonded with just as the only other black guy at the company. If I lose my job I'd probably lose these people too, and I don't have too much of a social life elsewhere.

So yeah just looking for any advice about how to navigate this from now on, or if you think I'm just overreacting then I'd want to know that too.

TL;DR been hooking up with the woman who's due to marry my boss in a few months. Someone might have heard us having sex and I'm afraid if it got back to my boss and he ended up putting it together, I could get fired. How should I proceed?"

I have a few questions right now:

1.) Should I have an objective or summary statement?

2.) Should I rearrange some of the sections' order in my resume?

3.) Should I elaborate more on some of my bullets like under work experience or skills, or shorten others? I don't have a whole lot of experience yet, really, which I guess is one thing that's worrying me.

I guess I'm still trying to figure out the organizational side of this and seeing what might look attractive to engineering companies. I'll also answer questions to clarify things. I'd appreciate any suggestions. Thank you."

So naturally I started looking into the certificates but with no direction of where I wanted to go I didn't hold interest to invest enough time to get any certificates. The lucky contribution to my situation is probably the fact that I work at a big hobby store near DC. This means I'm exposed to all the technology people in the DC area that come by to get there Tech toys or to get help repairing and troubleshooting them. I worked on remote controlled helicopters for a bit and when all the Drone stuff took off a year ago I was naturally interested in it for the fun aspect. You had to build them from scratch at first there wasn't too much ready to go out of the box stuff yet. So I learned just enough to be able to build one that I like and used the knowledge I gained to help people build theirs and naturally I ran into all the problems that they ran into and had to learn just enough again to fix those new problems as well. Being the only ""drone"" guy in that shop I get to take first crack at all the random problems that can walk through the door. So about 80% of the time I'm having to troubleshoot/learn and apply a solution to a majority of the problems that walk through the door. This I realize later actually allowed people to see my on-the-fly problem-solving multitasking skills for something that there isn't much documentation out on at the time. I personally got interested in coding as it's pretty much the backbone for development and creating things which is what I realized I enjoyed doing development and creating Solutions. So I learned on my own the basics of coding and some more fundamentals of understanding so I could be at least a little useful with my knowledge. Opening my mouth to random customers about looking for job experience after they already saw my skill set allowed me to get internship opportunities. Now my lack of experience  and certificates with actual systems did hold me back on one job interview as they were looking for someone with more experience but that didn't hold me back from all the other places that wanted to take me in with the mindset that they just ""needed to teach me the basics and I'd be dangerous"". Another interview with a higher end company in DC even offered me an internship a day after the interview but I turned it down as I was too afraid a position in a private  Contracting Company  for the military and other government agencies would be too much for me as a first IT job. Now I'm taking a job at an app development company/ software development company and I like the company dynamic much more. I didn't want to Ramble On too much so if there's any questions or someone has any advice let me know. :-)"

5lkgz1,13,2017-01-02,Books / Problems for Statistics Undergrad Wanting to Enter Tech (x-post from r/statistics),EstTruth,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5lkgz1/books_problems_for_statistics_undergrad_wanting/,"Hey everyone, I am about to get my B.S in Applied Mathematics and Minor in Statistics in 5 months from one of the top schools in the University of California system and I am at a loss as to what sort of preparation I should be doing for any data science jobs that would qualify for after graduating. I have experience in R, Stata, some minor experience in C++ and a basic ability to write in SQL and Python. I also completed a 10 week internship with a utility company that taught me some, albeit basic, methods for implementing machine learning to produce predictions models for large datasets.

My questions are more specifically phrased as follows:

1. How should I improve on my Python skills with respect to statistics applications? Nearly all of the resources I find online about improving one's Python skills with respect to the tech industry focus more on the coding aspect than on statistical analyses. For example, most of my CS friends tout the Cracking the Coding Interview book as one that I should know cold yet it does not focus at all on statistical applications. Should I be utilizing these resources?

2. What kind of tech jobs with a statistics background do not require an MS or PhD? I am not sure that I would want to pursue either in the future as my theoretical math skills and understanding are rather shaky. Yet nearly all of the jobs I find on my university career site are oriented to individuals with MS or PhDs in Stats or CS.

3. What kinds of career fairs should I be attending? The general one by my university has companies that are generally not looking for very technical roles for their hires yet the CS career fairs naturally are looking for very technical CS students.

Overall, should I be doing the same things as my CS friends to make myself more attractive to tech companies (ie interview prepping coding problems, hackathons, attending technical career fairs oriented to CS majors, etc.) or should I be focusing on something else entirely?

Generally, I have an interest in predictive modeling but I am unsure of what I generally should be doing and internet, and university resources, give many conflicting answers on the topic.

Thanks for all your guys help!

TLDR: Almost a recent stats-oriented grad unsure of what steps I should take in the next 4-5 months to prep myself to enter the tech (data science) field."

5llbwq,1,2017-01-02,26M4A - The Milking of a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5llbwq/26m4a_the_milking_of_a_starlet/,"Hey everyone! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

I have been working at my dad's software company as an intern for the past three summers as I go through college.  It has been a really great experience (small company, nice people, interesting work), but it's not really the kind of work I want to do in the long term.  

Recently, since I graduate in a ~~year~~ year and a half, my dad has been talking to me about a position where I would answer directly to the CTO and do work (setup servers, write some java, act as IT support) for him.  To me, this sounds like it is more in the IT field than in actual software development, and I would rather work as a SDE when I get out of college.

Anyways, is it weird or bad to turn down that offer?  It would make me feel a little bad to turn it down after they have helped me so much.

Thanks!"
5llif6,3,2017-01-02,Demon Rehabilitation - Part 35,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/5llif6/demon_rehabilitation_part_35/,"The two wall lights were set low, and in different circumstances, the room would have felt warm. I had no idea what to make of it now. I knew that God waited on the other end of this wall but my mind could not quite comprehend his presence. I felt an angel, a demon and something else. Color, sound and taste attached to tremendous weight that took absolutely no space. Nothing specific, not red or blue or the string of a guitar, just the subtle pulse of them. This felt utterly wrong but thinking about it for too long caused an odd dull warmth in my head.

At the very least, I expected this all to come to an end in some crack house, thirty years from now, with the cackling laughter of Lucifer following both me and Pepper back to hell. Certainly not before Pepper could talk or with God visiting me in fake Lily’s living room.

I thought the bet was a whim . . . It felt awfully planned now. Just not by me.

I hovered outside the door, waiting for one of them to start speaking so I would not have to make an entrance into a quiet room. Feeling like one of those cymbal-holding monkeys, lifelessly bashing away at the push of a button.

Flash lights and phone lights glinted through the windows. I heard the murmur of the crowd that had gathered outside. People were drawn toward the occupants. None of them could know what it was exactly that had made them get out of bed and gather here but the feeling would be so profound that they wouldn’t even begin to question it in the first place.

Lily’s parents were downstairs when I last heard them but they were gone now. They must have felt it too but the proximity of the event scared them.

After another minute of silence from the lot of them, I entered just to get it over with. Deborah, Lucifer and God turned. She had a sorry smile on her face. An apology, I thought, but not an obvious one. Not to the other two. Perhaps she was trying to ease my nerves with it. Not that it worked.

I avoided looking at Him. I don’t even know why. He did not seem very different from the other two. Except, they looked good enough to attend a meeting at some investment bank and He wasn’t wearing any shoes. His toes were very carefully manicured, though. I realized I had been looking at them with too much fascination and made myself look away, catching his eyes.

“Good morning, Bael,” God said.

“Hello, sir.” Sir? What the fuck was that? I thought. Should I correct myself? Hello, My Lord? Hello, Heavenly Father? No, too late to make a correction now. But if I did correct myself and used My Lord as a greeting, would that have be more correct than sir? I was not a devoted follower, not to him, not for centuries. Why would I pretend to be one now? That seemed terribly fake of me. I wanted to make up for all my wrong doings but as I stood here before him, it did not seem like he wanted me to make it up to him. He did not look at me the way my mother had after I betrayed my father. He did not look at me holding the hatred of the men I employed.

I should have paid more attention when my mother held morning prayers before breakfast. Maybe I would have known how to act now, or what to say. Although, it was evening and not morning like he had said, so I hoped he would not focus on the details, because I had clearly been ill prepared for this.

“There’s a great change coming, Bael,” He said.

I tried to look for an imperfection. Something that looked out of place, that would make me feel less like an extremely nervous, and usually poor behaved high school student, trying to fake being an upstanding human when accidentally running into the president.

I opened my mouth to say something but his eyes changed color as I looked at him, going from the blue of a clear sky to the grey of clouds, and I forgot what I wanted to say. I thought I had made him mad for a second, but then they changed color to green and it was as if I witnessed the earth revolve in his eyes.

“A great change! And I think you should be a part of it. You’re at the center of it, actually.”

He had no marks on his face, not even a single expanded pore. Everything was excruciatingly perfect. This made me feel incredibly small and insignificant, even though He came here to see me.

“Deborah has been keeping a report on you, and I’ve been very impressed with the changes you’ve made to yourself.”

Lucifer’s presence had been forgotten to me until I caught his movement out of the corner of my eye. He went to sit down and even in the way he moved there was change. His confidence almost looked like it had wavered, not in that he had lost it and became some weaker version of himself, but he did not foreground it with everything he did. He no longer tried to show it. It just existed. He certainly seemed more comfortable here than I was. I guess, and I would have never used this word to describe him before, he was just relaxed.

“Would you like to sit?” God asked me when I did not respond. It wasn’t for lack of trying, I just felt like a fly caught on a line of tape. “Maybe you’ll be a little more comfortable if you sit.”

I’m not sure that would have done anything for me except make me feel even smaller. Then, as if on cue, he smiled and I noticed a slight imperfection in the position of his bottom tooth. It stood at a minimal slant. I knew—I don’t know how but I knew—that that little slant existed purely for my benefit. I could have felt tricked but there was only relief. Trivial, I know, but there was some fault, some imperfection that connected us and I started to relax simply because of it.

“I’d like to know what’s going to happen to me now,” I said. I did sit down after all, feeling the weight of the day in my legs. Still mad about Lily—Iva, not just mad, betrayed and deceived, yet, here they were, the people that deceived me, and bringing it up felt trivial.

“Yes, well, that’s why we’re here.”

Deborah sat up straighter and set her small hawk like eyes on me. She looked a little like a parent then, watching her child be questioned on the things she had taught him. I suppose in a way, she did dictate my journey, so whatever I did or said this even would somehow reflect on her.

“We want to offer you a position.”

“Me?” I asked. It was too soon for an internship and to be quite honest, I didn’t really want to join the program. Not another one. I hadn’t even finished the rehabilitation. Not properly, I suspect.

“Yes,” He said. He stood exactly in the same position as he did when I entered. He did not breathe or sway even a little. He did not raise his hands or let them sway as he spoke. They were solid at their sides and his feet planted like tree trunks.

“We think that a transition of power to you will break a little of the initial shock of Lucifer’s departure.”

Transition of power? Wait, a minute . . . Shit! I leaned back in my seat. Well, quite honestly, I fell into it.

“We want you to go back and run Hell the right way. Show humanity where there is none.”

“But I left,” I said as if they did not know this already. “I joined the program. No demon in their right mind will want to have me for a leader.”

“They will,” Lucifer said. “They fear me but they respect you.”

I turned to him dumbstruck. No, they don’t! I wanted to scream at him with the added squeal of a teenager. Was this him getting back at me? Did he spend that week with God and Deborah convincing them to give me the job? I won and he still somehow managed to get what he wanted. What a weasel.

“I don’t want to go back there. Me joining the program didn’t give you a hint? Here, I’ll say it then, I do not want to go back to Hell. Ever, under any circumstance.” I wanted to say that I had won and that he should deal with the loss but it was Kel who killed Pepper eventually. Kel, who wanted the power, the control of the damned and the demons.

“You still have friend there, Bael,” God said. “Do you think they would be better off under Kel’s leadership? Because that’s what they get if they don’t get you.”

“Oh come on!” I stood up from my seat. The nervousness and shock of being in God’s presence leaked right out of me. That’s what survival will do to you! Replace everything that threw you with loud alarm bells and the tunnel vision to an escape route. “There are plenty of others that are fit for the job. Sid,” I stuck my hand out of Lucifer, “he’s worked the gates, worked the souls, has half of Hell, including me, owing him favors. Mae’s actually complete the program. If you want Hell run differently, look to her.”

I said these things but just thinking about Kel being in the seat of ultimate power down there brought a hard, raging lump into my throat.

“Mae’s a follower. She has been yours for years. Sure, a master at manipulation, but at her core, a follower,” God said. “Remember, I know exactly what she’s made of. She won’t be able to handle the responsibility. Sid? Better than Kel, but is selfish and uncaring. He’s a smuggler. Does whatever for whomever as long as it benefits him.”

“May I?” Deborah, who had been only been listening quietly, raised a finger. “I’ll be down there every day and so will Mae. That is why I had her intern for me. I didn’t want you to be lonely. But I didn’t, for a second, think that you would say no to us. This is bigger than you. It’s bigger than me and him.” She pointed her thumb toward Luficer. “You know what needs to be done down there. You’re their second chance, Bael. We won’t interfere if you don’t want us to. We won’t even interfere if you don’t want to change a thing.”

“Deborah, I—”

“I sat there for years wondering when Lucifer would finally wake up. When he would forgive himself and seek that same forgiveness from others.”

Lucifer scoffed but she paid no attention to him. Nobody did. I think we all knew that this embarrassed him, and ate away at the imagine of the big bad wolf that he tried to preserve for so long. We also knew that he wanted to be here, otherwise he would have locked himself up in Hell even if he lost the bet and no one would be able to enter to get to him.

“If that can bloody happen, I don’t understand why you’re being such a baby about this. I suggested that you take this role and damn you if you prove me wrong. Imagine the team we’ll be down there, you and I.”

“You’re only down there an hour a day.” I’d be alone in that dark castle, hovering like Lucifer had once, in the darkness, watching the lining of lava in the far distance and trying to pretend that it was a sunset.

“Then I’ll extend my hours.”

“You want this, Bael,” Iva spoke in a tiny, heartbroken voice from doorway. “I know you do. There’s so much work for you to do. Perhaps, you won’t love every minute of it, but you’ll get to help them. Lev will be by your side. You can keep Kel and the others in check. You’ll never be like him.” Her eyes swept past Lucifer and fell back to me. “Help them.”

“You’ll come visit?” I asked her.

“Every day.”

I am from the USA and moved to Gothenburg this summer to live with my girlfriend.  I have a degree in Computer Science and mainly do web development but unfortunately have no experience in the workplace for that field.  Since I have been in Sweden I have been self-learning Digital Marketing and would love to find a marketing internship in the city.  I couldn't find many websites to help me find an internship but I am not sure if I am looking in the right place.  Any tips?

To combat this and stay motivated, I'm going to work back up starting with light weights in the following fashion:
-Bench day 1: 5x3 reps ""heavier"", followed by 3 sets of 6-8 on incline, close grip, finish with some lighter dumbbell work and some bw dips

-Squat day 1: 5x3 again, lighter pause squats, lunges, straight leg deadlifts

-Bench day 2: pause reps 3x5 of lighter weight, followed by overhead press, skull crushers, weighted dips 

(Rest day) 

-Squat day 2: front squats or lighter squats at 3x5, then throw in pause squats, lighter leg press and hamstring curls for assistance stuff

And finally a day that consists of deadlifting (I usually work up to 2-3 singles) and upper back work

What do you guys think of this plan? Obviously it'd be run like a linear progression focused mainly adding weight on the ""big 3"" with accessories being supplementary. I'm thinking if I run this, plus eat a ton, I should be back to where I was soon. 

For those of you that know this struggle, what helped you get back to, and beyond where you were? Any and all advice will be appreciated!

5lmy1r,6,2017-01-02,Ask Randia: Is it ok for startups to ask interns to bring their own laptops and force flash ubuntu on them?,achshar,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lmy1r/ask_randia_is_it_ok_for_startups_to_ask_interns/,"I joined a startup/company yesterday as intern and they told us we'd have to bring in our own laptops. I was kind of fine with it but then today they also told me they would need to install ubuntu on it (the work they do is node.js/android so unix type system is not a requirement) and format my system drive as well. I think that's crazy. It's my system and I should be able to control what happens to it. Yes I can of course quit but this should not be a thing.
The reason they gave everyone is that they cannot risk people using pirated windows but I don't have a single bit of pirated code on my system and they still insisted on it. I was hoping to probe good people of randia to see what they think. I realize they can request whatever they want and final control still lies with me but I think this is very personal invasion of my privacy and rights to my own rig.

And my laptop is a lenovo yoga the flex version, it has touch screen and screen folds back. It's semi hybrid version and Ubuntu would look laughably bad and criminally useless on my machine. Not to mention I have all my workstation set up on it. I told them I have genuine windows which will be rendered useless and their response was that I can always take my machine to the service center and tell them to install windows again. My internship is 6 months long so all this trouble would only be for 6 months to begin with.

I tried to negotiate quite a bit but they don't seem to budge. Dual boot, VM, or just working with windows all don't seem to make any dent in their resolve. If I cannot resolve it tomorrow I will have to either escalate it to top management (it's a small 300 person company) or just give up and leave.

I am not looking for any legal recourse, instead I am just trying to find your take on the matter."

5lnbk3,6,2017-01-02,I finally cut off my narcissist father for good.,foreverwalkalonr,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5lnbk3/i_finally_cut_off_my_narcissist_father_for_good/,"I have tried to regain my relationship with my narcicisstic father So many times and I just can't do it anymore... 

So my dad has always been a narcissist even since I was a kid- prime examples would be whenever my brother had an awards ceremony at school and my mom got him a nice shirt to wear for the ceremony and my dad made him switch shirts with him because he felt like a bum, wearing a KMOD radio station shirt, completely forgetting the fact that the day was about my brother looking nice because he was getting honor roll at an awards assembly...

Another occasion is when he destroyed an art mural of mine so he could make an art piece for himself and when I took my root beer bottle back for the MY ART MURAL that I had in my bedroom, he flipped out on me and picked a fight with me and told me I destroyed his art, completely not acknowledging that he destroyed mine. 

One recent thing that happened between my father and I was I told him if he pulled anymore of his shit with me, I am done because I dont have to put up with it and i don't expect anybody else to at that matter. 

I was sick with viral bronchitis, I couldn't eat, I couldnt move, I was running a fever, and I felt like I was going to faint. My brother didn't want to take me to the ER because he's very busy with is three different jobs he does- school, work, internship- so I called my dad crying because I almost passed out behind the wheel of my car and I almost wrecked it. I asked him to take me to the hospital and the whole time, he is in my car and driving me up there, he flips out on me and screams at me while I am damn near passing out in the passengers side of my car. He starts stomping on the brakes of my car and going on about how the car I am making him drive is unsafe and im going to get him and his stupid wife sick. 

He tells me that I use him as a parent and only go to him when I need something- isn't that what a kid is supposed to and allowed to do with a parent? I may be 27, but if I need something, I can still go to my mom. The big issue I have with that is, he's played that card to worm his way out of being my dad since I was a kid, and then he would turn around and get angry for never going to him if something came up and I needed someone- well... First I'm using you... And then you get mad because I don't reach out to you when I need something? He's been this way since I was a kid.  

He brings up the fact that I refuse to live with him- I told him I could not stay with him after I had already lived there before with him for the most miserable five months of my life with him- he was pissed because after I left his house, I  had been on my own and struggling for a while and my mom finally let me come back and stay with her. He was pissed because I went to go and live with her instead of moving back in with him. 

but he doesn't realize he is a hoarder- his house is filthy and disgusting, it's infested with roaches, at one point, he had 13 dogs- now it's three dogs and three cats- when you step on the porch of his house, you can smell the dog and cat piss before even going inside. He piles his trash up everywhere all over the floor- the dogs and cats piss and shit everywhere and neither of them clean it up. It was so bad, I took pictures incase if I ever had to use that against them because for a while when I lived with them, they were blaming all of that on me. It was so bad, I was sick with bronchitis the whole time i lived there, and every time i left the house, I would shower and wear clean clothes but I would still stink because the stench of his house would lock into your clothes. 

When I left his house, I left a lot of my stuff over there because I didn't want to bring cockroaches from his place to mine. I didn't want my new place smelling like his house, and miraculously, my asthmatic bronchitis stopped.

I have told him to his face that his house is filthy, it stinks, and it's disgusting- but he will sit there and deny it. 

So he brings up the fact that I told him i cant stay with him to try to prove his point that I used him- and then he told me he was calling my brother to take me to the hospital to make sure he didn't say  verbatum that he wouldn't take me- and then told me I was a liar and ruined his relationship with my other brother because I lie to him about what the boys say to me to get what I want which pisses me off because I never did that. 

I told him I didnt ask my younger brother to take me because hes busy and exhausted all the time.

And as for what happened with my dad and my other brother? Let me set some things straight on that. 

My dad was so happy that I was going to school, that he told me that he would help me with rides to make sure I get through it. Because at the time, I had no car and I did not have a license. (Now I do.) 

Well he started coming up with excuses to not take me to school and my brother and his husband would have to do it. They would get mad- not at me- but at him because every time dad promises to do something he bails out like he always did since we were kids- and my brother always had to come to my rescue. They werent mad at me- they were getting annoyed with him. 

And I had a talk with him because he was saying taking me to school all the time was too much and he needed help and I expressed concerned because of the transportation issues and I mentioned how my older brother was getting annoyed about it but I didnt go into detail about exactly why because I didn't want to start problems. All I was trying to do was in a nice way without getting my dad to flip out, was tell him I needed him to help me with rides. 

But I did not in any way or form tell him that my brothers were being dicks or anything like that- but he took it like that and started flipping out on my brother on the phone and my brother told him to never talk to him again and hasnt talked to him again. But some how, all of that is my fault. He constantly blames me for his problems and tells me that I lie about stuff and I'm sick of it- 

I tell him stuff because it was the truth and when he tries to confront people and acts irrational, they would rather sit there and lie and not do anything or leave out vital information because they don't want to deal with him, so I am constantly being made out to be the liar. 

Ugh I just want to run away from my family sometimes and just disappear.

5lnfwq,3,2017-01-02,Transfer Advice,claudiams22,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5lnfwq/transfer_advice/,"Hey guys! Thanks for taking the time to read this. I am a sophomore at a top 10 public university and am applying to transfer for my junior year. I will explain my situation and then have a few questions I would love some help with.

I am currently a double major in strategic communication in the journalism school and political science with a digital studies certificate. I have a 3.2 gpa sadly after receiving a literal F in accounting. I went through a really traumatic family experience this fall and spent every weekend for the last two months of the semester driving 7 hours each way to help my family. Accounting requires a lot of time to master. Time that I did not have. I am hoping schools will be able to look past this due to the circumstance. Other than that, I do have good grades in all of the relevant courses to my major (took a few Econ and math classes last year when I thought I wanted to major in business) but they aren't relevant to my degree. 

I was an intern at Hillary for America for six months while also holding a retail job and leadership positions in a few organizations. I also had an impressive internship last summer and already have received an internship at a top ad agency in NYC for this summer. 

In high school, I had a 3.9 unweighted gpa and was on honor roll all eight semesters. I also had a lot of volunteer hours in high school that have continued into my college years. 

Questions:
1) will schools be able to look past my F in accounting? Would it be worth trying to pursue a retroactive drop of the course? I am hoping they will understand the circumstance that led to this.
2) how seriously do schools take extra curriculars and work experience? I think I am very well rounded but fear that gpa is the only thing that matters.
3) Which schools would I have a chance of being accepted into? These are the ones I want to apply to:
-USC (applied to transfer last year but was not accepted) 
-NYU
-Fordham (was accepted as a senior in high school)
-George Washington
-University of Minnesota/University of Washington/UT Austin (accepted to all as a senior in high school)
Any other ideas for schools I should apply to for pr/communications? I don't want to downgrade the quality of program from where I am, but I really dislike the environment of my school and am not happy there.

Any help would be appreciated! This year has been brutal for me and am hoping for positive change! Much love to everyone that read this. Happy new year!

Here's my situation:

I go to a top university for my major and just finished the first semester of my second year.

This past semester, finals was an especially rough time because I realized I wasn't really studying throughout the semester (between extracurriculars--a part time job and leadership position--and going out more than I should have, I did the bare minimum to get me through week to week on assignments and midterms; this is a study habit that I've had since high school, I've just been able to pull As in the past, but at this school and this major (engineering), this is obviously not how it works).

Now, I'm seriously regretting the semester and I'm afraid I'm really behind my peers. The classes are only going to get harder and I feel as though I don't have the background that I should have established because instead of doing the ""daily grind"", I've been a crammer my whole life.

To add to that, in a week, I'm about to start an internship that I feel like I'm not qualified for. Basically, I feel like a complete fraud.

I'm so scared to continue pursuing my major because I'm afraid I dont have the discipline to do what needs to get done. I'm particularly afraid to go back to my school, where there's an expectation that you are able to do everything-- the academics, the extracurriculars, leadership positions, etc. (I mean I guess that's why when you do ""get out"", they say you can work anywhere.) Maybe I just didn't have the right balance this past semester, but I'm afraid of failing again, of making the same mistakes.

I'm afraid that I won't be employable at the end of it; whether it be my less than stellar GPA (or even failing out) or my lack of involvement and necessary extracurriculars (needing to step back to focus on academics/catch up).

To add to that, my parents have invested money and I have my personal loans to consider too. It's about 5k a year for me and 35k for them.

Going into college, the plan was that if I put in the work, I will be able to be competitive in the end... well, I guess I feel like I haven't put in the work and I'm afraid I can't possibly catch up between now and graduation.

In a way, because of the feelings mentioned above, I've entertained the idea of switching out of my specific major and engineering in general. But I don't know to what... so that seems like just giving up, doesn't it? 

Anyway, I've spent the entire holiday break contemplating my future and it's seriously drained me of my energy and motivation. I've also caused some strife in my family, bogging my parents down with my awful mood.

I'm afraid that if I don't get out of this mentality, my reality would turn out to be the fears that I have: unemployed with thousands of debt. 

I hope this post has made some sense. I'll be happy to explain things further if needed (to the best of my ability) but I could really use a 3rd party's insight/advice on what I should do.

tl;dr: I want to switch majors but I think it could be for the wrong reasons. Yet, staying in seems like an impossible battle."
5lobwz,0,2017-01-02,About a friend... I am 22/m,duckintheeast,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5lobwz/about_a_friend_i_am_22m/,"I have realized that I have some strong feelings for one of my best girl friends. She is 21 turning 22 soon if that means anything to this post. I am also single.

So I have had these feelings really since the summer when I met her during an internship. At that time, we went on a couple dates and she cut it off because we never talked about being exclusive and she picked another guy over me. I was upset but not mad because we were never exclusive. We decided however to be friends and have gotten really close since then. Between then and now, there was about a one month time where we stopped talking because I needed to work through my feelings and get over her. At the time, I did. Since then though, my feelings are stronger than before. It wouldn't be this bad if she didn't give me the most confusing signals ever. We talk all the time and just got back from our holiday break where we didn't see each other for 2 weeks. When she found out we would be back to my school's city on the same day she demanded we go out for dinner and when I went to pick her up she jumped in my arms.  

During our break, she met a guy and told me that they were ""kind of but not exactly"" dating to quote her. I am good with her dating, but she does it a lot and most don't last long. 

We have been meaning to party together and so we decided we would go out together on New Year's day. When we were out we were pretty drunk and I got a little touchy (something sober me would have never done). It was nothing bad, just like grabbing her around the waste and scratching her back. However, later that night we were dancing and she started dancing on me. This is all stuff that bothers me now because I regret what was going because she has some interest in this other guy. She went home a bit early that night because she wasn't feeling well. This was the first time she had met my friends. When she got home she asked me what I was doing and if it was just with friends. 

This is all driving me insane and I have no idea what to do. I feel the best course of action is telling her, but I don't want create an awkward situation and have to choose anyone. We are also really close and I don't want to lose her friendship.  Any advice is welcome and I am willing to answer any questions that could help with the advice."

[Survival Island 2: Battle of the Sexes](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/5k16bv/td_survival_island_2_battle_of_the_sexes/)

Click [here](http://brantsteele.com/totaldrama/01/r.php?c=itgoTQKX) to skip the Intro/Character Bios, and go straight to the season.

After a (not so brief) hiatus, Survival Island is back with a new cast and a new twist! This season, each of the contestants will be playing with one of their rivals! This means that ex-roomates, divorcees, business rivals, and even siblings will be facing off against each other for the $100,000 grand prize!

In addition, there is another twist that will be present during this season. This season will feature one of the biggest rivalries from Season 2 of Survival Island: Lizzie and Cassi! These two enemies will also be playing for the grand prize.

Who are the other 20 contestants battling it out in a season full of drama, back stabs, and blindsides? Let's find out!

**Abraham and Ramsey**

*The Football Rivals*

Abraham (22) and Ramsey (21) are football players from rival colleges. The two have been rivals since their freshman year on the football team, and have no intention of working together on the Island. Although their physical strength may carry them far, will it be enough to win the game?

**Olive and Jasmine**

*The Ex-Best Friends*

Olive (19) and Jasmine (19) are ex-best friends from Massachusetts. Although Olive and Jasmine were inseparable in their youth, their differences in personalities have led them to abandon their friendship. Will Olive's sweet persona give her the win, or will Jasmine's fiery attitude bring home the grand prize? 

**Alvin and Carter**

*The Business Rivals*

Alvin (55) and Carter (61) are executives at rival business companies. Though they have never gotten along, will they be able to put aside their difference and work together to take down their opponents?

**Dana and Ross**

*The Estranged Father-Daughter Duo*

Ross (51) and Dana (22) are a father-daughter pair from New York. Although they were close when Dana was young, Ross's harsh rules ultimately drove Dana away, leading her to a ""punk"" lifestyle. Will the duo be able to mend their relationship, or will they lose their shot at $100,000?

**Andrew and Michaela**

*The Stepfather and Stepdaughter*

Andrew (41) is the new stepfather of Michaela (18). Although Andrew has tried to reach out to Michaela multiple times, Michaela is not interested in a new dad. Will Survival Island bring them closer together, or only tear them farther apart.

**Christian and Meghan**

*The Ex-Roommates*

Meghan (23) and Christian (24) are ex-roommates from Ohio. Christian's lazy and laid-back demeanor and Meghan's uptight attitude often clashed, leading to them finding new roommates. Will their conflicting personalities continue to clash, or will they be able to work together to make it to the end? 

**Jessica and Thomas**

*The Divorcees*

Jessica (33) is a beautiful, full-figured woman, and is the ex-wife of Thomas (34) a successful New York attorney. Although their marriage started off steady, their constant adultery and continued fights have led to their inevitable divorce. Although they haven't spoken in years, will they be able to get past their differences and win the money?

**Dominic and Gene**

*The Bully and the Nerd*

Dominic (20) and Gene (19) are your classic example of a high school conflict. Though Dominic and Gene have both left high school and moved on to their own paths, they still haven't been able move past their strained relationship. Will they be able to bury the hatchet and win the grand prize?

**Kayla and Kaylee**

*The Control-Freak and The Free Spirit*

Kaylee (28) and Kayla (28) are two twins who couldn't be any more different. Kaylee is a recent law school graduate looking for internships at some of the most prestigious internships in the country, while Kayla is a freelance musician and artist looking to get discovered. Will their conflicting personalities bring out the best in them, or the worst?

**Tina and Jake**

*The Rich Siblings*

Tina (27) and Jake (25) are siblings and members of the financially elite. Though they are siblings, they are still bitter enemies, both vying for the inheritance of their parents. Their parents sent them to Survival Island as a sort of ""bonding exercise"", but will they be able to actually bond, or will they end up worse off than they started?

5lotwj,18,2017-01-02,"[25 F4A] Sorta like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, except sex-themed! Oh, and it takes place in a regular old office.",KellyMcSizequeen,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lotwj/25_f4a_sorta_like_dungeons_dragons_except/,"Fun fact: When I first learned about D&amp;D, I mistakenly thought that RPG stood for ""Roll Playing Game"" which is why they needed so many dice. For rolling!

Regardless, I've recently learned a little more about D&amp;D (never played, though, so I'm still pretty uninformed) and thought it would be fun to turn it into a sex adventure! I've posted before about my interests in world-building, and thought this might be a good setup.

I'm not entirely sure that the actual stories (interactions between characters) need to be dice-based, but it might be fun if we introduced some dice-related randomness to our character creation process. I thought it might be fun to use the headquarters of some small company as the backdrop for our adventures. Only 10-20 employees, all in their 20s or 30s.

My proposal: we create names and personalities for all of the characters who work at the company. Once we have a set that we like, we start assigning their sexual characteristics randomly (penis size, breast size, sexual appetite, sexual competency, anything you want!) and then we can either pick our favorite characters to RP or the two of us can collectively control all of the characters and see how the story unfolds.

Just to warn you, I'm fairly geeky. Maybe not when it comes to D&amp;D, but definitely comes to math. I want a realistic distribution rather than just giving every guy a big cock (or even worse, giving our favorite guy a massive cock and the other characters small ones). I'm still trying to figure out the rules, but here are a few examples.

------------------------

Penis length: Roll 4 dice. Throw out the two lowest dice, and keep the two highest dice. Add them together, subtract 2, this is your penis length in inches.

Penis girth: Roll 2 dice. Add them together, divide by 2, add 2, this is your penis circumference in inches.

Penis length (flaccid): Roll 1 die. This is your flaccid penis length. (NOTE it's possible to have a shrinker if your flaccid penis is longer than your erect length! Be prepared to explore how that might affect sexual encounters!)

Breast size: Roll 2 dice. [2,3,4] = A cup, [5,6] = B cup, [7,8] = C cup, [9,10] D cup, [11,12] DD cup

Breast appearance: Roll 1 die. [1] = -2, [2] = -1, [3, 4] = 0, [5] = +1, [6] = +2. This is how many cup sizes bigger your breasts look in your work attire. Negative is smaller, and the minimum cup size is A. 

Breast firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = floppy, [2, 3, 4] = normal, [5] = perky, [6] = so full and round that they look fake despite being real.

Breast Examples:

* Size roll = 9, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = D, Appearance = -2, so her Ds will look like Bs when she's dressed for work.

* Size roll = 5, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = B, Appearance = -2, her As will look like As because your cup size can't drop below A.
* Size roll = 7, Appearance roll = 6 --&gt; Size = C, Appearance = +2,
her Cs will look like DDs.

Butt size/firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = Ironing board, [2,3] = Normal, [4,5] = Shapely and attractive, [6] = Nicki Minaj.

Sexual experience: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 was probably in a fraternity/sorority.

Sexual skill: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 should be writing a sex advice column.

Sexual appetite: Roll 1 die. [1] = Monthly, [2,3] = Weekly, [4,5,6] = Daily. This is how often the character wants (needs?) sex.

-----------------------------

Obviously, I'm still trying to figure this out. We don't need to do include all of these measurements and I'm certainly open to adding other traits/measurements. But first things first! Let's come up with our theoretical company and the people who work there. Once we come up with their office backstories, we can start discovering their sexual side and figure out how they all interact!

Character backstories don't need to be too intense. For example:

* [Lianna](http://i.imgur.com/rTWEjh6.jpg) is in charge of product design. She's always been an overachiever and joined the company immediately after graduating from a prestigious university.

* [Joel](http://i.imgur.com/Vuo7Wna.jpg) does all of the coding. He's likable and competent, but has a tendency to show up late or take long lunch breaks. 

* [Ali](http://i.imgur.com/ySv6cwj.jpg) is a sophomore at the local college and is working part-time as a marketing intern to earn credits for her business degree. She's not afraid to work hard for what she wants... it's just that she's never actually needed to work hard before because everybody is so enamored/intimidated by her!"
5lph84,4,2017-01-02,Hey! I might transfer here! Comp Sci major SOS,duhspair,Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/5lph84/hey_i_might_transfer_here_comp_sci_major_sos/,"Hey everyone, I am (obviously) considering transferring to Temple and was wondering if I could get some info on what being there is like. 

Right now, I attend the University of Pittsburgh, which, don't get me wrong, is a very highly regarded school. I am a computer science major whose only classes that will transfer over from this one year I have at Pitt are calc 1 and an intermediate programming class. I also hope to minor in film? If that's something I can do here, cool, but it's not a must.

My main concern here I guess is how accessible was your ability to get involved in comp sci organizations, hack events, internships, and career assistance? And how much do you enjoy working with this department?

Any objective or subjective opinions are welcome! I'm touring this spring and have a bunch of friends who go there, but not for the same major!

5lq5nw,369,2017-01-03,Is the whole “literally anyone can code” mentality indicative of a bubble?,DBZ5episodesyelling,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lq5nw/is_the_whole_literally_anyone_can_code_mentality/,"DISCLAIMER: I am a bored undergrad. This is my personal opinion. If anyone has a well reasoned counterpoint I would love to hear it. 
 
I remember hearing an anecdote about a famous investor pulling his investments before the 1929 stock market crash. Essentially, he realized that that the bubble was about to burst when his shoeshine boy was giving him investment advice.

You can sort of see the same thing today. There’s a serious mentality that “anyone can code” and I’m talking ANYONE. There are bootcamps that promise to get somebody with zero experience jobs six-figure jobs. There are plenty of askreddit threads extolling how you don’t even need that; all anyone has to do is learn some javascript, build a portfolio, and BAM! High-paying programmer salary. On the frontpage of /r/cscareerquestions right now you can see someone pointing out that there seems to be many people with an expectation of going from working at McDonalds to getting a high paying programming job in six months. In the real world, I've noticed a lot of people parroting similar sentiments. 

There are plenty of high paying jobs with growth potential: Multiple fields of engineering, pharmacy tech,  and countless trades(think electrician). Yet only software development seems to have this mentality of immediate turnaround. 

Granted, this could all be (largely) BS. It could be that it takes an extremely special skillset, talent, or work ethic. However, that doesn’t change the fact that there is a perception that such a move is easily possible. This should, in theory, flood the entry level with a glut of (albeit unqualified) applicants and drive wages for programmers down dramatically. 

...Or it could be true. In which case there are thousands of people (like myself) who go through a 4-year program for no reason. I am a senior in a four-year program. I’ve spent the last four years working at my program, applying/working at internships,  and get my  (more recently. It took me a while to get serious about career stuff) portfolio up to snuff. I would be distraught to learn I could have skipped all of that or it’s more or less meaningless in obtaining an entry level programming job. I mean, I have a job offer I’m really happy with, but still…

I also think it might be indicative of software development seen as “easy money”. That mentality, in terms of both jobs and investment into tech companies, can be dangerous. I (again, personal opinion) that will lead to an over-saturation of the market and the funding of risky investments or the hiring of underqualifed devs. 

I’d love to hear what you guys think about this. 

TL:DR I think the whole “anyone can code” mentality is, to some extent, a canary in the coalmine of a bubble for the tech industry software developers. I know I’m just one dude with an opinion, so I’d love some thoughts. "
5lqa3q,1,2017-01-03,"For a Career in Program/Project Management, could a masters be useful?",wclayton44,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lqa3q/for_a_career_in_programproject_management_could_a/,"I feel that I'm in a bit of a unique position in terms of my career aspirations. I'm very interested in a career in Program/Project engineering management (or even product management), because I very much enjoy combining my communication skills with my engineering knowledge. I love the diverse set of activities in these rolls, and while I love CS, and don't nessisarily get as much fulfillment out of programming as I do in a PM role. I've even had multiple internships as a PM and loved the role, and worked at some cool companies. 

At the same time, Im also fascinated by pattern recognition and even deep learning in CS, and very much want to learn more. Ideally, I very much want to work on projects in my career that leverage these concepts in CS. In my undergraduate career, ive not really been exposed to these concepts other than some elective classes with limited scope. 

Ideally, I want to be a PM that works with engineers on projects involving pattern recognition and deep learning. The questions is, what is the best way to get there? I have PM experience , and I am finishing up my undergraduate CS degree in years time. Would graduate school in CS help me fufil this goal? Even if I don't want to be a software engineer?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

5lqz45,1,2017-01-03,Learning more about backend,qtumble,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lqz45/learning_more_about_backend/,"I'm a junior student who's done side projects and internships on mostly full stack or front end stuff. Most of the stuff on my resume is with javascript and all the hottest frameworks. Even though I consider myself a ""full stack"" developer, I realized the only thing I've ever done with the backend side was to just create a node server that can do routing and some other stuff, or some simple api.

I would like to learn more about backend stuff, and for job postings related to backend, I see words like ""scalable"", ""distributed"", ""fault-tolerant"", or ""concurrency"" and usually in languages like Java or python (funny though, I thought nodejs was considered backend, but never saw it ever pop up much). I know Java pretty well and would like to learn how to use it to build a scalable and fault-tolerant backend, most likely for enterprise applications. I'm finding it hard to know where to start.  What should I look into or what books do you suggest? 

I've looked into it a bit and it seems like J2EE or Spring could be something to look at. Where could I learn about making them scalable, distributed, fault-tolerant, etc.? What would be a good project to work on?"

I did an internship and co-authored a paper in an academic journal and was on a pretty solid track. Then I married a soldier and put my career on hold while we went through multiple overseas moves and deployments, had some children, etc. 

Now he's retired from the military with a more stable job and the time is coming for me to dust off the resume and rejoin the workforce. Over the years, I have volunteered to run a few small websites, and occasionally worked through some Project Euler exercises for fun. Logic and algorithms always came naturally to me and I remember quite a bit, but I know I'm rusty and out-of-date. 

I was planning on a timeline of 2-3 years (flexible) and we live near Seattle. I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for what I should focus on as I start to refresh my skills and make myself marketable. Is an old CS degree worth anything? Do I need to disclose when I got it?  Would it help if I went back to school? Bootcamp? Concentrate on developing a portfolio and working on open source projects? I'd love to hear your ideas. Thank you."
5ls66d,0,2017-01-03,Started job search 6+ months after graduation... how screwed am I?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ls66d/started_job_search_6_months_after_graduation_how/,"I graduated last summer with a BS in Computer Science at the decrepit age of 30. I have a high-ish GPA (3.6) from an unremarkable program/university. By the time I graduated, I was pretty depressed and burned out. I attribute this to going to school while working full time, the self-doubt/impostor syndrome that a lot of people seem to experience in this field, and life circumstances at the time. 

As I was finishing up my degree, I had become pretty convinced that I shouldn't/couldn't do this. I didn't do an internship and I didn't bother applying for jobs before or after graduation. I felt like I lacked the intelligence and motivation needed to succeed in this career. I wanted nothing to do with software development and spent months just pretending the degree never happened.

After having some time off to relax and getting back to programming, I'm finding that I actually sort of enjoy it. I'll never have passion or consider myself a real computer scientist but I think I could do this for a living. I don't really care about working anywhere too competitive and I'd be fine with just doing boring CRUD apps for a boring company somewhere that isn't SF/Seattle/Austin/etc. 

Anyway, I feel like my biggest issues right now are the fact that I have no experience, live in an area with very few development jobs, and have a large and growing gap on my resume since when I graduated. I'm pretty adamant about wanting to relocate since being able to move was one of my reasons for going back to school. I feel like I'm going to have to move for my career sooner or later and I'd rather do it now and get it done with. 

I started applying for jobs (5-10 per weekday) in mid-November and have received a lot of rejections. I'm guessing hiring slows down over the holidays so I'm sure there's a chance I could hear back from some others. I'd like to find something by summer if at all possible but I know it's going to be an uphill battle due to my location and lack of experience.

What I'm doing:
-Working on projects and trying to learn new languages/frameworks/libraries/etc. These are nothing special and won't likely impress a recruiter. Right now I'm developing a simple web app for a family friend that I think I might actually get paid for by their employer so that might give me something to talk about in interviews.
-Working on coding exercises on the usual sites mentioned here (Leetcode, etc). I am very, very bad at them and it's an absolutely miserable experience but I keep telling myself that everyone sucks when they start and that I'll get better with practice.
-Refreshing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I've been pleasantly surprised how much I actually retained so that's encouraging. 

My questions:
-How good do projects need to be? Do I need to meticulously follow best practices, have unit tests, etc, or is it ok to have some code that probably reveals that I was learning as I went along?
-How do I explain the fact that I'm still searching 6+ months after graduation? 
-How can I make myself more likely to get responses from companies out of state when I live in a relative backwater? Are there any tech hubs in particular where companies might be more open/less competitive for non-local candidates?

tl;dr: How screwed am I for waiting over half a year after graduation to start applying for jobs and what are some ways I can combat being a 30 year old in the ass end of nowhere with a shitty resume?"

5lsbbo,5,2017-01-03,RE: 'Is this sub dead now' &amp; What Happened to the Project?,LuckRoar,EclipseSix,https://www.reddit.com/r/EclipseSix/comments/5lsbbo/re_is_this_sub_dead_now_what_happened_to_the/,"Hey readers,

I just wanted to let you know what happened to E6; why is the sub inactive? What happened to the Facebook page? First of all, I'm sorry for this message taking this long to find you.

This entire project began during an internship for the anime media platform GoBoiano (henceforth referred to as 'GB'). GB was searching for unpaid interns to learn from them, gain experience. It wasn't a problem if you were somewhere across the globe, as the internship would be via the internet, so a great opportunity there! After a sollicitation process myself and twenty-something others were picked out, and joined several teams. There were people assigned to social media, people assigned to video editing, and people assigned to writing articles for GoBoiano.com. I was one of the latter, writing Buzzfeed-style articles, but also writing anime analyses. I eventually pitched my idea for a community-made anime project to GB, and they loved the idea. I got to work immediately, writing the articles you've read and compiling ideas upon ideas in a giant document we called the 'proof of concept'. This was around August, the month I was on holiday with family. But I loved this project and I worked throughout my summer break to deliver the proof of concept to the CEO. Hadn't heard anything from him for a while, then a 'sorry, I'll read it this weekend', after pushing some more another 'I'll read it next week, just been busy' and eventually it was September, the so called end of the internship, and I hadn't heard anything from him. So I decided to put E6 on hiatus until he approached me with his opinion on the proof of concept. This entire thing was a GB project, so funding for the anime and development would all go through them instead of the online fundraising a lot of you suggested. But that would of course only be the case if GB had faith in the project. And I suppose we'll never know whether or not GB had faith in the project. I believe that up until this day, they haven't even opened up the proof of concept's document. E6 is one of the victims of a severe lack of communication from the GB staff's side during this internship. I don't hold any grudges towards the GB staff for this lack of communication. I'm just sad the internship had to end like it did, without any official announcement from the staff, with the radio silence speaking for them like 'you can quietly disappear now as if this internship has never happened'. It's unfortunate, but it happened. I'm glad this internship has resulted in me getting to know other interns and making friends in America, Australia, the Philippines and the UK, which is awesome for a Dutch media-student like myself.

So from here on.. What do we do? Do you have any suggestions, now that you know the E6 team's side of the story? I'd like to make the proof of concept publicly available for all of you. I'll sticky it to the frontpage of the subreddit once this message goes live. Continuing this project without GB would be an enormous challenge, but if you still want to see Yumi come to live after all this time, I think we should give it a chance.

You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"
5lsku2,3,2017-01-03,I've been out of programming for three months,caterpillar15,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lsku2/ive_been_out_of_programming_for_three_months/,"Background: I'm 25 with a BS in Computer Science, and I live in Pennsylvania. I've held two programming jobs. My first job I started as an intern and worked my way up to being the lead backend developer (it was a smaller company so take that title with a grain of salt). I was there for about three years.  My second programming job was as a software engineer with a bank, and I was there for about a year.


Skills: I have done a wide variety of  different work including frontend, backend, and a little DevOps. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET, Git, SVN, SQL, Jenkins CI, and a few others. I would say I'm strongest with C#, SQL, and Git. I primarily have worked on back-end CRUD projects, and have had the opportunity to be the technical lead on some. Again I've worked with small companies, so I wouldn't have had that same opportunity if I was working at a large company with more experienced devs.


I'm starting the process of looking for a software development job. I've been out of programming for three months. I was going through a divorce that really threw my world upside down. I quit my job (stupidly), and I'm now working for my Dad's construction company in a technical role in which I don't get to do any programming. 


My current job is Ok and I make a decent salary, but I really miss programming. I don't enjoy coming into work everyday as I once did. My Dad would like me to take his share in the business one day, but I'm just not passionate about it. So I'm going to start the process of looking for a dev job. I would Ideally like to find a remote or semi-remote job. I worked remote about one day a week at my last job, and I found I was more productive that way. 


I've never really had to interview for a programming job. I did some interviews for some internships, but that was about it. I got hired after my internship, and my second job I got hired by the CTO who had worked with me previously. He offered me a job without any kind of formal interview.


I'm not urgently looking for a new job, I just want to make sure I find one that I will enjoy, with people I can respect, and a salary I'm comfortable with.  I'm really looking for some direction on how to go about this. I think the first place I need to start is expanding my Github profile. I don't think I interview well, and I think having some solid projects, and open source contributions can mitigate that. Anybody have some suggestions where I could start looking? Also, will companies look at why I'm not currently at a programming job?"
5lsour,1,2017-01-03,What skills could i learn to get an internship with no experience,bikerchef,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lsour/what_skills_could_i_learn_to_get_an_internship/,"Im going to a university next fall for Computer science, Ive been taking all the classes I can to transfer over from a community college so far, taking calc II in the spring and calc III in the summer and Im pretty much done. Ive enjoyed math ALOT more than I expected, so honestly im pretty excited to expand upon this in actual university.

Anyways, Im appling to internships already because, why not? I would actually be getting paid more than i currently am in most of the internships ive seen, and I would have that extra experience to leverage getting an even better one next year.

 I have a 3.6 GPA and a very good resume for someone in my current field so im tring my hardest to spin all my experience to be applicable for a career with technology. 

But whats really affecting my success im sure:

Lack of industry experience
Lack of applicable class work.

Thinking of filling these gaps with some online courses in my personal time,  Im thinking an intro python course or ,maybe some basic IT certs like CCENT. What would you all say is going to get my the most bang for my buck(time invested).

Im applying to software internships and also IT internships if that makes any difference.

5lsuck,5,2017-01-03,"3 Years Since Graduation, Looking for Advice on Getting that First Developer Job",collegeseniorthroway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lsuck/3_years_since_graduation_looking_for_advice_on/,"Hello all.

TL:DR Graduated 3 years ago with no internships. Tired of current job that has no relevance to the career I want. Looking for advice on getting started in the field.

I graduated December 2013 with a BS in Computer Engineering. During which, I did not secure any sort of internship. I spent two years unemployed and depressed. I have spent this last year working in a job I loathe because it was literally the only offer I had during that time.

I am ready to make a change. I know that my skills have rusted considerably since graduation, and I am no competition for a fresh graduate in my current state. In fact, I am so out of the loop I don’t know what my greatest shortcomings are, let alone how to figure them out.

Currently my plan is to use CodeBlocks for C++ and PyCharm for Python, make some working code and post it online. Problem with that is I’m having difficulty thinking of projects that are nontrivial yet something I can feasibly manage on my own.

Another problem that I’ll have to deal with is how bare my resume is. Like I said, I only took my current job because it was the only offer I had in two years, and there is nothing technical about it apart from using the occasional spreadsheet. It’s mostly a struggle of not wanting to shoot myself while talking with customers on the phone.

Any advice for my current situation?"

So I got my first class honors last year in Maths and has been applying for graduate positions in the last few months. I got a few interview opportunities but I failed pretty much all of them unfortunately.

Now, I got a 6-month internship offer from a Big 4 firm. Although the salary is ~$1000/month which is half of that of a full time position, I think it is a good opportunity for at least some more work experiences in case I am not able to secure any permanent positions this year. 

There is potentially one more interview opportunity soon, but I need to pass a test first.

I want to know what you guys think, should I take the offer or not? If not, what are the alternatives?

Thanks!"

5lszql,60,2017-01-03,[MF] Making a new friend in Hong Kong,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5lszql/mf_making_a_new_friend_in_hong_kong/,"I really hate traveling to China most of the time. The flights are too long, and I don't usually enjoy the food. I tend to enjoy the experience of being in a minority, and the looks I get being an over six-foot-tall white guy walking through the city, and especially the groups of girls who shyly want to try out their English with me, but a few novelties don't make up for being jet-lagged and hungry the entire time. But at the end of the last trip I was lucky enough to have a much better night than usual in Hong Kong. 

For the fist part of the night, this definitely wasn't the case. I was there with some colleagues in Wan Chai, which, as my local friend explained to me, was the Dirty Old Man district. Ladyboys wandering the streets, strip clubs on the sides, and lots of bars with guys way past their prime who didn't mind trading cash for attention. I was at a bar with a live cover band, which I really can't stand, either, watching a young Filipina using some Newt Gringrich-looking guy like a stripper pole while a very wrong rendition of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" skullfucked the room. Yeah, I was in hell. So I was really glad to see my phone light up in WhatsApp when my local friend got off work. I happily bade my colleagues good night and walked around to the hotel where she was waiting for me.

We'll call her Wilma, but she isn't really the star of the story. She had rented a room from me when I lived in Los Angeles whiel doing an internship. There was definitely some chemistry between us, and we did wind up playing around a bit, but never really having sex; the timing was just wrong - I was in a closed relationship then, and now she was in a serious relationship, although she did do some submission to others withher boyfriend's permission. So, we definitely knew each other's proclivities, even if we didn't partake.

She greeted me with a hug, and we walked to the metro. I told her what she saved me from, and she cringed on my behalf. As we took the Metro to the Central district, she laughed at how much taller i was than everyone else. Yeah I know. We got there and walked to her apartment, which was a very typical Hong Kong apartment in that it was a testiment to minimalist efficiency. After a few minutes, we took a bottle of wine from the firdge walked up the last few stairs to the rooftop, where a few other people in the building were. 

It was actually a gorgeous night and we could see out over the city. Wilma's apartment building was 25 stories, so we had a nice view out. As we talked about life, we drifted into the topic of D/s and submission, which was nromal fare for us, and I saw a couple of the other people on the roof cast their eyes over at us in a bit of shock. 

After a few minutes they walked over and introduced themselves. They were all Australian, a married couple and a single woman, who of course caught my eye. Her name was Elise, and she was fairly tall, maybe 5'11', with long dyed red hair, wearing a wraparound top that showed off her extremely generous cleavage. While I'm not normally someone that obssesses over such things, she clearly was proud of breasts and knew how to work them, and liked being noticed. 
The confidence wore very well on her, and I was happy to give her the attention as we all chatted for another hour or so. As it turned out, they all lived in the building, so we were happy to enjoy the night together and letting the conversation run into all sorts of purple topics. I'm sure that there were all sorts of hints being dropped that Elise was interested, but I was my usual oblivious. Wilma, thankfully, was more on the ball than I was.

When we got back to the topic of spanking, which was always Wilma's favorite, it got to the right tools for the job. Since I had spanked Wilma in the past, she was able to attest to some of the things I had done in the past. Elise pointedly asked if we were a couple, which Wilma happily said we weren't. I smiled a bit at that and she caught my look. ""But TheWanderingPro here is really at his best with those big hands of his."" God bless her for being a great wingman. 

Elise lit up at that. ""let me see!"" I held my hand up against Wilma's, and her small, Asian hand almost vanished against mine. Elise roller her eyes. ""No, hold it against my hand."" Given her height, I couldn't quite so easily dominate her in size, but my fingers easily extended a knuckle past hers. But I looked and caught the twinkle in her eye as we were touching. Wilma helpfully emptied the wine bottle into her glass. 

""Hey, TheWanderingPro, do you want some more to drink? I need to run down and get some.""  Before I could answer, she was off the roof. I owe her for this.

And suddenly there I was with Elise, still holding her hand (why had we not let go?) around another couple kissing. We looked at each other a moment, and then I pulled her against me, and she turned her head up as I kissed her. Her lips parted immediately and my tongue slid past, caressing hers as i felt a surge of blood below and her body pressed against mine. I don't know how long we kissed, but by the time we stopped our pulses were racing and we could barely breathe. ""Your friend is taking a long time with the wine."" she breathed.

""That's what makes her a good friend."" I smiled against her lips. ""Want me to tell her to forget the wine?"" She nodded. I pulled out my phone and texted Wilma. I just got a smiley back and a reminder to be safe.

""let's go to your apartment."" I said. Elise practically dragged me off the roof and down the stairs. As we waited on the elevator, we kept making out, my hand sneaking under her top, caressing her breasts through the lace of her bra. The elevator arrived, and we fell into it and she stabbed the button for the 11th floor. The entire ride down was hands, lips, and furtive carresses as we rode down to her floor. The elevator stopped roughly shaking a little sense into us. We walked around the corner to her apartment. 

Elise got assertive at the door. ""Shoes off. Don't want any dirt on my carpet."" I obeyed, then pushed her back against the door, kissing her furiously as I lifted her top. Her arms went over her head, and a black lacy bra was revealed, barely holding her enormous chest in place. Her breasts felt amazingly soft through the bra as her hands worked the buttons on my shirt. I dropped my arms as she pushed it off my shoudlers and i finally felt her mostly-bare chest against mine. I started ksising down her neck which elicited a lot of moans while I worked her jeans open, and pushed them down, stripping her down to her white cotton panties. I went to rub her through them, and was soon rewarded with wet fabric. Her eyes were wild, as she grabbed at my belt. 

""Take these off"" she said. I stepped back, and pushed my pants and underwear off, taking my socks with them. I was naked in front of her as she worked her panties off, and then she knelt in front of me, eagerly taking my throbbing erection in her mouth. I could feel every bit of her energy coming through in the furious motions of her mouth and hand on me. I pulled her hair back as she worked up and down on my shaft. I happily let her work on my for a few minutes, groaning, telling her how amayzing her mouth was on me. Suddenly I pulled her off by her hair and turned her face up to kiss me, tasting my cock in her mouth, one of my favorite little pleasures in life. I then pulled her off her knees onto the bed, and directed her onto her back. As I slid down to return the oral favor, I found a small ring greeting me. This was my first pierced clitoral hood, so I took a moment to consider my options, then softly licked her from her opening upward, lifting the rung out of the way and letting the flat of my tongue slide across her clit. Her hups surged up into my mouth and her hand grabbed my head and pushed it into her. Takign that as approval, I repeated the motion again and again, and she began to moan, but now ever more audibly, surely loud enough for the neighbors to hear. I turned my head to let me work a finger inside, and I could feel the amazing texture inside her body. I was hooked.

She spoke in a breathy moan. ""Put on a condom and fuck me."" God I love instructions sometimes! I looked up as she dug the condom out of her nightstand and passed it down. I rolled it on and positioned myself over her. She pulled me down to kiss her, and taste herself, the rough fabric of her bra on my chest as I guided myself inside. Her legs wrapped tightly around me and pulled me in deeper as I felt her stretch around. ""Oh my God you feel so big!"" She knew how to flatter a man! I started working myself in and out, and she pushed against me, willing me to go faster. I pulled out, and she protested in shock. ""Roll over."" The coin dropped and she got on all fours, positioning her hips high and grabbing the pillow in front of her. I gave her a sharp spank across her offered ass and she yelped, sticking it out farther. I guided myself back inside, then took her hip bones in my hand and began pushing her hard up and down. ""ohhhhh yyyyyeaaaaaaahhh"" she stuttered with each impact. I worked harder, trying to drive through her body each time. I felt her fingers at the base of my cock, rubbing herself as I wokred furiously away at her. Suddenly her body clenched, hard, and she went silent, her breath stuck in her chest as the orgasm erupted across her body. The moment hung, suspended in time until suddenly her muscles gave out and she went limp under me. I resume my own motions, and she moaned incoherently, all circuits fried. Her helplessness to my motions was the magic I needed, and i planted myself deep inside her as I filled the condom. 

I pulled out and slumped in bed beside her. She curled up under my arm. ""mmmmm....that was amaaaaazing."" 

""Yes...it...was."" 

""YOu're not going to sleep are you?"" she asked pointedly.

""Not now."" I answered.

""Good, because I'm going to make the most of you."" she purred...

5lt18j,249,2017-01-03,A Momentum feature wouldn't be that hard to implement (from a computer programmer's POV),MakyMaestro,FIFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/5lt18j/a_momentum_feature_wouldnt_be_that_hard_to/,"FIRST OF ALL, I am no expert in programming. I just graduated from college with a couple internships under my belt, that's it. This is just an opinion, mainly to respond to all the people saying that a feature so ""complex"" as Momentum would be WAY TOO HARD for EA to code, when it's not. And yes, I will try to simplify the language as much as I can, cause it reality its much more detailed than the way I will explain it, but still relatively simple for someone who knows how to program properly.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

One thing my teachers emphasized during their lectures is ""Re-use your code as much as possible"", especially when you need to perform the same operations more than once in your program.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, if EA came to me and gave me a copy of FIFA and gave me a briefing of every feature in the game (with a summary of the game-code as well) and asked me to program a ""Momentum-like"" feature for online, I wouldn't think twice: Recycle the code for OFFLINE SLIDERS.


I mean, the code is already there. The principle is the same. Decrease and/or Increase in:

- Pace

- Pass speed/accuracy

- Shot speed/accuracy

- Marking

- Ball Control

- Goalkeeper skills (there is a slider for that too)


So for a programmer it would be dumb to re-code something from scratch when you already have functions who basically work the same way.


Now all I'd need to do from there is sit down with the game designers and find ways to nest the slider's code into a set of coherent conditions that would trigger these functions. quick example: 

IF home.possession &gt; 65; 

DO 

home.passAccuracy -= 5;

away.shotAccuracy += 5.

home.keeperSkill -= 5;


(in programming, the += operation means to take the old value and add the value after the sign to it, so home.passAccuracy -= 5 basically; means home.passAccuracy = home.passAccuracy - 5;)

&amp;nbsp;

Someone already posted something where they realized that tweaking with sliders made the game feel like as if momentum/handicap kicked in.

&amp;nbsp;

In summary, as a programmer myself, IF I was to program momentum/handicap, that's how I'd do it, re-usable code.


But then again, it's just me.

5ltap0,1,2017-01-03,I hate my life because hardcore porn is so much more rewarding,gallagher222,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5ltap0/i_hate_my_life_because_hardcore_porn_is_so_much/,"But if I had known that my love for hardcore porn would make the rest of my life feel downright unpleasant, mean and shameful, I wouldn't have fallen in love with it, or rather, fallen in lust with it. 

Porn is a mental model of mine. Its an idea that I've sculpted for myself out of viewing probably like 20 000 hours of porn in my life (that's just a guess). Its a very comfortable model. I just snuggle into it and I feel like my spirit dances and sings and celebrates itself. 

But then I come into contact with other mental models and its not a fun time for me at all. My spirit basically cuts its own head off. And the worst part is, I used to function well with these sorts of models, but now I have such an intense hatred for them. I start an internship tomorrow with white collar business professionals and I know I'm going to have mental models thrown at me that I'm going to really hate and want to reject. Its not that there's anything wrong with these ideas on their own...but my deep obsession with pornography has made me totally unadaptive to them. 

Why change for the world when porn is so much fun? That's basically my dillemma. I know I have to change, and I have been changing by watching way less porn and jacking off way less than normal. I don't know how I got so addicted in the first place...I guess porn was just too rewarding to reject, y'know? 

My real life was a rewarding thing before porn. But porn trumped it in terms of how happy it could make me, so I gravitated into a porn world and abandoned all the other worlds that I lived in. Now when I have to go back to these worlds, I just feel guilty and ashamed of myself, because they are not my home anymore. I shouldn't be there. I'm a trespasser! 

That's basically what porn has done to me. It made me forget about my whole life and just be a masturbating nymphomaniac. And once I made that transition, I became a really dysfunctional person with not nearly enough interest in my surroundings to achieve much of anything. High-achievers are those who accept their surroundings, and trust them to be rewarding. I don't have that trust, because porn has rocked my world. 

Disengaging for the last 9 months has helped...but I'm still not a happy person generally. I guess I need more responsibilities to keep me focused and not always pining after all the pornography I could be watching. 

Nymphomania really closes a lot of doors in life. It makes consistent self-esteem hard.

I'm the only one that works on it or knows how to do anything involved with it. Not by choice, though. We are a small division of a large company, and most of our employees are electrical engineers. No one wants to learn about this particular project. I'll be leaving in a little over a month to start a new job since I just graduated college, and I want to leave some sort of guide for the next employee to take my place.

When I first started, I was handed bits and pieces of the project and told that no one knew anything about it. Luckily, after some time and a lot of effort, I figured it out. I'd like to prevent the next person from having to go through all of that wasted time.
I guess my question is: What should I include in this guide? Since I was a college student/intern, I'm sure it took me a lot longer to figure out the project than it would someone who is a professional, so I'm not sure what all types of information need to be included.

The project includes C#, .NET, MySql, IIS, and a few other related things."
5ltuj6,5,2017-01-03,I am 16 year old girl and I hate my dad.,Me_398,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ltuj6/i_am_16_year_old_girl_and_i_hate_my_dad/,"For most of my life, I have been treated like shit by my parents. My mentally ill mother emotionally abused me for years and I even developed depression as a result. I tried to commit suicide three times and was on anti psychotics and anti depressants for 3 years till 2015. My elder sister was the one who intervened and got my mother treatment. My dad did nothing to stop the abuse. Not only that, but I was homeschooled when I was 5 and the teacher would sexually abuse me. My mother was in the next room and she didn't even bother to check even once. When I finally got the courage to tell my parents, they just fired the teacher and sent me to school. No police report, nothing.

My dad has always been unsupportive and unreliable. He promised to hire me as an intern in his company. He lied, when I asked him about the internship, he brushed it off, never speaking of it ever again. He has never supported me in anything, never tells me that he loves me and lies to me constantly. He is also a hypocrite and loves shoving his religious beliefs down everyone's throats, irrespective of that person's religious beliefs. If I ever ask for his help, he just laughs at me, says he'll help me and never does. When I point that out, he says that he has done so much for me. Which is just bullshit. He is one of the reasons why I trust no one in this world and have difficulty forming other relationships. Whenever I accuse him of lying, he just screams at me to quiet me. Later, he'll ask me whether I actually think he is a liar, and when I say yes, he brushes it off and says: ""You're angry thats why you are saying that, you could never think like that.""

I have been working my ass off in school and am a straight A student. I want to go to college and get my degree so that I can moveout when I'm older, be independent and never have to contact my dad again. So today, my dad announces that he has raised the money for and is buying a new house. He then mentions college to me and says that I must get a scholarship and work to pay for my degree since he has to now spend his salary on himself. I reminded him that 100% scholarships are quite rare at undergrad level. He just tells me to not go to college then. Now it isn't that my dad hasn't got money. He does, but he'd rather spend it on a new house and himself rather than my education. Moreover, he expects me to pay him once I am employed as well. I ain't paying him shit.

This is very very depressing. It was basically a goal of mine to end up in a good university, which my dad has ruined. I am not eligible for loans. Nor will I be for financial aid since my dad owns quite a lot of money. My only hope is scholarship, which I doubt I'll be able to receive, especially 100%. My mom has always been on my dad's side also.

I honestly don't know what to do, I have lost the motivation to work hard and just dont want to study at all. What is even the point if I am not going to college after high school?

A combination of these factors and a few others have les me to believe thaf my dad is a egotistic, selfish cunt, who never cared about me in the first place.

Oh, and he is super religious, and loves shoving religion down my throat, which I couldn't care less about.

tl;dr I hate my dad who is a selfish, unsupportive cunt. He never reported the guy who sexually assaulted me as a child. He couldn't care less about my education either. "

Below is my profile for review, I also have some general questions at the bottom of the post. Thank you for your time. 


**Background**


* Work experience: 1 Year internship at top tech firm during undergrad, 4 years of full time work experience at largest Canadian Telecom Company ($15 billion USD in annual Revenue) with one promotion. 
* Extra curriculars: ARCT Diploma in Piano Performance from RCM, Amateur Stand up Comedian for a few months (I have some stuff on youtube), Various leadership roles in student groups in undergrad, plan to do some relevant volunteering between now and time of application.
* Undergrad school/major: Top Canadian University (University of Toronto), Specialist in Commerce, major in Human Biology
* Other education/coursework: n/a
* Race/nationality: Canadian born Asian (Vietnamese)
* Sex: Male


**Stats**


* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): Have not taken, based on friends who have I am aiming for a 730 or equivalent. May want to take GRE. 
* Undergrad GPA: 3.46/4.00 (3.5/4.0)


**MBA Info**


*Goal of MBA: To transition my career into the sustainability sector as well as make a geographical change to the USA. Ideally either in corporate sustainability or sustainability/environmental consulting. 


* Target schools: Reach -  Fuqua MBA/MEM dual degree;  Ross MBA/MS Environment, Yale MBA/MEM. 
* Potential Target: Rice University MBA/PSM. 
* Safeties: ???


**General questions:** 

1. Are there other programs I should consider? Perhaps traditional 2 year MBA's with a environment/sustainability focus? 

2. If I decide to target Dual Degree programs, would the GRE or GMAT be more appropriate? I'm leaning towards GRE right now because Rice's PSM does not accept GMAT but all of the other MBA's listed above do accept GRE. 

3. In general are dual degree programs harder to get into vs traditional MBA's? 


Thank you for your time /r/mba, best of luck to those currently in the application process.


Cheers,

I currently attend a community college and will be graduating in this upcoming December (2017) with my AA in Computer Science.  I will then transfer to a University to finish my BS in Computer Science.

I will be working the rest of the internship while going to classes and I'm expecting 21 hours a week at $18/hr.  I recently paid off all debt that I had and I am gathering an emergency fund.

I am living with my parents and they have agreed to pay for the full cost of my community college and to help me with the cost of university. 

After achieving an emergency fund in a savings account should I put money into a CD set to mature when my first university tuition is due (January 2018) or put the money into an IRA?"

What do?,provobrony,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lu6r0/ive_just_been_assigned_an_intern_to_mentor_what_do/,"I'm a developer at a large-ish company, and I have been here for about a year. I also just found out that they would like for me to mentor an intern for the next semester they are here. I have two different questions for the two different groups that hang out here:

  1. Interns: Do you have a mentor? If you do, what do they do that you like? What don't you like? Is there anything you wish your mentor would do?

    a. Female interns only: The intern I have been assigned is the only female intern, and will be the only female developer on the team. Is there anything I should do or look out for to help her in this regard?
   
  2. Intern mentors: What was the best thing you did for the intern? How did you approach things that the intern needed to change in code? Any advice?

Other potentially relevant background info: I was at another software company prior to this, for ~5 years. Her future alma mater and my degree come from the same school, same department. In the brief 5 mins I met her today, I worry that her interests aren't totally aligned with my teams current projects.

**Edit:** Holy  cow I think this is the most feedback I have EVER gotten on any Reddit post. Thank you all so so much! You helped me crystallize many of my initials inclinations and thoughts (and gave me some new ones). Feeling much more confident and ready.  I'll make sure to do a follow-up post after the internship with some consolidated things I learned."

I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. 

I've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.

This has definitely colored my opinion of what I deserve to be paid, and as I enter the time in my life where I am receiving offers, they all seem extremely disappointing. 

I went to an average school and did extremely well, and have had many internships and what not, as well as 1 year of full-time non-internship experience. I'm about to finish my MS in CS. Let me emphasize that last point, I'd expect to be paid considerably more because I have both experience and an MS. Even before I decided to do my MS I was disappointed by the offers, for example I had a 55k offer in a small city, and a 60k offer in Austin, Texas. I just received an offer from a large tech company in a large city (I'd rather not disclose either for the sake of anonymity), it was a $71k offer. That is more money that I ever could have imagined, but I'm still disappointed. I expected more given my experience and MS. Do I just lower my expectations? How do I find out if this is actually reasonable. According to Glassdoor, the SE's at this company make 90k+. And I'm not sure CoL is a great way to gauge if it's a decent offer.

Has anyone had an experience like this, where this subreddit made you think you'd make way more than you actually wound up getting offered?"

I'm currently seeking an entry level job in digital marketing. I graduated from college with a 3.0 in business management and a focus in marketing, as well as two different marketing internships and a few marketing roles in university clubs. I have some experience in HTML5 and CSS3, intermediate level understanding of Search Engine Optimization, and experience in Facebook Advertising and Google AdWords. I've also written some (incomplete) books over the past couple years, so I'm a fairly strong writer. 

I'm currently trying to learn advanced techniques on how to use Excel- I'm reading books about how to leverage Excel for market analysis and basic data science techniques, and I'm taking some online courses for it as well (pivot tables, conditional formatting, vlookups, etc.). I was wondering if you believe this is where I should currently be focusing my attention?

I'm highly interested in getting involved in data science in the future (maybe in 3-4 years after I've gained enough knowledge in that area). Should I be focused on learning Excel, SQL and web analytics to move myself in that direction? Or should I be learning things like JavaScript, JQuery, Photoshop, advanced SEO/SEM techniques, etc. in order to turn myself into a more hire-able candidate for general digital marketing roles? I am searching for an entry-level job after all, so I need to be willing to take any role available. 

Any advice about what hiring managers might want is much appreciated. Also, if you know of anyone hiring, I would love to hear about it ;) Thanks everybody!"

I'm wondering if there's a way for me to negotiate without other offers on the table I was planning on referring to the average intern salary in Boston/ refer to other companies.

tl;dr I want to negotiate my intern wage from 20-25$ an hour in Boston because I'll be commuting in by train every day, and 20 seems low for Boston. No other offers on table ATM.

Need a bit more advice.

I graduated University a few months ago and was having a bit of a hard time finding a job. My husband was in the military before I finished my degree so I moved a lot and never got to do any internships. I still had a 3.77 GPA with a Math degree which is very competitive, but the lack of internships hurt me.

Eventually I started slipping into a bit of a funk because I didn't like waking up every day to do nothing while my husband went to both work and school so I started applying for a LOT of jobs that were less of where I wanted to be. I started working for a bank back in early November as a credit analyst.

Here's where it gets frustrating. Back in September I met with a company at the University career fair and we really hit it off. He told me he was only authorized to hire interns at the time but that he would like to keep a resume and bring me up at their next quarterly meeting.

They just emailed me asking me to formally apply for a position with them. I'm concerned about a couple of things. I don't want them to think I'm flighty and just jumping from one job to the next, and I also don't want them to base their salary offer off of my current position. On the application where it asks for the reason I'm leaving my current job it only has room for like 15 characters so I said to see the attached document and this is what I've got so far. I'd love some critiques.

&gt;HR,

&gt;In the formal application process I was asked why I am interested in leaving my current position to pursue a position with NEW JOB. The answer is simple, I met RECRUITER at a career fair at the UNIVERSITY and we spoke about career opportunities at NEW JOB. RECRUITER did a wonderful job of explaining the culture you offer, the career possibilities that are available, and the challenging aspect of the work to be done. These things resonated with me and I have been interested in a career opportunity with NEW JOB ever since. When I was approached and invited to apply for this position I felt like it was too good of an opportunity to pass up considering how well I felt I would do in that environment.


&gt;Additionally, while I am very thankful to my current employer I am currently working in a role that does not require, nor make use of, my degree. I feel as though I have worked very diligently to learn a very particular skill set and that my skills are not being utilized to their potential in my current position.

&gt;Best,

&gt;NAME

Is it inappropriate to mention my current position not using my degree like that? I don't want to just say I'm leaving because I don't make enough money, but I'm currently making $30k/yr at my job and BLS says entry level for this new position is $46k/yr and with my competitive GPA I'm confident I could push for $50k/yr. Or at least I'm confident I could do that if I hadn't just told them I accepted a job paying $30k/yr. That's why I made the comment about my current job not using my degree.

Does that seem reasonable?

And for that matter, like I said the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the bottom 10% of incomes for this line of work in my state in $46k/year. The average GPA for a college graduate in 3.1, and mine is 3.77. I think that being ~22% above the average GPA (and that gets bigger when you account for STEM degrees since they are almost universally lower) is enough to argue for a slightly higher salary and this is how I had planned on doing so.

&gt;In my research I found the average entry level salary for POSITIONS in the oil and natural gas industry in CITY to be roughly $45,500/year. Comparing my GPA to the average college graduate GPA you will see I am nearly 22% above the average GPA, and the gap only gets larger when you account for my holding a STEM degree. I believe that the potential and the diligence I have shown in my undergraduate studies are enough to justify what is roughly a 10% higher salary than my peers. Obviously this is negotiable.

That would obviously come out if we arrived at the salary negotiations stage of an offer, but am I crazy to things that's doable? 

Thanks for any help guys."

So during the off-days during these past holiday weeks, I decided to start looking for an internship required by my university. I started filling out information forms on several sites and sending out my CV to the companies that looked promising. 

On December 29th I got a call from a recruiter from one of the best companies in my area about my application. According to her, everything I sent was perfect and she just made the call to clarify some minor details. She told me all that was left to do was to get my schedule to be able to work out my hours with my university courses, and to have the in-person interview. She told me that work would start at the beginning of March.

I mentioned that my schedule might be a little weird because I would be taking classes from the course one year ahead of mine to lessen the load later, and that I'd send it to her via email as soon as we finished the call. Anyways, I did just that. Now, I might just be nervous or anxious because I would really like to be an intern at this company, but I sent that email on December 29th and have still not received an answer. I understand that we are still in holiday season and she might not be back at work yet, but I'm assuming even if my schedule doesn't work out with them, they'd let me know through email, right? 

I know it's only been a couple of days and I should just wait and see what happens, but should I send another email at some point to see what's the status on the whole issue? If so, how long should I wait for this? 

I probably sound really desperate but the truth is it's my first chance at an internship and the fact that it could be at a good company has me racking my mind a bit. "

I'm starting with a local B4 this July, and I'm in the middle of filling out my new hire information form. The form asks for my industry preferences.

During my internship, I worked extensively with some of my firm's government clients. I enjoyed the experience, and definitely got along well with my manager and seniors. My manager asked me at the end of my summer internship if I'd like to work with her and the rest of the team upon starting FT and of course I said yes.

Do exit opportunities from public accounting differ significantly for auditors who work on extensively on government clients? Are you likely to be pigeonholed to working for the government upon leaving public accounting? After taking advanced accounting this semester, I've learned that governmental and fund accounting are quite unique, and I would hate to limit future job opportunities in other industries, as I don't see myself working in government down the line.

I'd really appreciate any insight!

I am a university student, but I feel that I still A LOT to learn, and don’t know that much in comparison to my peers. There are so many things I want to learn, but I have no idea where to start. (I want to learn: ML, iOS – Swift, C++, Python)
My biggest problem is sticking to a certain topic when I encounter a problem/something I do not know about.
For example when I start learning about a certain topic and I encounter something that I do not know about I get frustrated when I cannot find a solution even after a VERY long time. And because of this I loose a lot of time and do not learn much. I think I am trying to dive into too advanced topics quickly without having the basics figured out. After one year of university I am still incapable of building something useful. I do get perfect marks at university, but I am lost at hackathons, or during internships etc. 

Another issue are also coding challenges – I got sent so many challenges to do from companies. But I was incapable of completing even a single one properly. 

What should I learn and how should I learn it?

My end goal is: I want to become a bright programmer who is able to pick up new technologies very fast, can quickly understand problems and come up with solutions to them. I want to be able to build stuff at hackathons, personal projects etc. I really love technology – it is my whole life, but I want to stop reading about what great people have done and actually do something great myself. 

*Is there any “roadmap” for a computer scientist (What should I know to become good)?
*How do I know when I am going to fast and skipping over material?
*How do others learn from zero?
*How much time should I be spending on such problems?

I am not afraid of working hard, I just don’t want to be in a situation where I do not understand problems just because I do not know the basics. Furthermore I am not sure if knowing what to learn and how to learn are really my main issues – has anybody experienced any similar situations? 

Thank you all in advance :) "

Im graduating in May with with BA in Economics from a major university, but not really known for academics.


I started out college at a community college after barely passing high school, my first year of community college i did okay. I got Bs and Cs. Second year i did terrible but my first year was decent enough to get me into a university. I went there for a semester and failed every class but one. Wrote a long letter and explained everything and my GPA was 2.5 and somehow transferred again and got a major university to accept me. First semester here i got a 1.9 and almost failed out again. At that point in my life i realized i needed to either leave college because i was wasting my time, or buck the hell up and be a responsible person and get my shit together. I chose the latter. After that semester i tried to get into the business school for marketing and but my GPA wasnt good enough so i went with a major that was 3 minors. One of my minors i picked was Economics. I took econ classes and finally had found my passion. I went to school for 2.5 years straight, 6 classes each semester, and then 4 classes also in the summer for 2 summers straight and worked my ass off get into the business college for Economics. Since i hit that crossroads in my life i got above 3.25 every single semester (i know not the best, but for me it was a huge achievement) and got my GPA up to a 2.72. Since i switched majors, transferred between three schools, and took classes every summer i never had a real chance to get an internship related to Econ and now im graduating in May and super stressed about finding a job.


I have applied to about 100-125 jobs so far for analysts, underwriter, and really anything related and heard nothing back from anyone. Ive contacted my professors trying to ask if they know of any research, or analytical opportunities next semester that could bolster my resume (still waiting to hear back). Ive worked many hours perfecting my resume with the critiquing of people from all over the internet. Have learned skills like SQL and im working on STATA now. I feel like im trying to do all the right stuff but i just dont know where to go from this point on. If i got an interview i think could try to tell someone my story and show them how this industry practically turned around my life but i cant get any calls back i assume becuase i have no experience. 

I really just feel like im at a dead end, i dont know what to do or how to go about breaking into the financial industry and i just need some guidance from someone. If anyone could give me any advice on where to go from here i would greatly appreciate it."

I'm currently entering my last semester at a small state school in southern California. I, like a lot of us here, am worried that I haven't set myself up properly to break into the software dev scene. I don't have any programming experience outside of school, and I've just discovered (with ~90% certainty) that I'll be moving to Alabama come July.

After searching for ""Computer Science"", ""Software Engineering"", ""Software Developer"", and ""Software Development"", it's pretty evident that there isn't much within 30 miles of my future home town. I do have 5 years experience in IT, but the point of school was to get away from that.

I have two questions:

* Regardless of location, what's the most realistic thing I can do to beef up my resume? Spring internships seem to be scarce and I've been getting conflicting info about contributing to projects on GitHub and OpenHatch.

* Should I get a jump start on freelancing/remote work or hold out for a ""normal"" software dev position?

When they all came on, we were a cohesive unit, and we'd all get lunch together every day, talk about our days every morning, and sometimes even hang out on the weekends.

Around June, I started noticing the three of my (five) coworkers would go out to lunch together without me, but I ignored it because I had just gotten diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumor and figured they might just have assumed I brought my own lunch. My birthday passed in June and no one even asked to go out for my birthday and none of them acknowledged it. Meanwhile, for any of my other coworkers' birthdays, they always go out to lunch and then have cake.

Throughout the rest of the summer, they'd have happy hours every Friday during work hours, and sit around and drink while I'd work and then go out to bars after. They never invited me.

In August, one of my coworkers had a wedding. I wasn't invited. Everyone else in my entire office of 80 was invited, including the temporary interns. He was the coworker I was closest with.

In September, I had a seizure at work. Since I hadn't taken a lunch break and it was a Friday and the two people above me had already left, I told everyone under me I was going home early since I didn't feel well. They ratted me out and called the big boss and told him I left early and I was told to come back immediately. I defriended them all on Facebook since we were obviously not remotely friends anymore. No one asked me about my health when I came back the next day.

In November, I got offered a new job. I put in my two weeks notice--and then the job fell threw that following Monday. Everyone asked me ""So when are you leaving?"" and ""Good riddance"" after they had heard. When I told them it fell through, they made jokes about how this is as far as I'll ever go in my career.

Since then, they've all refused to say hello to me in the morning even though I say hello and ask them how they're doing. They refuse to say goodbye to me when I leave. They refuse to talk to me at all. During our Christmas decorating contest, they didn't even let me get involved. And today, they had a meeting about ""the future of the department"" and just so happened to forget to invite me. They also all decided to get a special training I've been BEGGING for the entire time I've been here, and just decided not to let me in on the bulk del.

Not a single person even said a single word to me today in my entire department.

It's really hurting my ability to do my job since I commute 2 hours each way just to have everyone treat me like shit all day long. My morale is shot, and even my big boss noticed it during my review and didn't give me a raise because I don't ""build good relationships with coworkers."" I needed that raise to move out of an apartment with a cockroach infestation. I'm also third in command where I work, and when the two people above me leave, people just straight up refuse to send me their work for me to approve which reflects poorly on me.

TL;DR Coworkers are excluding me from everything and refuse to even acknowledge my existence. It's making me feel like shit."

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies of the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past their shrill laughter.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too. But one day, a fellow partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

It's late one night, and it feels like all the partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You saunter into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, and I’m the only person in the room. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and I can’t seem to reach the plate from the top shelf, even in my heels. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I stretch. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

And then you notice the lipstick.

The company I'm doing the internship for will want me writing scripts to automate testing. I don't know a lot about QA work, just that it's testing the developers software for bugs, exploits, etc. I have a relatively small amount of coding knowledge, but I do know java basics, python basics, and I just bought a book to teach me JavaScript. I'm a high schooler, I had the opportunity to shadow the developers last summer, and they liked me and said they'd love for me to do an internship on QA work this upcoming summer, so here I am. 

Questions:
1. What should I expect on the first day on the job? 

2. What programming languages are used to automate testing? How much do I need to know to get by?


3. I believe at the company I'm doing the internship for, they use Jtester. I'm not sure what that is or how to get access to it. Help? :D


4. What resources should I use to prepare me for this internship?


5. How do I get access to the developers code? Might sound like a dumb question but I have no experience in QA. 


6. I've never had an office job before. What should I expect in terms of the office environment? As an intern, how should I avoid pissing off my coworkers, and what are common mistakes interns usually make?


Any help will be much appreciated. I'm looking to prepare for this internship the best I can. Thanks!"

5lyuni,3,2017-01-04,"3rd year Mechanical Engineering student who has been planning on ID for grad school, could totally use some advice, lots of questions!",VivaLaShaggy,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/5lyuni/3rd_year_mechanical_engineering_student_who_has/,"Hey there, everyone! Happy New Year! :D

So the title is pretty much the tl;dr, but here's my sitch~ ! (I'm sorry I just scrolled up to apologize for the length of this post and I'm not done writing yet, oops)

I'm currently a 3rd year mechanical engineering student at one of the top 10 schools in the nation to do so. Do I love it? Not exactly, I don't really live for the equations and things like ""an advanced study mechanical vibrations"" don't exactly get me going. Regardless, I'm wrapping up and am totally decided in finishing this degree. To leave from my particular school with an ME just holds so much value that, if nothing else, being able to have it in my back pocket going through the rest of my life was important to me. I'm expecting to leave here with something around a 3.0 GPA. Not the greatest, I'm definitely going to try and get every point I can, but that's my realistic projection. 

Equally important to me; however, was that I could go on to become one of the best Industrial Designers ever (cue evil laughter). I am certified in SolidWorks, and have been filling journals with my designs since I was in about 5th grade. And for me, it just ""made sense"" that if I wanted to produce designs that were holistic in nature, that I should receive a complete education in engineering. Leaving here, I will have an understanding of mechanics, materials science, etc. that is beyond any field of comparison to (most) any ID student, and probably a lot of people in industry, too.

Last summer (the summer of my sophomore year) I landed an internship at a startup in San Francisco. I had an incredible time there, and as a person who has lived in many countries all around the world, I found a place that really felt like home. Everything about the culture clicked, the people were fantastic, and I found a place where I fit in. Great stuff. I was invited to return to this internship for a second summer before I had even finished working there, and even last week had companies that I'd networked with asking if I'd be interested in interning with them (presumably/hopefully with implications of work after college).

So, here comes the start of my hold ups.

-&gt; I really want to stay as close to (in) the Bay Area when pursuing Industrial Design. And I guess as a precursor to this statement, I don't want to let go of pursuing that major (is that naive of me?) The further I get into my mechanical education, the more I feel that an ID education would be more personally fulfilling. I'm aware that, especially as far as start ups go, I could probably or at least eventually land a job where my work is heavily focused on design. But I do want to experience an education where I am in a classroom and every day ""the light goes off,"" and I'm inspired and motivated and compelled and driven to do work from within; not just trying to make myself understand formulae that span multiple lines and multiple alphabets haha. I feel like I owe it to myself, and in the ""grand scheme of life,"" another couple years when I'm only 21 to be able to formally call myself both a Mechanical Engineer and an Industrial Designer could open up awesome opportunities for me-- maybe even startups of my own sooner than I'd think.

---&gt; Staying in the Bay Area means that there are /no/ accredited Industrial Design schools that offer a Master's program. In my research, I've seen that some universities (like Auburn, for example) offer a Master's program in ID where those matriculating from holding another degree can complete a certain amount of credit hours in the BS program to give them the skills they need to move on to the MS program. I'm very attracted to this idea because I don't know if spending four years and gaining another BS degree is ""worth it""? I'm going to draft an email to the department heads at SJSU after this post, but would it be plausible/possible that a university could tailor an MS ID program for me, given my Mechanical Engineering background?

-----&gt; To continue that thought, would it be worth it for me to even consider receiving a second BS degree? Would some of the credits I've received in my education thus far (humanities requirements, countless STEM classes), possibly accelerate this BS degree? What would financial aid opportunities look like for me? As a college graduate, would I be competitive as a Mechanical Engineer with a ~3.0 GPA from a leading university, and would my work experience be relevant? Would they even care about my SAT Scores ?(they were pretty good)

----------&gt; Besides being totally in love with the area, I want to stay near the Bay because I'm sure that the networking I've been so fortunate to start will only continue. My ""dream proposal"" to a successful startup would be working for them full/part time as resident engineer/brains/collaborator/designer while completing my second degree, and then being on contract to work for them for x years afterwards. Is this kind of thing feasible, or would it really be in my best interest to explore other options? Would an official MS degree even if I could finagle an MS program from a university that doesn't offer one be more valuable to me/more worthwhile/more valuable to employers? In one sense, I really, really want to be able to say I have a Master's if I'm spending the additional time in higher education. But on the other, Industrial Design is something I want to truly ground and develop my skills in. I don't want to ""rush it"" at the cost of losing out on additional opportunities deepen my craft. But again, as a Mechanical Engineer who does a lot of design work in my free time (and has been on many project teams where we design x y or z to meet certain needs and be within certain constraints, along with my internship) it's not like design is a foreign concept to me and I hope/expect my ME education to deepen the potential &amp; gravity of my designs. 


---------------------&gt; What schools would you recommend, regardless of location and also taking it into account? Given my desire to be in the Bay Area, I've read extensively that San Jose State University has a really good Industrial Design program (unfortunately, they don't have a Master's program). I've also been reading about California College of the Arts which is located in an even more prime Oakland/San Francisco, but I have reservations (are they valid?) about going through an ID program that is BA versus BS. They also do not offer an Master's program that is specifically ID, but have one for design. Any insight on either of these two schools? And others?

Any additional advice anyone could throw at me would be great as well. Again, sorry about the wall of text hahah. Take it easy everyone, and thanks in advance :) "

The job is not as big-exposure as I wanted, but as an entry level graduate, I'll take anything that has the title I want that I can get. During the interview process, the manager explained there is currently a temp-worker in the position and that they would ultimately have to decide if hiring me was a good choice over keeping him/her on staff. 

Fast forward to my second interview, and his boss was now the one asking questions. She said she had received outstanding reviews from my former managers and even an executive I worked under during my internship, and I felt this was very positive news. (I feel that networking plays a huge role in this company) It has led me to believe they may be leaning towards hiring me over the temp. 
After being told that they would be making the decision after the holiday season, I'm expecting to receive a phone call regarding that decision today and am having serious anxiety about the outcome.

5lzpe8,73,2017-01-04,TIFU by getting my mother's car towed during a hookup,tonybenwhite,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5lzpe8/tifu_by_getting_my_mothers_car_towed_during_a/,"Obligatory ""this actually happened 3 years ago"" preface. I had just moved to Florida on an internship with Disney. I previously lived in Washington state, which outside the city limits of Seattle, is actually a VERY conservative and gay-intolerant state. So, until this point, I was straight because everyone around me was likewise too scared to be gay, and so there was no opportunity to even entertain the idea of experimenting.

Orlando was an entirely shiny new world, and I learned I'm actually gay as fuck. I can't deny that I was a little promiscuous with my newfound sexuality in the beginning; imagine never tasting sugar until you were 21. I learned of new things I never would have believed existed, and one of those things was Grindr. If you're unaware, it's the gay version of Tinder, and the main goal is no-strings-attached hookups. Literally 9 out of 10 guys would agree to fuck an avocado if it hit them up on this app, and I'm a pretty attractive guy.

It's winter time now, and I'm boarding my plane to visit family for the holidays, and by this point, logging onto Grindr is just force of habit. There's two guys in my terminal, both of which were too busy for a quicky, none on my plane, and an incredibly hot and tattooed man working for Chicago's TSA during my layover, which unfortunately only lasted for 20 minutes and I wasn't about to get stranded in Illinois. By this point, I've been teased with chat, pictures, and dozens of profiles I rifled through during my 9 hour flight, and was crazy horny by the time I got to WA.

It was a redeye flight, so I landed around noon in SEATAC, and my mother drove me home. We have to pass through a town called Tacoma in order to get to my hometown, and I was in the backseat with my face glued to Grindr the entire way. I was hit up by an incredibly hot guy while passing through Tacoma, and my mind would not have me spend this afternoon any other way. I immediately made plans with my friends from a town next to Tacoma to give me plausible reason to drive back out of town later that afternoon, and I borrowed my mothers car to do so.

I made it back to Tacoma, spent a few hours catching up with my friend, and then set off to hook up with this guy. Sparing you the details, it was a subpar fuck, the guy looked nothing like his profile picture, I suspected it was 'shopped, so I called him out on it before I go. As I'm leaving, I walk out into his complex' parking, and my mother's car (a very conspicuous, periwinkle Scion xB) is gone.

I have to go back and knock on the guy's door after basically telling him he ain't that pretty, and he's all smiles like ""did you leave your car in covered parking?"" I had. He told me it was reserved parking and tow trucks are pretty efficient in Tacoma. He wasn't completely heartless, he gave me a ride to the tow lot and asked if I needed him to stick around until I figured it out, but I was pretty embarrassed so I sent him away. By this time it was 6PM, and considered ""after hours"" for the tow lot. When I called the office, the lady who answered informed me the tow fee would be $240 plus a $90 after-hours service fee to call a worker out to the lot to retrieve my car and process my pickup. 

At this point, I *refused* to admit to my mother that any of this happened, and so I was ready to pay any fee to get the car back and be home on time. I agree, and the man (*who was inside the office the entire time.......*) unlocked the door to let me in. We processed the claim, he gave me the keys to grab the registration from the car glove box, and took my ID. Midway through the paperwork, he stops dead and looks between me and the ID. He informs me that I'm not legally authorized to retrieve the car because I'm not on the registration of the vehicle, and the only person who can pick it up is K, my mother.

At this point I'm shitting my pants because my mother is going to wonder why my car was towed by a Tacoma company when the friend I'm supposed to be visiting lives in Olympia. I call my sister because I'm desperate for a solution. I give her my story, leaving out the fact that I was on a bootycall, just that I was trapped after visiting a friend. Unfortunately she answered on speaker phone, and my mother was actually with her.

As expected, my mother flew off the handle and screamed at me for a solid 5 minutes while I'm sitting in front of the guy in the office. He tells me I need to leave if I'm not able to pick it up, he's not going to wait around all night for me to figure out my shit, so I pack up and go. My sister, mother, and I go around in circles for another hour trying to figure out how I'm going to get her car off the lot without forcing her to call into work (she works night shift) and driving two hours out to Tacoma.

In the end, my sister, who is a branch manager at a credit union, gets her notary coworker to fax a notarized letter of consent for my mother to release the car to me at 9PM at night, and I have to pay cash because they won't accept a card payment unless it's in K's name. So I call the dispatch, they confirm (rather unbelievably) that they received my notarized release letter, and told me it would be ANOTHER $90 for another after-hour pickup session, bringing the total up to $420. I get $500 cash from an ATM, pick up the car, and I'm finally on my way home.

I NEVER told anyone that I had basically paid $420 for a hookup until today, and from that day, all promiscuous behavior ceased, and the very thought of hookups leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

tl;dr I discovered I was gay, went sex-crazy, got stranded in a random city after getting my mother's car towed during a hookup, and had to pay $420 to get home.

EDIT: All things considered, I'm happy I learned this lesson through monetary punishment, rather than contracting some STD as a result of my promiscuity."

5lzwxv,7,2017-01-04,Worst. Tinderdate. Ever.,Shoggothlicious,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/5lzwxv/worst_tinderdate_ever/,"As Asha walked briskly towards Carl Cederströms gata and the bus stop, she cursed herself for stupidly going on a date so far from home and not driving. She’d had reservations about going all the way to Vikingstad for a date but the idea of a homemade meal and a nice evening of wine and conversation had won her over. 

The evening had started nicely enough. The house was old but roomy, built in classical 70’s architecture. The first hint of the evening to come had been the fact that her date hadn’t asked the housemates to find something else to do that evening. So she ended up having dinner with a group of friends who were all intimately aware that she was one a date with one of them. SÄPO would have been proud of the subtle but intensive questioning she went through during the half-hour they spent eating. 

One of the main reasons she’d agreed to the date was that Emil had somehow managed to get a pre-release copy of Rogue One. Christmas had been hard on her wallet as usual, so when she saw an opportunity to watch it and maybe get laid afterwards she finally agreed to the 35 minute busride. But in the spirit of the evening the power had gone out just as the movie started and she had ended up enduring two hours of Caracssonne with a group of friends that knew eachother well, some decent red wine, and an awkward date that drank too much too fast and got grabby be the end of the evening. So, not a success. What really rankled was that Lisa, one of the cool girls there, first wanted to play Netrunner but her date didn’t want to «bore her with that nerd stuff». 

All of which led up to her walking towards a buss stop in the asscrack of nowhere with wind strong enough to almost drown out the music from her airbuds and make lighting a cigarette one of the twelve labors of Hercules. She was nearing the stop and lo and behold, of course it was only a sign with nod goddamn shed to be seen anywhere. In addition to that there was a huge warehouse or something on the opposite side of the road, with a big deserted parking lot and large black windows leading to god only knew. Great, so this was where she was gonna get abducted, raped and killed. That seemed like a fitting end to a shit evening. 

Struggling to light a cigarette and absorbed in her own thoughts the metallic clink to her side, loud enough to bull through the lyrics to «November Rain» and wind rushing trhrough the trees on all sides of her. Turning her head she saw a man, a fucking gargantuan man, leaning on the sign with the buss schedule and lighting a cigarette with the biggest goddamn Zippo she’d ever seen. He angled it towards her in a questioning motion and she gratefully stepped over to him and got her own fag lit. 

The first feeling of nicotine hitting her system was a welcome reprieve from a shitty evening. The only thing to lean against was the sign, so she just walked the two metres back to where she’d been originally standing. The giant said something that gave her an excuse to turn towards him she gratefully took. She pointed to her airbuds and said «Slash guitar solo» which elicited a grunt and a nod from him. Her lucky star must be out above the cloud cover somewhere. Settling on her heels, she halfheartedly studied the man most likely to be voted Bar Brawler of the year. 

Whenever his cigarette lighted him up for a moment she got an opportunity to study him. The dude was huge, at least 2 metres tall and probably more, her own 160 cm didn’t give her the best possibility of accurately judging the height of someone at least three heads taller than her. He was built like an ox, broad shoulders and huge arms straining against the fabric of his thick leather jacket. There was a bit of a gut bulging the t-shirt he wore, but it was the kind of gut you saw on a dockworker or logger, not the kind her classmates spending time on League of Legends or Guild Wards had. A working man’s gut, hint of a beer belly over hard muscle. His jeans were ripped, not classy ripped like on the babes studying economy or marketing, but ripped from use and shoddily patched up.

Her skin suddenly felt to tight. Her throat tightened and cold sweat ran down the small of her back as fear-fueled adrenaline hit her system. He was wearing heavy combat boots, the old model from before the military got lightweight new gore-tex boots. And the laces were snow-white. Experience kept her from showing she’d noticed in any substantial way but she quickly dropped her cigarette just to be sure. No need to let the ember at the tip of the cigarette show him her hands were shaking. She wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction. 

She noticed the lights from the bus before she heard it. They lit the giant up as it turned the intersection and came rolling up from behind her. In her hypersensitive state of fear it felt as if time had slowed down. He had long curly red hair spilling down his shoulders, a massive red beard and a scruffy ‘stache that didn’t connect in the middle. That made her chuckle, must be a source of constant frustration for him. He was wearing a hoodie under a well-worn, scuffed black leather jacked that looked solid enough to stop a bullet. A band hoodie she noted, some black metal group called Arghoslent, and if she hadn’t gotten braindamage from her furiously frustrating evening some kind of black metal judging from the font and vaguely apocalyptic scene on it. Any hope she’d been fostering that he wasn’t dangerous died when she saw his gloves. Black leather, with a raised ridge over the back of the hand and knuckles. Her brother had owned a pair just like that when he was a bouncer at Studenterhuset. Those raised ridges were filled with heavy sand, designed to give extra weight to a blow and proctect the users knuckles. 

Still trembling slightly she boarded the relative safety of the bus. Of course a traveling bunch of off-duty police, security guards or a squad of fallskärmjägare was too much the hope for. Instead there was a little old lady on the bus, sitting in the back. She looked like someones slighly racist old grandmother, the kind o fold lady that was skeptical of everyone not born where she could see them from her living room window. A grandmother you’d see during holidays, the kind that made seven kinds of lovely little biscuits and then complained about all the black people in the big city. Not the blacks in her neighbourhood mind you, just the ones in the big city. And ISIS, she probably held a dim view of ISIS as a whole. All cookies and the subtle racism old people seemed to pick up somewhere. 
  
At least nobody had shit on the row of seats when she got down. That at least was a small favor. She decided she was safe, the busdriver would probably call the police if the unfriendly giant decided to murder her. He hadn’t bothered to check her ticket or even look at her when she climbed aboard, but surely he wouldn’t be able to ignore a dude the size of a well-fed grizzly tearing a university student to pieces a few rows back. Finally getting her pulse under control, her Fitbit informed her she was down to only 120 bpm, she settled in her seat and tried to relax. Only a 20 minute ride to town and then she’d find some friends at a pub and drown the frustrations of the evening in Lapin Kulta. Of course there wasn’t a Pokestop in sight, that would have been too much to ask for during a double candy event. Fuck this evening. Fuck it to bits in a bad way.
 
She leaned back towards the window and pulled her feet up, planning to doze her way through «Wrong side of Heaven» and maybe even the next song, whatever that turned out to be. She was halfway through the song when she noticed she was freezing. Opening her eyes she saw her breath fog as she exhaled. That wasn’t right, why was the bus colder than outside? A timid shriek pushed its way up her throat when a hand shout out from between the seats and caught her forearm in an iron grip. She tried to tear her arm loose but the thin, liver-spotted fingers clenched so hard she could hear her bones creak. She wanted to scream but all that came out was a sob of pain. She twisted enough to get one foot on the floor, partially getting out of her seat and turning to the old lady. Her mind screamed her that being violent to an obviously mentally ill octogenarian was wrong, but she screaming pain from her forearm overrode it and she puncher her as hard as she could. Pain from the impact shot up her forearm and there was an audible crack she would later swear she heard inside her skull as her knucles and wrist fractured from the force of the blow. 

That punch should have dazed even the giant, but the old lady didn’t even flinch. Her other arm shot out from under what Asha could now see was a tattered floral-patterned coat that must have once been red but was now faded to a washed-out pink with flowers the color of toilet bowls on it. The old bitch now had her left arm gripped tightly in both of her and she was pulling her towards her with a force Asha couldn’t hope to resist. Terrified and with pain blackening her vision she screamed as loudly as she could and desperately towards the bus driver. He didn’t even turn his head. She turned back and punched the old bird in the face again and nearly blacked out from pain for her efforts. Bile rose in her throat and she did the only thing her panicked mind could think of, she leaned forwards and emptied the contents of her stomach into the face of her attacker. 

The bitch didn’t let og or pull back, and Asha felt the first flutters of pure terror when she didn’t even try to get the vomit out of her eyes. Cold black dread took over for terror when a too-long tongue slipped out between old, chapped lips and licked flecks of vomit from Ashas own lips. The touch of it felt like room-temperature fish guts and the smell was like rotting entrails. Screaming, Asha drew her ace in the hole from her pocked with trembling fingers. It was a small knife with a wicked blade, a Spyderco something-something her brother had given her when she enlisted. She jabbed it fiercely into the cheek of whatever-the-fuck was holding her and was rewarded with a slapt that made her vision go black and loosened at least two teeth. Her eyes filled with involuntary tears and she was suddenly too dizzy to reach for the knife again. 

And suddenly the bitch let her go. Blinking through the tears she saw Mr.Colossal pump his right fist into the face of the old monster one, two, three times before she leapt out of her seat at him. He intercepted her with his left arm, grasping the front of her coat while he pivoted and smashed her through the window on the other side of the aisle. Asha heard a ripping sound and the giant roared in pain again before turning on his heels and smashing the creature through the window right beside her. She again gagged as foul-smelling blood spattered her face and the front of her jacket but managed to force it down. The huge dude smashed the old horror against the security glass showing bus routed until it broke, then smashed her into the roof and onto the floor. All this, Asha noted, while pummeling it with his right fist. She noticed he wasn’t having it all his own way and despair knotted her abdomen when she saw blood streaming from his throat somewhere, staining his beard a darker red. 

Roaring like a wounded elephant he stomped down on the thing repeatedly. The sound of bones snapping should have been sickening but to Asha they were like the trumpets of heaven, heralding a hope of surviving this fucked up night. The creature shrieked, the sound like someone stomping repeatedly on a bagpipe from hell. As suddenly as it started it was over. The thing went limp, and a moment later faded away. The busdriver turned and said something she couldn’t hear over the rush of blood in her ears and the giant responded with something jovial sounding, walked up and crashed down beside her. 

«What….what the fuck just happened?» She sounded panicked even to herself, but on the whole felt like it was a perfectly accurate response to the last sixty seconds or so. The giant fished a box of Göteborgs Rapé out of his pocket and proceeded to pack himself the biggest fucking wad of dip she had ever seen anyone stick up his or her lip. His eyes were intense and she noticed he was shivering and clenching and unclenching his fists. She decided to give the man time to come down from his adrenaline high before pressing the matter, not feeling any need of getting pushed through a window by the big, angry, wounded giant of a man. The arms and front of his jacket were scratched to hell but it looked like it had stood up to the punishment pretty well. He was bleeding from a long scratch to the side of his neck, but it didn’t look deep. Her own arms were poudning and promising to be sore and in a lot of pain for a while to come, and she’d probably need to get at cast on her wrist at some point. 

It took half of «Land of Confusion» for himew to calm down enough to look at her. His eyes were sea green and slightly red, a byproduct of him having fought for his life just now. She corrected herself. For their lives. He noticed her airbuds and asked «Are those as shit as I think they are?». She chuckled at the absurd question. «Worse. What the fuck was that? Who the fuck are you? Why the fuck isn’t the busdriver calling the cops?». 

He took a moment before answering, the kind of pregnant pause a teacher or dad takes before answering a difficult question. «I thought they were shit. I have no idea what that was, I’m Snorre Karlsson, I have no idea but I ain’t complaining ‘cos it’s a a bit of a walk to the closest beer from here. Wanna go to a bar and get really fucking drunk?». To her that sounded like a splendid idea. 

«Sure, let’s go to The Unholy Crypt of Misssabbath and get drunk. A studymate of mine works there, we can have him patch us up.» The giant smiled at that. «I can patch us up, I’m a nurse at Linkøping University Hospital». She smiled at that. «No shit? I’m studying to be a nurse, I’m doing my internship there from next week. He smiled at her. They rode in companionable silence for a while before she noticed his headset and laughed. When he looked inquiringly at her she grinned and said «I never thought someone throwing money out the window buying Beats by Dre would have the nerve to criticize earbuds». They both laughed at that. 

She took a moment to answer Jannicke on Tinder that no, she hadn’t had a great evening and no, she wasn’t coming over tomorrow for another date. This evening was really fucked up so far, but there was still a glimmer of hope for it. Despite it all, Asha smiled through the roaring wind as she settled back in her seat.

SO. Got into CS university about an year ago, already got a lot of programming experience with Java (from command line and UI desktop apps, to games shipped on Steam and webserver programming). I've also done some minimal stuff with python, a bit more with C++ and got academic experience with C. During the past month I've been looking into pentesting - again, the first time I was a proper skid :3 - and I'm thinking into enrolling into OSCP, but I have a couple or questions..

Although I'm fairly comfortable with linux and the terminal, I don't have much pentesting experience yet. I've read whole 'metasploit-unleashed' free course/docs on offensive security and cracked a few wi-fi passwords. Recently I learned more detailed stuff on how arp spoofing works etc. I think I need further training before enrolling into the course. Based on what I've read I think I need to:

- Download vulerable VMs and apps (DVWA, Metasploitable, vulnhub.com , etc)
- Learn some better nmap scanning
- Get more familiar with metasploit (read Book: ""Metasplot: A penetration testers guide"")
- Get a bit more knowledge on SQL
- Learn more python (along with packet manpulation libraries)
- Learn how to properly use Ncat
- Gain broader knowledge on hacking by reading ""the web application hackers handbook""
- Learn some ruby in order to understand metasploit better

I've also read the syllabus' index that OffSec provides for free (contains only the contents of the course), but I think I'd better learn most of these stuff in parallel with the lab time?

Can anyone evaluate my thoughts/give further advice? :) Thanks for the help!

Also, what is all the crapstorm about OSCPs not being able to find a proper job? Imho these opinions are now outdated because the certification gains ground fast.

Here is a little bit about me: I am a 22 y/o male, am fairly outgoing, was in a fraternity at Mizzou that has a local chapter at Bradley, and will finish moving to Peoria next week. I interned in Peoria for four months roughly a year ago, and am somewhat familiar with the area. I was a little iffy accepting an offer with all the layoffs ongoing, but the offer seemed quite promising.

My main worry is meeting people outside of work who will want to hang out or to go to the bars. I never had issues in St. Louis or at my university, but I know absolutely nobody in Peoria, IL, and I know it is an older age town. Making friends with the interns when I was there was easy because we had organized events etc, but I think being FT it would be different. I ended up renting at Woodsage Apartments and it is quite far away from downtown, but I expect to still go out to the bars at least every other weekend. The one benefit is it is near Grand Prarie, but I do not know if there is a bar scene out there.

Would going to the bars be the best way to meet people or do many people at CAT end up making friends? I am located at Mossville, but will likely get rotated back to the HQ in the future. I love fishing and being on the water, am an avid traveler, and enjoy going out to the bars (for more than a drink or two) and am hoping to find others who enjoy the same things.

I haven't had trouble getting interviews (I've had superdays with Goldman Sachs Investment Management in Chicago and JP Morgan Commercial Banking in Milwaukee, as well as countless first round and phone interviews in Wealth Management, Investment Banking, and Corporate Finance). I usually leave the interviews feeling pretty good about how things went but I can't seem to get an offer/many second round interviews.

Time is running out, and most of my friends know what they are doing this summer, while I am still stuck in the search. Basically, I'm looking for any advice to help me be a more appealing candidate in the interview process/any ideas on next steps I should take. Ideally, I want to work in financial services in Chicago this summer.

Some of my stats if it helps:

* 3.9 GPA University of Wisconsin

* Internship experience last summer in a corporate finance role (Operational Finance- worked a lot in Excel and VBA, developing programs and analyzing performance and generating reports on a per-plant basis) 

* 2 leadership roles in business fraternity (Fundraising chair, financial reporting chair)

I was a Psych/Statistics/Pre-Med undergrad who payed for school out of pocket, then screwed around for some years, and now I want to find a fulfilling, well-paying career that won't put me in a ton of debt, as I'd like to pay for grad school out of pocket, too. I have zero debt, and use my CC like a debit card, and do not want to accumulate debt, and am unwilling to take out large loans for school.

I have been leaning towards Engineering, and on a whim while traveling to a town one state over, I met with the department head of a university I am interested in, and he put me in touch with a prof who offered me a PT research assistant position to gain more experience in the field. Dept Head also said they would love to take me on in their Masters program once I completed 6 pre-reqs at a community college (statics, fluid mechanics, etc). Their acceptance rate is 62%, so I'm not sure if that's why they are being so nice accommodating. Overall, after meeting all the profs and advisors, I felt a very supportive and friendly vibe. I have high GRE scores (Q: 163, V: 160) so maybe that's why?

My financial question: I have $3k set aside for these pre-reqs. In my home state each class is $250, in the state where the university is, they are $600 (out of state). In my home state I can live with my parents for free, and in the university state, I have a place for $250/month (including utilities). 

Other factor to consider:
- I would like to apply to other schools as well, and to make myself more competitive I would like to get an internship at a firm. Doing so seems to require prior experience or at the very least a BS in Engineering. I think the research position would help me get a more revered internship to help me get into a school with a lower acceptance rate.

-Semesters in my home state (HS) are half the length of time, and courses at the comm college at the university state (US) have a lot of classes I would take this spring that are broken up into two courses. IE: Calc2 in HS = $250 for winter semester leaving spring semester open for more courses, Calc2 in US = Part 1 winter semester $600 + Part 2 spring semester $600 = $1200

-I need to move back to my HS this summer regardless (university knows this) to watch my parents house while they travel. I was hoping to have a summer internship in this time. 

-I don't have any friends in HS, all my friends and my SO are in US. Life in HS is extremely stressful for me, being a large city.

Expenses in US for the next 6 months before summer: $1800(3 classes)+$1500(rent) + $2400 (food) + $600 (health insurance) + $480 gas, etc
Expenses in HS for the next 6 months: $750 (3 classes) + $2400 (food) + $600 (health insurance) $480 (gas, etc)


How valuable is research experience to pay an extra $2550 more over 6 months? The rest of my classes will be fulfilled in HS over the summer and fall 2017, and winter 2018.


EDIT: I should add that, I am brand new to engineering, and am pursuing it because I love math and problem solving, but I don't have any experience and don't know right now if it's a good fit. Is $2500 worth gaining some exposure to get more of an idea if this is what I really want before investing more time in school?"

By crappy I mean, a small business or non-profit where you'll probably be the most knowledgeable guy there modifying their shitty Geocities-looking websites and maybe you'll make 1 shitty app for them.  Not to mention doing other non-programming related duties.  I can just picture the marketing guy expecting you to produce magic for him.

Unless you are working in a real software team, working in a proper environment (like an agile one), and have people who can actually teach you... the above opportunity seems useless.

I feel like time spent building a real app, and getting experience with modern techniques (RESTful APIs, heavy JS front-end work) and getting other fundamentals down (databases, testing) would be better worth your time.
I could also use the extra time to go to small hacking meetups and build things with other people, etc.

Am I right to think this way?  Assume someone has no internship/professional programming experience but otherwise good work experience.

5m2d3y,3,2017-01-04,How often do your builds actually run correctly with 0 problems...,caP1taL1sm,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5m2d3y/how_often_do_your_builds_actually_run_correctly/,"So in 2014 I built https://pcpartpicker.com/b/TygLrH this computer, with my own hard-earned money from an internship. Spent hours picking the parts, doing the analysis figuring out where I could go cheaper and where I could spend big dollars. Had everything -- 144Hz Monitor, rockin GPU at the time, the most highly recommended CPU. I was incredibly excited, being on the avant-garde of gaming. Especially since I played League, having that 144Hz monitor was awesome.

Then I spent hours learning how to assemble everything, and actually doing the assembly. Virtually no directions on anything, just had to figure it all out on my own since I had no guidance beyond videos which were always of difference cases and parts. After multiple roadblocks I finally got it all set up and running!

And then 5 days later, the crashes! The first time was playing Skyrim, I had just spent hours (see the theme here?) downloading all the graphics mods and everything and seeing the beautiful output. Then, bzzzzzrt crash. Said a prayer that it was a one-off thing, and then even when playing League it crashed. And then it wouldn't restart 100% of the time. Sometimes it would, seemingly randomly. I have no fucking clue how electronics in the 21st century seem to have an emotional mind of their own, but once the system began being more unstable, I tried taking it to professionals for help. Of course, this is after spending hours trying to troubleshoot the machine I dropped $1500 bucks on and giving up. Since I ""custom build"" my machine it's not like I could even go to any one manufacturer.

And even the professionals couldn't diagnose the crashes. They tried looking at crash logs, tried taking out RAM sticks, tried using the integrated GPU, nope. I ran Memtestx86 and also purchased an 800W power supply because some geniuses said it wasn't enough power, even though PCpartpicker said it was more than 100W over the maximum. That fixed it for like 2 days, and then it started crashing all over again.

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while, and I estimate about 20% of the time things that hit the front are troubleshooting exercises. **What I really want to know is, how the heck can people really suggest newbies (and I wasn't a fucking newbie at computers, trust me) to invest hundreds if not over a thousand dollars into building their own PC, when it seems like people constantly have problems with it, and consequently no real recourse to fix it?** Is it a buyers remorse situation where they convince themselves they're happy with their purchase because they don't want to admit they should have left it to a professional?

The follow-up is what do you think the percent is of people having perfectly fine builds that work without a hitch, and what percent of people, like me, drop HUNDREDS of hours and THOUSANDS of dollars on a nice piece of silicon?

EDIT: For the record, It's really not about the money, more the massive time wasted. It was a great learning experience, and part of the fun was the anticipation of building and seeing the output. Which of course made it all the worse when I realized these crashes were undiagnosable. The really sick irony of course was that it was probably for the best, because otherwise I would have played video games all throughout senior year of college instead of having IRL fun. So in some sick twisted way it was a blessing to keep me off video games more than I would have."

5m2tbu,18,2017-01-04,"What do i do? I have been on extreme crunch for 8+ months now, the dev team has lost more then half of its members in the last 6 months due to crunch, our CTO is AWOL, and i am the last backend dev holding the fort down.",ScreamingArtichoke,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5m2tbu/what_do_i_do_i_have_been_on_extreme_crunch_for_8/,"I honestly don't know what i am really supposed to be doing anymore. The company i have worked for has rapidly grown in every aspect. Every single god damn team but dev has grown 4x times bigger. Unfortunately we got hit really hard with crunch, and now dev has shrunk to 4 people in the last 6 months due to the situation not improving. Our CTO has been on maternity leave since july, now she announced she is taking an extra 2 months due to stress. 

Due to all the people leaving i am now responsible devops/backend/iot/anything else falling through the cracks, aside from me we have a single frontend developer (who has taken over frontend, and now both our iOS and Android apps), a brand new intern that started today (and was more or less completely ignored the entire day unfortunately), and a QA (that has no interest in coding or ops). 

However to counter this in the past 6 months, i have received 3 separate and substantial raises. So i get the impression that people know my value and are terrified for me to leave. 

Our entire infrastructure feels like it is being held together by little bits of string and tape, however none of us have any time to fix it. Honestly i don't even know what we should really be doing, we are months and months behind on deliverables (the last set of deliverables we have recorded is for September and half of isn't done), and every day it feels like someone else wants my head because ""we promised customer X we would have feature Y by Z."" Now the customer is unhappy, and might churn. I also loose sleep constasntly over how broken and a train wreck our cloud security has become. 

To make matters worse i have somehow become the defacto head of dev to the entire office, except the CTO doesn't see it that way. Our CTO when she left on maternity leave wrote this long email that basically amounted to ""its only a baby it won't impact my ability to lead."" However she rarely if ever responds to emails when asking for direction or information, and i have repeatedly been told by her to ""figure it out my self"" and i need to ""understand she just had a baby"".  However i am not allowed to make decisions according to her, for example i have gone through 3 different interview rounds/selections and every single time we could have gotten 1-2 great people, except:

* Interviews finished right when she left for maternity, HR kept dragging feet because he needs her approval. A month later she finally responds and by then its too late
* Round 2, found a great backend dev with experience in one of our obscure backend frameworks. She turns around and basically gives a 101 reasons why we shouldn't hire him and it all boils down to ""i wasn't there so i don't approve this person.""
* Round 3 i skip our CTO go to our CEO basically begging him to hire these two people. He says sure and agrees completely. CTO wrote me a very nasty and long email about how me going around her implies i value her less because of her baby. Apparently this caused some sort of weird tension and now i am being told to sit on the hiring by HR. 

Everytime she gets nasty at me, i point out bluntly point out that she isn't responding to her email, slack, and reiterate how tired and frustrated the entire team is. She immediately ether just ignores that part or points out she had a baby recently. 

I recently sat down with our CEO and laid out everything on table, and explained why and how everyone is frustrated and why we are not hitting any of our milestones in dev. Talked about how dev is basically wandering around directionless because we don't even know what is on our plate (which apparently surprised him because our CTO has been claiming otherwise, and i showed him our kaban board which hasn't been changed since September). However he doesn't feel comfortable going over our CTO when it comes to office stuff like hiring. In the end he basically offered us more money and 2 months paid vacation when our teams are back to strength. 

Today was absolute hell, and everyone was angry at me for some reason or another. I am so god damn tired of being asked ""Is there any reason why we haven't done X"", and when pointing out we ether didn't know about X or it is such low priority it will never be done.  I am tired of being dragged into meetings about products to explain to person Y why they don't have X. I am tired of working from 8am - midnight, 7 days a week.

I feel like i am 2 steps away from a nervous breakdown and just want to walk. But at the same time i have constant rage, since for so long our startup struggled and when we finally started making progress, and doing really well this happened. I also cannot get over my sense of guilt, since if i leave who is going to take over ops. There is almost 0 documentation (if it exists it is terribly wrong), and I am the only person in the company right now who has full access to our AWS account (CFO has access to billing but only that).

Long time lurker and first time poster here! I currently am in college(sophomore) for computer science and I've been viewing possible routes I could take with my degree. The reason why I am considering IT Consulting is that I really enjoy doing backend work as well as dealing with unique problems and dealing with the general public (worked in retail for 4+ years).

Over the summer, I had an internship at a Dev shop that focused on Data Hosting as well as web design. Over the couple months that I worked there, I was taken through the process of building a server using RHEL to work all the way up to creating a website for one of their clients. I learned a lot at the internship, but throughout the process, I tended to enjoy the backend work(Apache, setting up PHP, SQL, PhpMyAdmin, automated scripts) more than the frontend work(PHP, HTML5, CSS, JQuery). Which sparked a general interest for how Linux worked at a deeper level. I've done the Linux From Scratch project, and all the computers I operate run Arch Linux, and the server I maintain runs Ubuntu Server. 

Currently, a friend of mine and myself have made a few websites for small companies around our college. I do backend work mostly and frontend work when needed. Which has kind of solidified that I want to do something with a heavy backend aspect. 

I also have experience managing enterprise networks from working for my college. Over this summer, I am doing work with the network as well as setting up some new servers that run RHEL.

Ultimately, the overreaching question I have is what other things should I try to learn while I am at school and have the time to build my portfolio? Are there possibly better suited jobs that fit my skill set?


Thank you in advance!

I split with an amazing guy 6 years ago. We connected so well and I trusted him endlessly, but he always felt a bit far away and had a gaming addiction (which he’s since resolved). I had an internship opportunity in Africa and had to decide whether to keep it short and come back to him, or end our relationship and be open to jobs there. So I laid out 2 things I needed from him – stop gaming so much and a bit more sexually adventurous – but he said he couldn’t do those things. So I ended it.


Forward 6 years. Work and the decision I want a family landed me on the other side of North America from my ex. I hadn’t met anyone and kept thinking about him. I wrote him a long letter, and we talked so openly about what happened. I learned that during that time he was failing school, and actually dropped out adding 2 years to his education when we split. He couldn’t give me what I needed, because he was losing himself. He would love to explore us, but right then he was seeing an old ex who was going through a lot (alcoholism), and while he doubted it’d last he had to let it take its course.


Two weeks later I met a great guy 15 years older than me. He is hot (for almost 50), has a great career, is very well off, great sex, and tells me I’m beautiful and smart every day. It’s been a year and a half and we just moved in, and he wants to marry soon (he’s very ready to find his life partner and build with them). Fantasy right? Suddenly though, I felt like.. how could I ever NOT be with my ex again? OMG.. never another chance! It tore me apart. And now I suddenly am picking out all these little annoyances about the current guy. I don’t even feel as attracted to him and have been a bit rude but almost feel I can’t control it. 


I met for coffee with my ex while visiting home over holidays. He said he was sorry he never had the confidence to come after me – he just never believed he’d amount to anything. That I was out of reach. Then he saw me with this guy and he thought I was happy - he wanted me to have that. Figured I’d marry this guy, and with that resolved he’d likely just be alone for a long time. He would love another shot… but also doesn’t want to be the reason I change everything. He feels guilty, like a home-wrecker. We’re both logical enough to know it might not even work. We’d be starting from scratch emotionally and in life, new (but good) careers with student loans and not even have enough to buy a home if it does work. And, it would mean me leaving a job, life, moving across the country to a place I know no one. But, much closer to my fam (4 hour drive vs. 700$ flight).


Since the talk with my ex I’ve told my current guy a million things Im unhappy about. Too far from my family? He’ll get me a condo there so I can see them. He’s too clean for kids? He will learn to be messy. Loves penthouse too much? We’ll get a house. He is just so willing to fix every single thing I bring up! – because he will do anything to see me happy. 


I don’t know who I love. My ex? I did so much but its been 6 years we don’t even know each other anymore. My current, I thought I did but now I’m really not sure. I haven’t even wanted to kiss him. I cant ‘follow my heart’ – its not speaking to me! Am I just running away from a good thing, cold feet? And, I worry the money clouds my vision – a life where I could have anything and so could my kids.  But, it’s not just that – one is ready to do anything for me, while the other let me walk away once before. But, the current is so willing to do anything, I worry I’ll steal how he envisioned his retirement – kids instead of travel and luxury, and he may resent it later. Or I could go after the one I’d get to grow and build with and who finally put himself out there, sharing more with me than he ever has – but if it doesn’t work lose everything and have to start all over and maybe never meet another good guy for years and years. All I do know - is Im tired of dating, am ready for the next stage of life.. and both are so great I might never find another as great as either. :’( Im just so lost. Please help :””(.

I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Accounting and Finance at a four-year university in Chicago. I ultimately want to end up at a more prestigious university with a reputable business program and I'm wondering which school I'm applying to would be the most suitable path for someone who wants to go into finance.

I've applied to UCLA, UC Berkeley/Haas, UC Santa Barbara, Boston College, UNC Chapel Hill, USC, and SMU. I know that some of these programs, especially at Berkeley and Boston College, are difficult to get into as a transfer student. With regards to Berkeley, I'm a California resident so I'm hoping this is beneficial to my application. I also have a 3.87 GPA and have only received one B+ in Microeconomics of probably 8+ business courses I have taken thus far, with membership in a professional fraternity, a business competition club, and a fall 2016 finance internship for one of the presidential candidates, so I'm hopeful about my chances.

My questions are: 
1) does anyone know how likely it is for someone to get into Haas as a transfer from another four-year institution? 

2) How is the investment banking/finance recruitment from UCSB compared to my other potential schools? 

I want to have a better idea of what my opportunities will be like at each school before decisions come out so I can make a well-informed decision.

My mom has told me multiple times that if I wasn't her daughter, she would have cut me off by now. My brother said the same, he would have cut me off if I wasn't his sister. I grew up with an abusive father and picked up his habits. I emotionally abuse ppl, manipulate them, and use them for my own selfish needs. I'm extremely selfish and I don't really care about other ppl and their needs. I have a really bad temper and I often say really hurtful things to ppl that I later regret. This morning my mom woke me up to do the dishes. I almost yelled at her and told her that I'd take all the dishes, put them in a trash bag, and throw it outside so that it smashes on the concrete. I wasn't actually going to do it, but I was close to saying it. On top of how disrespectful I am to my mom, I'm still living off her. She pays for EVERYTHING.

I know everything that I'm doing wrong but I just can't seem to stop. I lost the best friend I've ever had in my entire life because I couldn't stop being emotionally abusive.

I'm 22, ppl around me are talking about having kids, but I can't have kids if I'm this type of person. I have been trying to change for a long time. I fully accept everything that I've done wrong, and I know what I'm doing, I don't get why I can't just stop.

This is driving me crazy. Im supposed to work out, mediate, eat healthier, have better hygiene, but I can't seem to keep up with everything due to lack of motivation. Not to mention my bad weed habit.

I don't know what to do... How can I change if I know what's wrong in my behavior already but I'm just not changing ....."

I'm aware that all the schools I just listed are very good, but the student body at MIT is likely stronger overall than that of, say, VT.

I'm curious whether or not this would make it harder to get an interview and internship at MIT than at VT, because at MIT you are competing with many more very strong CS students. In other words, it's harder for your resume to stand out among other MIT students, than it is for a strong CS student at VT.

Does anyone have any experience to indicate this is true/false?"

I'm currently in the recruiting process for a summer SWE internship at FB, but have already accepted a summer intern offer from GOOG. My FB recruiter is asking for deadlines - should I mention to her that I have already accepted a GOOG offer, but plan to renege if accepted at FB, or should I keep that information on the down-low?

I will be graduating debt free in May and starting a job in July that pays 85k/yr (and one time 15k signing bonus) as a software engineer. I'm very grateful for the opportunity but I am also trying to be wary of lifestyle creep. I commuted to the same company as an intern last year and my commute from the suburbs on Long Island takes me about an hour and a half door to door each way. I found it to be pretty draining and I'm considering renting a place in the city with friends after graduating, but am hesitant because of the extra expenses and opportunity cost of having that money be invested, saved for an emergency fund, towards a down payment on an apartment (obscenely expensive in the NYC area).

My relationship with my Mom (the only person living in my house) is pretty solid and she has even advocated for me staying at home until marriage. I also have an understanding long time girl friend so I will not have to deal with many of the single dating problems living at home comes with. My only issue is with limited free time (50+ hour weeks at work and 15-18 hours/week of commuting) which may cause me to neglect my friends and health, not have time to work on side projects, and potentially not developing as much personally and gaining life experiences as I would otherwise have enjoying the city, living in an apartment with friends, etc.

The monthly costs of my commute are quite high: $400 commuter rail + metro card, + gas and maintenance on a car given to me by my grandmother who can no longer drive. The insurance payments are low(~$100-150/mo) but currently made by my mom. However these payments are small in comparison to life away from home: estimated $1500-1600 in rent, more for utilities, $120 metro, no more free home cooked meals etc) If further breakdowns are needed I have comprised several budgets based on my living situation.

Initially my plan was to live at home maybe a year or two if I can bear it, but I wanted to post here to hear all of your advice on the topic. Thank you in advance!"

Have personal preference towards good work life balance in career, without getting into too much debt right out of the gate, but want an honest outsider’s perspective on my specific dilemma and what could be reasonably be done hack it out. My full ride Texas Grant is coming to an end, but all my core courses are completed, and If I radically change course, it would take 1 to 1 and a half more school years to finish, and tuition per semester is in the 6 to 7,000+ range, not counting miscellaneous expenses, which potentially adds up to 10 to 12,000 per year at most, though. My Financial Aid advisor told me that, at the rate I’m going, total amount is within the 6/7/8k range.

---My Situation---
I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate.


*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci major, that might also be an asset if I seek out TECHNICAL WRITING. JOURNALISM is also viable.


*GRAPHIC/WEB DESIGN: This one weighed very heavily on me, as I did enjoy the major, and I do regret changing course from it. If I were to change back, I would have to take 19 more classes, and at the absolute latest, graduate December 2018 – this might not be so bad, as this extra time would allow me to seek out relevant graphic/ web design internships. I know someone who has had a paid graphic/web design internship for my local school district for about two years, and I’d kill to have that type of experience on my resume – although, such positions aren’t super uncommon. I feel that on several levels, this might be the riskiest investment, but there’s also a payoff at the end of it that might make it worth it.


*WEB DEVELOPMENT/PROGRAMMING: With this plan, I feel that I would just graduate as is, devote time to learning the craft, then relocate to whichever part of Texas would take me.


There’s an overarching question for each of these: Am I looking at it pragmatically enough? Careers aren’t light decisions, and I’m ultimately drawn to these paths in particular because of opportunities for interesting work with potentially good salary between 40 to 80k, along with good work-life balance that allows for family, personal projects and hobbies. BUT, I also need to keep in mind the potential flaws. For instance, Web Dev/Software Engineering roles are better paying and in higher demand compared to Web Design, yet I strongly believe that I could do perfectly well with that as a career – even with the elephant of student debt being a potentially stronger pressing concern. English major stereotypes are largely just that, but there’s truth in stereotypes, and there’s always the risk that I could live out the nightmare scenario of nearly a decade of low paying jobs WITH debt. I’ve been told by my family that I don’t have to worry about that having that potential debt, as I have a personal financial cushion along with financial aid and scholarships.  I live in the RGV of South Texas, and there’s not much opportunities for the above careers, so there’s also the financial issue of relocation. 

I thank you all, and am interested in hearing your comments on this matter.

I'm failing college because I have no motivation.

I want to be a producer &amp; rapper and Im starting to think I'm crazy for it. I'm going to school for audio production and I moved to NYC. I might be manic right now... But who knows lol... I'm bipolar so my perspective of everything, including myself, changes drastically depending on my mood. Which changes rapidly......

I have no friends. My best friend of 8 years cut me off because I treated her like shit. Even though I cared about her, I just couldn't bring myself to stop. My older cousin just cut me off today lol. My mom &amp; brother have both told me that they wouldn't keep me in their lives if I wasn't family.

I'm 22, living off of my moms money. I have an unpaid internship and I'm in college.

I have no friends lol. My social life was pretty much non-existent when I was still friends with my ex best friend. My whole life revolved around her, but now she's gone and I feel like a good for nothing with no friends. I have really low self esteem and I don't know how to make new friends and I am having trouble letting people in, I push ppl away once they show interest in me. It's also hard for me to believe that someone actually likes me and enjoys my presence even when their actions show that they do.

I have poor hygiene and have little to no motivation to change that. I'm supposed to eat healthy &amp; workout to help with all of my issues and to be more clear-headed, but I can't bring myself to keep up with doing it.

I'm selfish, manipulative, and emotionally abusive. I try to stop but unfortunately my father's abusive influence just won't let go of me and I hate myself for it.

I lie so much, I believe my own lies, and I've been in situations where I wanted to tell the truth but I just couldn't bring myself to be 100% honest.

I always have a problem with someone. Everywhere I go, I'm always going to find something wrong about a situation or with a person and whatever that ""problem"" is, entirely consumes me.
Example: I find that a guy named Jacob at my job is arrogant. Other ppl also think he is arrogant but treat him like they would treat anyone else because in their minds, it's not that serious. I end up seriously disliking Jacob because of his arrogance and I then find every little thing about him that annoys me and consume myself with it to the point where he makes me visibly upset whenever I have to interact with him.

I have no self control. Weed, porn, temper tantrums.. I'm addicted to all 3.

Im honestly, so sick of myself. I considered ending it all so many times, but I can't do that to my mother. Most of the time I'm not thinking about ending it though.

I want to change but don't know how. I'd make progress then fall right back in to old habits.

A few years back I graduated and got my bachelor degree: Journalism. I should add that 3 years before that I had a hard time making the decision... Journalism or Computer Science. I took the... let's call it 'easy' way. I got my degree without having to study too much (I passed all exams on first try by just getting everything in my head the day – and night – before an exam). 

So after that I had to make another 'big life decision'. Get a job or get another degree. I decided to take a job, because I got a job offer from the company where I did an internship and I wanted to be in the possibility to move out of my parents house and start living with my girlfriend. Online football (soccer) journalism. Not a permanent contract, but I was a 'freelancer'. I should add I was working 12h/day + weekends for that company and was getting quite some money from it. 

But then, before I even moved out of my parents house, everything went wrong. It all started with the payments getting more and more delayed and the company (with the website I'm working for as just one small part of the bigger company) ending up bankrupt (in total I missed out on 3 months of payment, which I will never see, due to the fact I was 'just' a freelancer – eventhough I pretty much ran the website entirely by myself, content-wise). I should add at this point I even got a second job some months before the bankruptcy, but I let it go, because of several reasons. Not a job to continue my carreer in (betting website, …).

So there I was, january 2016, jobless. At that point my girlfriend decided to leave me. Completely different story, but it had to be mentioned, because it makes me reconsider my big life decisions (even up to this point, where I still regulary get in contact with her, but without making any progress – and I FINALLY start giving up on her) and it has some ties to this. Me working so many hours, not having enough time for her, stopped working out (but started again, yay!), ...

In april 2016 I got a new job, permanent contract (after a trial), business journalism. Writing technical articles for several magazines that are distributed to companies in the sector. Payments are in time, but I'm making only half (a bit above the minimum 'start salary') of what I used to make. This is where I'm at now. Not completely unhappy with my job, also due to the fact that in the near future (2-3 years) I could get a promotion (and a company car) to be 'chief editor' of one of the magazines. 

But here I am, starting courses on CodeAcademy and considering if I should get another degree, in Computer Science. And if I do, should I do it in home school (evening) or day school to get a bachelor degree? I'm quite sure I'm 'smart' enough to get a bachelor degree, but I'm not sure if I want to leave my job for it. Getting back to school means saying goodbye to this promotion I might get AND deciding to live at my parents house for another three years... This last thing is what is bothering me the most. I was ready to move out and move in with my girlfriend-at-the-time. Still considering moving out and start living on my own, but financially not do-able without a dayjob.

I'm trying to list the pro's and the cons, but still can't really decide.

Any advice or things you would do in my situation – and why

Kind of wanted to put my life out there in words. There is a tl;dr at the bottom for my question if you are not interest in life story. 


As of late I feel my depression is continuing to worsen. 
I am at a point in life where I go to work, come home, do nearly nothing for hours and go to sleep. 

Some back story. I have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember (about 12 years now and I am 25 now). When I was younger always interested in technology and was a critical thinker with my parents claiming (don't know if it is true don't really remember much from chidlhood) I had ideas for products before companies were making things and could solve problems easily. I was also pretty active even though I was overweight I would go out for different sports teams never made any though (football, soccer, baseball, basketball, pretty much anything my schools offered) I was a lot more social would actually go outside, go over to friends houses. Got a bit older started working on computers, playing, building pretty much anything I could with them. I started to lose interest in pretty much everything. 

During middle school is when I feel I began feeling depressed (I don't recall any major events around this time) but I would cover it with anger getting into fights all the time which typically resulted in me getting suspended and having to stay home a lot. During this time too I stopped biking, doing sports, interacting for the most part with people. I became very shy and reclusive, pretty much only interacting with people online. Still had a few friends I would interact with offline. Visiting them though started to dwindle and then pretty much only interaction with them was now also online.

Now into high school I would do the absolute bare minimum to pass and mostly sleep in class. The reclusiveness hit a high during this time I would refuse to speak to the teachers even if they called me out in class. Some of the teachers cared enough to notice that I knew my the subjects they were teaching and would try to push me to do work and make something of myself which at this point in my life I hated but looking back I do appreciate it a lot and these teachers are still the ones I remember and even miss them to this day. Moving into college I finally had a reason to work for my teachers since I was doing something that I felt I had interest in (computer programming) did the work got the grades,  nearly graduated but one of the final requirements for the degree was an internship which they provide companies and contacts that I would need to get a hold of and setup an interview with. The school failed so hard in this part they were sending me contact information for event programmers (like setting up music or art events) which wasn't even close to anything I wanted. Eventually I gave up on getting the degree. 

Following dropping out of college I got fed up with people in general and wouldn't leave the house for months at a time for more than just taking the trash out. I would try programming something but never felt I needed anything and anything I did someone else has already done before and better than I felt I could so I basically gave up on computer programming as well. I do have thoughts of suicide during this time but never feel I could go through with it just kind of imagining it. 

Forward a few more years me and mother hit financial trouble we couldn't deal with any more and getting evicted and just decide to move to another state. In the new place which is so small the whole town has a population smaller than the high school I was in. I get my first job which happened to be retail so I dealt with customers as much as needed for the job then went home and played games with friends from old state online. Shyness does start to go away during this time but also start hanging with friends less due to work also during this time I start to lose interest in even playing games that I have been for year. I eventually get moved to overnights for stocking which I excelled at but even less time with friends online now due to hours.

And now much more recently a year ago I changed my diet and hit an all time high of feeling like life was finally going good a couple months in. I started exercising more, lost over 100 lbs putting me in shape for the first time in my adult life. Got a promotion to manager at the same job. Everything was going well. Then I hit a wall extremely hard... I just all of a sudden lost all interest in everything again but even more so to the point now I work and basically sit for hours then sleep... Almost no interaction with friends again, no interest in games, no interest in shows/movies nothing I do seems to help. I don't know why... I feel I don't have stress I no longer have any financial trouble and have tons of free time to do anything with but I sit all day doing nothing. I have been trying to find something to do to no avail. I do a lot of theory crafting of things I could do making spreadsheets for things Including costs, time, projects, ways to optimize doing things but when trying to start I feel entirely overwhelmed on beginning and freeze up and just end up saying forget it and sitting there. Not much around me for clubs or activities unless I want to take up hunting and fishing. Technology around here is nearly non existent.

Have done some baking, and gardening since starting the diet it's alright in small doses nothing I feel I would want to do a lot. Thought about trying to start a business, woodworking, electrical engineering work, building things but all these falls back to the same problem I had with programming never knowing what I want to do or someone else already doing it better than I feel I can.


Tl;dr
Looking for something to do to help with depression. Previous interests were computers, programming, sports. Have tried baking, gardening. Looked into starting a business, woodworking, electronic engineering, building but feel I never know what to make/do with the skill and don't end up even starting."

About six weeks ago, I started as an intern in my first degree-related job. My manager and team often engage in office banter and most of the time I am excluded from this, so I just continue working quietly at my desk. I think I have developed a reputation for being quiet and shy because of this.

I have attempted to join in numerous times and have initiated conversations with the individual team members which normally go well but none of them make the effort to talk to me first. My manager has only ever acknowledged me once, when we were introduced, but has ignored me since. I have become more and more anxious about being excluded. My self-esteem has dwindled as a result, and it has made me become even more quiet and shy - it's a vicious cycle and I am no longer motivated to go to work and do my job.

I am naturally a shy and introverted person, but I am able to socialise well if the other person shows a genuine interest in wanting to speak with me. So far this has not happened.

How can I recover from the situation I am in so that I can get a second chance at getting along with my team?

Edit: 6 weeks ago (not 3 months, I'm interning for 3 months)

So what exactly happened to the guy who bragged about how he was _so professional_ at making websites and always talked about it like he had superior knowledge? The ""madcast media"" website as he described it is not hard to make. Literally, this would be a learning project for a new intern at any modern company. The kind of thing they cobble together to understand basic web development then throw away when they're done.

Remember when he was talking about how static HTML websites are so superior to modern websites? Or when he was bragging that he programmed some chat application for when he was writing his book? Or when he was talking about how Dropbox was so poorly constructed and FTP is superior?

As a programmer, here's one thing I can tell you about Maddox -- he's not good with computers. He's actually one of those ""dangerous"" types programmers, the very counter-productive kind. He knows he's not able to keep up and learn modern tech, so instead, he demonizes it. Then he says the ""old way"" (the way he knows) of doing it is better, when in reality, he just doesn't understand how to do it in the new way."

5m8ajg,3,2017-01-05,Young College Student at Critical Point with Careers and Salary,quantum-blade,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/5m8ajg/young_college_student_at_critical_point_with/,"Tl;dr 22 Year College student nearing end of degree path seeking practical, honest feedback on planned course corrections with a few degree paths. Have personal preference towards good work life balance in career, without getting into too much debt right out of the gate, but want an honest outsider’s perspective on my specific dilemma and what could be reasonably be done hack it out. My full ride Texas Grant is coming to an end, but all my core courses are completed, and If I radically change course, it would take 1 to 1 and a half more school years to finish, and tuition per semester is in the 6 to 7,000+ range, not counting miscellaneous expenses, which potentially adds up to 10 to 12,000 per year at most, though. My Financial Aid advisor told me that, at the rate I’m going, total amount is within the 6/7/8k range.


---My Situation--- I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate.


*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci major, that might also be an asset if I seek out TECHNICAL WRITING. JOURNALISM is also viable.


*GRAPHIC/WEB DESIGN: This one weighed very heavily on me, as I did enjoy the major, and I do regret changing course from it. If I were to change back, I would have to take 19 more classes, and at the absolute latest, graduate December 2018 – this might not be so bad, as this extra time would allow me to seek out relevant graphic/ web design internships. I know someone who has had a paid graphic/web design internship for my local school district for about two years, and I’d kill to have that type of experience on my resume – although, such positions aren’t super uncommon. I feel that on several levels, this might be the riskiest investment, but there’s also a payoff at the end of it that might make it worth it.


*WEB DEVELOPMENT/PROGRAMMING: With this plan, I feel that I would just graduate as is, devote time to learning the craft, then relocate to whichever part of Texas would take me.
There’s an overarching question for each of these: Am I looking at it pragmatically enough? Careers aren’t light decisions, and I’m ultimately drawn to these paths in particular because of opportunities for interesting work with potentially good salary between 40 to 80k, along with good work-life balance that allows for family, personal projects and hobbies. BUT, I also need to keep in mind the potential flaws. For instance, Web Dev/Software Engineering roles are better paying and in higher demand compared to Web Design, yet I strongly believe that I could do perfectly well with that as a career – even with the elephant of student debt being a potentially stronger pressing concern. English major stereotypes are largely just that, but there’s truth in stereotypes, and there’s always the risk that I could live out the nightmare scenario of nearly a decade of low paying jobs WITH debt. I’ve been told by my family that I don’t have to worry about that having that potential debt, as I have a personal financial cushion along with financial aid and scholarships. I live in the RGV of South Texas, and there’s not much opportunities for the above careers, so there’s also the financial issue of relocation. 


I thank you all, and am interested in hearing your comments on this matter."

I'm a current undergrad junior who's interested in both data science and finance. But I haven't quite figured out which field I prefer as of right now. 

I got my first internship offer in Data Science. It's an ok offer, in terms of pay. Not great location. But it's better than nothing and I'm thrilled I was able to get an offer at all. 

That being said, I am still interviewing/applying for quite a few other firms, in both data science and Finance. I have two final round interviews coming up, one in data science one in finance, among others in earlier rounds. Pretty much all of them have better locations, likely better pay, and are probably better for my career. I would rather work at both the companies I am currently in the final round in, as well as most of the other companies I'm still interviewing for. 

So the data science offer I hold right now has a deadline for this coming Monday, but there's a good chance I won't do the final round interviews (among other interviews) until mid-late January. The dilemma I'm in is that I don't want to turn down my current offer and then get rejected from all my other offers, leaving me with nothing for this summer. 

My dad thinks I should accept the current offer, and then just back out if I get another offer. I can't help but feel this is unethical. Anyway have recommendations for me on where to proceed?

5m9khh,16,2017-01-05,The Curse of Pragmatism,arcterex117,aznidentity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/5m9khh/the_curse_of_pragmatism/,"Where does white worship come from?  Or why do Asians often give preferential treatment to whites in social interactions?

Let's try to get inside the mind of an Uncle Chan or Auntie Tan- the sort of person who thrills to the presence of a white person, who excitedly engages them in conversation, who shies away from disagreeing with them, who in general gives them more importance in social interactions.   

**Social Status**

Let's consider the idea of Social Status.   Social status is comprised of many factors but in the end it is an assessment of a person's social worth, their importance; it determines their rank.   I think we can agree that in America, whites have fashioned a society where they put themselves atop the social hierarchy.   If you want a primer on Social Status and how it affects people's behavior, [see my review of an important study on the subject](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/4e7vc1/i_summarize_the_study_social_hierarchy_and/?ref=search_posts).

**Pragmatism, Social Pragmatism, Social Opportunism**

This is where Pragmatism comes into play.   A pragmatic person accepts reality how it is, and figures out how to operate in that ecosystem to his best advantage.   (Idealism is the opposite of pragmatism; an idealist leads with his values and operates in his ecosystem according to his beliefs, and does not accept the rules of the game, as such).   Pragmatists largely accept Life as it is; often thinking the Rules of the Game are beyond reform; and in any case, focusing on the big picture comes at the expense of their personal gain.

I think we can say that many Asians are Pragmatic.   Pragmatism is associated with being rational.  Being realistic.   And in many cases of being effective and successful.   Poverty drives people to pragmatism.   Our parents or grandparents may have lived in impoverishment- where they margin of error was slim.   One could not afford ""ideals""; what needed to be done, needed to be done.   Not acting out in accordance with practical reality and that which brings near-term gain could mean failure, ostracism, or possibly death.   Therefore, this pragmatic- accept the world as it is- mentality is in many cases, part of the home culture we were raised with.

Now let's think about the nature of an Uncle Chan given the concepts of Social Status and Pragmatism.   **Pragamatic behavior with regard to social status (""social pragmatism"") would accept the racial hierarchy ""ecoystem"" how it is, and plot to advantage oneself as much as possible within the fixed reality.**   I will submit that this behavior is a) largely subconscious and automatic, and b) not limited to race, and not unusual.   For example, it is somewhat normal in an office environment to interact respectfully with let's say a senior VP who's your manager's manager, but more casually to your peers, and tease/act in a dominant way towards those lower in the org chart.  It is acceptable behavior that almost everyone does to some extent.   But clearly, SOME take this to extreme levels - the Kiss Up, Kick Down type -- and you see this in the social world too, forgetting the office environment example.   

Coming back to social interaction, the Uncle Chan has adopted a pragmatic, un-idealistic way of navigating it.   And let me be charitable to him.   This is a rational strategy.  In many cases, because whites do have higher status, **the butt-kissing Chan finds a way to elevate himself in social rank, even if it's at the expense of other Asians**.  Even if it's solidifying the racial hierarchy, selling out his own, making whites, Asians, and non-Asian minorities think less of Asians and in general, acting in a way that's Status-Reinforcing of white supremacy on a broader level.  

At the micro-level, the individual has secured himself the approval of high-status whites, which insulates him from perhaps the most damning social aggression, exclusion, and in some cases insulates him from criticism of others in the group.   It is a self-serving, cynical strategy- but nonetheless one that is not foreign in human affairs- and as I pointed out with my office example, one that we all engage in to some degree.    Pragmatism seeks out the decisions that will advantage oneself, not one's group; and the outlook emphasizes the short-term.

The difference with the Office example to Social interaction is the office example features Official Hierarchy- that is, the different levels in rank accord to real differences in level of responsibility and seniority.   In the Social example, we are arbitrarily making distinctions in rank based on race.  However, if you read my analysis of a [study on Status](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/4e7vc1/i_summarize_the_study_social_hierarchy_and/?ref=search_posts), social ranks are remarkably durable, comparable with Official Rank in a defined hierarchy.   This is based on the individual and group's need for stability. 

Opportunism is taking pragmatism to an unhealthy place; where moral standards are jettisoned in favor of personal advantage.

**Pragmatism and Vulnerability**

As I mentioned, pragmatism doesn't just emanate from selfishness; it often results from vulnerability (such as poverty).  Those that believe they cannot afford to ""lose"".  Asian women fall into this category.   Women are more vulnerable than men.  And minorities are more vulnerable than whites.   Being both, Asian women often believe they can ill afford the wrath of the group or high status individuals.   This may lead to an often cynically pragmatic outlook - which in our society, necessarily leads to some form of white worship.  

**How Social 'Pragmatism' leads to mistreatment of not just Asians, but other POC**

In addition, unfortunately, a purely pragmatic point of view, not only normalizes white supremacy in their mind (because that is a part of reality), it also legitimizes the mistreatment of POC, because they are deemed lower status by society.   We can see where pragmatism run amok - Accepting white-constructed social reality whole cloth - among AF's can lead to unremitting white worship but also dismissiveness and rudeness to POC, since such pragmatic Auntie Tans at a subconscious level assume their reaction to someone ought to be based on whatever society classifies their social rank as.

Social Pragmatism comes from a ""rational"" place but if often means accepting the racism and racial hierarchy in white society.  If every Asian engaged in Channery, the Asian race will be forever subordinated in the West- in every area of life.   This is true even if the Asians in question argue on their behalf that they were just trying to make the ""best of a bad situation"".

**Idealism**

Idealism is the counter-balance to Pragmatism.   Idealists believe Right makes Right, not Might makes Right.  Idealists are willing to take hits in the short-term in order what is the correct thing to do in the long-term; that are long-term optimal, that are optimal to the collective.....and even if they are not optimal, their moral compass influences their choices, not merely self-interest.

Identification with a group leads to Idealism.   Because now the group's agenda has importance to the individual; and the individual also sees his benefit in the realization of the group's agenda.  Being part of something larger than onesself can be a healthy experience because one is able to finally step outside his narrow instinctual/short-term self-interest.  (However, group membership is not necessary for the Idealistic worldview).

Idealists leave something on the table in interactions.   They take less than they could, but in adhering to conduct consonant with their worldview and morals, they realize these sacrifices are minor in service of playing their part in the larger mission; in this case, in engaging in Status-Attenuating behavior towards white rule atop the social hierarchy.  The individual's behavior chips away at a larger force he deems unhealthy to him and others like him, and whatever the impact, is the right thing to do. 


**Drilling Down**

I will now get away from neutral observation of the matter into how I think about the subject.

I personally have contempt for people who are purely Pragmatic.  To me, they are soulless golems, prisoners to their instincts and vastly overstate the benefit of their ""victories"" from aligning themselves to the world as it is.  At the end of their life, all their epitaph should say is: ""I played the Game"".   

**Self-monitoring**

We face a choice in the social sphere.  We can either take the ""safe, easy"" route of supplicating to whites ""because that's the way things are"" or we can do what we know is right- which is act to counteract that.   Such as monitoring how we act in social situations and noticing if we subconsciously make allowances for whites; if we notice we ""feel happy"" when whites are around or ""bored"" when greeted by another Asian or POC.   **This self-monitoring is essential** to rooting out internalization of the social/racial hierarchy.

**Gauging Other Asians with more Nuance**

Beyond self-monitoring, we should see the behavior of other Asians clearly.   I think this is absolutely essential.   If you ignore everything I just said and were unfamiliar with this topic, you might observe an Asian person who in a social group who is happily talking with a tall white male, getting along fabulously, and assume this man is socially successful.   You might assume an Asian woman who is getting the attention of let's say a white female and a white man in a larger group of other Asians and Hispanics is - popular.   But what if you realized that the reason they were directing attention and talking to her was that she *agreed with everything they said*.  She flattered them.   And she gave further importance to them, by refusing to make eye contact whenever another Asian spoke.   Or the syllable they finished, immediately began talking again to the white people in the group.   Or what about the Asian male example I gave- what if that Asian man was ""getting along"" with the white male because he was deferential to him but undercut FOB Asians to him, and laughed at how bad their food smelled, etc.

**Not Enough to Guard against Raw Social Pragmatism in Ourselves, but also avoid Accidentally Giving Respect to Asians who Engage in It**

We tend to make automatic judgments of the ""social success"" of others; but we need to look more closely at patterns of behavior and understand the WHY in it.   Part of the problem is our language.   Which insists people are either Uncle Chans or Not-Uncle-Chans.   But an Asian can be subtly ""respectful"" towards whites while more normal towards non-whites in the same way a person can be ""respectful"" towards their superior at work and more normal towards their peers.   These subtle differences, we often don't pick up on- or are too slight to meet the bar of Channery.   Instead, perhaps we can rate people on a scale of what I call Accomodationism (white accomodationism- that is preferential treatment to whites): high levels or low-levels.  To simplify we can say it's a scale of 1-10; from Independent (treats people equally and objectively) to Utter Sycophant to Whites.  By making an assessment along a gradient, rather than binary (Chan, Not-Chan), we can better gauge Asians around us.   

If a fellow Asian is *always* acting friendly towards whites, whether the CEO or the intern, whether the attactive charismatic white or the dorky obnoxious white, that gives us information on which to grade them.   If instead an Asian person treats others in accordance with their actual nature and their compatibility with them, that would stand in favor of them not being Accomodationist.

By grading in this fashion, we do not accidentally ""give credit"" to Accomodationists or Chans for ""social success"" that ostensibly seems earned but is actuality the result of Channery.   This is because even if we are Idealists, we naturally reward one another for ""wining"" social interactions, for being ""popular"".   We can correct ourselves and other Asians when they speak about an Accomodationist/Pragmatic Asian by making it clear that their social gains are ill-gotten.   Our vigilance and clarification to others of it is what serves as the necessary Moral counter-balance to the social gains that are to be had through selfish social Pragmatism.  In other words, it serves as a Deterrence to this behavior by Asians.

One of the 'crimes' committed by 1st-gen Asians is 'rewarding' their children or any 2nd gen Asians overly for 'assimilating' as ""proved"" by having white friends or being popular among whites.   One crime we all commit is giving more respect to Asians who 'earn the respect' of whites.   We have to guard against our gut-reaction, and be critical if this is all the result of white accomodationism.


**Closing**

Pragmatism is a human strategy applied in many areas of life.  If is often pronounced in those who are Insecure and those who suffer from Poverty; aspects of our parent's culture and also properties of being the ""other"" in America.  Pragmatists in the social sphere do not believe they are doing anything wrong; they are 'following the rules' that they discern through observation of social patterns.  

We often think of Channery as a conscious choice.  My write-up on Pragmatism and natural yielding to social hierarchies, whatever the setting, suggests that giving whites preferential treatment may instead be an unwitting extension of ordinary behavior.   Taken to its extreme, social opportunism accepts as given the racial hierarchy whites have created- and then supplicates to whites, disregards or treats less well other Asians.   Because of that, self-monitoring as well as properly assessing and undercutting Asian accomodationists is important.   

We mustn't fall into the trap of raw social pragmatism but neither should we unconsciously reward Asians who do, just because they see the social or professional benefits of it.  Instead, we should expose their 'selling out' to others in subtle ways so, long-term, Asians are deterred from doing this.  Perhaps over time, we'll develop the language to stigmatize such people; for now, while I think Uncle Chan/Krishna are useful, they are often more too severe, and not credible for the vast majority of cases.  

Idealism- or in this case Asian identity- serves as a counter-balance to the instinctual tendency to ""go along to get along"".    Unhealthy degrees of pragmatism lingers in the Asian community from the scarcity mindset of immigrants.  Hopefully, we'll realize that   success goes well beyond the Western emphasis of Popularity or the Asian emphasis on Financial gain and Assimilation.  The 1st gen didn't combat social racism because they 'had bigger fish to fry'; because the poverty mindset meant accepting society as it was and being purely pragmatic to gain economic security.  The 2nd gen, benefiting from economic security, can see the bigger picture and act in accordance with their moral values, not just 'getting ahead' - whether in social or economic terms."
5m9s6n,34,2017-01-05,Why I think there will be a release in 2017,rosiest72,jaipaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/jaipaul/comments/5m9s6n/why_i_think_there_will_be_a_release_in_2017/,"Keep in mind what you are about to read is my thoughts and theories only and what I believe in is backed up by what I believe the evidence I have come up with means.

For starters, XL usually has 5 to 6 releases a year and sometimes announces what will be released at the beginning of the year.

I've deduced that these 5 or 6 releases will be Beck, The xx, Sigur Rós, Vampire Weekend, and Jai Paul. Whether there will be a 6th release, who knows? Beck has already released a couple singles for his upcoming album which is surely to release this year. The xx is already known to be releasing *I See You* next Friday. Sigur Rós have been touring while also playing new music at shows with a single having been released last year. The chances of an album coming out late this year are moderate to high. Vampire Weekend is tricky though. While they have been working on a new album and sources saying it could be released this year, there has also been talk of them signing to Columbia Records. So their release wouldn't really count as an XL release. The upcoming *New Gen* album could be considered as one of the 5/6 releases replacing Vampire Weekend if they do move to Columbia Records

But what we're really here for is Jai Paul. Given all the releases most likely to come out this year there would still be 1 or 2 more slots left. Here's where Jai comes in. Come April it will be 5 years since *Jasmine (Demo)* was released (by XL). We'll also reach 4 years since the leak happened. Given it usually takes 2 to 3 or even 4 years until an artist releases an album, now would be the opportune time for Jai to release something. There's been word that the leak really hindered Jai and rightfully so. Let's say he took the rest of the year mulling things over and keeping low; taking a break after what happened. 2014 comes and he's ready to put his all into his next big piece. He's most likely been working on this thing since then non-stop.

We know Rodaidh has been working with him. Here's where I start reaching a bit and draw my own conclusions. If we look at McDonald's [AllMusic](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rodaidh-mcdonald-mn0002398151/credits) credits he would average at least 5 projects he was involved in each year before and during 2013. But after that, he's only been involved in 2 projects in 2014, 1 in 2015, and 1 in 2016. Even then, in 2014 one of the projects he worked on was a compilation of songs of various artists that have already been released before so it's really only 1 project each year since 2014. During that time, we know he's been working with The xx, Sampha, Denai Moore and Jai Paul so that gives reason to why there's been such little co-production in projects seen these past few years. The former 2 are confirmed to be releasing their respective albums this year and that leaves the latter 2.

And then I reach a bit more by looking into Pat Shannahan who is known for her sample clearance skills. It's obvious Jai likes to use samples and who better to come aboard and help clear those than the expert herself? Her [AllMusic](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pat-shannahan-mn0001780819) credentials show she hasn't been a part of a project since 2013. In other words, since Jai's stuff was leaked. It isn't listed, but it's been said she cleared samples for The Avalanche's latest album released last year. I like to think she's been hard at work these past few years clearing samples for Jai while also helping out with *Wildflower*. Though in a recent [interview](http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/08/pat-the-detective-shannahan-interview) she explains why she's done less work each year recently so there's that. But something else mentioned in the same interview caught my attention.

&gt;One of my clients wanted this sample, this East Indian recording.

This kind of sample is right up Jai's alley. The chances of this meaning what I think it does is hard to say and it's all complete speculation, but like I said, she's an expert and I'm sure XL would want one if they want the best for Jai.

Some last bit of information: Jai Paul's [website](http://whois.domaintools.com/jaipaul.co.uk) is to be expired on 13 April of this year. The Paul Institute had been looking for interns back in December. Last year there were several people on Twitter stating they'd heard new Jai Paul.

In the end, it all falls down to Jai and whether he wants to release something. I just wanted to share my theories and I'm hopeful that something will be released this year be it a new single or a full-fledged album."
5m9wr3,0,2017-01-05,New Job (first job) and some questions!,NotSoInfamousE,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5m9wr3/new_job_first_job_and_some_questions/,"I just started my ""internship"" at a school district working in the finance department doing reporting and other small general IT things. Down the hall there is the technology department who handles everything that the normal visitor of this subreddit would handle.

So, my responsibilities are to manage our financial and hr management systems and their databases. We are the admins of the system and have full access to everybody's information and then we go and do all the SQL reporting that needs to be custom because the system's don't have those features. Blah, blah, I've only been here a week, so I'm learning.

I can't tell if since it's my first week that things are just going slow and will pick up, but so far there hasn't been jack shit for me to do. It took until Tuesday afternoon to get a working computer, the first machine wasn't imaging correctly. I got lucky with this second machine that there was an oversight I have local admin. My biggest surprise since starting has been that I walked into my bosses office on Monday/Tuesday and was talking to her about our databases and asked ""So, do we have an ERD or any diagrams at all for this thing?"" and she says ""Nope. The vendor gave us nothing."". Is this a common thing? I can't believe that a vendor would sell you a system with hundreds and hundreds of tables and then not provide any documentation. But then there's the next part that I just absolutely cannot figure out. There's no god damn foreign keys in this database. I used some other software (this is where having local admin pays off) to reverse the DDL file I got from SSMS and got a picture of this database. And there's a total of maybe 8-10 foreign keys out of hundreds of tables. How the fuck does this thing function?

Anyways, my boss wanted me to try and learn how to use SSRS instead of cognos just because of they way they have it setup, using cognos for reporting is kind of a bitch. So I got my report established in SSRS in 2 hours and have been waiting for days for the admin's to give me privileges on the SSRS server to get these reports up and running.

My biggest problems this week have been running into walls and needing more permissions / access to more servers. I'm asking the technology team to give me or my boss privileges to use diagrams in SSMS on the databases. I'm asking for rights to create stored procedures, I just keep running into walls where I can't do what I want without having to ask for permissions. Maybe it's because this is my first job and I've only learned in an environment where I had full control. But it really is a bitch to keep running into walls and feeling like if I keeping asking, they're going to start getting suspicious.

I guess my main questions out of all of this are as follows:

1. Is it common for the technology team and another team who heavily interface / depend on having access to the systems to be so separated and not allowed to speak to each other?

2. Are they going to start getting suspicious and asking questions about why I keep needing more and more? (Would you as a sysadmin be questioning my motives?)

3. Why do I feel like there is a DBA down that hall that has diagrams of these databases or even a data dictionary and my boss just isn't aware of it?

4. Is my job in the finance department a normal role? I feel like the things we're doing and some of the projects I'm being asked to start up are more of the ""IT"" realm, rather than just another department that uses the databases.

My main goals this week has been to starting creating documentation. When I walked in and my boss and coworker said ""you just have to go searching through hundreds of tables to figure out what links to what"", I was amazed. There's no way people can be expected to just ""work"" without being provided proper documentation.

TL;DR: This is my first job, I've been programming and learning databases since high school and everything I try to do is from the mindset of having free access. I just have some questions and don't want to overstep an boundaries."
5m9ygx,10,2017-01-05,"Parents semi-suicidal, dad has cancer - should I lie about having faith?",yohj,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/5m9ygx/parents_semisuicidal_dad_has_cancer_should_i_lie/,"Was a typical ""sleeping"" Christian until age 14. Then I got saved. Had the fire of Christ in me - shared gospel with tons of people, including strangers, even got in trouble at high school once for passing out too hellfire-ish gospel tracts at my public school, prayed/read the bible every day, was very active in church until age 17/18. From then until now (age 20.5) been a lukewarm christian (largely bc i concluded evolution was real and that there was biological causes for homosexuality). During the past two years especially past two months, my reasons for believing in Xtianity have decreased. Main arguments for me were archaeological, historical, and inconsistencies in the bible, as well as finally stumbling across a decent explanation that explained how the Bible could have come about if it wasn't true/God's Word (cf. The Documentary Hypothesis and other things).


Been an atheist since Dec 4th, 2016. Only have told two of my closest friends (who were both not believers) and my worship leader (I told her I was ""having doubts/questions"") as I played in my church's worship band and no longer wanted to keep playing.


I had considered coming out to my parents this Christmas break. But my dad has had cancer for the past 16 months (technically he's been in remission for past 4 months) and his health is still very bad (been in ER 2 times over the holidays already). He has been on death's door many times. I have been faking prayer throughout the break (my mom will ask me to pray out loud with her several times a day). During this break I have also learned both my parents have been having suicidal thoughts. My mom said yesterday if she weren't a Christian, she'd consider suicide.

I hate lying. I hate pretending that I'm a Christian, and I want to stop participating in my church activities when I go back to school (~2 hours away) as they take up 5 - 15 hours a week and I could use that time doing other things. I'd also like to be able to freely date non-Christian girls, have sex etc. But I also feel like coming out could push my parents into nervous breakdowns/ even worse, in what is already the most stressful time period of their lives.

I see the following options:

- 1) Keep staying fully active in church and just completely fake it. Church sunday, weekly bible study, worship team, and then social events with my small group [total 10-15 hours a week]

- 2) Do the bare minimum in church - bible study and service [4 hrs week], either fake it or admit to rest of bible study i don't believe or ""have doubts""

- 3) Not go to church at all, and then just tell my parents I am going

- 4) Not go to church at all, tell my parents I am not going, but still pretend I'm a believer and have just gotten busy with school or something

- 5) Not go to church, and when pressed admit I don't believe anymore


Which do you think is best?


Even if I don't come out to my parents there's still the question of coming out to my social circles. Do I finally let my self start partying/drinking/having sex? Do I stop censoring myself from saying thoughts that don't agree with a Christian worldview? I feel like eventually my parents would find out, and there's no guaranteeing that when they would find out that they would be out of their extremely stressful medical/financial situation. My dad could die any day or could stay disabled the rest of his life. I was going to ask my older brother for advice as he was sort of agnostic when growing up, but now it seems like my parents and I have shared the gospel with him so much over the years that he's a believer too (or maybe he's just faking it?)

I am financially independent (full ride scholarship to univ., but I plan on living with my uncle for free over the summer for an out of town internship and he is very Christian as well). Parents are very religious - both participated in anti-abortion rallies, shared gospel with people, spoken in tongues, creationists, equate liberals with evil/ignorance etc."
5ma5gq,30,2017-01-05,[B/s] I'm just updating that I went home for Christmas.,151andChocolate,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/5ma5gq/bs_im_just_updating_that_i_went_home_for_christmas/,"I'm back. Once again, just go to /u/151andChocolate/submitted/ to see everything so far. I am finally settled back at my apartment right now, and I've gotten used to being back at work. I went home for Christmas even though I was dreading it.

People are really trashing my brother. They are mostly sending me direct messages, and they might be just trying to get me to be their incest pen pal or something. Honestly, the people coming down hard on me are probably more correct. I don't know if anyone read one of my comments in my last post. I don't know how to link directly to comments.

I pushed and pushed until my brother agreed to have sex with me. I pushed and pushed saying that I would be fine with FWB and nothing else, especially since I was leaving for college. I was fine with him seeing other girls; everyone needs to sow their wild oats in my opinion. I am a little bit bisexual anyway. I just didn't realize all the feelings I was holding back for him, even before we had sex. He was the one nonjudgmental constant in my life. I wouldn't even mind sharing him with my friend, but they've made it clear more than once that isn't something their interested in pursuing. I can't blame her, and he is definitely the monogamous sort when he gets into a relationship.

I know I sound kind of bratty and immature. I don't have a diary, so I just sort of vented without a filter. I've said things I regret now, but I am not going to edit anything and pretend like I haven't fucked up. I'd rather own it and be able to say, ""at least, I am still not THAT fucked up."" I don't think I want anyone telling me how mature I am either or how well I am handling it. I'm not, and over a year of being shitty doesn't go away overnight. I've manipulated too many people, I need to just be better. I can't just change myself overnight either.

I've been trying to balance space and communication with my family. I've made it clear I still need space, but I am not holing myself in a room. I am answering calls and texts. I just let them know when I want some space. It is hard not to focus on what I had with my brother when I am with my family or talking to them. I'll probably think about it less as time goes on. I wasn't a hermit at Christmas either. I wasn't exactly a ray of fucking sunshine either, but I was trying at least. It helped that we had a lot of homes to visit. I wasn't really alone with my parents or my brother that much at any given time. I've been practicing the whole fake it til you make it sort of thing most of the time.

My friend, my brother's future wife, has been reminding me that I get free counseling at my college. I really hate therapists. I've been in therapy. I am wondering if these school counselors might irritate me less than people I've seen before. I just want someone that I can say whatever the fuck is on my mind to without them interjecting if I don't want them to. Obviously, I can tell them about the incest, but it is easy enough to leave that fact out and say he is close to our family. I am only considering it because my brother actually broke down in private in front of me. It happened around Christmas. He misses having me around, and he felt like his decisions have left me fucked up for the rest of my life. They were barely even his decisions considering how much I manipulated those decisions. I really owe it to him to try harder to fix everything between us and our parents. 

My dad keeps going around unsure of what he wants to say. My mom keeps pretending like nothing is wrong to a level that is actually creepy. She just might have been on a happy high since I was home for Christmas and did some bargain shopping with her and my friend after Christmas. I'd probably lose my mind if I was still living there, but I know I need to be more of a fixture at home. I still won't be coming home for the summer though. I have an internship lined up, and I honestly do love my major and career plans. That is why it has been so easy to just focus on my studies. I just have to remember not to forget everything else going on.

5mae6d,81,2017-01-05,[B/S] Just Sent this Letter to My Parents About Me and My Sister. Names changed.,lettertoendallletter,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/5mae6d/bs_just_sent_this_letter_to_my_parents_about_me/,"Dear Mom and Dad,

I want you to imagine that I met the woman of my dreams. A girl who is smart, funny, caring, loving, and loves me so much she would do *anything* for me and my family. Someone who makes me laugh more than anyone and cries with me when I'm sad. Someone who shares my values about the world - about justice and fairness, human rights, freedom. Someone who shares my deepest beliefs, and imagine she's so awesome she actually shares yours too! I want you to imagine that she's so kind that she would give her coat to someone off the street at the age of 16 in the middle of the winter because she saw he was homeless and shivering. Imagine she's so smart that she has gotten all A's since she was in 3rd grade except for a semester in college, and went on to finish post-graduate work in molecular biology that works on finding ways to help defeat certain kinds of cancer. Imagine she's so loving that she offered to give her friend a kidney when her friend was in a situation where she may have needed it. Imagine her values are so congruent with mine, and with yours, that if you asked her what was most important to her in the world, she would say the same three things you taught me: Loving Family, Ethics and Kindness, Seeking the Truth. Imagine that she's so beautiful she makes me catch my breath every time I look at her. I drop things when she walks into the room sometimes. Imagine she's so strong and passionate, that when she was at risk of losing both her internship and failing her class in the most important semester of her life, she ran on a couple hours of sleep a night for 6 weeks, used coffee and exercise and destroyed every obstacle in her way. While still making a little time for her family. Imagine that she'd be the best partner I could ever hope for to share my life with.

Imagine that I love her so much, that I would never let anything hurt her or harm her. I'd take a bullet for her, or a thousand. I'd give her every ounce of love and effort I have. I'd make sure I finished medical school and every barrier in between it and getting a job, not only for myself and my dreams, but motivated during my most difficult nights of studying, so that I could provide for her and for our children. That every dream I ever hoped for in a woman, she fulfills. That I know her inside and out, her every hope, dream, desire, and would never let anything happen to her. That I am so totally in love with her, that there isn't a man on Earth except her own father who sacrifice everything he is in order to take care of her. That I'd move to any place on Earth, if I had to, to be with her, to marry her, to love her till my last breath. 

Imagine that I love her so much, that if a doctor said for some reason, she couldn't have children or there was some issue with me or her or us, that I'd throw it to the wind, and stay with her and adopt so that whatever family I had, it would be with her. 

I'd hope that you'd be happy for me. That you'd be happy for her. Happy for me that I'm so in love. Happy for her that she has me to love her and that I care for her so much, and you know that anything I've ever done, I've done with all of my heart.

Imagine that people judged me and her for being together and made our lives difficult. That this woman who is like my air, my water, who I'm so in love with that I feel every little bit of pain she feels and want nothing more than to live a normal life with, full of the kind of love and happiness I saw you two share, is being kept from me because of what other people think.

Now imagine, that its Kayla. That the girl I love is Kayla. My sister. Your daughter. You probably figured it out from the little story details I put in there.

You can stop imagining Mom, Dad. Because it is. It is Kayla. And everything I wrote is true. I want you to go up to the top and read this again. I want you to read Dad, that Kayla is in the hands of the ONE MAN on Earth BESIDES you, who would, literally, die for her. Mom, I want you to read that there's no one on Earth who could ever know her as well, take care of her as well, know her every fear and hope and dream as well as me. That there isn't a girl on this planet who could make me as happy.

Everything you would ever want for me in a woman, Kayla is. And everything you'd ever want for Kayla, she tells me, as I write this :)  I am. 
It doesn't matter that we share genetic material. It doesn't matter that she's my sister. I will cherish her and serve her and protect her, for the rest of my life.

We have a lot more to tell you, but nothing that beats this revelation honestly. We are driving in Friday like I told you and will fly out to school again on Sunday. We wanted to give you a few days to process it. And I'm expecting you to yell at us on the family telegram group two minutes after you read this or get a thousand calls. That's ok. Say everything you need to say. But I want you to read the beginning of the letter over and over again until I tell you it is me and her and realize how real, how beautiful, how perfect this is.

You have the right to know everything, and we won't hide anything from you and we won't tell anyone except you.  

Kayla is sitting next to me as I write this and this letter is from her as much as it is from me, but in case you decide to be really mad at one of us, you can take it out on me first :)

We love you so much, we are thankful to you for every moment of love you gave us both and continue to give us. You are the guiding lights in both our lives, our compasses, our roots. Every good thing Kayla and I have, whether it's our successes, our health, our happiness, we owe to you. We both love you and we are so, so sorry that this letter is such a shock, and such a disappointment to you in so many ways. We know that our family is as straight-shooting as it comes, and I promise, we won't do anything or say anything publicly to hurt you or embarrass you. We will figure this out.

We can't wait to see you. 

Love, forever and always.

I have an offer for a technology internship at Nordstrom. I would like to know if anyone reading this thread has done it before. The pay seems equivalent to what a software developer would earn at a non technology oriented but a huge brand value company. 
Should I go ahead? Lot of my applications elsewhere are in queue. And ideally they say a bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
My personal aim is to be at a technology oriented firm for the simple reason of brand value. According to my understanding an internship at a lesser known but a technology oriented firm will help better my resume more than a technical internship at a non tech firm. Please help if anyone has any ideas. Thank you. "

I am in a master's program away from my country, away from my family and friends. My first worry is about getting an internship for this summer, second about finances, third about finding someone to be in a serious relationship with.

Apart from all this, I think I just keep finding things to worry about or self pity about. I am not doing anything productive, I am slacking off in applying for internships (cuz looking at LinkedIn scares the hell out of me).  Everything good that happened in my life seems soon far off.

I wake up every morning with anxiety and every time I take a nap, I feel anxious. I feel anxious all evenings. Even the smallest things like going to the bank make me anxious. I don't know why. And then the worst of it is that I start crying.

My therapist says I should hang out with people, talk to someone, keep myself busy. But that's not always feasible (my friends have studies too). Besides it doesn't seem to be addressing the root cause. Can someone please tell me what to do? I have been meditating, doesn't seem to be helping much."

Imagine that she's so beautiful she makes me catch my breath every time I look at her. I drop things when she walks into the room sometimes. Imagine she's so strong and passionate, that when she was at risk of losing both her internship and failing her class in the most important semester of her life, she ran on a couple hours of sleep a night for 6 weeks, used coffee and exercise and destroyed every obstacle in her way. While still making a little time for her family. Imagine that she'd be the best partner I could ever hope for to share my life with.

Imagine that I love her so much, that I would never let anything hurt her or harm her. I'd take a bullet for her, or a thousand. I'd give her every ounce of love and effort I have. I'd make sure I finished medical school and every barrier in between it and getting a job, not only for myself and my dreams, but motivated during my most difficult nights of studying, so that I could provide for her and for our children. That every dream I ever hoped for in a woman, she fulfills. That I know her inside and out, her every hope, dream, desire, and would never let anything happen to her. That I am so totally in love with her, that there isn't a man on Earth except her own father who sacrifice everything he is in order to take care of her. That I'd move to any place on Earth, if I had to, to be with her, to marry her, to love her till my last breath.

Imagine that I love her so much, that if a doctor said for some reason, she couldn't have children or there was some issue with me or her or us, that I'd throw it to the wind, and stay with her and adopt so that whatever family I had, it would be with her.

I'd hope that you'd be happy for me. That you'd be happy for her. Happy for me that I'm so in love. Happy for her that she has me to love her and that I care for her so much, and you know that anything I've ever done, I've done with all of my heart.

Imagine that people judged me and her for being together and made our lives difficult. That this woman who is like my air, my water, who I'm so in love with that I feel every little bit of pain she feels and want nothing more than to live a normal life with, full of the kind of love and happiness I saw you two share, is being kept from me because of what other people think.

Now imagine, that its Kayla. That the girl I love is Kayla. My sister. Your daughter. You probably figured it out from the little story details I put in there.

You can stop imagining Mom, Dad. Because it is. It is Kayla. And everything I wrote is true. I want you to go up to the top and read this again. I want you to read Dad, that Kayla is in the hands of the ONE MAN on Earth BESIDES you, who would, literally, die for her. Mom, I want you to read that there's no one on Earth who could ever know her as well, take care of her as well, know her every fear and hope and dream as well as me. That there isn't a girl on this planet who could make me as happy.

Everything you would ever want for me in a woman, Kayla is. And everything you'd ever want for Kayla, she tells me, as I write this :) I am. It doesn't matter that we share genetic material. It doesn't matter that she's my sister. I will cherish her and serve her and protect her, for the rest of my life.

We have a lot more to tell you, but nothing that beats this revelation honestly. We are driving in Friday like I told you and will fly out to school again on Sunday. We wanted to give you a few days to process it. And I'm expecting you to yell at us on the family telegram group two minutes after you read this or get a thousand calls. That's ok. Say everything you need to say. But I want you to read the beginning of the letter over and over again until I tell you it is me and her and realize how real, how beautiful, how perfect this is.

You have the right to know everything, and we won't hide anything from you and we won't tell anyone except you.

Kayla is sitting next to me as I write this and this letter is from her as much as it is from me, but in case you decide to be really mad at one of us, you can take it out on me first :)

We love you so much, we are thankful to you for every moment of love you gave us both and continue to give us. You are the guiding lights in both our lives, our compasses, our roots. Every good thing Kayla and I have, whether it's our successes, our health, our happiness, we owe to you. We both love you and we are so, so sorry that this letter is such a shock, and such a disappointment to you in so many ways. We know that our family is as straight-shooting as it comes, and I promise, we won't do anything or say anything publicly to hurt you or embarrass you. We will figure this out.

We can't wait to see you.

Love, forever and always. -Adam and Kayla

---My Situation--- I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate.

*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out  more relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci minor, that might also be an asset if I seek out if employers are interested in ""hard"" skills. There's not much in the way of opportunities down here, in terms of jobs, so I'm willing to relocate to upper areas of Texas. I live in the RGV of South Texas currently. After talking with my Career Advisor, I just might have a marketing internship lined up for me in the spring. I know there’s opportunities in places like San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, Galveston. 

I'm interested to hear honest feedback on my dilemma; if I can honestly work with what I have, or not. Thank you."

A large portion of CS classes and experience is coming next semester, but it will be too late to add by then and I can't really talk about them in my resume currently since I don't know the details/projects of the courses.

 I am planning on buying a car in about a year and a half. I really like the idea of actually gaining interest on my money. While i wait until then I would like my money to grow to put down a good initial deposit on the car.

I currently have a little less than $2k in a 1.05% APY savings account with Synchrony Bank. It will grow to about $9k after my internship this summer. It seems like a nice moderate and safe option for growth.

Since I'm young (21) and don't really have any bills or anything right to worry about (I have college covered with jobs and scholarships) I thought maybe some more aggressive strategies could work.

I've seen stuff like Wise Banyan for hassle free investing that they manage without fees and that seems rather attractive but I'm not savvy with any of that so I wanted to ask you all.

What would you recommend? "

5mbo57,2,2017-01-05,"[NeedAdvice] grad student behind in program, considering other things, need help getting my head straight.",thrwawy2223,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5mbo57/needadvice_grad_student_behind_in_program/,"Hi all,

So, I am in year 2 of grad school and way behind. Just starting to get myself together. During my first year I did the coursework but little else. Now that I am expected to do research, I'm behind on my project and very anxious about my future and also what people in the department think about me. 

I was on an SSRI that was contributing to the amotivation, but I also have always had a severe lack of discipline. Over the summer I withdrew from this medication w/o consulting a doctor and had somewhat of a mental breakdown, but I am much better now, on better meds, and seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. 

However, I'm still struggling. I always have a million things swimming around in my head at once, and internet addiction on top of all those interests and anxieties. My thesis (experiment) is way behind schedule and it looks like I'll have to ask the department for an extension. I have the feeling that I have a bad reputation amongst the faculty (beside my advisor who has been supportive) and generally I feel bad about myself. I've been working a lot more and making progress though since I've changed medications.

I am unsure whether I want to stay in the program, and even if I did, it's completely possible that my department will not advance me. I do have a real interest in the tech industry, doing industry research and I have some job experience which might help me get a foot in the door. That being said, since I feel like I haven't given school a fair shot, my project is still my priority. 

Here are all the things I've been thinking about/need to do, but I need help prioritizing them, staying on task, and eliminating the performance anxiety I feel which encourages me to procrastinate:

* Reading papers directly related to the literature review for my thesis
* Reading papers of general interest in my field that I should have read last year when I was underperforming
* General menial tasks related to my thesis project (editing, coding, etc)
* Statistics and R programming Coursera course (Helpful both for thesis and if I want to go into industry research)
* Industry research Coursera course
* Internship applications for industry research this summer
* guitar practice
* friends

Obviously some of these are more urgent than others and I have some sense of priority and have been doing the most work on thesis tasks, but whenever I work on anything, all the other things are swimming around in my head. Any advice?"

I've had a handful of phone screens and code tests, but nothing in-person yet.


I've been applying to jobs everyday on LinkedIn, Indeed, Gamasutra, and my school's job board (which is horrible). I've gotten feedback from here on my resume multiple times, and most people said it looks solid overall. I've probably been applying to about 3-5 jobs a day. Junior/associate positions seem very rare, and its even harder to find a job that matches my skills. So I've been applying to anything even remotely close.


I've probably applied to 150+ jobs by now. I didn't start seriously applying until around October/November (I was still working a lot to provide for my family). I've only been applying on those job boards that I listed above. Sometimes that involves being directed to the actual company website and applying.


I had an 18 month internship, but it was a government position, so they were unable to immediately offer a full-time position afterwards (you need to take a test and go on a waitlist, which I have done).


I had a phone screen yesterday for a gaming company, followed by a 2 hour code test of 2 questions. I managed to only pass 4/8 test cases for each question (the questions were very weird, but I felt like I could have passed given a bit more time), and they haven't responded to me since, which really got my hopes down. I've been studying CTCI diligently and doing leetcode for the past month or so.



Any advice would be appreciated. Am I looking in the wrong places? Am I just underqualified as a programmer?"

__________________________________________________________________________________________
I'm currently a senior with two semesters left going to one of top 10 computer engineering school in our nation.
I am under an academic probation for having my cumulative GPA at 2.7 (TGPA below 2.0 due to one failed course.)

Two semesters left, no internship under my belt. I've relied on my intelligence to carry me through school. 4.0 and came to this prestigious school while playing about 5~6 hours a day along with extracurricular activity. I still don't think I've matured out of that.

I'm still a very social person and most of my friends don't even know that I'm an active gamer nor that I'm top ranked in lot of games (Noticeably current top 500 in overwatch and league of legends. Participated in pro gaming scene for two different game (FPS and fighting))

My parent who is first generation aren't very fluent in English and hasn't seen my transcript once or took part in my academic life. My peers think I'm some kind of genius elitist because I help around whenever someone asks a coding question and I'm above average with programming among my peers just because I seem to understand the problem and find a way to solve them efficiently.

But my GPA is garbage from not attending lectures and not doing homework that isn't coding. My one F in the transcript is because one of my teammates cheated on a final project that counts for 30% of our grade which resulted in 0 for our entire team. I also worked full-time to financially support myself while going to school. I slept on average about 4~5 hours a day to play a video game, meet people, work, and spend the least amount of time just to get by at school.

My current standing is a senior with two semesters left (with summer for an internship in between). Over entire college period, I sent out about a total of 15 resumes got 4 interviews failed 3 and got into one where I worked as an IT... I wouldn't really call this an ""internship"".

I want to get an internship, I want to break off from gaming. I want someone to just slap me and force me to do stuff at this point because I keep making goals to solve problems on OJ leet code, enhance my personal project, and most importantly send out resumes yet... I just play video games and push it to tomorrow. This has been my last 3weeks and I realize that I'm a game addict... 

I say that I want a better life yet I don't put in 1/3 the effort of people around me.
How do you guys think I should go about pushing myself to just do it?
I don't think I can ever break off from a gaming completely just because of all the relationships with people that revolve around it.

I feel like I'm just letting my life slip by seeing it is one week into 2017 already."

BS Computer Science, graduating May. 3.8 GPA one year at top 25 school with a 4.0 before transferring to state school for family reasons.

GRE: Taking it this week but so far practice tests have given me 166/166/5.5. Believe it may be higher since I've been studying since then.

Work as a Software Engineer at top competitive tech company. Multiple internships and part-time work experience, as well as full-time offers to top tech companies. $130k+ salary out of college.

Founded a tech startup that folded after seed round funding, some research experience, also have an unrelated patent pending through another company.

Plan for afterwords is to move into consulting while working on startup. Very precise goals and thorough research on why I'm getting an MBA from talking to upper management and surveying tech leaders. Career goal is to move beyond entry-level engineering eventually into executive/CTO role.

Deferral gap will be spent abroad doing an international business fellowship before working in Japan for two years.

Applying to MIT deferred, Stanford deferred, Harvard 2+2, considering Yale Silver Scholars but may be too late. Any other suggestions appreciated.

I understand I'm a little out of the norm for the average MBA applicant, which is why I'm a little curious what I should try and emphasize/improve. AFAIK the programs I'm applying to are the only ones that encourage college seniors to apply. They waive the application fee so I figured I'd give it my best.

5mcfdo,39,2017-01-06,Last year I was on the news for leaving a suicide note in my dorm room and now I can't fit in socially or thrive professionally,raspberrysorbetto,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5mcfdo/last_year_i_was_on_the_news_for_leaving_a_suicide/,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet, as I've had to explain it too many times.

I go to high-profile college.
Last year due to a number of issues, I became depressed and suicidal.

Convinced I'd do it, I left a note in my room and went to go do it, but changed my mind before I could follow through (due to a risk of cowardice and a sliver of hope.)

I was reported missing, a fiasco ensued, I didn't return for a week, and when I returned, everything was different. I stopped getting invited to parties. People stopped talking to me. The guy I was dating stopped asking me out. I don't think people hated me, they just didn't know how to react. Or maybe they did. I don't know.

Everything is still shit. There are 5 pages of news articles of this when you Google my name.

The thing I miss most is feeling young. I'm 19, but I feel 50. I don't feel invincible. I don't feel like anything is possible for me. I don't feel like the world is my oyster. I don't feel like I can make any more mistakes. I don't feel carefree, ever. I only see myself through the eyes of the people who called me psycho and made me feel less than human. I only see the stigma, and the shame, and the scrutiny. All I want is to have fun. People try to recommend therapy, coping mechanisms, blah blah blah. Like I'm perpetually sick. I don't want any of that. I want to be a kid, and enjoy myself. But there's nobody who wants to enjoy life with me anymore, because everyone stays away from me.

What do I want?
I want to be happy. I want to have social connections, and be successful. I want to get a respectable internship and feel like I could actually have a shot at a high-profile job. I want to feel like nothing is impossible for me if I put in effort. Like this event wouldn't disqualify me from being trusted with responsibility if I met the credentials. I used to want a career in politics, but I'm so demoralized that I've completely limited my goals. I just know the media would dig this up and have a field day, and I'd have to relive it all over again only to be called mentally unfit to govern. I know how America sees people like me. I'm a black female, so I already had strikes against me before any of this bullshit went down. 

But what do I need, if nothing else?
I need to be acceptable. To be normal. To smile again. To believe that I actually have a shot at my dreams. To believe that I'm not a lost cause. To believe that the world still wants what I have to offer. To feel alive again, instead of just living. To feel like I haven't been robbed of a path to my goals. A never-ending list of wants. Each quite simple yet, at least now, completely outside of my grasp. It all feels impossible. I feel like society, and my school, and most people, won't let me. Sure, I can act confident or happy, but at the end of the day nobody is buying it. I can act how I want, but when there's no external validation towards it that's all it can ever amount to...an act. I feel trapped with this awful reputation and this awful stigma. I feel stifled and limited by the Google results. I feel like I'll never rise above my past, and I just don't know how to thrive.

I know this is a lot to take in, but any advice to any part of this is welcome. I need all the perspective I can get, because I spend the majority of my time mulling things over in my own head. It's not that I'm reclusive. I try getting involved but nobody wants me to be involved. So where do I go from here? "

Not fitting in, long hours, and commute?",SirAccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5mci86/scared_and_anxious_to_start_in_big4_not_fitting/,"I interned in tax this past summer and it was okay. Good hours, sat all day and did minuscule work. Ate good food at training, had good intern events. However, the more I think about it, it was all just sugar coating for what's to come.

After the internship I came to realize that I didn't want to do tax. I feel like tax are for those who are good at problem solving, which I am not. I am super dumb, and it takes me a while to ""get"" tax. So, I changed my FT offer to assurance/audit.

I'm nervous because I don't have a type A personality. I'm an ISFJ, I listen. I talk when needed and I don't really engage in conversation. It's hard for me to relate to big 4 people because I seem to like other stuff than what they like. I'd rather talk about art, games, nature than talk about golf or any of that shit.

I also live almost and an hour and 15 minutes away from the office. During summer it would be fine because I was in tax. I stayed in the office majority of the time. But now that I'm in audit, I'm just afraid that my commute would be a disadvantage since I'll be at client sites, traveling etc. 

I also read horrible stories about staff burning out after like a year or so and how public has deteriorated their mental health and public health. 

I was excited to start for the big 4, now I'm  not. 

Also the cpa has been making me super depressed. I've crammed BEC in a week and am taking it in 3 days. I am utterly fucked.

5mcla1,3,2017-01-06,[21F] I think I'm subconsciously trying to accumulate enough reasons to kms,yourhomegirl,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5mcla1/21f_i_think_im_subconsciously_trying_to/,"TLDR: diagnosed with hppd, severe anxiety and depression, went out of country to see dad after 8 years, came back and felt good so didn't work for 2 months, had a lot of debt, got a job when classes started, in campus bathroom saw a wallet stole money, admitted and returned everything still got arrested now facing 3 felonies, work was exhausting bc of sleeping problems so I got a sugar dad- which btw not mentioned in the long version I got attached to (fuck), and got tested for herpes- doc thinks I have it results come next week. Mom is crazy, I keep thinking someone is listening and watching me especially in my car.

-

Back in Spring 2015 I was at a rave or concert with my four others and we all took molly. It was my first time taking this drug- Prior I have only tried marijuana and alcohol. As a result, I did not get a wink of sleep for two whole months straight (or more, it's hard to tell). I had a lot of anxiety and visited 30 different specialized doctors, 3 ER visits because of anxiety, and 12 or 17 different prescriptions for sleep aids, anti-psychotic, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and for chronic headache. I was finally able to sleep again, gradually adding more hours, from going on Zoloft. But going on Zoloft made me wake up with visual snow/static, and onto afterimages, trails following object in motion, etc. I was later diagnosed with Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD). At this point I was getting Ds and Fs when I used to only get As. I became impulsive, started dying my hair, cutting it, wearing makeup differently, spending money I didn't have, getting piercings, and so on. Later I switched to Lexapro. On it I went to visit my Dad in motherland March 2016, the last time I saw him was early October in 08', I stayed for 1.5 months, came back, didn't work or have classes for about 2 months, then switched to Effexor XR. So while for Fall 2015, and Spring 2016, I had very poor marks, recently Fall 2016, I took four classes and got 3 As and 1 B. I got off my antidepressant the first week of December. 

From not working for the two months after I came back from motherland, I accumulated a lot of debt. At that time, I paid $400 in car insurance every month along with $375 of monthly car payments, and ~$30 in health insurance. I had to borrow money to meet those deadlines. I didn't get a job as soon as possible because I realized my sleep and mental health significantly improved with decreased stress- it was my attempt to remain on vacation even though it was over. I was overdue for a job so I finally got one.

It was around this time classes started. I went to the girl's bathroom and noticed a Louis Vuitton wallet on the toilet dispenser. Inside was ~$215 in cash. I analyzed the wallet, she was a white, blonde, blue eyed woman about my age, who looked like she had a good life and me taking this cash would not affect her. I was negative in my bank account, I needed money to pay off bills. So I took the cash. But I left everything else there because when I had my wallet stolen, it was a pain replacing everything I had lost. Then I went upstairs, thought about how the police didn't care about my situation when I was the victim, and how the bank credited me all of the $950 from my debit card, so I went back to the bathroom and took her debit and credit card. I did feel guilty. I was asking for reassurance from my friends, and even had trouble driving home that day because it was weighing over my mind. Later that evening I got an email from campus Police regarding a missing item. (I think they looked at the camera facing the ladies room entrance/exit) Not even 5 minutes had passed and I’m dialing the phone number from the message. I started off with a lie but eventually told the truth as soon as they mentioned “things will go easier,” and “no one is pressing charges.” 

That same night I got an envelope and put all her belongings in it with an index card and a message along time lines of “I’m sorry, I don’t remember if it was $213 or $215 but here is $220, I hope this doesn’t affect your faith in humanity.” My friend at class that following day and I had errands the next, so I requested for her to deliver it to the station for me. Long story short: they wanted me to come in, I didn’t understand why, they told me I “need to sign some things,” so I went in and then and there I learn charges were being pressed against me, I was arrested, and now I have a court date coming up facing 3 felonies (grand larceny &lt;$200, credit card theft, credit card theft). I felt awful, I sent the victim a long message through Facebook explaining myself- not justifying- of why I did what I did and how sorry and deeply regretful I am. She ignored it. When I went to meet the Student Conduct Coordinator on campus to receive sanctions, he told me the victim claims I’m lying and I took ~$400. I did not.

All the while the new job I found was hosting at a restaurant. Though I was sleeping again, it was not the restful sleep I knew all my life. By the end of every shift I felt both high and drunk, unable to talk to customers, slow reactions, half asleep, basically if you looked at me it would almost seem like no one’s home. So I turned to something easier. I got on a website where me a young college girl, can meet older rich men (Sugar Daddys), act like their girlfriend, and get huge compensations. So I quit my job, and started doing that instead. But so many men have taken advantage of my naivety, and so many men made me hate people especially men. At a point I would see neighbors outside and would wonder how they would act if they knew they could get away with it.

I used to have amazing memory, people would always comment “wow, you remember all that?” Now it’s hard to remember what I even did this morning. When I talk to someone it takes a long time for me to process what they had just said. It was never like this before. Oftentimes I don’t want to keep them waiting on a response so I’ll say something and a few days later, after I have processed the situation, I realize I didn’t mean what I said. When someone speaks to me in English, I know they are saying something, but it sounds like noise with no value. The classes at college used to be so easy. The tests easier. Now I try harder than I ever have. I feel stupider. It’s so hard to learn things now. I used to learn things and they would stick to me, now I have to tell myself to let it stick, and even then it doesn’t work. I feel stagnate, stuck, my reality is like a dream (depersonalization/derealization), because of all this I feel depressed this is who I am. I still have H.P.P.D. visual symptoms, along with tinnitus, and physical symptoms of anxiety when I sleep my entire body feels like it’s vibrating (kind of like when your foot falls asleep). Also I’m too afraid to even apply for internships and jobs because of court. I don’t want it to confirm my fear that this case has just made it harder for me to work for a company. I constantly hope to be killed/murdered; I don’t want to suicide though, that feels more preventable. 

Also I think it’s important to also mention my Mom was always physically and emotionally abusive. She is better only now but I think it’s cause I’m sponsoring her green card. My Mom doesn’t know anything I’m going through. My friends on the other hand do know but easily forget. And I got tested for herpes today. My doctor is pretty positive, I get the results next week. Also experiencing paranoia. I keep looking around when I get out of my park thinking someone is waiting for me. Usually the someone I expect is a boy I'm seeing- like Sugar Dad. "

First off, thanks to all participants in this sub.  It has become my most frequented, and I spend countless time here daily.  Even if experiences are not my own, I try to learn from everything I read here.    

So, regarding the car.  I was in a bind when I purchased; I needed something dependable quickly.  I ended up with exactly that, which is great, however my credit made this a very unfriendly deal.  My only option was a 7 year term at something absurd like 18%.  The only good news here is while I was starting an internship as a software developer, I was also working part-time at a car dealership so the total price was a great deal, only around 14k, for a 2014 Fusion with only 30k miles, and a 100k mile warranty.  I am coming up on my third year in the term having not missed a single payment.  However my credit has not budged whatsoever.  I  have zero credit card debt, all my bills are paid on time, and the only things hurting my credit are a few poorly timed medical bills that came at a time without insurance(ranging 5-7 years ago).    

Without inadvertently turning this into a credit recovery discussion, does anyone have any advice on how I can possibly refinance, and hopefully lower the payments or shorten the term?  Like I said, I read this sub every day, and I could be using that money for emergency funds, IRAs, index funds, etc.  I am open to just about anything short of selling the car(this would take some major convincing).    

Thanks in advance for reading, and any insight that can be offered.  I really value /r/personalfinance's opinion, and hopefully something positive will come of this post!    

Thanks

5mdcbp,2,2017-01-06,So I lost the last bit of hope I had,themanwholosthope,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5mdcbp/so_i_lost_the_last_bit_of_hope_i_had/,"Hello. 

For my whole life I didn't care much for human contact - I was fine with reading books, playing video games, generally enjoying things by myself. It all changed in summer of 2015, when I shared an internship with a girl, let's call her P. At first I was kinda cautious, but she turned out to be very friendly and kind. I quickly grew very fond of her and longed for her companion. There wasn't enough work for both of us, so we were spending a lot of time together. But, finally the internship ended and I was very sad when it came time to say goodbye. We promised to meet sometime in the future.

Getting to know her made me change my way of thinking - I realised that other people are valuable and I started to work on relationships. I started to make friends and enjoy their company. Because of P, I decided that I needed to better myself. I started going to the gym and picked up playing guitar. I don't know, you could say she became my muse.

We studied on the same university, so we sometimes run into each other or hung out after classes. We often didn't see each other for weeks at a time and I was going crazy. I never missed anybody so much, I didn't even think it was possible. Still, I didn't want to be too annoying, she had other things to do as well. However, after meeting with her, I was very sad because I knew this meant I won't see her for some time.

During last year, I had several girls interested in me in the romantic sense, but it didn't work out. Every time I went out with one of them, the whole time I was thinking ""Man, I wish this was P"". The girls vere attractive, funny, I couldn't say anything wrong about them, but I just didn't feel the same connection like with P.

I decided that I need to take the risk and tell her everything. Yesterday I came over to hang out with her, and I finally said how I felt about her. P was very nice about it, but kinda sad. She explained that she liked me very much and knew right away that I would be a good friend, but she had a boyfriend for several years, so that's it. 

I was very surprised, because there was literally no clue towards her being in a relationship. There were situations when it seemed like she was into me. Whenever she told me about somewhere she went, it was always with her friends or parents, not a word about a bf. I was prepared for rejection, but felt like I never even had a chance, because she was already with somebody.

I guess that's on me - should've asked her if she was in a relationship. 

Anyway, now I probably won't see her ever again. She said she doesn't want to push me away and we could still hang out, but I don't think it would be possible. 

I really wanted to get this off my chest and am seriously thinking about going to some therapy. I don't think I can deal with this on my own. I realise that it's not healthy to depend on someone so much. She was the force that kept me going, I enjoyed doing things with her in mind.

I guess I imagined this perfect world where we would be a happy couple, but now i know we can't be together.

I don't know how to go on."

**Current Situation:**

* Have been keeping in touch with local recruiter seeking out potential MC Officer candidates the past few months
* Recently began regularly attending PT with local Marines every MW morning to improve my endurance/learn more about how things work 
* Projected graduation date: Fall 2018
* Though I have obligations the upcoming summer which would prevent me from participating in any sort of extended training, I intend to keep the entire following summer of 2018 open in case I do follow through with this opportunity.

**Timeline:** What would my timeline in potentially becoming an officer look like, from training to potentially being selected, to signing? I still have very much I feel like I do not know, despite any research completed on my own time. I figured it would be best to reach out to those more knowledgeable on the recruiting timeline. 

**Current projection:**
Spring 2017 [classes]
Summer 2017 [internship]
Fall 2017 [study abroad]
Spring 2018 [classes]
Summer 2018 [no obligations yet]
Fall 2018 [graduate]

**Personal life/relationships:** I am currently in a long-term relationship. 

* What would I need to keep in mind when it comes to how joining will affect my personal life?
* What is a yearly schedule like for someone in active duty? 

-----

**Presidency:** I have had many individuals warning me to consider the fact that Trump is now president. Research tells me that Trump’s presidency likely makes little difference on deployment/lifestyle and that it should not hold any weight when considering joining. 

* What are your thoughts on this?

-----

**PT:** I have grown up as an athlete and love keeping myself physically fit. I currently run 3 miles in ~24 minutes (still working on it). 

* I am weakest in pull-ups. Any advice in improving?
* Any advice at all in regards to form/things to watch out for when being tested?

-----

**MC Aviation:** Is anyone available for further PMs about MC Aviation roles?

5mdyyf,1,2017-01-06,Is this woman worth LTR?,fakeplastictrees87,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/5mdyyf/is_this_woman_worth_ltr/,"Prepare for long read, but it's interesting. Didn't experience this one before.    

Just to say, I got access to all her Facebook messages history, Whatsapp history and all I read, she always told me the truth.    

She said she slept with 6 guys, including me.    
Based on her chat history with her female friends.    

- First boyfriend of 3 years (he cheated on her, without sex on party - girl jumped on him, and he fingered her, but she ofc stayed with him, it was first and virginity taker)    
- Guy she hosted at her parents home 2 years after she was studying with him, based on chats she liked him 2 years ago but nothing happened (she told he came for 1 day and she initiated, she says she didn't have sex for 2 years, so she was thirsty + lust from before). He is in different country, so obv she didn't have intention for LTR.    
- Guy she slept during NY 2014/2015(5 days for new year) and she sniffed cocaine (knowing him by mutual friend who visited them, and then that guy inivited her to the place). alpha i guess. He cheated with her on gf, but told her after, he obv never fucked her after, while she still trying to contact him. Obv he lived in London, so she couldn't have LTR intention with him..    
- Guy she slept in 2015/2016 while on internship in London, it was bartender that she just wanted for fun - she told me she wanted some fun. another alpha that stopped responding to her after he was ocassionaly fucking her over the period of 2 months. No LTR intention obv..    
- Guy in start of June 2016(over weekend) - Friend she liked back 4 years in uni as well, but didn't happen. She hosted him in her place in London. He is from Ireland, so obv dunno how this would work LTR. She said to her female friend, he came in 2 min and was not sexy, so sex was definitely decider for losing interest in him, and that now at least she is happy to know what she could've missed at least..... ..
    
The thing is all sex that happened, she always discussed with her female friends, so I am quite surprised she was honest with these 5 guys based on chat history (if something happened that she didn't tell her buddies, that's other story).    
    
- She told me she almost slept with one guy in uni after kissing 2 guys, but he didn't want to fuck her because they were drunk. I read the same in messages how she explained to her girls.    
    
- She told me wanted to fuck the guy who had girlfriend, which she actually ate with, while with him, when girlfriend visited, and this is what bothers me the most. She told me this, and texts confirm as well, that she wanted to fuck him and showing no mercy to other woman, but she didn't fuck him because it end up not having a chance.    

So she was always telling me the truth. I read from the texts, that she wanted to steal a guy from a girl, unsuccessfuly while in uni 4 years ago. She is introvert girl, that didn't get much attention from peers.    

Because she basically had 4 one night stands(weekend, 5 days, fuck buddy is one night for me). and one real and me now for 6 months.   

I feel bad, because she is 26 and now soon 27 in february, so I think she wanted to fuck as much on internship as possible, before going back home and since she is 27 she knows she wont have chance anymore.    

Now with me she never made any mistake ever. I set my boundaries (of not seing any male friends etc), she accepted without hesitation. She doesn't speak with any guys or anything, I have access to everything.   

But it still bothers me what she did with 2 guys before me, and her attitude of ""whorishness"" while having no empathy trying fucking that guy while knowing he was cheat and knowing he has gf that she met in real life.    

Her 2 best female friends from uni 4 years ago, have no issues with sluting of course, and all friends from chats always were saying ""sure do it, have confidence, you'll never see him again"", that's why i think she got motivated for london internship parade and the thinking it is her last chance.. We know that they are all sluts anyway..    

Btw, the last guy before she met me, she fucked 2 weeks before she met me, so if she didn't meet me, I think she would continue with her parade in internship.. ?    

How damaged this woman it is? Is it worth? If it is 6 guys for real, it is quite low for today sluts, but her thinking it's nothing wrong whe she tells me make my mind drift other ways, that i don't know all..."

I never considered myself to be a really brilliant student. I'd say that I'm above average, to say the least. My grades have been quite okay, considering my performance, in the past three semesters. Well, after Winter break, I'm back in Uni, and can't seem to focus/concentrate on my studies. I just can't seem to get up and do what I'm supposed to do. I don't seem to have the fire, the eagerness I had before. It's kinda like imposter syndrome, like I don't feel like I quite fit in, even though my grades were perfectly okay than half of the class. I feel like I'm really missing out on something. In addition to that, my self confidence is very low. I've been depressed in the past, but what I'm experiencing right now feels different. It surely isn't depression. I'm clearly distracted. I know I wasted a lot of time in the past. Most of my peers were doing internships, during December, while I gave up my internship at HP, because I didn't feel like I would fit in, when I was even shortlisted. It's a really disturbing feeling, and I've got these voices in my head that feed me fear. I've got goals, big dreams, but I just can't feel like I can achieve them. I restrict myself from drugs, alcohol, girls, and going out, too. I'm pretty ugly to be dating other people. That's not even a priority for me now. I just want to get some good grades, and learn a lot of stuff, which would help me for Grad school.
Can you help me? What tips can you give me?"

Even when I put forth a good effort in customizing my resume and cover letter (which I am confident are both well-written and structured), there seems to be no response for the most part. I also feel I am pretty qualified for most positions I apply for, but perhaps employers are only selecting the very top level of candidates. 

I have an Hons BA in Economics &amp; Financial Management (graduated in June), completed my CSC, and am awaiting results of CFA level 1, so I'm mainly looking for careers in finance (the goal is equity research, portfolio management, private equity, venture capital, investment banking, or something similar - in no particular order). As for my work experience, I quit my most recent job having only worked from sep-dec (client service at a big banks’ brokerage), because it was something I felt I was not growing or learning whatsoever.  None of the skills I have were being used or expanded, and I felt working there for a while would not get me anywhere I really wanted to go. I also have worked 3 internships in order of recency: one in finance, one at a small marketing firm (operations), and one in accounting/tax. My skill set is pretty broad, and not confined to one area which might be hurting my chances applying for the positions I desire.

Anyways, I’m hoping to get some advice on what I can do to improve and actually get feedback from some of these companies I really want to work for. It seems that getting a position requires you to know someone, otherwise your application won’t even be looked at.  Any help or advice is appreciated a ton!"
5meaoe,12,2017-01-06,Job Decisions,TheDreadedLorax,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/5meaoe/job_decisions/,"I need mom advice and my mom isn't very good at being a mom when it comes to things like this.  I'm sorry for the novel ahead of you.

**Backstory:**

I work in a niche field that's mostly contract work.  A few years ago I scored a permanent position at a university that allowed me to create my own job description.  I've used this opportunity to grow skills that will increase my chances of spending most of my career in other permanent positions, rather than hop from contract to contract.

I absolutely love this job.  My boss loves me and trusts me.  He comes to me for my expertise and he listens to what I have to say. I'm given free reign to work on projects I think are worthwhile.  I've also been given tools to increase any skillsets I think would be pertinent whenever there is down time.  The second I mention wanting or needing something, it's provided for me.  He even hired me an employee when I said I was getting stressed with the amount of tasks on my plate.  Pay is great.  Benefits are even better.  I've been rewarded with multiple huge promotions (along with healthy pay raises) over the past few years and I'm slated for a senior level position in 2 more years.

I bought a house less than a year ago.  I'm almost finished fixing it up.  I love my house.  It's allowed me to adopt a bunch of fluffy pets that I adore.  My husband interned here over the summer and the company wants to hire him when he graduates from grad school in a couple months.

I hate this area.  I'm so lonely.  I live in a very ""old"" area.  By that I mean, the median age is 71.  I'm less than half that age.  There are very few young people.  The young people I meet either came down here with a SO who left them or were transferred here by their jobs.  They're all trying to leave.  It feels like, every time I befriend someone, they move away.

My husband and I have also been talking about having kids once he graduates.  We're both in our early 30s.  My mother had a hard time conceiving, so I feel the clock ticking.  Here's where we hit another plus for this current job:  They have fantastic insurance, maternity leave, and they'll work with me to slowly transition back to work.

For the above reasons, the plan was to stay here for another 3 years or so.  We were going to have our kids. I'd hit my promotion.  Husband would get a few years working here under his skin (big fish in a little pond career experience).  We hoped that having kids would have the additional benefit of helping us find a more-permanent circle of friends.

**Dilemma:**

Before I took this current job, I discovered a different company that I'd love to work for 1000+ miles away.  I contacted them, but they weren't hiring at the moment.  Now, several students I greatly helped while they attended the university are working there.

One of those students contacted me several weeks ago.  The company is now hiring and they asked that I apply.  I declined because of the above reasons.  The owner of the company then reached out to me.  Again, I declined, but agreed to go on a tour of the facility when I was in that neck of the woods over Christmas.

The tour could not have gone better.  We had some amazing conversations about both my work and theirs.  They even treated me to lunch.  Again, they pushed me to accept a position there.  

The problem is, I think I want to take this position.  The place was beautiful.  Everyone was so friendly.  They had me meet all their senior level staff.  I'm so impressed with the place.  I was very open about the reasons I'm happy where I am currently.  I explained how I had hoped to move in several years, but they just responded with, ""There will always be a position here for you."" Eventually they asked if there were a tentative timeline we could talk about.  I stated that there was no way I could leave before July.  I couldn't abandon students mid-school year.  Plus then I'd need time to wrap up all my projects.  They didn't bat an eye.  Again, I made sure to stress that this was all tentative and I wasn't committing to anything.  They assured me that was fine.

I've been in near constant contact with the company and I like everything I hear.  I sent an email to the owner a couple days ago, asking some rather forward questions.  I figured, what do I have to lose?  His response was perfect.

He thanked me for asking the questions and complemented me on my honesty and intelligence.  He then asked if I'd be willing to participate in a Skype call next week with all his senior staff, since he believes they would be better at answering some of the questions that he would be.  I accepted.

Now I'm getting to the point where I know I'm going to have to make a decision pretty quickly after this Skype call.  I appreciate the, ""There's always a position here for you,"" but I'm a realist.  I know ""always"" doesn't mean ""forever"" in business speak.  I've been trying to evaluate the pros and cons of this new company, but I feel like I'm stuck in a deadlock.

**Pros:**

My husband would be happy in either location.  He loved his internship, but the new company is located in his hometown.  He would have more opportunities (and competition, but he's brilliant, so this won't be an issue), but it would be a small fish in a big pond situation.  He's not worried though.

For the past few years, I haven't been actually doing the thing I'm trained in.  I've been helping students do it.  I really miss doing that thing, but it's so time intensive that it's difficult to do it and make progress on my own.  This would be an opportunity to do that thing again, while surrounded by people doing the same thing and pushing me to improve.

I've wanted to work for this company for years.  Everyone I speak to seems to love their job. I'd fit right in with the company culture.

I have friends in the area.  I would have a social life again!  The people I currently work with are all older than I and have families of their own.  In the three years I've been here, I think I've gone out twice with co-workers.  A friend I have at the new company has referred to her coworkers as ""family.""  I want that.

Our current house is between two colleges.  The plan was always, once we leave, to rent it to college students rather than sell it.

My current boss is at retirement age, though he hasn't mentioned retiring.  If things were to go south at this new company, as long as he were around, I could return to my position. At his age, I don't know how long he'll continue to work here.

**Cons:**

I haven't been given a number yet, though I know I have wiggle room for negotiation, but I don't think they'll be able to pay me what I make here.  I've spoken with my friend and she's given me her ballpark salary.  From that, I can extrapolate what they'll most likely offer me.  I know the benefits are nowhere near as good.  Though, my husband would make more money working in this city and would probably make up a good chunk of the difference.  

Moving is expensive.  Last year I not only moved to a new house, I also moved everything out of my childhood home across the country.  After two moves, I'm pretty broke.

Housing scares me.  I'd have to get the current house ready to rent.  I do love it, but I can't bring myself to sell it, and I think I'd be silly to anyway.  Since we just moved, we're low on funds.  I know I'd have to put some money into the house to get it running up to rental standards. 

The pets make the situation much more complicated too.  Keeping them is non-negotiable.  Finding a rental that will allow all of them is going to be near impossible.  The best we'd be able to do is to find a pricey rental house in the suburbs, which means we'd need a 2nd car.  I don't know how we save up money that way.

What we really need is to buy a house.  The best option we've come up with here sucks.  Husband's aunt would take the cats.  We'd move in (with the dogs) with his parents until we found a house.  This brings up a whole slew of issues.

First, I've always made a point of adopting the ""unadoptable"" pets, because I've been in a position to.  This living situation will cause the cats (separation anxiety) a lot of stress.  I can visit them daily if need be, but I know how much time/energy that'll take.  The dogs come from terrible situations themselves too. I've spent countless hours and thousands of dollars working with them and training them.  Whenever my father-in-law comes over (which is rarely), he ignores my training with the dogs.  I'm afraid he would undo all the work I've done.  If you knew how bad the situation was with these dogs, you'd understand what a big deal this is.

Secondly, I'd be living with my in-laws.  They really are wonderful people and I love them dearly...but that's very close proximity for a long time.  I don't want to ruin the relationship we have.  I know they'd take us in and never ask for anything in return, but I'd still feel indebted to them.  

We'd have to put off having kids another year.  This breaks my heart a little.  I desperately want kids.  I'm worried that, with genetic issues, it will become very difficult to conceive as I age.

What do I do?  My gut tells me this is a once-in-a-lifetime and to go for it, but there's a voice in the back of my head reminding me constantly how good I have it.  I'm excited at the thought of starting a new adventure, until I think about all the cons it's going to entail.

I need a mom right now."
5mejrg,2,2017-01-06,Mother doesn't keep up her promise,Cheesus_Bacon_Crisp,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5mejrg/mother_doesnt_keep_up_her_promise/,"Last year, by November, I've finally managed to get a therapist so I could have someone to talk to, and try to solve my issues.

One of the things I've discussed with her was about my mother, and how she'd excessively try to shove me to do things over and over again, everyday, which not only I found absurdly annoying, but exhausting as well.

""I think you should find an internship at your college. It's very important for your education. Why didn't you find one yet? You're not even trying. Everyone is looking for internships and planning out their future, and you're not doing anything, you're being lazy. You'll be a nobody if you keep up like this""

""Don't you think you should call your friends and hang out with them? You're always at your room at your computer. You never go out. People will think you're a freak. Don't you think you should put on nicer clothes? You look like a freak""

""Why don't you have a girlfriend yet? Everyone at your age has one already. All your female friends are so pretty, why aren't you asking them out? You're not gay, are you? I don't have a problem with gays, but I don't want my son to be one"" 

Me and my therapist have discussed this, and she said that she'd call my parents over, and try to talk about that.

At first I was afraid of that, but after thinking a bit, I realized that, maybe, my mother would listen to a professional. She spoke to my parents, then spoke to me. She said that she had made an agreement with my mother, that she'd try not to speak those things and stop putting so much pressure on me.

So, what do you think happened next? Did my mom, upon my arrival at home, hugged me and, in tears, apologized to everything that she has done to me, and we all lived happily ever after?

Haha

No.

She just kept doing it. But now, with a little addition: she'd keep saying the same things, and after saying it, she'd raise her hands in surrender, as if she was the victim, and say ""But since you won't let me give you suggestions, I won't say it""

Ha, fuck my life."
5mepgi,5,2017-01-06,I'm def hypomanic right now. [Long] [brief vague mention of suicide/self harm],[deleted],BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/5mepgi/im_def_hypomanic_right_now_long_brief_vague/,"I just spent 2 hours thinking through extremely detailed plans about studying abroad next year and getting in shape. I'm already accepted to a university in the UK, but it's only a possibility if I show my parents a ton of maturity this semester and get really good grades. I researched medication import laws for the UK, planned how my psych could manage my medications while I'm abroad, planned to study four hours a day(I've never studied 4 hours a week in my life), get the top scores in my year, and get a high paying summer internship. 

I'm working on my weight, as abilify and depression had increased my appetite dramatically this fall, and I, a short woman, starting at 130 lbs, gained 20 lbs in two months. I then switched to latuda, which has been a godsend, lifting my depression and being weight neutral for me. I've lost 7 lbs over winter break, due to CICO, my fitness pal, r/loseit, and r/fatlogic. I plan on continuing my weight loss over the semester and summer, and am planning on losing about 40 lbs(I'm really short).  I'm going to lift weights this spring, and have found a few experienced friends to go to the gym with a few times a week. I also chose a program from the r/xxfitness recommended list. Now that I'm manicy, I started making plans to start running 3x a week over the summer and then run everyday, lift regularly, and play rugby in the fall, in addition to studying 4 hours everyday and being the top student in my year at one of the top universities in the UK. I also planned how I'd have a great social life and a new hot girlfriend/boyfriend. I already have a boyfriend, and we're doing great, but if I study abroad, we might not do long distance. 

I also thought about how I'd later post on reddit about all of this success and get karma for my progress pics and an inspiring story about succeeding with bipolar and ADHD.

This planning was all while in the shower and lying in bed wrapped in a towel post shower without even getting dressed. My room is a disaster(like can't see the floor cause clothes and towels), I've needed to wash clothes for about a week, and I need to study some stuff I've forgotten, so I can do well next semester.

This has been brewing for the past couple days, I've been ignoring all the stuff I need to do and instead been researching transferring to a better school within the US, which is fine, as it influences what courses I need to take, but I've gotten really specific and spent hours a day talking about it. 

I can't even apply to transfer until next spring because I bombed last semester. I attempted suicide and landed in the hospital the first week of school, was deeply depressed for a few months, and almost went inpatient when my insurance/doctor messed up and I didn't have abilify for a week and was self harming and suicidal every night, instead of going inpatient, my boyfriend stayed with me whenever I was awake, until a few days after I was back on meds and feeling better. I ended up withdrawing from all but one class, and getting an F in that one class. When I retake the class in the fall, the old grade will be expunged and replaced with the new one.

After that incident, and the realization of the weight gain, and a new diagnosis of bipolar 2, my psych switched abilify to latuda, started titrating lamictal, and later decreased my lexapro to 10mg / day.

Earlier this week, I was on 20mg vyvanse, 150mg lamictal(titrating to 200mg at 25mg/week, no rash!), 80mg latuda, and 10mg lexapro. The latuda was causing evening anxiety and I was having trouble staying asleep. I saw my psych Tuesday, and he told me to slowly decrease latuda to 40 mg (I'm on 60 at the moment), and added .5 mg Klonopin for sleep/evening anxiety. I've slept well the past few nights, despite the hypomania, and no longer had evening anxiety. 

I forgot to take the latuda right after dinner and have been taking it about an hour later for a couple days. I also have not done any more studying, despite the vyvanse, which had been working great until the drop in latuda. I blamed this and what I now think was hypomania on getting used to the vyvanse and texted my doctor, and he told me to take 2 vyvanse today. I took two vyvanse and had coffee and that's when the obvious hypomania rolled in. I've also been extremely fidgety today, smacking my lips constantly. 

I texted my psych and over about ten messages(that read super hypomanic) explained all this and asked him what dosages to change. I'm waiting for a response and the focus to get off reddit and actually get dressed. 

Ugh. This is so frustrating. Earlier this week, I was getting work done, and my meds seemed to be working great besides the sleep/anxiety from the latuda. I was short term motivated to study and clean and it was great. 

The bright side is that I'm in contact with and working with my psych and I haven't been suicidal, or feeling like self harm since Thanksgiving. Also, this is the first winter in a few years where I haven't gotten clinically depressed, and the bipolar meds are working so much better than the depression meds were. I guess I should ask my psych whether to decrease the lexapro again, as SSRIs are known to cause mania and depression even when combined with a mood stabilizer. I'm also extremely med compliant, use a weekly morning/evening pill box, have reminders on my phone, and have only missed one dose in the past month. 

Also, my psych is great. I've had him since I was 7 when I just had ADHD, and though he diagnosed bipolar 2 as opposed to depression/anxiety a little later than my hypomanic symptoms started(I was 17, and it wasn't too obvious that it was out of the norm), he's always been great about working with me on meds and treatment and finding good therapists. I really feel like we work together well. I am pretty knowledgeable about bipolar meds, and often his suggestions are what I was planning on asking for. He took into account my weight gain and helps me avoid meds that increase appetite. The only time he offered a med that I asked for an alternative to was Xanax, where I requested Klonopin. He listed the pros and cons, and I decided on Klonopin. Also, he's great at giving me multiple options and giving me the pros and cons of each.

Hopefully, with a few med tweaks, I can be back to the stable productivity I was at earlier this week, minus the latuda induced anxiety and sleep problems, and able to go back to college next week, and do well this semester. 

Update: As the vyvanse/coffee from this morning has worn off, I've become much less hypomanic. I'm still talking a little fast, fidgeting, and am a little euphoric, but not nearly as grandiose. No longer in the ""write a 1,155 word reddit post on mobile about how hypomanic I am"" phase. My psych texted me back and said to go back to 80mg Latuda and 20mg vyvanse and avoid the coffee. My boyfriend doesn't seem to mind that I sent him a link to this post and 20 separate paragraph long texts explaining various things about bipolar(esp. Hypomania) while he was at work and couldn't respond. (Before his shift, I mentioned I was hypomanic and he asked what that entailed, so the texts were somewhat justified)"
5mevgi,14,2017-01-06,Do agencies usually hire after a 3-months internship?,Kayters,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/5mevgi/do_agencies_usually_hire_after_a_3months/,"Hi guys,

I'm going to start a 3 months internship in two weeks. The agency is in London and they're going to pay the minimum wage for this 3 months.

The contract is 20hrs per week (because I'm finishing university) and I've asked if they're going to hire me if there's a good fit, and they replied by saying that they have no reasons to not hire me if I'll do well.

Having said that, what's usually happens after a 3 months internship in this industry? Should I keep interviewing in another agencies, while I've a secured position for 3 months? I think it'd be easier to get a job while I already have one.

I also need to change house in the next 2 weeks and I'm looking at some apartments. They cost more of what I'm paying now, but if I've a salary there're no problems with that. I don't know what I'd do if they not hire me though.

What do you guys suggest?

Thanks!"

Always having screaming fights",ipleasehelpmefixthis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mez2t/me_19_m_with_my_family_21_f_sister_51_f_mother_56/,"Screaming fights with my parents have begun getting more commonplace as I've gotten older. Today was really bad as we yelled at each other for quite some time and the bout ended with my mom running upstairs and crying and my dad saying I'm no longer his son and I should change my last name and ignoring me (run-on sentence I know). My mother has depression so I am sitting on the stairwell outside her room to make sure nothing extreme  happens and to wait until everyone calms down before I try and talk to either of them. 

This is the first time I've contemplated doing this as for the past weak, I've mainly been locking myself in my room and ignoring everyone when we argue as I don't want to argue forever. Typically, the arguments begin with something menial but then explode into a big fight about everything. I usually argue that they treat my unfairly, they argue that other kids don't act like me and how I lack respect. I argue that they never listen to me (which they usually don't), and they say I don't listen to them.

Most recently, I had an internship interview with a business company and wanted to buy new dress shoes (don't own any) and we had an argument over that. They said wearing any shoe is fine whereas I told them I want dress shoes (all other interviewers are typically in suit and dress shoes as it is in finance, I would purchase with my own money from working this past semester). My parents are both blue collar workers so I say I know more about this field than them and this exploded even more. I told them I just want to sit down and talk without raising voices or cursing but my dad won't listen and is just saying I'm not his son and my mother is still blaming everything on me. Even if everything is my fault, how can I fix this? I have a lot of pride, I know how interviews go and it is very difficult to secure a summer internship as a sophomore so I don't want anything to lessen my chances.

They constantly say that once I grow older I will for sure abandon them and never talk to them again but I would never do that. I'm not sure how to get any points across as I don't know their native language and they don't know mine. It feels like whenever I say something, it gets ignored or goes over their heads and because it doesn't seem like they're listening, I don't feel any obligation to listen to them.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I am always having screaming battles with my parents. I'm really prideful and hate losing arguments even though winning an argument is hardly winning which usually leads to a lot of escalation on both sides. I want to fix this but I don't know how. My parents are immigrants with english as a second language (very low level) so it is hard for both sides to get points across.

The trouble is that school starts in August and I'm graduating the following May, and my work experience will look like:

- IT internship 2012
- IT internship 2013
- Web development work 4 months, 2013/2014
- Web development work 1.5 years, 2015/2016

None of these jobs were very good at all, and I was dealing with medical issues at the time. Anything before 2014 might as well be worthless in shaping me as a candidate. From 2010-2013, I went to a top 20 school and completely ruined any chance of good standing there, and left due to said issue.

I know literally nobody who codes, have no network, and I'm currently trying to apply to internships and getting pretty plainly rejected without any interviews or phone screens. And I went, and am returning, to a top 20 school. I know I don't meet the requirements (returning to program I was just at) and am about 4 months late, but I really don't want to have two major unexplainable gaps in my career.

Right now, I have an offer as a letter carrier that will pretty much ensure I don't have the flexibility to go to through any interview process for the next 7 months.

What can I do? Are there jobs other than internships that would be better suited to my needs? Am I even doing the right thing by applying to internships? I live about an hour and a half out of NYC, if that's worth anything."

5mg6pu,11,2017-01-06,"[For Hire] Art copywriter, assistant, IT, photo retoucher, restaurant server, barista, or anything, really.",jesse_st,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/5mg6pu/for_hire_art_copywriter_assistant_it_photo/,"Hey all,

If you want to skip my little story below, here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-stein-0895b885

I've been unemployed for about 6 months now, after I left a serving job that wasn't the greatest environment (in addition to working 7 days a week for a few months… I needed a break, but not a break this long). The NYC job market has gotten intimidating.

I've been an Editorial Intern for that time, learning art copywriting (artist biographies, introductions to content written by other people, my own small piece or two, curating small thematic collections of art for sale and writing accompanying descriptions of the pieces, etc.).

Before that I was a PR and Marketing intern where I wrote many, too many, press releases, researched with the rest of my time, and occasionally had to drive clients around, get product to trade shows, and other various errands.

I've also been immersed in the fine dining world for a few years now, serving at a farm to table restaurant while I was in college upstate (where I made a lot of ""third-wave"" espresso on a La Marzocco) and at a very fast-paced NYC restaurant. I love food, talking about food, making people happy, and drinking wine beyond my paygrade. (Once had a 1962 Rothschild Bordeaux… it was good, but not as life-changing as I wanted.)

Before I started working in restaurants, I was a student technician. I did a little bit of everything—phone support (diagnosing and trying to fix problems, walking users through their software, etc. Think: helping professors get to their email who don't *quite* know what a mouse cursor is. It was fun.), hardware replacements, re-imaging machines, wiping and reinstalling Windows (for student computers), etc. Basic computer janitor stuff. I got to drive a massive 4WD enclosed golf cart around at my first job, too.

I host my own website off of a DigitalOcean VPN (my portfolio, on Koken) and I'm just about done building a pretty rudimentary website for my mom in Wordpress (customizing a commercial theme for her needs, mostly). My Sysadmin skills are rusty, as I've been out of the game for a while, but I've used MacOS (RIP ""OS X""), Windows (95 through 10), Debian, and Ubuntu for years. They call us digital natives, right?

Basically… I know technology, I can write, and I can be comfortable while selling high-end food and wine. In my personal life I'm a photographer, writer (photography theory and criticism), bookmaker, and I'm currently working on curating my first show.

I studied Human Rights and Photography in school, and I've been using Photoshop since I was 11 with Photoshop CS. When I was a teenager I wanted to be a graphic designer, so I made business cards, personal brand identities, even forum signatures all the time, so I'm at home in Photoshop (though not the best graphic designer). Studying Photography in school, including black &amp; white and chromogenic printing, made me an excellent retoucher. I've also laid-out and printed (via Blurb) a few photo books, so I'm pretty comfortable in InDesign. I've also done some editing in Premier and Final Cut Pro 7, but I'm a little rusty still, it would probably take me a couple weeks to pick it up again and learn After Effects.

I live in Manhattan. I have a driver's license. My schedule is pretty open and flexible (I intern two days a week, but I would leave for the right job), and I'm pretty much looking for any job that my skills suit me for. Part-time or full-time, temporary or not. I learn quickly and my biggest issue is probably difficulty saying no… sometimes I take on too many projects at once because I want to please everyone, but I think that stems from taking 7 or 9 tables all at once in restaurants. I'll work nights, weekends, whatever. Mornings, too, though I'm not a morning person. But, hey, beggars can't be choosers, right?

And if you want to know a little bit more about me, my ultimate goal is to ""break-in"" to the art editorial world. I want to make photo books and write about photography, essentially, though that doesn't have to be my *career*. I just want to find someone to pay me to do something I'm good at. I can write on my own time.

Thanks everyone! If I sound like a good fit for any opportunities you know of, please shoot me a message through my email listed on LinkedIn."
5mgc4a,4,2017-01-06,Opportunities for programming work within Target Corporation?,target_questions,Target,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/5mgc4a/opportunities_for_programming_work_within_target/,"Hey guys, this is something I've been curious about for a while now.

I'll be finishing my degree this spring, majoring in Computer Science. I don't know much about what internal IT/programming/CS work is done at Target. Does anyone know anything about what sort of IT/CS jobs Target would be looking to hire for?

I've done a little research and it seems like Target used to outsource all of it's software design work to other companies, but I read that in more recent years Target is making an effort to bring the technical computer work back to internal teams.

Let me add that I am a current Team Member, I've been with my store (and the company) for over 3 years now. I also know the kind of position I'm looking for would be with corporate. Aside from what opportunities Target would be hiring a CS major for, I am also curious if my status as an already employed TM would make it easier for me to get a new job with corporate which allows me to do work more closely associated with my degree.

I also know that corporate personnel visit my school regularly to attend career fairs here and give out information. And I know that typically, Target seems to be looking for college grads to fill out ETL positions in its stores. I know people who went through the ETL internship program and are now working their ETL positions. Most of the ETLs at my store when I started were replaced with college grads.

So it seems that there is a high demand for new ETLs and other management positions within the retail scope of operations within Target, and while this is a good backup plan for me, I'm really much more interested in getting a career job that relates to my computer science degree and I'm wondering what the demand for CS work within Target is.

More specifically, I'd be looking for software development/engineering work, or information security work. I imagine that infosec/cyber security is now a pretty big deal within Target after the big breach a couple of years ago.

Thanks!"

I'm not a heavy spender and I want to use the credit card to build my credit. 

I was thinking of applying for either the Discover It student card or the Capital One Journey card. Which card is better? I want to limit hard inquiries into my credit score. I'm aware of the cards details, like APR's and cashback offers, but I was wondering which one increases your credit lines more, is more widely accepted, is better for the long-term, etc. Also, which one is more likely to accept me? I'm also unsure what I should report as my income on the applications...

I applied to the discover it card a couple of months ago, but got rejected as I have no credit history, and I reported 0 income.

A few weeks ago, my boss introduce me to someone else as ""the software engineer"".  

Fast forward a few weeks, and I am home for the holidays and people have been asking me what I do.  I usually say something along the line of ""I am developing a mobile app"" or ""I work for a startup"". But sometimes, it slips out ""I am a software engineer"" or ""Im a mobile developer"".  

Everytime I say it, my voice starts to trail off. I feel like i don't deserve the title. Engineer for me is someone who went to school for a long time and studied high level math and physics.  Developer is someone who could hold their own in a job interview exam.

5mgndz,0,2017-01-06,No idea what to do,joblessengineer17,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5mgndz/no_idea_what_to_do/,"Hi all. I'm nearing the end of my rope and was hoping for some advice.

I have citizenship and passport to an EU country, as well as citizenship in Canada. I have 2 degrees (Science and Electrical Engineer, EE being the most recent). I have some experience (about 2-3 years) in an oil &amp; gas role as both software dev and IT admin. My skills include hardware development at the microchip level as well as the firmware that drives them, and software development for embedded systems and desktop users. I've even released some software on my website in both a paid and free model. I have a couple internships under my belt, but those companies have either downsized or been sold off so can't go back there. I will move anywhere, worldwide, to work. I just want to work.

I've been job hunting since July '16 and have had 2 interviews in Canada since I started. I have had 2 interviews in Austria as well, but didn't work out as the company was unwilling to meet part way for cost of travel to interview (many companies in the EU, especially Germany, are willing to either fully pay or partly pay for travel for just interviews). I have gone through dozens of revisions for both CV/resume and cover letters. Each resume and cover letter is tuned to the job and uses keywords to reflect what they want in the candidate. I do my research of the company and try to display that I want to work there and for what reasons. I've even written software to automate some of the more monotonous parts of applications, such as tuning with keywords for certain industries. I tried recruiters in different countries as well, especially in Japan (since gf is Japanese and has no PR or visa to live here) where they told me they won't even talk to me until I'm in Japan.

I'm tired of hunting and being filtered. I'm exhausted of getting daily emails saying ""we thank you for applying but have gone with a more suitable candidate"". I don't know how I can make myself more suitable. I've spent a few months learning web development and have made several websites. I've honed my skills in both hardware and software. I've learned new languages, both programming and linguistic. I've worked for free on various projects. I've networked with friends and graduating members of my classes, most of which weren't in a much better position than myself. I've networked with friends of friends to no avail. I've entertained random LinkedIn recruiters only to never hear from them again after saying I'm interested. I've sought out recruiters and headhunters, which never resulted in any jobs in my field. I included a link to my website, which shows various projects and my ability to problem solve, on my applications and track visitors, but found not a single person visited after I applied. This suggests no one is looking (or at least interested in) at my site and skills.

I've teetered from desperate to fake-it-till-you-make-it and back. I am lucky to have amazing family that is helping me until I get on my feet, but I can't and don't want to rely on that forever. I just don't know what to do anymore. I thought having experience and a degree would be enough even for entry level, or at least having someone entertain my application, sadly I've not seen this in reality.

Feel free to call me out on any BS if you see any. I'm under no illusion that I deserve anything, I'm just trying to find a way to live and be productive. "
5mgo3c,2,2017-01-06,Being Able To See The Future,Deivius7,precognition,https://www.reddit.com/r/precognition/comments/5mgo3c/being_able_to_see_the_future/,"I have been able to see my future since I were a child. At first I didn’t think much about them, I thought these visions were just another dream like any other at night. But then the dreams I had became reality and it got me thinking more and more about them with each vision that turned out to be real. I still remember the first vision I had and I won’t forget it no matter how much time will pass.

I was about 6 years old when I dreamed the first vision. I dreamed about going down the stairs at school and when I reached the bottom of the stairs I went around the corner and bumped into a kid who was in a class two grades lower then I was in. I knew this because I remembered him being in the same class as my brother. After we bumped into each other we just simply continued on and then the dream ended. Normally this could be seen as just any random dream but when I was about 7 or 8 years old I went down the stairs at school and when I reached the last step of those stairs I remembered the dream and I got a feeling of déjà vu and hesitated for a second. But then just as I wanted to continue on that exact same kid from the vision walked around the corner and we ALMOST bumped into each other. Because I was just a kid I didn’t think much about it and only thought it was strange for a second and then I just went on with whatever it was that I was going to do.

The other visions I got also came to be and because I had experienced it before I could act upon them and get away with things which I should have gotten in trouble with. For example I was quite depressed in school and skipped a lot and because the teacher would call your home to ask how you are after being “sick” for a while I tried to get back to school before getting into trouble with either my parents or school. Usually I told my parents that the teacher was sick and the class got dropped or I simply just went outside acting like as if I went too school but instead I was playing somewhere on my NintendoDS with some snacks and something to drink in order to avoid getting into trouble with my parents if they found out I skipped school. And thanks to a vision I knew I would get caught if I dragged it out too long and thankfully I could time my “being better again” before I got into trouble due to the school calling my home. I don’t know exactly how many visions I have had in total so far or how many of them came to be or how many I have avoided, but what I do know is that there are at least 7 that I remember well. 

Unfortunately those visions about the future became further apart from one another by each passing dream and it was not just the time between the dreams that became longer, but also the day that the dreams came to be took longer before they happened. The last vision I had was about 1 or 2 years ago and the one before that one was about 8 years ago and which came to be about 4 years ago. This dream showed me where I would go for intern, but without knowing this I just thought that it was a normal weird dream. Having never been inside that company before, having never heard of them before, having never been in that village before my intern made things even more special. The vision I had of me inside that company was about me working behind a desk and when I was called by someone behind me I turned around. So when I eventually got there for my intern I didn’t recognize it from the vision at all because a lot of time had passed and I had forgotten all about the dream. But then when it was the day of the vision I had once again a feeling of déjà vu and remembered the dream I had. What is even weirder then all the things I have mentioned so far is that the company only existed for about 2 or 3 years when I got there. Meaning that at the time when I had the dream about the company they didn’t even exist yet.

So why am I posting all this? Well, I am looking for help. I want to know if someone else has also experienced this and knows how to have these dreams with visions about the future become more frequent. And also if someone knows if you can interfere with the visions themselves and if this effects the outcome of the vision in any way or if it turns the vision in just any normal dream. I have always tried to not interfere with my dreams when I noticed that it could be a vision. But if you can interfere with them and shape your future and the path towards it then I would definitely want to know how to do this. But… the biggest reason why I’m asking for help is because of the last dream I had. It showed me my death and possibly also the destruction of earth but I’m not completely sure if this is truly a vision and I really hope that it ain’t but this dream felt different unlike all other dreams I had so far, both the visions and the regular dreams didn’t feel as real-like as this one which makes me quite worried. If it’s a vision then it would mean I would die within at least the next 30 years and because I didn’t see what happened to our planet I’m not completely sure if it exploded or if there was only a large explosion at the place in that vision where I was. It is never the less still quite a scary dream, whether it’s a vision or not.

From all that I have seen so far and from all that I have experienced, I have come to the following conclusions. I think the visions that I have experienced are not me looking into the future, but the future me experiencing things and somehow our minds are connecting with each other, sending me what the future me is experiencing or has experienced into my dreams when I sleep. I think so because I am able to avoid what was supposed to happen and I think there’s a good chance that alternate timelines exist. It’s not just me avoiding the troublesome future’s like bumping into people or escaping being scolded, but also something else that has been bothering me which makes me come to these conclusions. For example I had a dream quite a while ago and this vision showed me sitting on my bed and next to me sat a girl with long blond curly hair. But I have never met any blond girls with long curly hair nor is it popular in our country where every girl basically has straight hair. Because this is also a vision that hasn’t come to be (yet), it has made me think that it could have been a vision from a future me from a different timeline. Possibly a different timeline then the timeline of the other future me in which I die. But nothing is for sure, and both could still be happening in the near future because in the visions I look from a first person perspective and so I can’t guess my age and I also can’t guess when I could expect the day of the vision to be.

If anyone could possibly give me some answers to my questions or possibly even more. I will truly appreciate your kindness forever and remember all the help you have given me whether I die anytime soon or not."
5mgwtf,3,2017-01-06,[Advice] Might have my first programming job!....using VB.Net,nemonemo33,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5mgwtf/advice_might_have_my_first_programming_jobusing/,"So to give background I am a sophomore in college who fell in love with programming and decided I wanted to teach myself and hopefully end up using it to pay my way through school. To this end I learned web development as it has the most resources online (such as free code camp and the odin project) and is the quickest to learn. From this I got an internship by the end of which my manager is dying to keep me but there is no room on the web dev side. Given that I have recently taken a liking to C# and .Net he suggests me over to the application development side of things. Which leads me to where I am now.
  
  
I just got finished with testing and interviewing for the Application Developer job both of which I aced and from the sound of it they want me. My only worry is...is this useful? Is this a good idea? I don't see many VB jobs in my area and on this sub I have yet to hear a positive thing about the language. Would a year here give me enough experience to just go ahead and work elsewhere with C# (which I know and can train more in) or would I be shunned or stunted in my job search for using such an unpopular language? I really was hoping this would kind of be the start of my development career so basically I'm asking, is this a good deal or a waste of time career wise?
  
  P.S: If it matters, I'd be using SQL a lot as well if that matters."

**Update** I suppose I forgot to mention why I want to move to those places. You'll have to excuse me, stress levels are pretty high and I'm full of coffee. EU: I am from there. I have lots of family there. I want to live and work in a place that values my experience and hard work, where basic human rights and requirements aren't traded back and forth in politics (yes, yes, I know it happens everywhere, but universal health care, basic human decency and such are valued much more than here). I am tired of the Canadian way, it no longer interests me or my future. I do not want my future kids going to school in Canada like I did. Just not interested. Japan: my gf is from there, I have visited and liked it. I find it generally very polite there, and even though there are many things that aren't desirable there (cram schools, etc) I think it would be a good step to take. Regardless, I just want out of Canada."
5mhcp7,4,2017-01-06,Really struggling to prepare for my internship interviews,CoolBreezeTM,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5mhcp7/really_struggling_to_prepare_for_my_internship/,"Hi guys,

I just got an interview at a really good company in the next couple weeks (and am applying to internships now as well), and I have my first interview in 2 weeks exactly. I've been going through CTCI in my off days over break, and I'm getting the approaches/general algorithms to problems correct, but I'm struggling really hard to finish and solve the problem correctly and get the correct output for the problem on my own, even after looking at the solution without having to look things up online (make random errors with java as a language, for example).

Sometimes I get an approach semi-right, but it's not optimal.  I write out all this code, and then can't figure out how to debug it. I'm horrible at harder brainteasers. I have a lot left to learn as well. In an interview setting, I definitely will not get the right output, let alone I'll just miss some syntax, won't notice and the interviewer will think I'm an idiot. Aside from easy array/list problems, I don't think I've gotten anything right on the first try/without having to debug. I almost always end up over-complicating problems in terms of lines of code versus the actual solution.

I need your advice, if there even is any for this situation... How can I try and prepare as well as I can for these interviews when I'm failing these questions so miserably? I want to succeed so badly, but I'm feeling like I'm coming closer and closer to abject failure."
5mhupj,5,2017-01-06,My Chinese Parents,MENEV,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/5mhupj/my_chinese_parents/,"Before I start I want to give a heads up that my memory is complete horse poop. I have a hard time remembering names, anything I remember was a constant occurrence or was significant to my life. I have a tendency to almost completely forget things that were insignificant. This makes it even more sad that all my life I've felt a deep emotional disconnect with my parents.

I am currently 19 years old and still finding my way. 
My parents are both from the same village, my mom apparently came as a refugee while my dad smuggled his way as crate. They're both legal citizens now though.

At the age of 2-3 I was sent to China and didn't come back till I was 5. I spent my earliest memories in china with my grandparents. I only knew the village language. (China has many different sub-languages) When I was pulled back to America I was thrown into this Pre-K chinese school thing. Where they taught me Mandarin and English. Even then it was just mainly Mandarin. So there I was with my first language as a village language, the mandarin. I only later on learned to understand English through the old fashioned tv we had. When I first came over my family rented out a basement. As a child I didn't think much of it, I continued to act the same way I did back in China, a very load and curious kid. Somewhere between then and when I started grade school I became a mute. I remember something about me singing a song I really like and my dad screamed at me to shut up. 
Now when I said I learned to understand English, I didn't learn how to speak it. So when I got sent to grade school they instantly threw me into ESL classes. The first 3 years of grade school was terrible. Thankfully I've forgotten most of it, the bad memories still come back to me every so often, the 1 thing I will share is that I was the 1%. The teachers didn't know how to teach a asain, and most of them ignored me. 3rd grade was when we moved to a actual house. A 3 story house that was newly built. We move into the 1st floor and rented out the 2nd and 3rd. 
This meant a new school for me, this new school is where I end up getting bullied. I ended up in a mainly Black/Hispanic school. Genetically these people were bigger and matured faster then me. This contributed to me being very anti-social throughout middle school, which by the way was bully filled as well. I told my mom once during 4th grade about it and all she did was complain to me about why I'm letting it happen, then complained to the entire school about it. So I learned not to rely on my parents for jack shit at a early age. Somewhere in middle school I got into a fight, things got out of hand and I ended up with half my face swollen. But surprise surprise! The guy I fought lost and was in the hospital. The other students all reported that he attacked me so i was let off rather easy. (they probably knew about me being bullied) It was a spur of the moment and as a child I completely didnt remember what I did at all, all i remember was feeling a sharp pain on my right side and then I was standing on top of the guy. My classmates told me that when I entered the stairway the guy swung at me hard, they all thought I was gonna fall flat. But apparently I turned, grabbed him, then used him as a surfboard as i rammed his head down the stairs. The school labeled it as a accident since all the injuries he had were from the stairs.
I boasted to my mother about it thinking she would be proud of me. And ended up getting punished for ""hurting a poor soul"" and how it'll damage her name if other people found out. 
Highschool things started getting better, I ended up with people that accepted me. But as a socially awkward kid I'm very thankful they all had the patience to handle me.
That's the rather good gist of my school life, heres the next part.
So I stated that I was rather disconnected to my parents. Growing up I only saw them as free food. And I'm pretty sure they saw me as a investment for when they are old. I didn't know even the most basic things about my parents, even now if you asked my my parents favorite colors I wouldn't know. They were always working so I was always left alone. At first I always looked forward to seeing them but as times past by I stopped caring if they were home or not. Rather I perfered it if they weren't home. They never asked how my day was or just any generic interactions. All They'll ever ask was ""How your grades"", ""Did you finish your homework"", and if I'm done with everything they'll just tell me to go ""study"". Now that I'm older I can understand they were probably tired from work, but I still don't understand why they never actually tried to interact with me more, it was the same on holidays. They always forced me into there saturday sunday schools saying how I better do good in these classes because they paid for it. As a child growing up I never learned how to smile. I didn't realize what a real smile was till high school. 
During one high school summer, for some reason instead of forcing me to go to a summer school they took me to literally ever single coaster park you can think of. Hersey Park, Six Flags, Dorney Park, and plenty other ones that wasen't as popular or wide known. It was like a attempt to cram every motherly and fatherly love they had saved up over the last 10 years crammed into 2 months. I enjoyed it since it was better then going to school. This was also the first time I skipped the first day of school after summer break. The trip was told to me the night before we left which was about 1 week after school ended, and we didn't come home till the night of the 1st day of school. So as the child I was I completely forgot about summer homework. Andddd Tadaaa guess what happened. School called my parents up asking why I didn't finish my homework. I go home and they start chewing me out. The only thing I remember them saying, or repeatedly saying, ""How could you not do your homework, do you have any idea how much money we spent on you this summer"". Great way to end the almost new beginning of a parent child bond. I never got a chance to speak since ""a child should shut up and listen"".

Well those days are over, and I actually didn't want to bring it up but recent things have completely killed my sense of thought.

When I graduated Highschool I didn't know what I wanted to do, my nagging mother just won't let me off the hook so I joined the Marines Reserve as a way to relieve myself of her nagging and experience more of the world. My ship date was August 10, a week early from my birthday August 17. I didn't really care since a birthday wasn't a big deal to me growing it. It's just a fucking date of when you were born why bother waste of time. Training was 3 months. It was probably the longest 2 months of my life. When I somehow managed to pass everything I came home for boot leave. It was 10 days, my parents couldn't really control me anymore. I spent my the first 3 days crashing with my friends day in and day out. Thats when my mom complained about me being out all the time. So To keep her from nagging whenever I saw her I spent the next few days home. AND THEN SHE NAGGED ABOUT ME ALWAYS BEING HOME. I gave up and just started doing whatever I wanted to do which was hanging with my friends. AND THEN SHE CALLED ME AND SAYS ""YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPENT HOURS MAKING FOOD FOR YOU WHY ARENT YOU HOME"" WHEN I TOLD HER I'LL BE SLEEPING OVER AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE. My parent have this thing were IIIIIII have to tell EVERYONE  where I'm going or they will all make there own seperate agendas for me. I tell my dad I'll be home late, 5 min later mom calls asking where the hell am I. Vice-versa. THIS HAPPENS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE, my parents work together and NO SHIT live together but just simply can't tell eachother whats happening. I SWEAR I'LL BE THAT ONE GUY WHO GETS HIT BY A FUCKING CAR AND THEY'LL CALL MY DAD WHO'LL MAYBE COME TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEN MY MOM WILL CALL 911 BECAUSE HER SON HASENT RETURNED A GOD DANM PHONECALL IN THE LAST 4 HOURS.
Well bootleave ends and I move onto the rest of my training. The entire training process was long enough that I spent 2 of my birthdays with it. I finally came home Sept. I want'ed to relax and learn to communicate like a normal human being now. No more of that bullshit yes sir no sir, I'm a reservist and I need to remember how to be a civilian. I spent a month trying to forget my marine vocabulary for more friendly words. I was finally able to get myself  talk in a laid back way. I went around town enjoying the freedom actually appreciating being able to do that for once. 
Then my parents started doing shit again. They told me to get a drivers permit and then a license. I found that reasonable so I went and got a permit. And somewhere down the line my mother started talking about college. I told her don;t worry about it. Since I still haven't figured out what I wanted to do I've been volunteering in these projects. I became a intern in this business. etc I was living the free teenage life. 
Well she ended up saying ""Now that you wasted 2 years of your life how about you start doing something with it"". This pissed me the FUCK off. She is calling my military career wasted. 
In her eyes the ideal son was a college graduate.
I am still very pissed. I need help. So far I've found business interesting, but I enjoy helping people. I spent this Christmas helping feed the homeless and I couldn't help but feel joy in doing so. I'm starting to lean towards being a cop. But my current problem is my parents not approving of it. ""Your gonna get shot by some black guy"" ""go be a lawyer"" 

Any hints on getting them to STFU and let me ride my first few years out? Any older mates that are or were in this same exact boat?"

After transferring schools I taught 2nd grade for a year and asked to be moved back down to kindergarten. I enjoyed second grade but kindergarten truly has my heart. I have a bachelors in Early Childhood Education and my Master's in Special Education although it is not on my teaching license (I did not have the ability to take a semester off to complete the internship hours required by the state). I was born and raised and currently live in Alaska. I really love the school I am at but am ready for a life change.
On a couple recent trips I have spent a fair amount of time thinking and want to take the opportunity I have now to move out of state and experience something new. The only commitment I have right now if a golden retriever who would need to be able to come with me. I would want somewhere with access to the outdoors (this could mean with a drive or having parks available) as that is a huge draw for me in the summers and winters. I have looked at international teaching and teaching across the states but am looking for some advice or options to look into.

Any information regarding the disappearance of Jesse Ross, please contact the Chicago Police Department at: 312-744-8266 or contact us


Jesse Ross Fact Sheet 
-19 years old at time of disappearance
-Was a sophomore at University of Missouri Kansas City
-Just received a promotion from intern to paid radio personality on a popular Kansas City Morning Show
-Was in Chicago for a mock United Nations Conference
-Was last seen walking to the side door during a 30 minute break from an ""emergency"" model United Nations Conference


Jesse Ross phoned his mother from Chicago on Nov. 20, just to let her know that he was having a blast at the model United Nations conference.

He promised to call again the next day when he and the 13 University of Missouri-Kansas City students and their faculty sponsor had loaded the vans for the return drive home.

He was that kind of son, said Donna Ross. He always let his mother know where he was, what he was doing, and when to expect him home. He couldn't keep a secret, not from his mother.

There was an ""emergency"" meeting of the mock U.N. at 2 a.m. Nov. 21, the final day of the conference that drew more than 1,000 university students from across the country. Before the mock emergency, there was a dance, and parties throughout the host Four Points Sheraton Hotel in Chicago's downtown loop.

Jesse Ross FamilyAt about 2:30 a.m., about 12 hours after his last cell phone call to his mother, Jesse Ross got up from his chair and walked out of the room for a 30-minute break. A surveillance camera in the hotel lobby caught the unmistakable image of the red-haired Jesse, clad in a white T-shirt, jeans, and a green warm-up jacket, walking toward the main doors.

It was the last trace ever of 19-year-old Jesse Ross.

The 10-minute walk back to Sheraton Chicago Hotel &amp; Towers, where Jesse and the UMKC group was staying, was well-lit, heavily traveled and covered by outdoor security cameras. None of them recorded Jesse.

""Aliens took him away,"" said his mother, knowing full well how ridiculous that sounds. But it's no more ridiculous than any other reason offered for her son's disappearance.

Chicago police have found no evidence that he was a victim of foul play. There has been no activity on Jesse's credit cards or his cell phone since he disappeared into the Chicago night.

There was no way imaginable to any one who knew him that Jesse could have committed suicide, or wanted to walked away from the life he was living, said Don Ross, his father.

Jesse had just gotten a promotion from unpaid intern to paid morning on-air personality at Kansas City radio station 95.7 FM - ""The Vibe"" - a dream job for a sophomore communications major.

""They decided he needed an on-air name, so they named him Opie Cunningham,"" after Ron Howard's TV characters, Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham, said Don.

Jesse Ross and FriendsA parent's worst nightmare is supposed to be the death of a child.

There is a worse nightmare than that, said Don and Donna Ross.

""We pray for a sign, anything,"" Donna said. ""We pray, 'If he is in heaven with you, that's not my first choice, but God, please give us a sign. Send me an e-mail, a phone call, something. We have to know that he's OK and with you.'

""When you lose someone you love when they pass on, you grieve and then you move on with your life,"" Donna said. ""We are nowhere. We are still stuck in that revolving door. We know nothing more than we knew that first day.""

As the months roll on, Don and Donna Ross can't give up hope.

""If Jesse ever thought we'd give up on him, we'd catch hell from him. 'How could you just give up on me?' he would tell us,"" Donna said.

Body found in Lake Michigan badly decomposed. His family contacted authorities but haven't heard back. I really hope this family gets resolution, one of my friends new him well.

5mifnh,5,2017-01-06,"Looking for a job in the international nonprofit sector, and I have questions about my volunteering experience.",CCBS1226,nonprofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/5mifnh/looking_for_a_job_in_the_international_nonprofit/,"Specifically, I am wondering about the timeline of my volunteer experience.  In 2007, I volunteered for a year in Ghana. I lived in the far north, without electricity and running water, in a mud hut, and I loved every minute of it!  I was an assistant to the director of a volunteer teacher program, and we provided admin support to young people who volunteered from all over the world to work in remote villages with the Ghana Education System. 

I was 22 at the time, and had not yet gone to college. However, when I returned, I started school and graduated from a top university with a degree in African Studies. I immediately started a graduate program and completed an M. Ed. in Community Development and Action with an emphasis in International Nonprofit Management from the same college.  From several internships I did during college, I learned that finance is an area that many nonprofit struggle to grasp and master.  So, thinking that accounting would be a great additional skill to have, after I completed my M. Ed., I took an accelerated accounting program and four semesters of graduate level accounting. During that time, I worked 2 years at an accounting firm, and then admin work with a nonprofit organization that is focused on secondary education.

My goal is to eventually work for an international nonprofit in West or Southern Africa, in girl’s education or something similar. However, I'm concerned about the 10 year gap from when I initially had the great volunteering/international experience until now. I had some shorter internships while in school, but I always had to work full time, all the way through school (being a non-traditional student) and I so I didn't get to build my volunteering resume as much as I would have loved to while in college.  (The internships I did have were both women’s empowerment programs.)

Everything I’m reading says that it’s so hard to break into the International development field, and to be prepared to work at an entry level job for a time before moving up. I think I'm ready for something beyond an entry-level job at this point, but I'm concerned that what I have will not be considered relevant or recent enough. Should I just put myself out there, or should I spend some time getting more recent volunteer experience before I start applying?

Thoughts?

I'm a totally blind student (and I only mention this because I'd be doing something like Lyft or Uber if I could). I've had internships at Acquia and Carbonite and most recently just got my first FreeBSD patch committed. I started dev when I was about 12 with a form of basic and grew to c++ and other languages beyond that.

My biggest problem is that I'm really bored with classes and am working for the degree to get done. I'm looking for some ideas that might give me a challenge, and also give me a good way to make money on the side as someone who is fairly decent at software development. I'm fluent with C, C++, PHP, Python, Java and others and have experience with FreeBSD, Linux, and various configuration of services/some pen testing. I'm also experienced with Jenkins, which is something I picked up at my last internship. I've looked at sites like upwork and others where people post jobs, but most of the easy jobs which would be used to build my ratings are things like ""design a css,"" which is pretty notoriously hard for me to accomplish. I'm great with backend work/system administration.

I'd appreciate any advice you can offer and thanks for your time!

The 2nd job is one I find very exciting, both interviews went well. The problem is I have no idea what to ask for on salary. The man asked me what I would like to have, and of course my brain went to 150k a year but I know this to be an unrealistic expectation. So I asked him what he thought was fair for the job, he says, ""40 thousand is what I started at, I'm making 300 now!"". So, from this comment I knew he was low balling me and I don't think he meant to be mean at all he was just trying to cheer me up about hearing 40k I think, he knew I had no prior history of salary negotiations because I've always just taken the money I could get per hour at retail stores. 

My question is, do I use job #1 as leverage for salary negotiations of job #2? I really don't want to come off as a dick, and them say ok nevermind, but I also want to make more for a programming job(his first statement is less than I make currently at the retail store I work at full time). And just to be clear, I have a bachelor's in computer science with 5 years experience and two internships. I have a family with two car payments so money is very much a concern for me at this point in time.

If any employers have any input that would be amazing. And if you've read this far I thank you very much! Any input is appreciated. I have 0 experience with salaries this is a whole new world to me.


TL;DR got two job offers #1 offered 72k, #2 the job I really want told me to name my price, curious if I can leverage #1 to get more for #2."

Need somewhere to live, cant decide if i should drop out of college, work part time, or go back home",PenninahPie,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5mim37/justwhat_do_i_do_now_need_somewhere_to_live_cant/,"I'm not even sure where to start so I hope this makes sense. It's going to sound so privileged and I'm sorry.

'm a junior at a university, an i'm very excited to be graduating next year! 

Currently, I live with many other people in a school dorm, and I am really sick of dorming. It's VERY expensive, and cheaper to live off-campus. 

My parent's have offered to give me the rent money I will need should I decide to live off-campus next semester, as the money is already put away for me, and it's cheaper and saves them money in the long run anyway. 

However. I was hoping to stay in the area over the summer so I could take a really good internship, which would require I move off campus after this coming semester ends into an apartment with some friends. Our rent would be put at around 600 a month (each), as opposed to the 1100 a month (each) that campus housing costs. 

I go to school full time, and as an architecture major, I have VERY little time for a job, but I do have a part time job, that gets me about 100$ a week. Yeah, not a lot of hours to be had, and a second job isnt in the cards, I tried it and my grades fell and I almost lost a scholarship because of it. So I stuck with my single crappy campus job.

by the end of the semester, i'll have about 5000 dollars in my bank account.  between trasnporation/food/rent/materials, even when skimping, It would pretty much drain me of all my savings and funds to pay the rent for the summer on my own, until September when my parents have already said they would (generously) pay for it for me until I graduate and then im on my own. 

The plan was to ask my parents to help me pay for the rent each month for May, June, July an August. I could pay half, but Paying all of it would mean I'd be back at square-fucking-one come graduation next year. I could get a full-time summer job on top of my internship as well. 

Problem is, I recently found out my father has gotten a HUGE pay cut for the new year, like huge, and we're now a family of saving big wherever we can. 

I never ask my parents for money, ever. I never have. Since I left for college I have paid for everything myself as they are covering my tuition that isnt covered by loans/scholarships. they do enough. 

How can I ask them to help pay for this now? I cant! (I have four siblings) 

The obvious solution is to go home for the summer. Which would mean I A. Would have to spend next year on campus again, as i would have no one to get an apartment with. 
B, would be incredibly depressed and lonely all summer as all my high school friends have moved away. Going home even for a week is so lonely. No one is in the house and it's just me. I have a lot of issues with manic depression when im lonely, as im a huge extrovert.
C. Would mean I miss out on this amazing, career-launching internship for the summer. 


I really dont want to, but i'm starting to think I should cut my losses, find a rando to live with in a cheap part of town, drop out and just work and make money so i can live without the constant anxiety of what im going to do, where i'll live, and if ill be in a depressive, suicidal state or not. I like working! I just dont have time to right now!

What the hell do I do?

First year went by fine, my grades were pretty good. In 2A, I failed a course and couldn’t get the grade required for another course to move on. I’ve had problems with anxiety and depression since high school and it took a toll after the mediocre performance in 2A. I began seeing a counsellor and taking meds, but despite my best effort, I failed 3/5 courses in 2B. Frustrated, I took the summer off and managed to land a software developer internship with a startup. During this time I kept seeing a counsellor and filed a petition to clear my 2B term. The petition was approved pending a conditional term in Fall 2016. I kept on my meds and managed to get through Fall 2016 term pretty well, doing well on my midterms and assignments for all of my courses. However, disaster struck during my first exam. I had a terrible panic attack and left the exam midway, and ended up at the Emergency wing of the Grand River Hospital. I met my counsellor the next day and with her help I managed to get an INC for the course and permission to write the exam later. Struggling, I managed to get through the rest of the exams but did poorly on each. Despite the poor performance, I managed to pass each of my classes but I couldn’t meet the conditions of the conditional term. However, I am completely out of hope. Failed out of my program and now in Mathematical Studies. It seems like no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to get my grades up. I have completely given up hope. Being home for the holidays, I have been completely depressed and I am not looking forward to anything anymore because it seems like I am nothing but a failure. I’ve been to a doctor and seems like ADHD but its probably too late now. Nothing seems to be working and honestly suicide seems like the only option. Just so tired. If you managed to read this far, thank you. I just needed to get it off my chest. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up as I have already wasted enough of my parents time and money. Hopefully death will bring peace. "

I grew attached to many of them and  things were dandy. However, near the end of high school I started to become very distant and depressed (mostly due to things happening at home at the time). I started to distance myself from others and stopped keeping in touch with some of my peers. Nothing bad ever happened, I just drifted from them.

It's about five years later and things were going great. Almost ready to graduate university and start an internship at a top company.

It wasn't until I started seeing pictures of my old friends and peers meeting up and partying/hanging out without me. It's all over Facebook and Snapchat and I always kind of come across it. I try not to make it hurt, I mean... it really shouldn't, right? 

I haven't spoken to them in years. So why should I care? It's just hard seeing it all spammed on my social media and I don't want to mass delete these people for no reason otherwise it just looks odd. 

To put it in perspective, it feels a lot like an adult clique. They like to put out the fact that they're all happy and dandy and still friends. It makes me feel like crap seeing these posts. I'm still picking up the pieces from feeling depressed (took 4 years of feeling this way and I'm just starting to recover). I don't have too many friends but I got a wonderful boyfriends and a few good close friends.

I'm not looking to be friends with them again. But, I just want to know if anyone else has felt/experienced something similar and has possibly found a way to cope with this? Sorry if my thoughts are all jumbled up and if I don't make sense, just a lot on my mind. Let me know if you need some clarification or more details. I'm an open book. Thanks for reading."

5mjrdk,47,2017-01-07,"Man, how do you get a job in this city?",OverlordXenu,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/5mjrdk/man_how_do_you_get_a_job_in_this_city/,"I had a chance at an editorial assistant job. Knew everyone in the office, they liked me, I'd saved a butt or two as an intern. Got an interview for the position. But, I lacked any assistant/office experience, so they didn't want to hire me.

I got an interview for a part time job to get that kind of experience. Transcribing, regular secretarial work. A pitiful per diem. It was a weird group interview—me and another person. Said other person was 30 and had a graduate degree and was looking for something to do while their spouse was a doctor. (Recent transplant.)

Didn't get that job.

I was waiting tables. Worked 7 days a week for three months until I burned out. Someone had been trying to hire me as a photo retoucher, so I quit, and pursued that. Had a couple interviews. He talked me up to the owner. The person making the hiring decision said they wanted to send me some files as a tryout, then didn't. Followed up, ""oh shit, we're super busy this week! I'll get them to you next week."" Followed up the next week, ""we're still slammed. I promise I'll get them to you next week!"" Rinse and repeat for 2 more weeks. I emailed my contact, who was a friend, and asked if they were still interested in trying me out, because otherwise I had to pursue other opportunities. Didn't even get a response.

I hate waiting tables, and I have some coffee experience, so I try to get a barista job. Pretty much no one is interested because I don't have NYC coffee experience. I intentionally choose a mediocre coffee place near my internship, that is never that busy, thinking it'll be an easy gig to get some experience and money. I walk into the most absolutely hostile interview I've ever had. They asked me how much money I made waiting tables, asked me how much I expected to make there, ""Oh, I've been interviewing around and the competitive rate seems to be around $13 an hour."" Their response: ""You can live in New York on that?"" Never mind that I had told them I'm lucky enough to not have to pay rent at the moment (live with girlfriend). Like, fine, I get not wanting to hire me or something, but really? If you don't pay your employees enough to live in NYC then why don't you pay them more?

And it's just like, shit. I'm not really very good at anything. I'm a dilettante and more of an autodidact that anything, so I have a shit load of half baked skills, and nothing I really excel in. Everyone in this fucking city is smarter than me, is harder working, and somehow has famous parents. And they all have masters degrees or 10 years of experience. (I was trying to get another job with people I knew, and they were nice enough to tell me I didn't get it because it made more business sense to go for the person with 10 years of experience. They approached me originally because it was an entry level position and they were afraid their only other candidate would leave for greener pastures. Oh, the joys of being an intern that is well liked enough to get interviews but not jobs.)

I've been funemployed for about 6 months now. Interning and going into more debt. Like, shit. Do I really need to go to grad school to compete? I guess so.

Anyone got any good stories? Or advice? Most job-search advice I find, or get, seems better tailored for people who are already mid-career and have something to offer. The only shit I've got to offer is a stupid cliché—I work hard, I learn fast, and I'm smart. And a bachelor's degree but I already knew that'd be worthless before I went to school. Rather, it's the bare minimum.

This is a hard fucking city. I hope I survive it. I like it here, and the shit I want to do (art editorial, essentially) really only exists here. (And LA and London and so on I guess, but I can live here for almost free.) But it's so demoralizing to fail at even getting a fucking barista job. Fuck. I wish I hadn't worked 7 days a week, I'd probably still be at my very well paying serving job, but like, fuck. I hadn't slept in two weeks and we launched a new menu item that caused lines out the door and made my check average go from like $80 (lunch)/$140 (dinner) to like fucking $24. I was working 3 times as much (triple doubles how much fun), 3 times as hard, making almost the exact same amount of money. While not sleeping because I'm lucky enough to be an insomniac and it's hard to work 10am - 12pm waiting tables and then work 9 - 6 as an intern, sometimes leaving my internship to cover for someone else, and just not having a moment to sit.

How the fuck are all of you tough enough for this shit? I feel like a baby. Like, I'm complaining, but I don't mean to complain. I just don't know how to get an entry level job when I'm competing with Masters or years of experience. Like, I wouldn't hire some fucking kid straight out of a liberal arts school either if I had a 30 year old with an MA in art history and 4 years experience as a gallery assistant, either. But I'm not even getting the good, prestigious internships I need because I'm losing out to grad students and people fresh out of grad school. (Confirmed for one place because my college advisor was *on the board* and told me later on. It was an internship that had a high chance of leading to a job. AH)

Like, fuck, man. What do I do? I don't want to start a shitty ass vanity project VICE -clone culture magazine to ""stand out."" I have friends that applied for paralegal jobs out of college, with similar degrees and resumes to mine, and got them. I apply to probably 10 jobs a week. I've tried different styles and tones for resumes and cover letters. And I'm barely getting interviews. And then half of my interviews are group interviews with people who are obviously better than me, or at least more attractive as candidates. And I'm sure my plummeting self esteem isn't helping.

Anyone been in this position? What did you do to climb out?

Edit: I can't afford grad school and credit card debt from this vacation is fucking with my credit score to the point where I probably can't get loans for it. I can't move back home, my mom doesn't have enough money to support me and there almost no jobs there. Even waiting tables."

5mkgjn,547,2017-01-07,[EMSK] How to Write a Basic Resume,MexicanSpaceProgram,everymanshouldknow,https://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/5mkgjn/emsk_how_to_write_a_basic_resume/,"I had a search through EMSK and didn't find any concrete (read: practical and useful) guidance on this, so I thought I'd put together a basic guide based on what I've learned on both sides of the desk when it comes to job applications.  I'm also happy to do more of these if anyone is interested.

I'm also going to tailor it, where possible, for two different groups:

- People that have an established career and work history.

- People that are new to the workforce (e.g. high school or college graduates).

**1) Thoroughly read and understand the job advertisement / description and what it is asking you to do.**

This is a very basic screening technique, and you'd be amazed how many people get bounced from consideration for not following basic instructions, typically:

- Please submit a current resume and cover letter.  Happens all the time - people submit one, or the other.

- Please submit a resume and cover letter in (whatever format - .doc, PDF).  Again, a simple instruction, which a lot of people fail by sending through things in odd formats.

- Please submit a resume with professional references.  Another simple one, which people screw up all the time by putting ""references available on request"".

**2) Format, font, style.**

Resumes are professional documents - they represent and market you as an employee to a business, so opting for conservative and professional is what you're after.

There is no 100% correct ""prescribed"" font, as long as it looks consistent - e.g. having part of it in Arial and part of it in Times New Roman looks lazy or copied and pasted.  Pick something reasonable and stick with it.

Obviously, avoid any cutesy / fun / joke fonts - Comic Sans, Papyrus, WordArt - it's a professional document, not a church newsletter.  Ditto for bullets and lists - just use standard bullets and tabs - nobody wants to see your educational awards indicated by Hello Kitty emojis.

Don't fuck around too much with margins or paper size or anything like that.  If the person at the other end tries to print your resume off, and it won't print because it's in a wacky Zimbabwean paper size, they're just going to move on.

- Stick to black and white.  Chances are, if printed or faxed, this is what it's going to come out as anyway, and colour turns up shit in b+w or greyscale.

**3) Length and Content**

1-2 pages for a resume, 1 page for a cover letter.

If you're new to the workforce, a single-page resume is fine.  Don't be tempted to pad it out with irrelevant shit and 1.5 line spacing just to make up 2 pages.

If you're established, avoid the natural inclination to document every single thing you've done in the last five years and end up with five pages of shit.

*General guidelines - new to the workforce:*

- If you have no work experience, activities connected to your academic studies and extracurricular are fine.  The classic examples are internships, work experience, volunteer work and vocational classes.  You lay these out the same way you would work experience (when you did it and what you did).

- These can also be supported by social things - e.g. being on a sports team can help demonstrate teamwork and leadership skills.  However, don't fill it up with irrelevant shit - they're supporting activities, and nobody gives two shits that you got MVP in an Under 10s cricket game.

- If you have some work experience (e.g. retail or fast food), obviously that comes first.  List your employer, position, time employed and main responsibilities.  Don't overdo it.  Cash handling, food safety, customer service is fine.  Don't say that you ""provided excellent customer service while maintaining a high standard of health and safety in a commercial kitchen environment while providing cost-savings to management by reducing shrinkage and enhancing time management"" for a burger flipping job at McDonalds.

- At this point I wouldn't bother detailing reasons for leaving, but if you really feel compelled to, just put ""left to concentrate on my further studies"" or something to that effect - nobody is going to fault you for leaving McDonald's to study for exams so you never have to work at McDonald's ever fucking again.

*General guidelines - established career:*

At this point for most people, your work experience is going to be your most marketable skill, and far more recent than anything you did at college.

Work history should be laid out by your most recent or current position, including:

- Name and location of employer.

- Your position and department (note - should be the last position you held, so even if you were Senior Account Manager for a month, and Junior Account Manager for most of it, put Senior).

- Time in role (e.g. August 2013-November 2015).  For the older jobs, you can play around a bit / guestimate the dates because nobody really gives a shit what you did three jobs and five years ago.

- Your main responsibilities.  Should be pretty much a summary of what is in your position description.  If you can't remember, google the role, find a similar advertisement and use it.  Don't go overboard - you need to keep the length down, especially when you get to the 5-10 year mark in your career and you've had a few different jobs.

- Add any particular accomplishments e.g. ""recognised by management for excellent leadership"", or ""fulfilled all financial and safety KPIs for the years 2012-2014"".  Again, don't go nuts.

- Reason for leaving.  Keep it positive, or at best, minimalist and understandable.  Something like ""offered and accepted position at ABC Widgets"" or ""promoted and offered relocation to the Sydney HQ office"" are the best ones, obviously.  ""Left to pursue further studies and professional development"" is a good one if you left on shitty terms with a place.

- Anything that is older than 5-10 years, or not strictly relevant to the job you're applying for, just put it in under a bullet list like ""additional and supporting work experience"".  Nobody gives a fuck that your 32 year old self worked at KFC as a pimply teenager.

**4) References**

References, wherever possible, should be professional people that can vouch for your attitude, skills and performance.  Obviously this is going to be very different for existing workers vs. people studying or recent graduates, but there's a few commonalities:

- No family members.  I don't give a shit that your mom thinks you're awesome.  If you're new to the workforce and you did work experience for your dad's company, ask someone else at the company to give a reference.  Nothing looks worse (and this happens with 30 year olds), when Tim Johnson Jr's referee is Tim Johnson Snr - believe me, it fucking happens.

- Contact details need to be current.  If you give me a number that goes through disconnected, I'm not going to waste time calling you to get the right number.  I'll move on to the next candidate.

- No wacky email addresses.  Jesus, fuck - people just don't get this.  Obviously, a work email is the best, e.g. j.smith@abccorp.com, or jsmith@school.edu.  If you have to give a personal one, for the love of God get a normal one like johnsmith@gmail.com, not hotbrony6969_xxx@hotmail.com.

- References need to include: name, position, company, email, phone (direct and mobile if available).

- If you don't have their direct extension, google the company and just put their main switchboard number in.

- Don't even bother with written references, unless it's on NASA letterhead and says that Neil Armstrong sucked your cock while they gave you the Medal of Honour - they expire too quickly.

*Reference guidelines: new to workforce.*

Obviously the hurdle here is ""how can I give employer references when I haven't had an employer?"", and the simple answer is, you can't - unless you've worked.

The best one to give is someone in a decent position that can vouch for you - a teacher / lecturer, someone from an intern or WP program, school administrator, student supervisor, something like that.  BUT, there's a caveat - don't expect a maths teacher or a psych professor with 1,000 students in the past year or two to remember who the hell you are / were.

For graduates, this is where tutors and supervisors come in handy because they've worked with you on major projects a lot more closely.

Out of high school, a reference from a teacher or something, and a personal reference from something else (e.g. sport coach) would be more than enough.

*Reference Guidelines - Established*

Obviously, your current and / or most recent employer is who we want to talk to.  If you can put your current reporting manager, that's easiest; however, a lot of people don't want their boss to know that they're looking for another job.

Easiest workaround is to find someone in another dep't that you've worked for that can give the same information without tipping the hat to your boss.  Another good way is to give a company reference and a Client / Customer reference - we get the same information, while minimising how many people at your current work that we contact.

This also works in certain companies that do not, as policy, give full references.  My company, for example, will confirm that I worked here in x position for y time and was responsible for z, but we're not allowed to elaborate further than that.  A Client or Customer reference is a great workaround to this increasingly common issue - as is giving personal details as an alternative.

- Somebody three jobs and five years ago?  Don't even bother."
5mkjpc,7,2017-01-07,Gf broke up with me because I'm not ambitious enough?,10Dante4,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5mkjpc/gf_broke_up_with_me_because_im_not_ambitious/,"I just need other people's perspective on this : me and my ex gf have been together for almost two years. We were crazy in love, met each other's families and were talking about living together at some point. In the time together we've had 2 major fights/arguments. I should also mention she has been diagnosed with depression and she started taking medication, slightly before we got together. 

A bit of background on our careers : both still live  with our parents. I've been working in different gyms personal training and coaching for the whole duration of the relationship. She was doing a internship for the first year of our relationship, she was unemployed for a good part of the second year of the relationship. She had only a waitressing job for 2 months which she left because of ""work stress"". Last month she got a full time marketing's assistant job. 

Me making my measly income and her having a full time job, I thought we could afford a flat together. And maybe get some benefits, don't judge me, to help with the money. She said ""you know you'll have to get a proper job"" and ""benefits are there as a last resort"". Fair enough, I will look for a job then. 

So approximately two weeks after this ^ conversation, and a month after she found a job, I lost my job and the day after she broke up with me (immediately after I mentioned that I lost my job). It might sound that she dumped me because I was jobless, but I knew she was thinking about breaking up earlier than that day because she kinda distanced herself the week prior to ""the talk"" (didn't text me very much, didn't tag me on funny shit on FB etc.) 

Reason being : I don't have an ambition in life, I'm lazy and I don't have a drive to get somewhere in life. I've been stuck in the same place in my life and don't have a drive to improve it. 

I kind of agreed that I don't have an ambition, because other than moving out of my mum's house and getting a better paid job, I don't want to get anywhere else in life. I'm happy working in gyms and coaching, the only problem for me is the income. 

I found it really unfair since it seemed to me, while she was unemployed for almost a year, and I was working, albeit little, she dumps me as soon as she gets a job? 

What do you guys think? "

I'm going to be applying for internships very soon for the summer, and wading through all the different sites and jumping back and forth between sites is such a hassle. In the spirit of my major, Software Engineering, I think that making a web crawler (I think that's the right term?) to do the work for me is a very good choice regarding what I'm trying to accomplish.

Anyways, I have seen examples of some in the past, and I'm not entirely sure what to look for on the googles, so I figure a community like this would be the best place to ask to point me in a good direction. I've dabbled with python, html, and css in the past, so I believe that I'd be able to pick something up rather quickly. Plus, since my major is computer science and I've been around code for awhile now, I shouldn't have a problem. 

Basically, I want to make a search across multiple job boards; like indeed, monster, etc., and then take only the job offerings that have specific keywords within them. Specifically, I'm looking for paid software engineering internships in Pennsylvania that include housing stipends. There's so many positions and so many different companies looking for SE interns, that it would take me forever to crawl all the sites myself.

I'd be very appreciative if someone could point me in the right direction or give me an idea of what it is that I should be trying to look for or construct. Thanks so much, r/learnprogramming."
5mkvtu,17,2017-01-07,Sistema universitario comparato,BrokenC-1,italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/5mkvtu/sistema_universitario_comparato/,"Sono l'unico a pensare che in un'ottica di comparazione con il resto del mondo la nostra università dal punto di vista organizzativo delle scadenze svantaggi i nostri studenti? 
Al netto di discorsi sulla qualità dell'insegnamento, abbiamo un sistema costruito sulle rovine dei sistemi precedenti (e.g. quello del liceo come unico gate per l'università, che però poi sostanzialmente ti garantiva un lavoro dirigenziale, altamente classista), il quale se unito alla tendenza crescente di volersi iscrivere all'università in ambo i sessi (fortunatamente) (fonte: www3.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20120118_00/cap_7.pdf) ci dà indietro un numero spropositato di neolaureati rispetto al numero di lavori disponibili. Il fattore che però mi interessa è che i lavori tradizionali di tirocinio o entry level in Italia richiedano una laurea magistrale, mentre all'estero si inizia a far lavorare a partire dagli undergrad studies (equivalente della triennale) con internship e altro, con anche lavori entry level ancor prima di un eventuale MSc (equivalente della nostra magistrale). Ciò vuol dire che i nostri laureati magistrali a parità di età si trovano sì avvantaggiati dal punto di vista didattico (neanche di tanto, di un annetto), ma perdono sul lato esperenziale. 
Il laureato triennale medio che voglia andare fuori per lavoro/studio (che secondo Almalaurea nel 2015 esce con voto medio 25,5, durata media 4,5+ anni) esce con un sostanziale svantaggio su tutta la linea.
Il risultato è che in Italia trova facilmente lavoro chi ha fatto studi erasmus all'estero (solo il 6% dei laureati triennali e manco troppo facilmente), mentre gli altri annaspano a poter fare esperienza fuori o dentro. 
Cambiare gli studi riequilibrando il peso in modo da dare una qualche utilità alle lauree triennali in ottica di continuazione degli studi anche all'estero e di lavoro credo sia un'ovvietà ma quali passi stanno venendo fatti?
In totale ci mettiamo intorno ai 7,2 anni per laurearci tra laurea triennale e magistrale o magistrale a ciclo unico. Non sarà un po' tanto senza pressoché alcun tirocinio per quasi  la metà della popolazione dei laureati? Sempre tenendo conto del fatto che solo in alcuni corsi di laurea il tirocinio è obbligatorio e taluni casi sia una farsa di copiatura di relazioni finali. 
Qualcuno mi vuole aiutare a fare ordine su questi concetti? Magari anche con esperienze e informazioni storiche che non ho.

I'm currently going into my second semester of my Sophomore year at college and things haven't been going the best. My very first semester I failed college algebra because I 
1) Was never good at math
2) Deal with extreme testing anxiety where I would completely blank out then start to panic because I blanked out and in turn start to become physically agitated. 

I ended up taking another lower level math course this previous semester that would suffice and BARELY failed that course as well because of the same issues. My G.P.A is sitting at a very low 2.3 and I actually had dreams about going to law school.

Friends around me are accomplishing great things and are in way better academic states than I am in. A friend of mine, a freshman, just got an internship at the House of Reps. I applied to this same internship and was denied. 

Some days I just kinda sit in my apartment and play World of Warcraft and wouldn't get up or check my phone because I didn't want to interact with people. Whenever I see my parents or old teachers from HS everyone always raves about how ""intelligent"" I apparently am and how they're looking forward to me accomplishing great things.

I'm never going to. I've given my all to my studies and always ending up coming up short? What am I doing wrong? 

I went to the doctor a while back because I was having physical spasm attacks at night when I would think about all of this stuff and he prescribed my Zoloft. I never went to pickup the prescription because I was afraid of (and I know this is such a miniscule and nonexistent thing) the CVS Pharmacy tech seeing that I had to take anti-depressants or if someone found out I had to start taking them. I had a followup scheduled with the doctor 4 weeks after I was supposed to be taking them but never went because I never started and was too scared to say so.

I know this post is all over the place and I apologize I just have a lot I wish I could get off my chest but I don't want to make this obnoxiously long in fear someone will dislike it and in-turn me."

I do have an interest as a buyers agent though.


Would working as a licensed brokers assistant fulfill the time requirement?


How likely are you to get hired by a broker if you state you only want to work as a buyers agent?



I have an MBA so according to the ok real estate commission I have 50 points of the needed 100 to get the experience equivalency requirement. Could this accelerate things?

5mlt83,1,2017-01-07,Would editorial coding interview problems / competitive programming live-streams be useful and have viewers?,qmaq,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5mlt83/would_editorial_coding_interview_problems/,"Hi there,

I have an idea I want to ask the community about, but first - some background.
I spend a lot of time trying to solve some *competitive programming problems* and I want to utilize my time better and to film my progress. I didn't win any TopCoder/ICPC rounds, but I had an internship at Google and just signed an offer from Amazon, so I focus more on career development through learning, than attempting to win a contest. 

There are mainly 3 tutorial types of videos on YouTube. 

* A problem explained in a super-detailed manner, like Bubble Sort with real cubes with people replacing them and showing each step. Sometimes the code is shown.
* A problem explained on a whiteboard with voice explanation, charts, formulas, examples, and code, sometimes with a person filmed. 

1 and 2 are both well-prepared and we are given the algorithm/information about problem solution immediately. Although this is a good way of learning, there is another one which I think YouTube lacks. 

* Screen-recording. Petr Mitrichev (the only channel I found from CP community) solves a round on TopCoder and we can see him going through a problem statement and writing corresponding code. This is more interesting for some intermediate level programmers (like me). But he lacks one important thing - explanation, making his videos for an unprepared person almost useless. We can just guess what thoughts came to him and why he decided to go with one algorithm and not another.

I found a lot of blogs/github codes with solutions to TONS of problems, but they are usually one-liners, like ""use Dijkstra"" or ""think backwards"". Although sometimes it's really enough info to solve the problem, but this is not really encouraging and makes things too complicated.  
So I am thinking to come up with a format of live-streaming/screen-recording with a thought process explanation and coding. To show the way a person would tackle a problem seen first, without previous preparation and deriving the solution on-go. This format causes some bad feelings, because I usually make some stupid guesses and mistakes, but this is super-honest. And this is how *a real coding interview will look like*, with a portion of struggling. And here my main question comes.

**Would this type of content be helpful for someone?
And what are some other thoughts about this, maybe I'm missing something?**


I imagine this in the way that one instead of watching game streams/news/series in the evening would watch coding streams. I found a good example here: [liveedu.tv](https://www.liveedu.tv/), but I am not sure how popular this field is, and I was able to find only 1 stream about coding interviews / competitive programming with few viewers."

5mm17p,17,2017-01-07,"How to advocate for mental illness and religiosity to safely and positively coexist/How to stop staff-only ""venting"" over difficult clients from going too far?",copiouscuddles,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5mm17p/how_to_advocate_for_mental_illness_and/,"I was personally hospitalized in a child psychiatric unit when I was a teenager and I now have a BA in Psychology and an MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I might as well admit my own struggles with mental illness are part of what brought me to wanting a career in mental health, though I've always kept that quiet in any mental health jobs/internships I've held for fear of negative reactions. I think I'll feel more comfortable being a bit more open about it after I've established my career somewhat and gained the respect of colleagues.   
    
My own hospitalization was well over a decade ago and the facility and any records of my treatment there no longer exist, so sometimes I think it's useless that I still get  angry over what I saw as some mistreatment of me by some of the staff at the time. A big thing that still bothers me is that, while I'm no longer as religious as I was as a teen, I believe I was mistreated by mental health professionals because of religious statements I made they took to be ""psychotic."" Although it's likely too late to make anyone who did this to me pay somehow, I want to advocate for others  facing similar mistreatment.  
  
When I was a depressed teen (with a severe lack of sleep, which definitely explains some of my delusional thoughts though the lack of sleep was not focused on nearly enough) I never actively hallucinated anything, though I believe I got no sleep for several days at least once (barring likely periods of microsleep, as I definitely remember nodding off for a few seconds here and there), so I'm surprised I wasn't worse off than I was because active psychosis is definitely possible with no sleep over a long enough period of time. I spoke with mental health staff of a night I felt incredibly hopeless and suicidal and how I heard thunder and took it to be God speaking to me and reassuring me. I *never* said I actually heard a voice. The thunder being God was only my *interpretation*. I don't think anybody needs to *agree* with religious/spiritual interpretations like that, but it clearly was not harming me. It *gave me hope.* It was incredibly *positive*! The fact that this incredibly positive thing for me was turned into reasons for a diagnosis of psychosis by mental health professionals still angers me to this day.  
  
I know similar things happen. I recently completed my counseling internship on the psych ward of a hospital. One patient was incredibly depressed over the death of her husband. One day she said she saw a bird outside her window and she took it to be her deceased husband greeting her/looking out for her. I don't know if he ever said anything about it in front of her, but one of the psychiatrists openly mocked this patient's spiritual interpretation of the bird in the presence of other staff, including me. I obviously had little power to do much about this as an intern, though I discussed my discomfort with my supervisor who was sympathetic with my concern and agreed with me that spirituality is helpful if it's positive and we can let clients share their spirituality with us whether we believe similarly or not.  
  
I do realize now that some of what I saw as overly negative ""venting"" over difficult patients by hospital staff was often simply how mental health workers end up coping with a difficult job. I know some nurses personally and some appreciation for black humor can definitely come with the territory...but how do you stop from crossing a line? And how do you treat a client's religious/spiritual beliefs with respect and help other staff do the same, while treading the difficult balance of knowing what spiritual beliefs are helpful and positive and which ones may not be? I know religiosity definitely actually can feed psychosis at times.  I also know, especially from some guilt and shame over my sexuality I have personally managed to shed after a Catholic upbringing, that religion can have negative effects on mental health as well as positive ones.    
    
I know I got a little long with this post so thank you if you've read this far! I think this is an important discussion and I'm interested in any responses.

I'm considering applying in 2018, but I'm struggling to understand if I've got any chance at all at top schools with my profile. It would be great to get your opinion on my current default career path, and any better alternatives - I can still change some things. Any feedback is immensely appreciated.

White / Male / Eastern European / 27 at matriculation

**Work Experience**: 4 years, Presales &amp; then Consulting - IT Services firm, London  
• 4 years at matriculation, all in the London office of a European blue chip IT Services firm (virtually unknown in US), of which:  
	• 1.5 years+: IT presales / bid management  
		  ○ consistent strong performance: one promotion with no title change.
	• 2.5 years+: Same IT services firm, but moved to business consulting arm - in the Digital division within consulting  
		  ○ [NB: I've just transferred here, and considering moving again if I can better my chances significantly.]  
	• Previously did a 12-month internship at Fortune 30 company - think GE/HP (non-consulting)    

**Extra Curriculars**: Several but nothing amazing.  
	• was on the board of one of the largest student societies at my college  
	• played soccer for my campus team  
	• lots of small initiatives at work outside my core job  
	  
**Undergrad school**: Official rankings of my undergrad: UK Top 10 overall / Top 140 globally. Think Loughborough/Surrey- not Russell Group, and virtually unknown in US I presume. To get an idea: it's target for Big4, but not for any MBB or even niche MCs.  
Major: BSc Management

**Stats**  
• GMAT Score: Let's assume 750+. I've got plenty of time to prepare and I also need a good score to offset lack of big names on CV.  
• Undergrad: UK 2:1, ~80th percentile in my class. There's no standard conversion to US GPA, estimates I found range between 3.1 and 3.7.  
	• I have some mitigating circumstances (bereavement), but don't want to bring them up.  

**MBA Info**:  
•Goal of MBA: Short term - consulting (ideally MBB).  
• Target schools: M7, INSEAD, LBS, Oxbridge or bust. Might extend to a few other schools targeted by MBB.

**Advice Required**  

I'm unclear on how much weight some factors have (e.g. prestige of employers and college, or lack thereof). I'd like to hear your thoughts, particularly around how the following options would change my prospects:  

1. Moving to a more prestigious firm  
	• Where would be best purely for M7 MBA chances? Big 4? Niche MC? Fortune 100 non-consulting?  
2. Stay at my current firm, in consulting, but move to another office, abroad  
3. Stay at my current firm, in consulting, but within consulting, move away from Digital business consulting - based on my assumption that 'Digital' consulting is frowned upon by Adcoms.
  
Some other questions I'd like to hear your views on:  
  
4\. How important are public speaking ECs for Adcoms, are they just expected from everyone?  
5\. If I get British citizenship (will have dual nationality), will this affect my chances? Am I in an underrepresented demographic at the moment?  
6\. Bringing up mitigating circumstances during college - is it frowned upon by Adcoms? If not, would it make any difference in my case? My grades are by no means disastrous, just pretty average.  
7\. Realistically, does a rejection have any effect on subsequent applications at that school? I already know they say it doesn't, but will they even look at past applications from candidates?   
8\. With my default path mentioned before, what tier of schools am I looking for as target atm e.g. top50? Do I have more than a 0% chance at any of my target schools mentioned?  
9\. If you were me, what would you focus on in the next 2 years to become a better candidate?   
	• Would you wait 1-2 more years? Would this make me a significantly better candidate?  

&amp;nbsp;

I put some structure to it to make it easier to follow, but feel free to comment in any format. Thanks!"

5mmlrw,6,2017-01-07,"College senior asking for entry level job market advice for Marketing, Design, Comp Sci industries",quantum-blade,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5mmlrw/college_senior_asking_for_entry_level_job_market/,"---My Situation--- 
Tl;dr 22 Year College student nearing end of degree path seeking practical, honest feedback on with planning for Design, Marketing, and Developer career/jobs. Have personal preference towards good work life balance in career, without getting into too much debt right out of the gate, but want an honest outsider’s perspective on my specific dilemma and what could be reasonably be done hack it out. My full ride Texas Grant is coming to an end, but all my core courses are completed.

I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate. The job market down here doesn't offer much for these.

*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci major, that might also be an asset if I seek out TECHNICAL WRITING. JOURNALISM is also viable.

*GRAPHIC/WEB DESIGN: This one weighed very heavily on me, as I did enjoy the major, and I do regret changing course from it. If I were to change back, I would have to take 19 more classes, and at the absolute latest, graduate December 2018 – this might not be so bad, as this extra time would allow me to seek out relevant graphic/ web design internships. I know someone who has had a paid graphic/web design internship for my local school district for about two years, and I’d kill to have that type of experience on my resume – although, such positions aren’t super uncommon. I feel that on several levels, this might be the riskiest investment, but there’s also a payoff at the end of it that might make it worth it.

*WEB DEVELOPMENT/PROGRAMMING: With this plan, I feel that I would just graduate as is, devote time to learning the craft, then relocate to whichever part of Texas would take me.

There’s an overarching question for each of these: Am I thinking pragmatically enough? I think I have the same preferences as other people my age: good work/life balance and adequate/more than adequate pay for what I do, benefits- each path has its own in terms of attaining jobs, some more difficult than others. I'd be very appreciative to hear honest suggestions on what I could do."

5mn6sa,18,2017-01-07,"New to Business Development, Need Some Advice...",FutureMillionaire_,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/5mn6sa/new_to_business_development_need_some_advice/,"So I'm a 19 year old canadian student who just scored an internship in Manhattan, New York for a B2B business development role for a European SaaS company.

I've only been on the job for a few days but I feel kind of lost... 

I had great success with my inside sales internship last summer, but this internship is completely different in so many ways..


**What the job involves (so far):**

- Cold calling/Emailing C-level executives in small-medium sized businesses

- Lead generation (have to find every prospect and enter them in excel with contact info (name, city, phone number, industry, email etc.)

- Social media management 

It really is a sweet gig &amp; i'm thankful for it, but i'm literally the only business development rep there, the hiring manager is Italian &amp; doesn't speak very good english - so I don't have anyone to really train me on the role (business development/outbound cold calling, etc). There's no scripts I can start from, no email templates, no Salesforce CRM (the company uses their own CRM but it's not very efficient and is still in the development phase) and i've got a month to prove myself... 


**About the company**

The company has been around for a approximately a decade and is fairly established in the European market (HQ is in Milan, Italy, have offices in Madrid &amp; London as well) and they literally just opened up an office in Manhattan about a month ago, so i'm essentially involved in building their business from scratch in an entirely different country/language/culture. 


**What I'm Selling**

The product/service i'm selling 
is also fairly complex, meaning we offer SO many different services, like business expansion services. One of the things we can do is take care of all the logistics of selling your product in the European or US market like Warehousing, shipping, packaging, duties/fees associated with shipping, commission fees (eBay, Amazon, Paypal fees) etc. for a certain commission incentive for us. 

**Our primary service involves** e-commerce channel synchronization &amp; integration (you can post all your products on one platform and they will simultaneously be added/edited across your channels on eBay, Amazon, Shopify, your own website, etc. as well as revenue tracking)

**other services include:**
SEO, SEM campaigns, Software development, customer service outsourcing, and so much more....

**The Price**

Our full service e-commerce program costs a one time payment of approx $5,000 - $10,000, plus ~$85/month from there on out - this is what i'm supposed to try and sell. 

**The Issue**

Having no previous experience or training with coldcalling, I'm finding it difficult to explain &amp; entice prospects within a short period of time about all our services, and even when i've found some great leads, getting them to actually commit has been tough as well... 

What are some things I can do to become as efficient &amp; successful as possible as a Business Development exec? 

I have one month to prove myself (then i go back to school).

If anyone has some tips, scripts, email templates, or general advice for cold calling with c-level execs, that'd be extremely helpful!


**TL;DR** Got an internship in Manhattan with a European software company that just opened  up their office here a month ago, no one speaks fluent english except me, i'm the only BDR there, was given virtually no training, sales cycle seems fairly long, have a month to prove myself before i go back to school, not sure where to start... 

**apologizes in advanced for format/grammar, i'm on mobile**

**Edit:** *Just to clear things up a bit,  the ""prove myself"" part is something I want to do, not something my employer has pressured me into thinking"

I've been taking beginning programming courses online, and it's really appealing to me and what I want in a job. Unfortunately, I'm a last year Chemistry undergrad graduating soon, and I'm not looking to change majors. I still want to get into the CS field though in some capacity.

I've looked at the school opportunities for internships, and it seems like the majority of them require you to be enrolled in CS or some computer-related field. Looking outside the school's listings isn't promising either.

So what opportunities are even out there for someone who has the drive and willingness to learn CS but maybe not the degree for it yet?"

However, many of the internship positions I am looking at require a whiteboard test during the interviewing process. 

What approach should I take regarding this subject? Should I tell prospective interviewers that I can't write on whiteboards and offer to type the tests instead? Should I specifically mention my disability?"

Just a couple of questions I have:

1. Am I spending too much space talking about my two internships? I didn't really do all that much during either. Would it help more to have an extra line or two to talk more about my current job?

2. Is there too little in the skills section? I've read this section should be reserved for hard skills, but I don't have all that much to put in the way of hard skills. For example, the only computer skill I have is MS Office.

Thanks for your time!"
5mo0ph,2,2017-01-07,How to explain wrongful termination in application/interview?,Ultra16,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5mo0ph/how_to_explain_wrongful_termination_in/,"I have posted about this before. Basically, I was terminated from my first professional job 2 months ago due to being framed and then thrown under the bus. 

I took a 1-year paid internship (no benefits) at a big company to get my foot in the door, but my sociopathic supervisor would make me work off the clock and violate some **very** serious animal care rules (that could have everyone in the lab's privilege to work with animals taken away if discovered). She was also very unprofessional, disrespectful, emotionally abusive (would yell and throw tantrums for petty things, put employees against each other and humiliate them, gaslight me to avoid admitting faults, etc.), and immature. For these reasons she has a very high turnover rate but still somehow has a job there. 

After 9 months of internship, I was looking for other jobs within the company but other supervisors were afraid of taking me from her. My supervisor officially hired me, and I only accepted out of necessity (working off the clock keeps you poor), fear, and for the healthcare benefits. 

*This is where things get bad.* After 2 employees under my supervisor resigned one after the other and reported her to the department manager (also female), I decided to speak up. 

It didn't go well. 
The dept manager originally seemed receptive to my complaints, but then sent me a letter with ""performance issues my supervisor has documented and I must fix immediately."" I knew this was my supervisor's method of retaliation, since the issues were all systematic but blamed only on me. I replied stating this and forwarded it to HR, so my supervisor started bombarding me with emails of similar errors and making them seem like they were only my fault, then forwarding them to the department manager. More errors started to happen as my supervisor got my only coworker (who would also be at least partially responsible for these errors and violations) to also deny all claims by me. HR claimed that the clock punch photos only proved I worked off the clock and not that she made me do it (???). The manager then said I had not improved my performance and fired me for ""performance deficiencies on probationary period.""

*How do I explain this when applying to new jobs? The fake documentation makes me seem pretty bad in case any new employers contact my old one, so I'm trying to figure out if I should even keep these jobs on the application/resume.* **Should I only put the internship?**

**TL;DR: I got fired from my first job after college due to being framed and thrown under the bus, so I need help on what to say in application/interview.**

You can go Rogue in the DZ, but with things as twisted as they are, what's to stop a morally unscrupulous agent from snapping in the LZ? Currently, friendly fire. It has been many a time that a JTF officer has done something to grind my gears, whether it's a dead dog in the crossfire, blocked cover, incessant hellos, or a cold refusal to raise me up when I've fallen as I beg my final breaths at their toes. 

Turn JTF friendly fire off and trigger JTF Horde Mode with sustained, intentional damage to any officer or civilian.

Once triggered, safe houses and checkpoints close, ISAC is disabled, map vanishes. Matchmaking is disabled. No escaping combat, no turning back. Hordes of JTF officers , which now hit like real threats, pursue you relentlessly through the open world, through buildings, underground areas, quarantines, and open streets. All mobs are still hostile to you. Fortified barricades appear on otherwise empty streets that continually push you to change your route and tactics. Getting cornered or trapped is a real danger. JTF snipers set up on rooftops as the green line continually approaches. Civilians betray your location to officers or mobs.

Maybe a single line of communication with Faye is left open for her to berate you for your choice or for Keener to hack into your comms and wish you the best.

Obviously, you can't go full Caligula in the LZ without consequence, so this would need to end in death, somehow. Perhaps escalating difficulty of JTF waves or named JTF and Agents that culminate in a chopper bombing the shit out of you, on a timer of twenty minutes. Can you get to the chopper? It would be like GTA with cops and stars, except timed and with no way out.

Or maybe there's a multiplayer component where an Agent or two can enter your game state in the final ten minutes and hunt you down. 

There would need to be some stimulus to keep moving--say, JTF explosive experts slowly work to destroy your position, wherever you may decide to rest, and after two minutes in the same spot within 50 meters, kaboom.

There could be leaderboards that reward things like distance traveled, multi-kills, kills from a hidden position, kills without taking damage, and time alive. Rogue caches from Keener and his ilk could appear in your Stash to reward you for your self-interested actions.

Maybe a fun fall project for an intern at Massive?

(with ugly graph),WantToBeFIRE,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5moete/its_been_a_roller_coaster_of_a_ride_over_the_last/,"27 Married, Single Income No Kids. Edit: for those asking my wife is finishing college and has been flying out every month for a few weeks at a time to take care of her dad who is fighting cancer.

Net Worth $180K. 

Planning to retire in 12 years at age 39

Let me start by saying I have not yet reached FI, but I do plan to retire early. If you came to read the story of someone who is finished already sorry to disappoint. If you don't mind a work in progress, keep reading. 

**The Beginnings: Work and School**

2006 First job repairing computers at big box retail and an unpaid internship.

2007 Graduate HS, attend low price private school in a state far from home. This school is highly ranked on list of best value schools (good education with low costs) Decide to study music. Parents help with housing costs and tuition not covered by scholarships. This allows me to focus on school, take unpaid internships, and save for the trip of a lifetime.

2009 Take a few years off school to go volunteer abroad. Learn a 2nd language.

2011 Return to USA with $1500, did my research to buy a motorcycle from craigslist that was a good deal and rain gear/helmet to have some sort of reliable transportation. Start working as medical interpreter with new language skills. Very infrequent work. saved a few $$ to start an IRA. At the same time  worked at another unpaid internship. Worthless company that basically hustled me.

2011 Fall return to university, change major to business management, emphasis in marketing. Sold my motorcycle for a small profit, purchased a car, sold that for a small profit, got myself another motorcycle.

2012 Took a job doing entry level SEO as I continued my marketing degree. Got a summer internship with Fortune 3 company. Low wage but exposes me to corporate life. A few more $$ goes to IRA. I realize I want to start making enough money to pay all my own bills for tuition/rent etc so I start buying and selling motorcycles whenever I see a margin for profit. I also do wedding photography, DJing, and motorcycle/scooter seat reupholstery for some spare cash.

2013 New unpaid internship at small company near my school. Part-time work as the #2 marketer in a 15 person company. Get in trouble for selling too many vehicles without a dealer license. Paid about 1200 bucks but I had probably saved 12k after paying for IRA, rent and tuition, so in the end it was worth it, although I did stop flipping vehicles for profit. Proud to say I have always paid cash for every vehicle that I have ever owned. Thought about opening a dealership with a small investment but I decided to see what full time work would be like at a small company.

2014 Co-founder and former head of marketing leaves the startup. I take over all aspects of marketing and graduate with 4 year degree. Company is growing. I agree to take a small weekly stipend of $250 as a 1099 worker for my part-time role while I finished school.

**Full-time work and a wedding. First home**

2015 Stayed with start-up for my first full-time employment @ 38k base (though still 1099 because I am a pushover). Incentives push that up a bit. No 401k, no healthcare (although I am asking for both). Continued side gigs.

Also in October 2015, I got married for a total cost under $4000. Put that on a rewards credit card with 6 months interest free payments. We had good credit from wise use of credit cards through college. We purchased a $180k starter home for $5% down on a 3.875 30 year note that had 2 bedrooms on the ground floor and 1 bedroom in the basement. It also had a second kitchen and bathroom in the basement. We decided to live in the basement and rent the upstairs to cover our mortgage. At least we would be living rent-free and the home buying process was enough to convince my boss to change my status to W2 rather than 1099.

We are down to $0 savings in the bank and about $3500 CC debt but ready to get started on the right foot. Also good news, the company has decided we can have healthcare starting Dec 1. I sign up for HSA and plan to max that as another tax-advantaged savings account while waiting for a proper 401k. My wife and I are just barely 26 and lost coverage through our parents plans but December is so close we decide to roll the dice.

**Shoulda had that emergency fund**

November 2015 My wife has to have an appendix surgery. Less than 18 hours in the hospital (would have been shorter but we went in Saturday at 11pm and had to wait until morning for the surgery.) That left us with a few bills (Hospital room, Doctor, Surgeon, Radiologist, Lab, Anesthesiologist, etc) that came to a grand total of $14k, certainly not starting on the right foot. 

I talked to the billing department at every party that had sent us a bill and let them know that we were uninsured and would like to pay what we can but we would need a discounted rate. They asked to see tax returns from the previous year (which fortunately for this situation showed very low income due to only working part time as a student). In the end we were able to negotiate about a 75% discount for a total cost between $3000 and $4000, which could be paid over 6 months to all providers except one. 

We cannot use HSA funds for these bills to save on the taxes, even though the bills came in December, because the date of service was November. I put these bills on the same cash back credit card as the wedding and we went into emergency mode to be able to get out of our debt situation pretty much the minute we got out of the hospital. We started cutting back on the road trips and going out to eat. We never had cable and dropped down to the cheapest internet plan available. I used Republic Wireless then RingPlus to save on cellular bills. We had some ups and downs but we were luckily able to keep making all payments on time to clear out the wedding and medical debt in just 6 months. YAY back to zero! Actually better than zero as April 2016 I sold the last few extra cars I had to fill in the gaps to max my IRA for the 2015 tax year.

Feb 2016 Company has grown 600% since I came onboard to run their marketing. After exceeding all growth expectations at that company and not seeing proper rewards and recognition I decided to look around and see what else was out there. The last straw was when my boss wouldn't let me take a lunch break on the day of a friend's wedding to go to the court house and support them.

**A much better job**

April 2016 after applying to dozens of jobs and having lots of early morning interviews, I had several offers and accepted a position at a growing medium size company that has a good marketing team, awesome leadership, and a great work life balance. I am excited to be able to specialize in my favorite area of marketing, PPC, and to be with a company that already appreciate me for my track record of success. Base salary is 73k with a 2k bonus. Includes healthcare, 401k with 4% match, good commute, and they encourage all new employees to bring their spouse or significant other to a Dave Ramsey course that they pay for to help families plan finances for a strong future.

Dec 2017 Well 8 months at my current position and I am breaking records with my channel, managing our multi-million dollar spend and generating twice as many leads as they were getting before I joined. We continue to live on a tight budget but are living a bit nicer than we did as college students. We can certainly do better than we are but I'm happy so long as we can hit our goals of maxing HSA, 401k, and both of our IRAs each year. 

**Home #2**

December 15 2016 We closed on our second house with 5% down at 3.75%. We didn't plan to be buying our second home so soon but it was another duplex that was for sale by owner and they dropped the price the day that I glanced at it on Zillow. We could do another 5% owner-occupied primary residence conventional loan since we had proof of rent covering the other property for at least 12 months. Luckily we were just able to get approved for this one and are now renting our old basement and the basement of this place to cover both mortgages and we have moved to an upstairs 3 bedroom (with garage) RENT FREE. We even pay an extra 12th payment to the principal each month to reduce the mortgages to around 21 years. Yes, I know we have the additional work as landlords so not technically free, but we have learned a lot as landlord for the last year and a half and we feel like we have the experience to better select and manage tenants. And yes there is quite a load of debt in these 2 homes that we have to be cautious about, but I believe the risk justified the reward. Even if we were without all of our renters, I could reduce my 401k contribution and cover the mortgages. Also, to those who may ask, yes we claim all rental income on our taxes (after appropriate expenses)

**The Future**

I think we are finally getting into stride and soon we will be able to have a very steady stream of income. Feels good to almost be done playing catch up. 401k and IRA for 2016 should be maxed by April 15 deadline this year. Could be sooner but we are living already with a weak emergency fund and don't want to drain it. HSA is already maxed for 2016. I believe I can justify a raise in the next few months. We want to get a slightly nicer car, since our $1000 daily driver now has over 250k miles on it. Now that we are maxing out our HSA, 401k, and IRAs, we will build a stronger emergency fund, pay down mortgages to remove PMI, make some small improvements, and then look at other taxable accounts to invest in. I have tried a little P2P lending and I am interested in what Betterment has to offer on tax reductions. 

We could move to another of our units since we don't really ""need"" the 3 bedrooms here, but it is nice as my wife and I are musicians to have an extra room for instruments and we are enjoying the sunlight of living upstairs finally. Also we could have her sick dad come live with us once he is stabilized from his recent surgeries. After this we are planning to have kids, continue to travel and visit relatives, and wait to see what happens next. If we decide to invest more into real estate we will consider an LLC or corporation, as 2 duplexes already feels like a liability stretch for one couple.

Also, I know that my story does not represent the norm, and I know the luck and blessing that got me here are a big part of my current success. But at the same time, I really appreciate this sub and the FIRE mindset that has helped us get started and stay strong in the tough times.

Here is a screenshot from Mint. Not as fancy as others with their custom spreadsheets, but it gets the point across just the same. I am a simple man. Note that the big jump in net worth is from when we purchased the first home but the debt was not accurately recorded for a few months.

TLDR: 27year old Musician turned digital marketing. Tried solo, small and large companies, ended up loving a medium size business. A little real estate on the side helping my numbers. Finally maxing 401k the first year I am offered it. Hoping to retire in 10-15 years but who the heck know once we start having kids. Ultimate goal is family time and volunteering locally and abroad."

So, for my studies, I have an ""internship"" to do in a shop, whatever it sells. I have been working for years in ""normal"" shops, and I know for sure I would be bored to death if I had to do that again, so I was thinking looking for something a bit different.

So I have a few questions for you guys :

* How are the customers ? I have seen a few threads talking about shoplifters here, do you have more of them in this industry, or is it like everywhere else ?

* Did you know well the products before working there, like for example a seller in a sneakers store is usually very knowledgeable about it even before working there ? Like, my only experiences with adult stores were when, within a group a friends, we decided to get a doll or a dildo for another friend's birthday

* Is/Was your experience globally good in this industry ? Would you do that again/ Do you plan on staying in this business ?

Thank you for your feedback !"

At the same time I started an online Post Baccalaureate at Oregon State University where I took: 


+Two intro classes 


+Computer Architecture 


+Data Structures 


+Operating Systems


&amp;nbsp;



After completing these classes I enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, where I have only taken Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence.    


&amp;nbsp;


    

My question is about the best way to transition to a job as a Software Developer. Unfortunately, I don't have any work experience as a software developer. I use SQL at my job, but it is pretty basic. Since, I don't have much experience I want to know would it be better to apply to internships? I think internships could make it easier for me to get my foot in the door, but at the same time I would be leaving a well paying ($29 an hr) full time job with benefits. The biggest concern here is that after an internship ended I might not have a job. How common is it for companies to extend full time offers immediately following an internship?     

&amp;nbsp;


Ideally I would prefer to look for full time jobs,but I realize that I don't have much experience, and one purpose of internships is to provide learning opportunities for the interns. Would a company have a problem with someone with unrelated work experience applying for an internship?     
      
&amp;nbsp;

  
    
If this changes anything I was planning on applying for jobs (internships) in around 6-7 months after taking a few more classes. I would rather focus my time now on learning, and building a side project in order to have more successful interviews in the future. On the other hand, the quicker I get into a CS job or internship the more I'll learn. At this point this is probably extraneous, but my undergrad was in Mathematics (pure). In any case, I'm here because I'm not sure of the best approach, so any guidance, personal experience, stories, or opinions are all welcome. Thanks all!

&amp;nbsp;



tl;dr I am entering my second semester in GA Tech's OMSCS program, and work full time (1.5 years so far, pretty good job). What's the best way to transition to a CS career (internship or full-time job, and when should I start looking)?

I was, at first, ecstatic to be home and visit with my parents and sibling, but I've quickly gotten sick of them. But it's not just that I'm sick of them--rather, it's like I just don't enjoy their company.

Since being back, I've realized that my home atmosphere has this sort of constant negative and tense energy that totally brings me down. I always feel slightly on edge and uncomfortable around my family, and that's nothing new--in fact, I've felt this way for most of my life and used to think that feeling meant there was something wrong with me. But after being surrounded by close friends in a positive and happy environment at school, I've realized that that's just not the case. Home kind of feels like a black hole that sucks that positivity out of me. Luckily, I've been keeping myself busy with exercise, internship applications and book reading so it hasn't been too bad here. But I guess what I'm saying is there's a stark contrast to the contentment I feel around my homies at school and the way I feel here around my parents and sibling. Basically, I don't think I like my family too much.

Has anyone else had this sort of general experience--namely, realizing that you don't like your family very much? How did you deal with it? Did that feeling fade over time?

Initially, I smoked really infrequently. I bought an eighth that November, and it lasted me until December 2013. I ran out and didn't buy more until March 2014, and from that point until now, I've smoked almost daily. The longest tolerance break I took was for maybe a month in November 2014 when I ran out and my connection had stopped selling, but beyond that, I've taken maybe 5-7 days off here or there when I had a lot going on in school and life. Nowadays, I average an ounce every 2-3 months. 

Next month I'm starting an internship at a newspaper that *may* drug test. From talking to friends who have interned there, they haven't ever actually drug tested an intern, but the professor who acts as the liaison said HR can drug test on the first day. Obviously, it's not worth the risk. More so, I want to prove to myself that I actually can quit smoking. 

The problem is that I'm struggling way more than I expected. **A lot more.** I just feel so off. I would smoke a small bowl every night before bed to help me sleep, and I would eat almost every meal high. Now, it feels like I can hardly sleep. My sleep cycle is just gone. I basically just sleep in 2-4 hour increments throughout the day, and I have no appetite whatsoever. I eat one small meal a day, and that's just forcing myself to eat once I start to feel really weak. Beyond that, I feel like I have this constant (albeit small) nagging anxiety in me. I'm definitely feeling better than the first 2 days after quitting, but I wasn't expecting to still feel so off. 

I think my problem is that I have no problem not smoking/cutting back when I have things to do, but I'm on a long (the entire month of January) winter break in the northeastern U.S., so I'm mostly just stuck inside. I'd usually just play videogames or something to pass the time, but they just aren't as enjoyable sober. I feel like if it were summer, this would be so much easier because I could actually go out and do things outside and enjoy nature as a distraction. 

Sorry for the long post. I swear I'm almost done lol. I would really appreciate any tips/advice from you guys, as I've always really respected this community. 

I have two other concerns I'd like to bring up though. First, one important reason why I smoked pot frequently is because of back pain. In May 2015, I was rear ended by a guy in a pickup truck who was texting. I had been stopped for 10+ seconds waiting for someone to make a left turn, and he hit me doing around 40mph and caused $15,000+ in damages to my car, which totaled it. As a result, I have several herniated disks in my back, and I'm in almost constant pain. I've been through physical therapy and the chiropractor since then, but it seems like things have more or less leveled off. On really bad days, it seems like the the only time I'd get total relief is if I smoked + took an ibuprofen. Right now, I'm thinking I might just keep the pot I have (probably around 12g) and smoking a small hit in the future when my back is really acting up. Do you guys think I should do this, or should I seek alternatives? I'm worried that I'll fall back into my old routines if I start again, but I don't know.

The second thing I wanted advice on is my friends. So far, they've been absolutely horrible to deal with. I've told them how much I'm struggling, and they're just making it worse. For example, I probably felt the worst ~24 hours after I had quit smoking. One of my friends said he understood how tough it can be and to let him know if I need anything. So, I went over his house that night to hang out thinking it'd get my mind off of it. Nope. As soon as I'm there, he opens a jar and tries to show me/have me smell the weed he had just picked up, and then he pulls out a joint he had rolled and asks me to take a drag on it (unlit) to see how good the airflow was. I think the harder thing is that I've been receiving daily Snapchats of bong rips. Like wtf. Who does that? If a friend tells you he's struggling to quit smoking and says he wants to distance himself from it as much as possible, why would you send him a 1min video of you taking a bong rip or a pic of your freshly cleaned bong?

Sorry again for the long post, but it's 6:15am, I've been up since 3:30 (fell asleep at 12:30), and typing this out has been really cathartic. That, and I'm a journalism major, so I really enjoy writing haha. "

I am currently in my second year at University (3 years University in Germany) and have to pay all my expenses and bills myself. I have some loans through the University amounting to 9,000 euros currently (with another 3,000 expected for the third year) that I need to pay back after I graduate. Additionally I am expected to pay 5,000 euros a year cash (2,500 per semester). My Spring semester payment is coming up and plainly put, I do not have the capital currently to pay it. 

In terms of liquid assets and debts right now;

I have 
$1,000 in an American bank account.
$1,000 in my PayPal account.
$500 in my German bank account.

I have
A MileagePlus Explorer Card nearly maxed out at $5,800/$6,000 with extremely high monthly payments. I have been making it a point not to miss or make late payments on this since I don't want to ruin my credit, but it's proving hard to keep up. I used this card to pay for my previous year of school and flights from home.
An Amazon.com Visa with $800/1,000 on it. I used this card for school supplies and grocery payments.

In terms of monthly expenses;
$2,500 Spring semester bill due this week (with a possibility of paying in monthly installments of $500 until May)
$80 /mo for Student Insurance
$50 /mo groceries and similar

I also had two jobs this past semester (both Campus Jobs) that pay minimum wage (8,80 Euro) and I average only about 30-40 hours a month between the two of them. However one of the jobs ended in December so I am hunting for another job.

I also need to look ahead as I need to take an internship over the summer to bolster my studies and future career, but I am worried about not earning enough money by doing that so as to afford the final year of University (whereas just working for money in the summer I could potentially earn much much more).

I have some possessions I could potentially sell of (school books, electronics and such) but don't know the best way of doing so in Germany.

I'm really worried right now about how to proceed without digging myself into a deeper hole and was hoping someone here has even a bit of advice to offer me.

5mqwns,273,2017-01-08,Hoshi got a raw deal,adamkotsko,DaystromInstitute,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/5mqwns/hoshi_got_a_raw_deal/,"Among the technological downgrades in Enterprise, the lack of a magical translator was one of the most promising, but also least consistently observed. And that left the character of Hoshi in a weird spot. On the one hand, she's probably one of the true geniuses of the Star Trek canon -- she has such a gift for languages that she can begin to pick them up almost immediately. On the other hand, her gifts turn out to be irrelevant most of the time, simply because it eats up a lot of screen time and bogs down the story to have to highlight language differences. 

The same goes for her personality. On all previous Star Trek shows, we're dealing with people for whom long-term deep space travel is a totally normal thing and Starfleet is a prestigious and respected institution. In Enterprise, it's something new and potentially questionable -- and so it makes sense that we would get our first major character who was ambivalent at best about space travel. It's interesting as an _idea_, but in actual implementation, it's hard to see what you do with it. Either you leave Hoshi as a one-note fraidy-cat character, or else you do the only natural character development and she gets over it. So once again, Hoshi's distinctive trait becomes irrelevant.

Hoshi does have her moments of triumph -- becoming the first-ever Star Trek character to go to Risa and simply have a good time, taking command of Enterprise and refusing to back down to the Prime Minister, and of course becoming the Empress in the Mirror Universe. All of that is small consolation, though, for the constant disrespect shown to her character by the writers (who squander an entire episode on her bizarre fever dream during a transporter glitch and at one point have her gratuitously lose her shirt while crawling through the ventilation system) and, even worse, by Captain Archer. 

One of the worst examples comes early on. In ""Silent Enemy,"" Enterprise is confronted with a hostile species with whom they cannot communicate. So naturally, Archer tasks Hoshi with the humiliating task of trying to figure out Lt. Reed's favorite food. Here we have a main plot that literally could not be a better fit for Hoshi's skillset, and she's doing the kind of thing you hand off to an intern. This pattern of disrespect gradually evolves into near-hostility, culminating in Archer's casual disregard for Hoshi's well-being when he needs her to help him decode something on the Xindi weapon. I understand that it was an extreme situation, but he seems to me to show no real sympathy. You almost get the sense that he's mad at her for, you know, breaking under torture, which everyone -- _including Captain Picard!_ -- actually does outside of film fantasies. 

In-universe, Archer's treatment of Hoshi does sadly make sense, because her work is the kind of thing you only notice when it's going wrong. Archer has no idea what is involved in the kind of linguistic work Hoshi does -- in fact, virtually no one on Earth is even approaching her level -- and so he doesn't have a vivid sense of the amazing things she's achieving every day. The only time Hoshi comes clearly into view is when she's either messing up the translation or whining about how scared she is. 

The one saving grace, in my mind, beyond the triumphant plot points listed above, is that they at least do not slot her in as a love interest. In season 1, Trip seems to have a bit of a fixation on her (the kind of thing you probably only notice if you've rewatched it way too many times, as I have), and they put her in repeated situations where Reed feels obligated to ""let her down gently"" (he misinterprets her investigation into his favorite food as a way of propositioning him, and she shows up in his room when she loses her shirt). But when she is finally partnered off, it is in the purely Platonic friendship she develops with the other neglected subordinate, Mayweather. She might not have had much of a chance to develop into a lead character herself, but at least they didn't downgrade her to a prop for another character.

**tl;dr** The character of Hoshi had some built-in limitations, but the writers did her few favors. "

* American in Scandinavia because wife has a good job here. 
* Have the equivalent of a Green Card 
* I am 28, work part time as a bartender
* My first bachelors is in Urban Planning from the US. 
* Have not really tried to get related work/don't think it'll lead to worthwhile related work here.
* Just bought our first home here with good terms and I can afford my half of the mortgage just working part time. 
* Nearing 100% fluency in local language (been here three years)
* Only prior tech experience I can point to is a position I had before moving abroad writing R data-cleaning scripts for a transportation agency. (Paid Internship)

I took a couple Bachelor's programming courses at university (Intro to OOP &amp; Numeric Computing) this past Fall out of curiosity and loved them and the tech department itself. Got upper percentile exam results on both. This Spring I've elected to take System Architecture 1, and the followup to Intro to OOP. 

Now I'm considering applying for a full time bachelors in CS for the Fall (here it would be a Bachelors of Programming and System Architecture). 

The structure of this bachelor's (3 year program) has one semester of fully open personal project studio development, and another semester of free subject choices. And because I will have taken 2 or 3 of the degree's requisite courses on my own beforehand, I'll have even more open credits to take what I want - or maybe just finish early. 

**Most importantly:** Because of my visa status and because this is Northern Europe: if I'm accepted to a bachelors in the Fall I'll be awarded some living expense stipends and probably be able to bartend just once or twice a week each semester. 

Along the way I very much plan to publish my smaller project work online and keep myself looking shiny. 

The situation is pretty good as far as career turnarounds go, but I worry about some pitfalls ahead I don't see now.

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut/friends/online. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy.

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere and face fucking. While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Message me on here or ask for my email

5mruog,1,2017-01-08,"My [f,27] boyfriend[m,26] of 5 years has been inappropriately texting and talking to an attractive coworker [f,25]. Need some advice. WARNING: It's a long story.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5mruog/my_f27_boyfriendm26_of_5_years_has_been/,"It's difficult to make this short as there is a lot of important backstory so brace yourselves. 

My boyfriend (26) and I (27) have been together for 5 years. I am the first serious long term relationship he's had, he's my second. When we first got together, we had known each other for 2 years prior and we weren't planning on being serious. After 3 months of casual dating, he admitted he wanted more and I was starting to feel that way too. 

We've been through a lot together. He had a debilitating skin condition which kept him home, no work or school, for about a year during our 2nd year together, so I basically took care of him that year. It became habit for him to text me and keep in touch while I was at work. It became the norm for us not to have sex often because of the pain it would bring him. I gained about 30 pounds from being so stressed about work and his health all the time, he gained weight from being practically bedridden. That year was a horrible year for the both of us. 

When a new drug trial came out for his skin condition, he was the perfect candidate. He did the trial and it was amazing how well things turned out. He was his beautiful self again. He got his skin problems under control and our lives could be almost normal again. But during this time, I was still overweight, stressed, lacking confidence, got used to not having sex or being intimate, and got used to basically knowing what he was doing and contacting him so much. I never broke away from that which I realize now after what has recently happened that I need to work on that. 

Months later, to help get him back in the working world, I talked to my boss about employing him. I am a project manager in the commercial flooring industry, and we really needed someone to assist the other project managers. My boss met with him and agreed. My bf was grateful. I trained him and we worked together. We worked amazingly well together. After a year of us working together, I was offered a great offer from a competitor. One that I just couldn't refuse. So I left and my bf and I became ""competitors."" It was kind of fun at first because my workplace is about 2 miles away from his so we still got lunch together and teased each other about the situation. But then came the boss's granddaughter. 25 years old, tight body, really attractive, but completely oblivious to the world. She had come around a bit while I was still working there. Of course I saw my bf check her out a few times. I know every guy does it, no big deal. But when I left that workplace, my bf moved up to the project management position and she became his assistant, she took my old desk in our old office for a while. Since she was still in college, her grandfather (bf's boss) said that she could work from home. This was at first, relieving news for me. Then the texting started. First they were texting just about work things. Then he started teasing her,being playful. Then it was mild flirting. I will admit when I saw the text messages (yes I snooped) I went nuts. He had never been that way with anyone in the 5 years we've been together. I didn't like it, and I told him I didn't like what he was saying because it was unprofessional and was going to lead to something else. We had a large fight and several more following about it. After I got onto him about the mild stuff, he decided to delete conversations they were having, and he lied a few times about it until eventually telling me that he did it because he didn't want to fight over nothing. I only found out that he lied because one night she texted a response saying, ""You hush"" at 11pm. I flipped out because why was she saying that? I woke him up and we got into another fight. He said that he had been texting her around 4pm and he made a joke and she was just now responding, which giving the circumstance, I believed him. He put a lock on his phone shortly after that so I would quit snooping and getting angry. He told me that he wasn't going to text her like that again. 

The Friday before Christmas about a week after he put a lock on his phone, I had given up trying to look through his phone. I didn't know his passcode, and honestly I just wanted to move on and forget about it. I figured we've been together 5 years. He's never done anything remotely like that before, but maybe I was out of line and it was innocent flirting. On Christmas eve, since my parent's live about 2 hours out of town, we normally split so I can see my family and he can see his. I spent the night with mine and went over to his family's house on Christmas. He was acting strange. I don't know how to explain it, but I knew something wasn't right. He wouldn't admit anything was wrong. I decided that it was time for me to snoop one more time. I wasn't proud at the time of doing it. But after 2 attempts at this passcode, I figured it out. That's when I saw a ""joke"" he made that basically implied that she made him hard. A funny joke to say to a close friend, but not a female coworker. She, being either oblivious or a good person, took it as just that, a joke and changed the subject. On Christmas eve, which was a Saturday, he stayed up until 1am texting her trying to find out if she liked him, looking for an ego boost. She wasn't biting, either because she wasn't getting what he was saying or knew and was avoiding it. This girl is a little bit of an airhead so it's hard to tell. He was being subtle but then came out and said to her that she was hard to read, etc. getting a little frustrated. He even said, ""I shouldn't be texting you on the weekends."" Apparently he had been drinking with his brothers at the time he was texting her. It was not a very forward conversation but since I know him so well, I knew what he was getting at. You can bet that I unloaded on him. He is a good person and this was so out of character for him. When we talked, he broke down and told me that he bought her gloves and socks for Christmas, which wasn't a huge deal to me because he bought all the coworkers gifts. He didn't have to tell me that part, but he did. He said that he had been really self-conscience and he just wanted to find out if she found him attractive or liked him at all. I felt like he was being honest, and we talked about the lack of affection on my part and our needs emotional and physically. We talked about how I'm controlling and how he needs to be able to have his personal space. But that all being said, I'm still uneasy. He lets me see his phone, but he said that he wants to be next to me when I do it and not behind his back. They still have to work together until tomorrow because luckily she got an internship so she won't be working for her grandfather much if at all. My fear is that they will keep in contact. I just feel betrayed even though nothing physical happened. He admitted to me last night that he likes talking to her. I don't know what to do here. I should've mentioned this earlier, but in all his texts to her, he never once brought me or our relationship up. He had many opportunities to but he didn't. Yesterday she texted him about a project and I saw the text and she gave him a great opportunity to subtly mention me. I even told him line for line what he could say. He didn't do it. He said, ""she knows we are together. I don't have to remind her."" I make it a point that if I'm talking to men without him, to mention him and our relationship. This threw up a huge red flag to me as well.

I just don't know what to think anymore. Before her, he was always so faithful, respectful, and open. I did overreact at first to a few things that he said to her because I was jealous that they had to work together and she's so attractive. I even blamed myself for the situation because I thought maybe my control issues pushed him away and drove him to it. Do I give him an ultimatum, me or her? Do I give him another shot and start over with the potential risk that he may keep contacting her? I've been more physical and intimate with him and he has been helping me out more around the house and has been affectionate. I want this to work, but I just don't know if he really gets what this has done to me. Me being his first long term serious relationship, it's almost like he's got a fear of commitment all of a sudden or that he's just not ready for this. HELP!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a rather unusual position to find myself in. Not physically as much, no, though my knees were together and my butt muscles clenched to the point where rocks would be jealous of their firmness, my knuckles were white and my neck was frozen stiff from looking straight ahead for at least twenty minutes. I was only aware of the time having passed because I had glanced at my phone at 8:39 PM and the other passenger's phone had Siri--sounding like a 60-year-old man--announce when it was 9:00 PM. The chuckle that he had given upon hearing it was bone-chilling.

""I HOPE I AM NOT MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.""

It took me a few seconds for my mouth to get wet enough to speak. ""Oh n-n-n-no that's alright! All's well that ends well, as they say!""

""IT'S JUST YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING STIFF AS A CORPSE SINCE I GOT IN.""

""H-hhh-ha-haha! That's pr-pretty funny! Are you a c-comedian by trade?""

""NO.""

Well, I had rather doubted that from the start, much like I had doubted he had had the vocal chords to produce such a deep voice as he did.

""BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD I CAN TELL A MEAN KNEECAP SLAPPER.""

I couldn't help it, it elicited a laughter from me that sounded like a rabid chimpanzee stuck in a trash compactor full of chocolate biscuits. Had he known I enjoyed puns?

""YOU SOUND MORE ALIVE ALREADY.""

""Thanks,"" I offered. I did not quite know how to follow that up, so silence ruled for several minutes. ""My name is Dirk.""

""I KNOW.""

""How do you?""

""BECAUSE I AM DEATH.""

This rather shocked me. I mean, he obviously wasn't a normal man, judging by the skull for a head and the scythe and the bony feet he had put up on the seat opposite from us--though the Uber driver being an off-the-clock limousine chauffeur had already been a bit unrealistic for my tastes--but I had not expected DEATH.

""I had not expected death,"" I told him as such.

""MANY DO NOT.""

""Am I dead?""

""WOULD IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?""

""I think it rather would! I'm in the process of applying for an internship to finish my education, and I do think they would be rather opposed to hiring a dead person!""

""BUT HAVE YOU LIVED?""

This took me aback. Was he asking it rhetorically? Surely DEATH was more intelligent than that. Was he asking philosophically? I could counter him with Descartes, but that didn't seem fruitful. Did he mean to ask whether my life so far had been worthwhile?

""If you're asking rhetorically or philosophically, then, well, I've read a lot of books, played a lot of games. You could say I've lived many lives.""

""AS ONE OF YOUR KIND WOULD SAY IT: ONE-OUT-OF-TEN. TRY AGAIN.""

""Well, I have a good family, some good friends, I've traveled a little, so if you mean it in that regard, I would say I have lived.""

""WILL THEY REMEMBER YOU?""

""I... I hope so.""

""FONDLY?""

""I think so.""

""THAT'S GOOD.""

Things were quiet once more after that, for a good while.

""You're not really a happy presence, are you?""

""DEATH RARELY IS.""

""Fair point.""

""YOU'RE NOT REALLY A RAY OF SUNSHINE EITHER.""

""I guess I wasn't.""

""AND YOUR WRITING HAS TERRIBLE ENDINGS.""

I have never been what I would consider fit. Since high school, I've been around 20% body fat most of the time. At the beginning of 2016 I started keeping a food diary (with calorie counts) and tracking my weight with a Google doc. My goal was 155 pounds (my best estimate for what I would weigh at 10% body fat). My strategy was a basic caloric deficit at a rate of one pound a week (2300 - 500 = 1800 calories per day).

Here is a graph of my progress. The green line is my best estimate for the number of daily calories that would let me maintain weight. The blue line is my daily calorie intake, and the red line is 1-week averages. The yellow dots are my weight in pounds.

http://imgur.com/a/7x9Gh

I'm a graduate student. During the spring semester I kept a deficit (on average) by buying lots of fruit, yogurt, and lean lunch meats. I played soccer or jogged maybe once a week. During the summer, while I was away from campus doing an internship, I kept with the same diet, lifted weights for an hour three times a week (3 sets, 6-8 reps on each lift), and ran 3-4 miles once a week. At the end of the summer I reached my lowest weight of the year, 169.

By the time the fall semester arrived, I was sick of being weak, light-headed, and grumpy all day, every day. I told myself that I needed my energy for classes, told myself that I would lift heavier to put on bulk, etc. These were just poor excuses to eat more. I quit trying to hit a deficit, and the last month of the year I pretty much gave up on calorie counting.

I'm disappointed in myself for not making good choices this year. Even though the first ~8 months of the year I made progress, I never felt completely in control of my appetite. I would usually keep a deficit during the week, then binge on the weekends. Then I would try to go super-low calorie or no calorie to make up for my mistake, and then this would lead to another binge. I pretty much yoyo-ed the entire time I was trying to lose.

I'm trying again this year, using MFP to track calories. I thought about taking up a super rigorous running/rowing routine, but I really enjoy soccer and I think I may just try to do that for an hour 3 times a week or so. I'm not sure if this will get me the results I want. We'll see. If anyone else has been in this same situation and found a way through it, I would appreciate your input.

5msb7o,12,2017-01-08,Want to expand my own knowledge and credentials as a current IT student outside of school,ongstrong,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5msb7o/want_to_expand_my_own_knowledge_and_credentials/,"Hi /r/ITCareerQuestions,

I'm currently a sophomore majoring in IT with a concentration/focus on Networking &amp; Security. I was fortunate enough to have hard-working parents that took it upon themselves to take on second jobs and ask me, personally, to quit my part-time retail job to focus more on school. I was in shock as they presented this to me as they haven't even asked for my opinion before deciding on the second jobs. My grades weren't that bad, as I was sitting around as mostly a B-student while working, but I do definitely believe that my part-time job affected my grades, and now I'm determined to make myself an A-student again. Anyways, shortening this, my last day on the job was this past week and now I have a bunch of free time until the next semester starts and I'll have more time off during the semester. My goal is to hopefully land an internship for the Summer (although it is a bit late, and I do realize I don't really qualify for most of them yet), but if not work another part-time job while working on my own self-development.

Anyways, my question to you /r/ITCareerQuestions, is **what can I do in my free time to expand myself as an IT student?**

I've updated my resume a bit as well with my Linkedin profile, although they aren't the best. As for my school, I haven't actually learned that much related to Networking &amp; Security because of pre-req classes that I did not finish up until last semester, so at the start of next semester I begin my first few classes relating to the concentration. So far into my IT degree I have only learned how to use programming languages such as: HTML, CSS (a bit), Java, and Python (a bit). This past semester I also learned how to use database management languages such as MySQL and Adobe software such as Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Flash. That aside, I don't really have anything else besides my retail work experience. 

So, back to my question, any advice on what can I do to expand myself and increase my self-development? I read through the Wiki, some FAQs, and other threads but as far as I know, self-development plays a huge role(?) to where I stand right now. Should I be working on getting certifications, keep applying for internships, or just wait and focus on school for another semester? I'm aware that I live in an area that has a high demand for IT/CompSci majors (DMV) and I want to take advantage of that."
5msfsu,6,2017-01-08,Career path for the reluctant generalist? [20/college student],sphades,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/5msfsu/career_path_for_the_reluctant_generalist/,"The essence of my dilemma is that I'm in love with everything. I entered college thinking I wanted to be a rocket scientist and began carving out a path in physics. I told myself physics was my life: I would watch Feynman videos in my free time, go to all the visiting lecturer talks, slave away at problem sets, you name it. Perhaps all of this stubbornness was due to the fact that everyone in high school was so impressed by my writing that they just assumed I was going to be an english major, and I wanted to prove them wrong by choosing the 'hardest thing possible'. Perhaps it was also partly motivated by the fact that my parents never went to college and I felt like I had to get the most out of it for their sakes; and I was also partly giving the middle finger to gender stereotypes because I'm a girl. I'm a stubborn kid, but back then my hard-headedness was coming from the wrong places.

Nevertheless I was a fantastically mediocre physics student in college and GPA stress was getting to me. (quick aside: I'm at a top 10 US university on a full ride, so I was also beating myself up for doing badly) The thrill of understanding physical concepts slowly gave way to a sense of detachment and confusion with mathematics, and I didn't reach out for help (again, I'm not defending myself here: I was just incredibly stubborn and thought asking for help was weak or something.) 

Anyway, I sat myself down at the end of my first year and realized I wasn't happy. Almost at the same time - by some gigantic stroke of luck - I managed to land an internship at a NASA subcontractor. So of course I thought, *well, if I'm not convinced after this, there's no point*. The internship proved enlightening and although I was grateful for the opportunity, this was my final nail in the coffin for research science: it just wasn't for me.

Meanwhile, I had dabbled in a couple of English courses my first year and got tremendous support from the department. I loved it there. Needless to say on the very first day of my sophomore year I declared English (alongside German - that had been a thing from day one though.) In my second year I took some upper level physics courses alongside english and german and while I was still rather mediocre, I found myself enjoying science again, probably because I could learn without the stress of being a major in the subject.

Now I'm 20 and in my third year (abroad in Germany). I'm very happy with my studies, but my future concerns me because I know that I want to operate in the nexus of the sciences and the humanities: I can't live without both of them at the same time. What exactly does that look like? I've considered data analysis, even the CIA. I love foreign languages, programming, computation, but I think above all I love the challenge of receiving new information, connecting the dots, and drawing valuable implications from data. Research excites me (it's academia that didn't: and that's probably what turned me off to research science). My skills can go in a lot of directions and this just muddles my view of the big picture more than anything.
Thanks in advance.

5mu56t,3,2017-01-08,Visiting Law Student Advice,straighttoricks,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5mu56t/visiting_law_student_advice/,"I'm looking for some advice about whether or not I should apply to be a visiting student for my 3L year. 

When I applied to law school, I wasn't sure that I wanted to live in Michigan, where I lived. So when I was applying, I was trying to go to a decent school but with a lot of scholarship money. I ended up halfway across the country in a top 40 school with a significant scholarship, and was relatively happy for the first year. 

Over the summer, I stayed in the area near my school, thinking that is where I would end up wanting to establish my practice. But I had a terrible experience with my internship. Meanwhile, I started realizing more and more that I wanted to work in Michigan, and that I knew the next summer I would be applying to work back home. 

My boyfriend has a job lined up back in Michigan. Back in September, I also secured a summer associate position at the firm of my dreams back home. It is a mid-size firm (which is what I want to eventually work in), so while there is a possibility of hire upon graduation, they can't guarantee it. I start working in May, and the offer extends through my 3L year (which I would be doing remotely from current law school, but could do in person if I become a visiting student, which would probably mean more hours). 

Since the summer, my mental health has declined. I have always been a kind-of anxious person, but it has escalated into almost daily anxiety/panic attacks. I feel isolated, and am extremely unhappy with where I am at school. I definitely no longer want to work in my current school's area. 

I want to apply to be a visiting student in my home state for my 3L year, and I wanted to hear your opinions. There are not GREAT options as far as law schools go in Michigan. There is obviously UMich (which is where I went to college), but I would be on the fence about being admitted I think, and is much more expensive since I am giving up my scholarship. There are not many law schools in Michigan, and the next best one would be Wayne State University. Many of the practicing lawyers in the area went to Wayne. I think this is ideally where I would end up being a visiting student, because it is less expensive and I would just about break even with what I am paying at my current school. However, it is a law school in the top 100 range, whereas my current is top 40. Do you guys think this would be a bad thing? 

My top priorities right now are my mental health, and securing a job after graduation (like everyone)."

I am writing in the hopes that you guys can help me with a problem I'm having. I don't feel like I'm on the right career path, but I don't know what else to do.

I've always dreamed of being a writer, but growing up poor and hearing horror stories about unemployment and M.A holders working minimum wage jobs drove me to taking a safer route to getting a B.S in Marketing.

Fast-forward to today and I've been working in the marketing industry for almost 4 years counting internships, with 3 in analytics. I'm more financially secure than I've ever been in my life, have potential for income growth if I'm willing to jump agencies and put up with crazy hours and even crazier clients, but I'm not happy.

And I'm starting to realize that's probably the most important thing in life: *being happy.*

To give you all some background:

I switched companies about 8 months ago and realized I still don't like the work I do (in fact I like it *less*), and dread the chaotic, client-whim driven environment that makes it so I can only commit to work. Even worse, it's wrecking havoc on my health. Experience and chats with veterans in the industry tell me I'll find many of the same frustrations everywhere and that the work remains the same repetitive and tedious reporting at it's core regardless of level.

That said, I haven't hated all parts of my career so far. I liked learning how different parts of the business relate to each other, and I took surprisingly well to SQL. In my new role (which doesn't use SQL), I've started learning R and Python on my own to try and deal with the issue of  *“Excel can't read billions of rows of data”* and *“everything takes too much time”.*

Ultimately, I want to do work that is more meaningful, more creative, and more people-oriented. I need something that still is intellectually challenging, but which can give me the same sense of pride and accomplishment as finishing a story or teaching others. Some soul-searching tells me I'd probably do well in academia, though the questions of what to study, employ-ability, and financial sustainability remain. I also don't want to limit myself or discount something I might enjoy for sheer ignorance.

That said, here are some details about my needs, skills, and interests then the floor is all yours! 

**Work/Life:** I've been most comfortable in small business type cultures that encourage open communication and collaboration. Flex-schedules and unlimited vacation would be awesome, but I'd be happy with a stable schedule, 8-5 with rare “long days”. For health reasons, I should avoid stress and can't do things like skip meals or sleep, drinking, and spending over 4-6 hours at a time on a computer. As a morning-person, evening and night schedules aren't very productive for me.

**Technical Skills**: SQL (building ETLs, queries, and functions), MS Suite, various industry programs, R (basic; while loops, simple calculations), Python (super novice, read this file, save it there), Photoshop, Illustrator (mostly font and vector creation), HTML &amp; CSS (enough to edit some web design elements and content)


**Most Liked  Subjects (in order of interest):** English/Literature, Art &amp; Art History, Psychology, Marketing Theory, Economics, Philosophy, Sciences (especially Chemistry &amp; Biology)

**Least Liked Subjects:** Math (I liked Algebra most), Finance

As long it's a good fit, I'm willing to get a Masters or a Phd if the career requires it, and I'm willing to deal with less income if it means more happiness (though I wouldn't mind 6-figures!).

Thank you everyone and please forgive the mini-rant. "
5mu6ue,11,2017-01-08,A few questions!,D1rty0n3,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/5mu6ue/a_few_questions/,"Hello EE guys and gals.  I'm new to this subreddit.  I've got a couple questions to shoot off to you all if you aren't too busy.  

First things first.  About me. I'm medically retiring from the Navy after 9 years.   Before joining the Navy I went to Remington College for ECET and got an Associates.  

While in the navy I did computer networking, and some electrical (Aegis FC of the Aegis Computer Networking Tech variety).  Based on this I'm looking to go back to school for EE at IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN.  They have a program with Purdue so I figured it's a good college to go to.  

Based off of this here are a few of the questions I have.

1.  Internships.  How easy are they to get?  I'm not really worried to much on getting paid for them it's alot more important for me to get practical experience.  

2.  Should I apply for an internship while in my Freshman year since I have experience in the field?

I have googled a bit on internships and such, but I wanted to get the word from people that have been there and done that so to speak.  

3.  It's been about 10 years since I've been in college.  Are there any recommended sites to ""brush up"" on theory/math?  It's actually been so long that I barely remember what kind of math to brush up on other than algebra, trig, calc, and such...  

Anyhow I'm glad to be here, and looking forward to hearing from you all.  Thanks!"

I'm going through my second internship (most likely my last before graduating) and the experiences have not been too great at either. Both are at large companies (not household names). I should mention I'm very grateful for these opportunities (it's nice to finally make money).

I've been doing a lot of busy work and not really learning much after the first few weeks I couldn't have learned over a few weekends (working in a large team was new but I got used to that quickly). Someone has to do it and obviously it's a good idea to offload that work to the cheaper intern (I'm not underpaid). I mostly work alone and hardly speak to anyone which is getting sad. I don't find there's much in the way of guidance (in becoming a better programmer, or even just a professional) and communication is a bit strained. I don't have anything to do a lot of the time though I ask for work - I end up with a lot of QA stuff.

I went for CS because I loved programming, and I thought programmers did interesting things. I don't find reading poor documentation of heavyweight frameworks and stitching them together interesting - I'm sure some others might (maybe from seeing the end result, etc.). I get excited at the thought of having to use the debugger on existing code just because I don't seem to do anything more engaging. I've enjoyed the degree mostly but not my real world experience.

I've done work at these internships, but it's so insignificant I'm actually really embarrassed that I have nothing to show for it. Do I expect too much from myself?

Work is work at the end of the day, but then why would I prefer this to unskilled work (prospects and security for developers don't seem too great here)?

Will I be stuck doing the same thing for the rest of my career?

Are my expectations unrealistic?

Will I go through the same song and dance as my internships (boredom) when I start full time work?

That was really ranty and disjointed, but in short I just want an answer to the title given the context of the unreadable body. Thanks :)"

[19 F] and pretty hesitant to continue my life the way it is. I just kind of need some practical advice about where to go next from here. 

None of my family has gone to college, much less graduated high school, so it's hard to imagine myself continuing college all the way through. Especially considering how touch-and-go I feel about majoring in computer science (despite having at least SOME passion for this most of my life). 

I'm two years in now, but it's been a rough time already. I dropped out the second week freshman year, took that semester off, went to a community college, and now I'm back at the state university this year. I just completed my fall semester and I did okay - I think I'm sitting at like a 3.45 right now. However, not exactly psyched about the college I'm going to - I've wanted to transfer since I was accepted there. Probably wasn't a smart idea to even go in the first place.. 

Reason I don't like this college: 
-It's far away from all the internships I've held (which pay actual money, $15/hr - pretty good in my book). If I transferred back locally, I could work and do school at the same time.

-The school isn't good for what I want to do, really, and there's no opportunities in the surrounding community.

Options I see for myself: 
-Drop out of college and just stop trying to convince myself it's necessary. 

-Transfer next year, get an internship, continue hating myself for just two or three more years.. end up unsatisfied anyways. 

-Blahwgafjgsdf I don't know, continue making mistakes because I'm anxious and have no idea what to do next?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.. I don't really have any more at this point.

5mulgi,24,2017-01-08,"After a really crappy year, if anyone has the time to pray for my situation I would be really thankful.",oneblazeofglory,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5mulgi/after_a_really_crappy_year_if_anyone_has_the_time/,"Hey /r/Christianity. I realise that it's nothing compared to what other people are going through right now, but I'd be really grateful for some prayer if someone's willing. 

Basically, I got an offer for a really good job on the other side of my home country from where I lived a year ago which fell through after nine months of waiting and praying, as well as a house move in the midst of the waiting because we didn't renew the contract on our apartment as we believed that it wouldn't take that much longer for the employer to give us some kind of answer. After getting a ""no"", my partner and I were really heartbroken because we'd really felt that God was leading us in that direction and so we'd set other things aside in anticipation. Because we still didn't like where we were, we prayed for another direction and got the message that God wanted us to go back to my partner's home country, so we dropped everything and moved here (with a decent money back-up because of the move across the country we'd been planning for). Since getting here, I've been doing an internship at a church which I'm not enjoying in the slightest (which hurts, because it felt like God was pointing me to this when we decided to move), and finding a job, which I need to get my right to remain in this country, has been a nightmare - I have 2 months left to find work, or I have to leave. My command of the language is good enough that people don't realise that I've only just moved here, but unfortunately it isn't good enough to work in PR and Communications, which is my area of work. I've been applying for every English-only PR / Comms job I could find, with very little success. The past month or so has been particularly bad - in December I was having panic attacks and breakdowns once every three days, and my faith that God is going to come through and intervene here is absolutely shot to pieces. I'm currently much more likely to get angry with God than I am to trust him. 

On Monday afternoon, 4pm Central European Time, I have an interview for a job with an amazing company which feels like it would solve so many of our problems (and of course cause a few, namely that I would once again be looking at moving halfway across the country, this time by myself for the first 6 months as my partner has an internship in the city we currently live in starting this Friday). I really, really want to get it, but after this horrible year job-wise for me and my tendency to get over-excited and put all my hope in getting the job, I'm trying to be realistic and remind myself that I might not get it. 

I don't want people to just pray that I get the job, because through all of this mess I realise I've actually learned something - that God isn't a vending machine, and you can't just pray and receive what you wanted immediately. However, I would be really grateful if someone could pray for a fast answer from the company after the interview, regardless of the outcome. Also for strength for my partner and I as we wait for the answer, and strength to accept the answer, whatever it is, because I know that if it's negative that we're going to go through a fair bit more pain, and if it's positive then we're going to have a few challenges ahead! Only God is going to be able to keep us going, and although I'm doing my best to keep praying and believing for an end to our lack of income and instability, I feel like my tank of faith is running pretty dry.

My thing with CS right now, is that although I've completed a few courses, I am still wildly un-polished and inexperienced/unknowledgeable on a lot of the stuff. I'm far from like a CS prodigy as some of my peers are. So my issue is that a. I'm not sure of whether I'd get into any CS internships b. even if I do, whether I'd be equipped to handle the work. Now besides being a student, I'm also an aspiring musician and will be looking to network around my city and gain valuable relationships, which doing an internship in something related to the music industry would help with. Getting an internship in the music industry wouldn't be as difficult and hard to do as something for CS, so I was thinking I'd do a Music internship this summer, then do CS internships my next 2 summers after I have more experience coding and working on projects, as well as more knowledge of CS from different courses.

My question is, would this be prudent/smart? And what would you recommend I do?"
5mv7pa,0,2017-01-08,Graduating in May.. jump into a mortgage? Stupid idea?,itsbecccaa,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5mv7pa/graduating_in_may_jump_into_a_mortgage_stupid_idea/,"Before I begin I have searched through this subreddit quite a bit already and honestly it is depressing me. I have been renting an apartment in the STL area with a roommate of mine, and our lease is up at the end of May. I am studying for the CPA exam right after graduation so I need/want an 'office' where I can put a desk and study in peace outside of my bedroom. My roommate and I went apartment hunting this weekend and found out that anything that is a 3 bedroom or has enough space for our taste is going to be $1150 for low base, without electric and internet on top. 

In May after I graduate my internship at an accounting firm will roll over into a full time position (I have an offer letter signed already and I will be making $52k for a year or two until I pass the CPA) so I am planning to stay in the area for at least 5 years, if not more. I don't know my roommate's plan after a few years, but the idea occurred to me that if I were to purchase a home, she could temporarily help with the mortgage if I rent her a room, and then when she needs to move on I will still be fine on my own (or with my current SO). I would get the mortgage on my own, with my own income as the only factor in case she fell out. 

I guess general opinions would be nice. Has anyone secured a loan with just an offer letter? I also am looking at townhome/condo styles, because of less maintenance, but I am afraid of HOA fees. The goal here is to save money, but after my research I am curious if this might be a bad idea. My ideal home would be around the $150k range, but this may be beyond my reach. 
Edit: Forgot to mention, I won't have much of anything saved for up front costs, maybe a few thousand, but Missouri has ""first home buyer"" programs that can grant up to 4% of the purchase price to help with closing costs/downpayments.

Thanks for any help. Sorry this is long."

Before we get into the story I will say that we had exceptional chemistry (being a horny 24 year old and her being a horny 21 yo probably went a long way with that), and that chemistry is what led me to write about this encounter. It took me a week to organize my memories of the night, and find the time to write this (that battlefield one....) so I admit that the dialogue is not 100% but this is gonewildSTORIES not gonewild: Legal deposition so it will have to do.

When I was going to community college I was working for an auto parts store. After a year or so of working I got promoted to an assistant manager, a few months after that Diana started working at the same store.
Diana was fresh out of high school, 18 years old and she looked and acted very young when she started. For reference I was 20 when she started. She was about 5'5""-5'6"" skinny, light skinned Hispanic (her skin was the color of hot coco), and her face was very pretty with an Aztec nose and thick black hair framing her face beautifully. She had a fairly cute ass, although there wasn't much of it at the time. She still looked and acted like a freshman in high school which was a big turn-off, and every other sentence she said had the word ""fuck"" in it, which is a really bad habit for a sales counter job (but great in bed...) She would get defensive if you tried to help her or show her a trick in the computer system, again a turn off, but outside of that she was usually really nice to me.

After 2 years of university and 1 year of paid internship, I moved back to the town where I attended CC to start my career. I started working on a project car, which led to a trip to the parts store at least once a weekend. Diana was still working there, she would always come around the counter and give me a big hug any time I walked in. This went on for a few weekends as I made my regular trips to the store, and we would make small talk for a few minutes, catching up and in hindsight she was being a little flirty the whole time.

In these last 3 years she matured a hell of a lot, emotionally and physically. Her hips were a littler wider, giving her a very nice figure. her ass and legs got a little thicker(average to a little more than average), and there was a lot more going on under that unflattering uniform shirt than there had been when last I saw her. She is probably 140-150lbs, and overall a medium/average build, curvy in the right places. Her face was as cute as ever, a little fuller softening her cheekbones and just damn... Her thick jet black mop of hair in a pony tail as per dresscode topped of a truly beautiful young woman. She carried herself like an adult, fewer ""fucks"" in sentences, seemed to care about her job more and some other attributes that showed maturity. She became way more attractive as a person in my eyes and I was thinking about asking her out after the holidays.

The day before New Year's eve I went in to return a few things, and she happened to be the closing manager that night. I got there about an hour before closing and it was just her and another kid in the store. We were talking for a few minutes at the counter she started to get pretty forward, for a workplace at least. She was running her hand along my arm and making tons of eye contact. Amazingly, me a man, got the hint. I asked if she had plans after she left work and if she wanted to join me downtown. She said that she would love to but she wanted to clean up after work, before I could suggest anything she said that I could pick her up at her place at 9 and she texted me her address. I went home and changed into a nicer pair of jeans and shirt, we had decided on a western place for drinks so Wrangler's and Ariats were the way to go.

I got to her place right at 9, she wasn't ready, which I fully expected given she would have got out of the store at 8:15. She opened the door in nothing but a towel, she pulled me inside and gave me a kiss on the cheek.
""Oh you look good as a cowboy!"" At 6'2"" 210lbs, and kinda bulky muscular; I fit a cowboy build well. ""I'll be right out."" She walked back into the bedroom and I got a glimpse of her cute ass peaking out the bottom of her towel. A few minutes passed and she came back wearing a knockout pair of jeans and a red silky bra while holding two different cowgirl style blouses. Her breasts looked amazing, probably a full C-cup that fit her figure perfectly.

""Which one do you like?""

I chose the white with blue trim because she looked like a real Mexican cowgirl, a vaquera if you will (yes she is of Mexican decent, that wasn't a generalization). She put it on in front of me and pulled me off the couch. ""Come on, let's go!!""

At the bar she ordered a tropical margarita while I sipped whiskey. We were sitting at a corner high-top with a bench seat which gave us a fair bit of privacy. After talking for a while, ""You know, I had such a crush on you when we worked together,"" she said.

""Really?"" I chuckled, ""I thought you were cute too, but we were coworkers, and I was technically your supervisor.""

""No, we never could have pulled it off then, but now..."" I pulled her a little closer before she could finish and ran my hand on her hip and thigh. She started stroking my thigh. We got more and more handsy from there, relying on the table and the bench seat for cover. She leaned into me, lifting a cheek of the seat, I had my hands all over her ass, and would run my fingers along her spine, reaching under the flowing blouse she had on, she was rubbing my crotch, trying to build a hard-on but the way I was lodged in my boxer-briefs it couldn't get free, and it was actually a little painful trying to grow. I had to ask her to stop, she pouted and gave me puppy dog eyes so I HAD to explain what was going on... in my pants... awkward...

By then she was on her third marg and I my second whiskey. We agreed to finish this round and head out. Walking back to the car we had our hands in each other's back pockets. She told me to head to my place, luckily I had straightened up a bit when I changed.

We got in the front door and attacked each other with kisses, my hands were all over her tugging at her blouse and caressing her soft skin. We got our shirts off and made it to the couch. I sat down and she straddled me. We were in perfect sync, as I would turn to kiss her neck she would nibble my ear, we would go back to our lips at the same time, and then venture elsewhere. Her long black hair fell around our heads, it was like being behind a curtain at a strip club, except I got to touch her and wasn't throwing $1s her way. It was so steamy and I was so caught up in her I hadn't even taken her bra off yet. I finally unclasped it and let her C-cups free. I squeezed them and rubbed her rock hard nipples as her tongue shot into my mouth and her hands rubbed every inch of my shirtless body. Things continued for a bit longer before I grabbed the front of her pants and started to undo the button.

""Wait.""

""What's wrong?""

""Nothing, everything's great, I just want to say a couple things before we go any further.""

""Oh... ok?"" I said trying to cover my impatience with concern.

""I'm on birth control so you don't need a condom and... I really I like it when guys... you know... finish inside,"" she said smiling naughtily at every pause.

""Trust me, that won't be a problem.""

""I also like things kinda rough. So squeeze my ass, hold me tight, if it's too much I'll tell you, but don't be shy about grabbing me with those big hands! Everything you were doing with your hands was perfect. Your hands were all over me, not just my boobs, or ass..."" She smiled ear to ear and closed her eyes, ""I loved it.""

""I couldn't let just one part of you get *all* the attention. I had to make sure your ass,"" taking a double handful, ""hips"" grabbing them hard, ""lips"" kissing her deeply ""back"" dancing my fingers up her spinning causing her to tremble and roll her eyes back ""tits... everywhere got some love.""

She covered me in kisses and begged, ""take these fuckin pants off me."" I slid her off my lap, grabbed her hips and spun her so she was facing away. She bent over causing a thong that matched the bra (currently hanging off of my tv) to play peek-a-boo. Before pulling her pants down, I gave her a couple spanks, and found her legs far too close together, I ran my hand up her thighs all the way to the seam in her pants and let my thumb press on the denim covering that ass, and fingers press against the thin layer hiding her crease. I forced her legs a little wider, I was able to see her tits and long hair draped down through the newly opened gap. Finally I pulled her pants down, she kicked them off and assumed her previous position to let me do the same to her thong. It was a regular thong, not a little g-string and her full and shapely ass hid it well.

By this time I was so horny I could feel it in my eyes... I was ready to dig my tongue into her pussy, I couldn't wait any longer, I would have gone berserk if I had spent one more second teasing her (and I guess myself, unintentionally). I slid her panties off and beheld the most welcoming pussy I had ever seen. Her puffy lips glistening, parted ever so slightly inviting me in, her panties heavy in my hand from her juices. I dropped to my knees in front of the couch, and kissed her cute little ass and the back of her thighs before teasing her lips with my tongue. As my tongue parted her lips slightly and teased her. I had one hand on her ass, one taking care of everywhere else. Then I buried my face in her, her taste was light and made me want even more. She reached a hand back to rub her clit. She kept talking dirty, ""Don't Stop"" ""Oh fuck like that"" I moved my tongue out to her clit and she went wild. Her hips ground on my face, her moans and ""oh fucks"" grew breathless and became ""I'm gonna cum..."" A moaning ""Gaaaaawwwwwwdd"" erupted from her.

She collapsed to her knees and turned to face me, in a heartbeat she had my pants and boxers off. ""Your balls are so big!"" as she cupped them and grabbed my cock with her other hand, I'm a little under 6.5 inches and proportional girth but I do have fairly large balls (according to her). Looking up at me from down on her knees, ""I hoped you would look like this naked.""

""You hoped to see my cock?"" I asked playfully.

""I told you I had a crush on you, and girls think about fucking too."" She quipped back without missing a beat, just before putting my head in her mouth. This was one of the hottest things to look down on, her mouth on me, her big brown eyes looking up at me, one hand grabbing my shaft the other on my balls. I moved my hands to her shoulders and gently rubbed them, since they were the only part of her I could reach. She moved her hand off of my shaft and took more of me in her mouth, she grabbed my wrist and pulled my left hand off her shoulder and onto her head. I took a handful of her thick hair which made her gently nod, then she pushed my hand onto her head to tell me to start pulling her onto me, when I applied a little pressure her nod got bigger and a smile grew across her face. I was conservative at first, only pulling her onto a little under half, then a little more, more, more, she started to gag with an inch left, I gently pulled her head back, she took a breath and pounced back onto my cock. She took it to where she gagged and then pushed down the last little bit until her nose was pressed into me. She coughed on it and tried to moan between coughs, it felt like an eternity but was probably 5-7 seconds.

As soon as she released me I pulled her up and kissed her, ""We're going to the bed,"" I said matter of factly. I lifted her by her ass, digging my fingers into her. We locked lips, and I lowered her down so her pussy was rubbing against my cock as I walked her to bed (I kinda stick straight out so I wasn't going to accidentally pop in). I laid her down and kissed her thighs, and hips, finally getting to admire the front view of a freshly shaved pussy. I kissed my way up to her tits and played with her nipples in my mouth, she was reaching down between us and guided me into her pussy while I was fondling her great tits. She moaned as I pushed in slowly and all the way. She grabbed my ass with both hands and followed along as I increased my intensity. We had a little gap between us which let me explore her body with my free hand, breasts, hips, hair, cheeks, wherever looked neglected. I had worked up a pretty good rhythm and she was showcasing her dirty talk, filling the room with ""oh god"" ""fuck me"" and ""yes"" and more I wish I could remember. After a few minutes she told me to roll over. She climbed onto me Cowgirl style and started to ride me. She found a good angle, her face told me she was right on her g-spot. A combination of bouncing and grinding that was driving both of us wild. I was all over her again, my hands never spent more than a few seconds on anyone spot. Her hands were giving me the same treatment which was insanely hot because I had never been with a girl who was so active with her hands.

""I'm about to cum, are you?"" She panted.

""Almost little more.""

""Keep fucking me once I cum, oh god, fuck YESSS!"" She shouted. I could feel her pussy and thighs quiver, she dropped herself onto me grabbed my face and kissed me. I grabbed her hips to push her a little lower, I took her ass in my hand and started thrusting into her. She moaned like crazy as I pounded her in reverse missionary (??? making up a name). She started to nibble on my collar bone and kiss my neck. I was ready to burst, I thrust and pinned myself in her as I shot into her ready pussy.

""Ooooo that feels like a lot.,"" her words leaked out of her giant smile. She gently rolled her hips as my cock softened in her and she kissed me with as much vigor as we had at the start of the night. We made out for a while as we cooled down and passed out.


New Year's Eve


I woke up before her, she was face down on my bed, her hand on my chest, legs spread just a little leaving a pleasant booty and leg outline under my sheet. I slid out and went to the bathroom. When I came back she was awake, lying in bed, with the blanket covering her, ""Morning!"" she smiled and lifted blankets inviting me back into bed. I climbed in and she cuddled up to me, me on my back her on her side pressing the soft skin of her breasts and stomach against me, she finished getting comfortable by tossing a leg over mine and nuzzling her face into my chest. I placed my arm around her hip, gave her a deep kiss and we just laid there for a bit.

She was staring intently at my right nipple and, while it is quite interesting I admit, I could tell she was thinking about something else. I gave her a squeeze and rubbed her hip, she snapped out of her daze, I asked what was on her mind. She asked, ""Did you have fun last night?""

""Yeah, you felt so good in my arms, and we we're in perfect sync... It was a great night. Did you enjoy every...""

""Oh my God, yes,"" she chuckled, ""you made me cum twice, once while you were going down on me and once while we were having sex. And then... the way you stayed in me after you came, it felt so good to have you pressed up to me while we were making out after.""

""You really like it when I finished in you?""

""Yeah"" she said with an embarrassed and blushed face, ""It just feels so good... I mean it's where you're supposed to finish. And I also just like cum."" She slid down and put my soft cock in her mouth, she started sucking hard, I could feel the blood rush in, I was getting hard almost instantly. I rearranged us so we were 69-ing and my head was propped up to make up for our height difference. She wasn't wet yet, but I could feel so much heat coming off of her, I kissed the back of her thighs, and her ass, I could start to see her pussy glisten. I was running my hands all over her, she was sucking my cock so well, her rhythm was great and she was taking me deep enough to hear an occasional gag or cough, which was driving me wild. I kissed her pussy, which was finally ready for more, I began to explore her with my tongue.

""Are you close?"" She asked.

""Yeah getting close but not quite.""

""Stand up!""

We switched so she was kneeling in front of me again. She grabbed my ass, and started sucking again, I grabbed the back of her head just like last night. ""Oh god, I'm close, I'm gonna cum!"" She pulled off and stroked me. Her eyes closed, smiling, licking her lips, I was ready, I tried to hold it in.... hold... hold... but she wasn't moving her face, finally release... sweet knee buckling release... all across her face and some weaker shots onto her chest.
She stood up and stared into my eyes as she licked up what she could, then used her finger, to clean her face and breasts. She kissed my chest a little before grabbing my hand and taking me into the bathroom. She took a swig of my mouth wash, and I did the same. She rinsed her face and I lifted her onto the counter so we could start kissing again.

""I have never cum on a girl's face before, that was amazing""

""Really? I like getting creampied more, but if I really like the guy.... Well *you* can cum where ever you want."" We went back to making out for a few minutes, ""are you getting hard again?"" I hadn't realized it but I was. ""What am I going to do with this?"" She said taking it in her hand, and rubbing the tip against her pussy. ""I was going to shove your head down there so you could eat me out but..... now that you're hard again..."" She pulled the first inch into her and I took it from there. She laid her hand on my chest keeping a little gap between us. Her free hand roamed over my body, I was holding her hip with one hand, and caressing every inch with the other. The dirty talk started again, well when her mouth wasn't pressed to mine. She was describing how hot it was to watch me fuck her. I carried to the bed a second time, but with her pussy wrapped around my cock. I laid her on her back and resumed thrusting into her while I was standing at the edge of the bed. She started to beg me to make little changes, ""Baby, hold my legs. Lift my ass of the bed,"" her eyes lit up, ""yes right there!"" She started moaning, only separated by her taking a breath, or telling me not to stop. She dug her nails into my arms. I could feel her legs tremble in my arms. She asked to change to doggy, I put her on the bed and climbed up and picked up where I left off.

""Do you like doggy style?""

""Not really. It feels good but I never get off from it.""

""Reallllllly?"" I said as I ran my hands along her stomach and up to her breasts, I lifted her off of her hands changing my angle in her, once I got her high enough up she started moaning, and shouting how that would make her cum again, but it was a little too much and she begged to be put back into regular doggy. Her near orgasm pushed me over the edge and I dribbled into her.

We laid back in bed and wrapped our arms around each other. She went back to staring at my chest and absentmindedly playing with my chest hair for a few minutes. Again I knew she was thinking about something, so I took a guess at it. ""Do you want to... maybe...try... something a little... more like dating and not being fuck buddies, or whatever?"" (Extra smooth, as..... always....).

She gave me a big kiss, and said yes, so I said I was taking her to breakfast. We hopped in the shower and fondled one another through the suds before heading out to a little place.

Over breakfast we talked about the things we had in common, and I generally had a good feeling about things. We decided to hang out for a bit before I dropped her off to get ready for my friends New Year's Party.

We went out and walked around downtown for a bit, surprisingly she lead me into the local adult store, she walked me over to the dvd area and playfully said, ""Here are all the Latina movies, since I know you like that,"" she gave me a wink, ""I'm going over to the other side with the lingerie, NO PEAKING, I want it to be a surprise!"" She patted my ass as she turned and walked through the door that separated what were once two separate stores.

A little while went by and I got bored of looking at the ""lusty latinas"" franchise of films and wandered aimlessly in the store until she came around with a little black plastic bag and we left the store and headed to her place.

After I had dropped her off I went home and got ready. We had always planned to leave from my place and take a cab, so I was waiting for her to drive up. She had her make up on but not her dress, she brought in a little over night bag and a garment bag with her dress. As we finished getting ready she explained her bag, seeing as we would obviously spend the night together, I agreed with her logic.

We drank a little too much at the party, made out sloppily during the cab ride home and passed out with out anything of note happening.


New Year's Day


I woke up with a splitting headache and made my way to the kitchen, took some advil, I took her the bottle and a bottle of water and left on the night stand. Once the advil started working I made some bacon, cooked some eggs in the bacon trippings, made a stack of toast and set my little kitchen table. I heard her up and about after the bacon was finished, but she didn't make an appearance until I was almost done cooking.

She was just in her little black thong, I had gotten her out of the dress last night but no further. She was in pretty rough shape. We dug into breakfast, ate way too much and turned on netflix while our bodies digested and fought off a hangover.

Some 4 episodes of Daredevil later, we were back to our old selves. Which is to say, horny. Making out quickly led to my boxers and her panties meeting on the floor. I got on my knees in front of the couch and started licking her nearly steaming slit. I went slow, I wanted to tease her, her fingers were already in my hair, but I wanted her to rip in out pulling my head up to her clit to finally let her release. One finger probed her depths, her whole body shook as she yanked my head so my lips were on her clit, in less than 30 seconds of moderate passed flicking I had her whole body convulsing. Her hips tilted back, her heals were digging into my shoulder blades, her hands were crushing my skull against her hips and her whole body was trembling. She was still shaking when she pulled my lips to hers and the making out started all over again. Once I was sure she recovered, ""Wanna try my version of doggy style again??""

She nodded eagerly and assumed the position bent over my couch. I slid in and cupped her breasts again, we got adjusted so I was on that perfect spot and after getting my rhythm she was whipping her hair around and moaning. I grabbed her hair and gently pulled it, which was her cue to talk dirty. Her begging me to pull her hair even more and pound her was rapidly pushing me to my limit. I told her I was cumming, but after I had let loose she begged ""not yet!"" As soon as I was done I pulled out and she panted, ""finger me, quick, I'm so close!!"" I managed to find her spot and vigorously went after it. She started to tremble, but kept feeding me a stream of ""don't stops."" She grabbed my wrist and withdrew my fingers. Diana collapsed on the couch and fed herself our combined juices from my fingers. I sat down and she laid her head in my lap."
5mw13p,6,2017-01-09,Advice on how to utilize a connection at Wells Fargo. Should I do retail banking?,djrainbowpixie,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5mw13p/advice_on_how_to_utilize_a_connection_at_wells/,"Hello,


I am a recent graduate of a non target school, with a Master's degree in Finance. My work experience consists of the following: Accounting internship, Operations Coordinator, and Treasurer. (I realize that most of my experience is accounting related but I want a job that's in finance.)


Recently my father meet the Assistant VP of the Wells Fargo banks in my region. My father told him that his daughter (me) was a recent graduate looking for a job and the ""banker"" gave him his card and told me to contact him.


I did and the banker is very helpful. He forwarded my information to the District Manager and he also gave me a list of few jobs to apply to. All of the jobs are in retail though. Most of them require sales experience, which I don't have. I took an assessment test for a personal banker position but it kicked me out during the preliminary question stage because I checked ""no"" when asked if I had previous sales experience. He is now telling me to apply for lower positions that don't have assessment tests, so I can avoid the sales experience requirement.


I've realized quickly that I'm not interested in the roles he is telling me to apply for. I don't mind starting at a low position if I can move my way up but I know for a fact that sales objectives are going to stress me out and drain me. 


We plan to have a phone call sometime this week. I figured that the best thing to do is to just apply to the jobs he tells me to and see what happens. But I would like a job in corporate, not retail. My dream job at the moment is to be a Financial Analyst.


How can I tell him this without coming off as not being appreciative? How can I utilize this connection if I DON'T want to work in retail? Should I just suck it up and do retail and get promoted afterwards?


Thank you!"

I have worked a software engineering internship at a reasonably large tech company. And what I've noticed is that most software engineers, IT personnel, etc. are INCEL TO THE CORE, or close to it. Out of all my male friends (not that I have any female friends), NOT ONE has a girlfriend. My classes are 90%+ dudes, I have not met one who has a girlfriend or speaks to women at all.

This is how society's hardest workers are rewarded.

**EDIT**: Wrote this to blow off steam last night, did not expect it to get any comments at all much less blow up like this. ""Society's hardest workers"" was a stretch, and I have worked with quite a few engineers who are happily married. 

However, it is still apparent that men in technical fields tend to have less success with women on average, especially in college."
5mwa1h,1,2017-01-09,Grad School Application - Need some people to review my PS to law school.,HiSoArshavin,CFBOffTopic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBOffTopic/comments/5mwa1h/grad_school_application_need_some_people_to/,"Hello everybody, 

I'm notified this sub a couple of weeks ago of my applying to law school, and now I need your guys help. 

If any of you are lawyers, attended law/grad school, talented English writers, or simply intelligent people who give a damn about a ""somewhat"" active person on this sub, I' greatly appreciate it. 

~~~~~~~~

There are experience or events which strike one so deeply that to ignore them is excruciatingly impossible, or at the least, deeply uncomfortable. My time at xxx is such a phenomenon. 

Attending xxxx was a direct result of both my underwhelming (some would even say mediocre) academic performance in high school, coupled with my insistence of paying my own way through university. My father being a professor at xxx certainly influenced my decision as I was somewhat familiar with the university culture. But initially, I saw attending xxxx as a symbol of my forthcoming redemption, the place where I would essentially rise from mediocrity and be born again as a student of boundless intellectual curiosity.

I can happily say that I fulfilled most of my goals. While I encountered rough patches - due mostly to my commitments outside the classroom (I worked 25-40 hours a week throughout college to afford tuition, room and board), I was able to graduate with a degree in Economics while participating in a various medley of experiences of such that without certain faculty, I would have been unaware of to this day.

Unfortunately, I know that my experiences and sentiments were not shared by many of my fellow students, particularly students of color. With many students of color at xxxx being first-generation, there is a lack of knowledge that afflicts some of these students when it comes to navigating the maze that university can be – particularly when it comes to such topics as major selection and how students should go about pursuing their careers. As a student worker, I witnessed countless instances of advisers shoehorning many of these students away from the majors of their choice, and guiding them towards majors which required much less work, offered much bleaker employment prospects, and which were completely misaligned with the student’s academic interests or passion. 

As I’ve come to discover, such actions have various implications which one could describe as a negative feedback cycle. Due to such a lack of students of color within certain majors or departments, internships and scholarships at xxx specifically targeting students of color are often low in number, and subsequently have a low number of eligible students. This in turn leads to companies and organizations being heavily discouraged, which prompts them to often suspend their various offerings. This leads to even lesser opportunities, and even greater amounts of students suffering as result. However, the most severe effects are the changed hiring practices of many companies in the area. I was told in confidence after the completion of one my internships that the stated company had been searching for a suitable student of color to intern for them for almost five years to no avail. The students either weren’t there, were there in such low numbers that their odds were low to begin with, or had performed poorly through the interview process. As intelligent as I may be, I find it highly unlikely that I was indeed the only suitable candidate in a university of over xxxx undergraduates, of which almost 40 percent of students of color.

Of course, I was somewhat insensitive to cases of such discrimination until experiencing it firsthand. On one lackluster autumn day, I walked into the advising area of the business school after requesting an exemption from taking a particular business course. As I walked into the advisers office, the adviser was seated. She then took one long look at me and then excused herself, only to return with numerous pamphlets which detailed various alternative majors in the business school and other schools at xxxx. I became very hesitant, but I was there to accomplish something, so I sat down. The next words she uttered to me were “Transferring out of xxxx isn’t the end of the world, you have multiple alternative options you can pursue.” Now as you can probably imagine, I was quite confused. This wasn’t standard practice for advisers – normally advisers at the business school would print out your academic performance report to re-acclimatize themselves with a student’s current standing. I brushed it off, and mentioned to her that my meeting was for a class exemption, and not a change of major. She then stared at me quizzingly for a long while, and then proceeded to print out my academic record. Upon returning to speak with me, she looked quite frazzled and softly apologized, but I believe my facial expression divulged the fact that the damage was done. I subsequently withdrew from the business school, and was admitted to the xxx.

Now, I’m not impervious to the alternate explanations that my adviser may have been having a bad day, or that many students may have been transferring out during that period, among many others. Unfortunately, I had heard much too many similar stories from other students of color, and upon my inquiry to many of of the Caucasian students within my economics and finance cohort, I learned that they had never experienced anything of the sort. Coupled with the fact that the middle of the semester isn’t a usual time for intra-department transfers, I was forced to face reality. 

Discrimination on the basis of race is explicitly prohibited by the American Constitution, but alas, it still does occur today. Such instances don’t entirely mar my college experience of attending xxx, but knowledge of the fact there are numerous people, (no less numerous students) defenseless against such actions has fortified a strong sense of action within me to correct not only the inefficiencies which result from such practices but also the constructs which allow for such discrimination to occur. I know that my knowledge of these occurrences will motivate me while attending law school to not only acquire thorough knowledge of the law, but will also enable me to serve as a legal advocate for those who undergo similar situations as I did, regardless of whether they are regardless of their title. In addition, I know that a legal degree will provide me an opportunity to inform other people of color (in particular African-American males) that there is indeed a legal process which one can utilize to advance their platforms and welfare, and long as they are deemed legal. With the rise of Black Lives Matter, there has been a rise in the awareness of various injustices committed against African-American nationwide, but accompanying this has also been an increasing polarization regarding the best course of action to resolve such issues. I believe that it is of the utmost importance that African-American males are more aware of those who look like them who are able to advocate for them, for I believe that social change is a long and tenuous process, which requires compromise and multiple years of hard work.

5mwbew,2,2017-01-09,I'm not going to kill myself,SubterraneanTarantul,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5mwbew/im_not_going_to_kill_myself/,"I don't think there's a risk of it. I've been noticeably depressed for about half my life now, and suicide has always been something I've wanted but never bad enough to ignore the consequences.

I don't think I need help but that's a lie. I'm making a post here to prove that to myself. The past day or two, instead of thinking about suicide, I've been thinking about calling one of those lines that never made sense to me. ""If I'm at risk of suicide, it's going to be because I've decided that it's absolutely what I want, and if there is a moment to change my mind and call for help, I'd instead just change my mind and walk away.""

I'm 20, starting classes again tomorrow morning, 8:00, haven't been able to prepare anything. I might have enough folders brought with me, dunno what textbooks I need. It's 2:00. Past month I've been staying up all night til around 5:00 and sleeping as much as 13 hours. Lost my internship job I'm expected to maintain whenever I'm not at school, gave me a long break to train horrible sleeping habits all in preparation for ruining today.

I already asked my Mom to help set up a doctor's appointment to get help with depression. I was really resistant to getting help at first. I flaunt the reason as being that I don't have the time or money, constantly busy with school and work, moving between states every few months. I think the biggest reason I didn't want to is because when I was much younger, not quite as early as 10 but in middle school and occasionally after, I would ask to seek help and get a diagnosis and see what could be done, and I was told I was too yound for medication and would be forced to attend weekly, time consuming, early morning therapy sessions that ""didn't help my sister any."" Things haven't really changed, and now I've got a decade of experience dealing with it. If help wasn't important then, why would it be now?

I have a tendency to delete these types of outbursts before sending them, but I'll just take this one down in the morning if I remember or have time before class.

5mwbte,1,2017-01-09,"PS Review - I'm a noob to this, and i'm also too broke to afford admission consults. I appreciate any constructive criticism.",HiSoArshavin,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/5mwbte/ps_review_im_a_noob_to_this_and_im_also_too_broke/,"There are experience or events which strike one so deeply that to ignore them is excruciatingly impossible, or at the least, deeply uncomfortable. My time at xxx is such a phenomenon. 

Attending xxxx was a direct result of both my underwhelming (some would even say mediocre) academic performance in high school, coupled with my insistence of paying my own way through university. My father being a professor at xxx certainly influenced my decision as I was somewhat familiar with the university culture. But initially, I saw attending xxxx as a symbol of my forthcoming redemption, the place where I would essentially rise from mediocrity and be born again as a student of boundless intellectual curiosity.

I can happily say that I fulfilled most of my goals. While I encountered rough patches - due mostly to my commitments outside the classroom (I worked 25-40 hours a week throughout college to afford tuition, room and board), I was able to graduate with a degree in Economics while participating in a various medley of experiences of such that without certain faculty, I would have been unaware of to this day.

Unfortunately, I know that my experiences and sentiments were not shared by many of my fellow students, particularly students of color. With many students of color at xxxx being first-generation, there is a lack of knowledge that afflicts some of these students when it comes to navigating the maze that university can be – particularly when it comes to such topics as major selection and how students should go about pursuing their careers. As a student worker, I witnessed countless instances of advisers shoehorning many of these students away from the majors of their choice, and guiding them towards majors which required much less work, offered much bleaker employment prospects, and which were completely misaligned with the student’s academic interests or passion. 

As I’ve come to discover, such actions have various implications which one could describe as a negative feedback cycle. Due to such a lack of students of color within certain majors or departments, internships and scholarships at xxx specifically targeting students of color are often low in number, and subsequently have a low number of eligible students. This in turn leads to companies and organizations being heavily discouraged, which prompts them to often suspend their various offerings. This leads to even lesser opportunities, and even greater amounts of students suffering as result. However, the most severe effects are the changed hiring practices of many companies in the area. I was told in confidence after the completion of one my internships that the stated company had been searching for a suitable student of color to intern for them for almost five years to no avail. The students either weren’t there, were there in such low numbers that their odds were low to begin with, or had performed poorly through the interview process. As intelligent as I may be, I find it highly unlikely that I was indeed the only suitable candidate in a university of over xxxx undergraduates, of which almost 40 percent of students of color.

Of course, I was somewhat insensitive to cases of such discrimination until experiencing it firsthand. On one lackluster autumn day, I walked into the advising area of the business school after requesting an exemption from taking a particular business course. As I walked into the advisers office, the adviser was seated. She then took one long look at me and then excused herself, only to return with numerous pamphlets which detailed various alternative majors in the business school and other schools at xxxx. I became very hesitant, but I was there to accomplish something, so I sat down. The next words she uttered to me were “Transferring out of xxxx isn’t the end of the world, you have multiple alternative options you can pursue.” Now as you can probably imagine, I was quite confused. This wasn’t standard practice for advisers – normally advisers at the business school would print out your academic performance report to re-acclimatize themselves with a student’s current standing. I brushed it off, and mentioned to her that my meeting was for a class exemption, and not a change of major. She then stared at me quizzingly for a long while, and then proceeded to print out my academic record. Upon returning to speak with me, she looked quite frazzled and softly apologized, but I believe my facial expression divulged the fact that the damage was done. I subsequently withdrew from the business school, and was admitted to the xxx.

Now, I’m not impervious to the alternate explanations that my adviser may have been having a bad day, or that many students may have been transferring out during that period, among many others. Unfortunately, I had heard much too many similar stories from other students of color, and upon my inquiry to many of of the Caucasian students within my economics and finance cohort, I learned that they had never experienced anything of the sort. Coupled with the fact that the middle of the semester isn’t a usual time for intra-department transfers, I was forced to face reality. 

Discrimination on the basis of race is explicitly prohibited by the American Constitution, but alas, it still does occur today. Such instances don’t entirely mar my college experience of attending xxx, but knowledge of the fact there are numerous people, (no less numerous students) defenseless against such actions has fortified a strong sense of action within me to correct not only the inefficiencies which result from such practices but also the constructs which allow for such discrimination to occur. I know that my knowledge of these occurrences will motivate me while attending law school to not only acquire thorough knowledge of the law, but will also enable me to serve as a legal advocate for those who undergo similar situations as I did, regardless of whether they are regardless of their title. In addition, I know that a legal degree will provide me an opportunity to inform other people of color (in particular African-American males) that there is indeed a legal process which one can utilize to advance their platforms and welfare, and long as they are deemed legal. With the rise of Black Lives Matter, there has been a rise in the awareness of various injustices committed against African-American nationwide, but accompanying this has also been an increasing polarization regarding the best course of action to resolve such issues. I believe that it is of the utmost importance that African-American males are more aware of those who look like them who are able to advocate for them, for I believe that social change is a long and tenuous process, which requires compromise and multiple years of hard work.

I'm currently in a position in which I find it extremely hard to rationalize out of. I'm graduating this Spring with a BS in Computer Science, with no internship experience, and a pretty average GPA (3.4-3.5). I, unfortunately, have had a lot of anxiety coupled with imposter syndrome the past few months since applying for graduation. The thought of never being a good enough programmer surfaces in my head when I start to panic about my future and career. It's comforting to think about working on my own projects, but the idea of working with others is a bit worrisome. My boyfriend tells me I'm a good programmer, that I *get* it well, and sometimes when I'm doing well on my projects I DO feel like I am good at what I do, but there have been times where I wonder if I can fit in working among other people. If they would accept me as I am or would they think of me as someone who's trying to be something they're not? This makes me feel like I am the textbook case of Imposter Syndrome. :/

I DO love programming and building things and have even built a game from scratch (since i didn't know about game engines at the time), but my fear of not being ""good"" enough for a company still drives me off from applying to the places i should already have applied for. I'm embarrassed to say my self-esteem has/is becoming a detriment to my future. I could've started and finished an internship (or a few) the previous years had I just went for it, but instead I was always pushing it off feeling like I wasn't good enough *yet.* 

Has anyone else felt similarly when applying for jobs? If so, how did you get past it? "

Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day.

5mx64q,3,2017-01-09,My first apartment experience....,Rexnone,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/5mx64q/my_first_apartment_experience/,"Hey guys, 

I live in a apartment building and have been through everything here. This was the last straw I think. I feel like I need to vent. Before I start, I know the number answer is gonna be ""why didn't you leave/move out yet?"". 
This is my first apartment after leaving home and I guess I just didn't know what to do next or that it was ok to leave.
I moved away from home in 2012 and stayed in a college residence while completing my internship for 4 weeks. After I completed it my company offered me a job and I needed a place to stay ASAP. I found this building in downtown Calgary fast. I was so excited!! My own place! This is where the first problem began. I used my washroom and my toilet was broken. It wouldn't flush. I thought it was clogged but it was 100% broken. I was forced to use the restaurant bathroom which was 11 flights of stairs on the ground level for 5 days while they ordered me a new toilet. Every night having to use the washroom I had to make that journey. It was a awful bathroom to, it was used as storage for janitorial supplies.
The next thing to go was my fridge. It started off as a rattle which graduated into a deafening BANG every few hours. Imagine a truck backfiring in your kitchen every night. I went down to ask for help and they would say they fixed it and then later that night BANG! It would happen again. I lost a lot of milk and veggies thanks to that one. New fridge was ordered. 
After the backfiring fridge my dishwasher went. Water would spray out of the sides on occasion. Management was actually good with this one. They fixed it eventually. The big one was the heat. My first year here was the worst winter I experienced. What made it worst was that I suffered through it without any heat in my apartment. Every day was a challenge. I would wake up frozen every morning. I complained and complained and complained. They would send a guy up who said they fixed it, and not to my surprise nothing was fixed. I would come home in my jacket and keep it on until bed time. My land lord told me one day to keep my oven on and oven door open. Every year I struggle with the heat. 
Another struggle is the drains. This problem is like Russian Roulette. Imagine yourself in the living room watching TV, then you hear a rumble and a water sloushing noise. You run to the kitchen to see dirty water shooting out of your drain 2 feet high! The smell is awful, rotten eggs. I had to air out my apartment for hours after that. This problem is a reoccurring one. The solution from management is ""always leave your kitchen sink drain clog in"". I forgot one day and came home from my 12 hour shift to all my lights on, kitchen mat and door mat SOAKED and THROWN in my bath tub and dirty brown kitchen tiles. No note was left, no call made to me, nothing. 
Moving on now and yes there is more. My living room flooded. It caused my floor boards to squish with every step I would take. Water came seeping up. They tore off my floor boards and I was left with a cement living room for 7 days. 
Every couple of weeks the building says they have to do maintenance and they shut off the hot water. This is particularly not fun cause then I either have to microwave bowls of water or take a extremely cold Siberian like winter shower. Those mornings are not fun and are extremely frequent. 
Last July I came back from a 13 day vacation with my girlfriend from Paris. I got into my apartment and smelled a musty smell. My girlfriend called me to the bathroom and I found what happened. My bathroom drop down ceiling had caved in from what looked like a leak. The bathroom drop ceiling tiles were all warped and scattered across the bathroom. Mold and stuff was forming on the ground. I called the emergency numbers in my lease and they had told me to wait for a call back. We waited for hours and got no calls. We kept calling them because once again I was with no bathroom. The emergency person on call was on vacation and no one was there to replace him. 24 hours later they came and replaced the tile. They didn't clean anything but replaced the tiles. I had to go down and complain to get my bathroom cleaned of mold and debris. 
Now the title of the thread. For the last year I thought I had allergies. In fact I've been to the doctor multiple times and have been told I have hives. Crazy itchy red lumps that vary in size and shape. I still don't know what it is. 3 hours ago I was laying in bed and moved my blanket to see a bug crawling on my bed. A bedbug. I was horrified. They say there's never only one and there's probably a colony in here somewhere. I don't know what to do now. I want to get rid of everything and just get out of here. I have been up the whole night cause I feel like my skin is crawling and I'm so angry."

I graduated with my undergrad in philosophy, not psych, and I would have to go back to CC and then do some ""open university"" classes while working on internships/volunteer stuff to be accepted to a decent grad program. But each grad program has its own specific criteria for non-psych majors to have the pre-requisites. 

So I'm wondering which school's pre-requisites I should focus on more and eventually apply to. How big a difference is there between, say, a clinical psych program at UC Berkeley or UCLA vs a Cal State like Sacramento or San Francisco, or maybe something in another state that's less amazing than UCLA? If the programs all purport to get students the internships and degrees required to do work, then if I were to do private practice, why would it be beneficial for me to work drastically harder to get into a ""good"" top school if I'm not interested in doing research or teaching? I just want to help people in therapy. "

 1. 

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

 1. Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! 

I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

 1. Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon!

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid.  This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, I’m Liam, the director of [CompeteLeague](https://lol.competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for a number of years now, providing and completing several amateur scene tournaments and doing our best to improve and give a professional experience to a wide variety of players. 

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted LoL league, we’re hosting 3 month leagues for Bronze &amp; Silver, Gold &amp; Platinum, Diamond &amp; Up that are open to all. We're operating in NA and EUW, more info below. **We’ve recently reset the ELOs of all teams on our site in conjunction with the new season, so all joining teams will have a chance to qualify for our Premier Leagues** Any teams that don’t qualify still get filtered into our Open Leagues, which are also run weekly and can be joined at any time! Check out our [Website](https://lol.competeleague.com/) and our subreddit [r/CompeteLeague](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/). 

Our Leagues qualifiers are *starting on the 23rd of January* (two weeks away!) so if you'd like to play with your team that can be the case as early as the Monday after next!

**About CompeteLeague** 

CompeteLeague launched 3 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. Starting small in size back then with only 1 league featuring 8 teams, we have grown and developed our community and website as a passion project since then to the point where we over the past year we’ve had our most successful seasons ever, running 22 leagues over the course of 2016 that all culminated with our 3 day finals events, one of which we [broadcasted from a professional studio in Denver](https://youtu.be/VKC6a9YXqBc?t=1646). We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made growing our community and competitions, and now we’re looking to build on what we have and bring you more features! 

**What We Need**

We need you! As a player, as a viewer, as an eSport enthusiast, as a volunteer, we're back and looking to grow our community coming into our 3rd season. Our site is ready for signups and teams registering for competition, and our qualifiers will be in the next few weeks to set up our CompeteLeague 2017 Spring Split leagues. Our stream will be beginning with it and we'll want anyone interested to come watch and cheer for our teams. We're also always looking for interested community members who would like to get involved in an eSports setting, we have several roles that we train people in and help them get experience (casters, organisers, writers etc.), and plenty to offer for our volunteers (more information below). We've recently put in the time to overhaul the visuals of our website – however we're not a big organisation and haven't had the manpower or time to do comprehensive testing. As such please report any bugs that you find on our site on our [bug reports page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report).

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST
6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 7 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in 0 points. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners &amp; next seasons teams over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [information page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/information) on our site. Just hit the ‘Format Information’ tab and it’s right there for you. 

**Pricing**

Totally free &amp; always will be: we've no interest in charging you money to play. Our primary revenue stream is going to be sponsorship, if you're curious about that there's more information about it on our site. For particularly generous benefactors we do have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) from which the money we make is turned directly back into prizing (and occasionally giveaways).

**Smurfing policy**

We have years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq).

**Prizes**

We don't announce the prizing in our tournaments at the beginning of our seasons - but we do prize all our leagues! The prizing for our seasons in 2016 was $20 RP for the winning team, $10 RP for second place, &amp; a mystery skin for third (insert appropriate EU currencies for EUW) - these are lower than we'd like as Riot doesn't provide prizing for online tournaments any more and we have to fund it ourselves, but we'll be equalling or bettering the prizing for this season. We don't charge players to play but as mentioned previously if members want to contribute to that the money we receive on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) goes entirely towards it.

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways intermittently, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. We stream over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/competeleague) which is our main hub, but for those who would like quality settings due to low bandwidth internet we also simultaneously stream to our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CompeteLeague).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being [Dominic ‘Dom’ Roemer](https://twitter.com/DomRoemer) who now casts for Riot) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). Just recently as well we’ve seen one of our casters [Jay ‘Arktiq112’ Taylor](https://twitter.com/arktiq112) land a job with Fnatic! We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. The different positions we have for volunteers are:

-- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

-- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails usually casting 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so bear in mind we may spend some time giving you practice &amp; training prior to putting you live to cast in our leagues - we aim to have any recruits that don’t have experience cast some of our Open League games to build up practice.  

-- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

-- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred.

-- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

-- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS, Angular 2 and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

-- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

-- Writer/Content provider

We're expanding and providing better structure &amp; consistency in our content crew in the coming season. Whether you want to create content surrounding our leagues, the amateur scene, the eSports scene as a whole, or other related topics we're happy to help you with a community to publish to &amp; feedback for your work.

-- How do I apply?

Our application form on our website has been temporarily hidden, so in the meantime the correct way to apply for a position is to answer the questions in this google document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOLbwkt_T0uvIzGegPyBnto3Pa1HZ9ikbIV74cY-VYc/edit?usp=sharing And email the answers to admins@competeleague.com

**What Makes us Different?**

*Experience.* We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We were one of the very first amateur leagues on the scene and having watched a lot of tournament organizers (HP5v5, Vespyr, iEsports) struggle with their LoL operations in recent months I believe we're one of the last - and we're not going anywhere! We look to run/perform everything we do as professionally as possible and if that sounds like something you can get behind then we hope to see you join our community!

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. Players looking for teams currently get bumped to the top by hitting a 'Actively looking for team' button on their account pages, so you can know what players have been looking for a squad in the past week! All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.


*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a Sm4sh tournament (currently operating in Northern California) then you can! We’ll be looking to expand to more games in 2017 beyond just LoL and Sm4sh so be on the look out!

- *My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If you continue to have issues our support email is admins@competeleague.com, we'll get you sorted out!

- *I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

any further issues please repeat the problem on the website once more and then go to [https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report) - when you submit your report we get automatic information on the last few processes you’ve run and it helps us diagnose and fix any issues.

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, we have a few extra unannounced changes, and we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. Make sure to look in the comments below, as they may have answers to your questions."

We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We were one of the very first amateur leagues on the scene and having watched a lot of tournament organizers (HP5v5, Vespyr, iEsports) struggle with their LoL operations in recent months I believe we're one of the last - and we're not going anywhere! We look to run/perform everything we do as professionally as possible and if that sounds like something you can get behind then we hope to see you join our community!

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. Players looking for teams currently get bumped to the top by hitting a 'Actively looking for team' button on their account pages, so you can know what players have been looking for a squad in the past week! All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.


*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a Sm4sh tournament (currently operating in Northern California) then you can! We’ll be looking to expand to more games in 2017 beyond just LoL and Sm4sh so be on the look out!

*My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If you continue to have issues our support email is admins@competeleague.com, we'll get you sorted out!

*I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

any further issues please repeat the problem on the website once more and then go to [https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report) - when you submit your report we get automatic information on the last few processes you’ve run and it helps us diagnose and fix any issues. From there we'll get back to you ASAP! 

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, we have a few extra unannounced changes, and we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. Make sure to look in the comments below, as they may have answers to your questions.

**Edit:** A few people are reporting issues at the final stages of free agent registration. I'll refer you to the above:

ADHD is something I was never officially diagnosed with, but for my entire life it has been something that I clearly struggled with.


My mom admitted to suspecting me to have ADHD as a child, but never brought it up to my doctor out of fear that my dad and his side of the family would be angry with her.  (ADHD is clearly prominent on my father's side of the family, but they deny it).


This past semester of my junior year of college, I struggled greatly with my ADHD and depression after some difficult personal trauma.  I was a great student, always working extremely hard to get As and Bs in school.  For the first time ever I was faced with nearly receiving no credit in one of my courses, and poor grades in the others due to my lack of motivation and focus through the entire semester.  Normally my ADHD will cause me to have spurts of times where I cannot concentrate, but coupled with the depression, I was like this for an extended period of time

By the very end of the semester I was finally beginning to come out of the rut I was in.  I was contemplating reaching out to a doctor and requesting medication.  I decided to just relax and enjoy the holidays and figure everything out after New Years.

After New Years, things started to click again.  Instead of sitting around unable to get myself to do anything productive, or focus on anything, I started doing things small steps at a time.  


In two days I was able to put together my resume, which I had been putting off doing the entire break.  After that point I was on a roll; I completed my cover letter and applied for four summer internships the next day.  Today I completed all of the tasks I needed to for my Resident Assistant job back at school, so now I am completely prepared for the new semester.


This is the most productive I have been in four months.  I think I am finally coming out of the rut I was in, and I am going to begin to develop a plan of attack for the coming semester for how I need to deal with my ADHD.  For all of you stuck, you can do it!  And for all of you not stuck right now, tell me your tips and tricks for coping!"

I have a Bachelors in Music Production Technology. When I graduated, I did 6 months in a studio and decided that life was not for me. I always loved computers, and in 2015 I took a 6 month paid internship as a onsite desktop support technician for a Managed Service Provider. They hired me after the internship and I thought I could work getting real experience and then jump ship when a better opportunity presented itself.  I have experience with windows 7 all the way to deploying 10, office 2007 up to 365, and server 2003 to 2012 R2. Active Directory UAC and Exchange as well. The client I serviced had over 400 computers and 800 users, was a hospital environment, and except for a helpdesk, I was the sole guy on the client job. This past November, however, the client I was servicing terminated the contract with my MSP and I got laid off. I know that the client did not leave because of my ability to run the environment. I have been to a couple interviews for onsite and helpdesk support, but never get past round one. I'm looking to make myself more valuable and in demand, so I was wondering what would be better: A certification or a 2nd Degree? I like desktop support right now, and can see myself as a Server Engineer some day, so anything to point me in that direction would be helpful too. 

Thanks!"

We live together and she has depression and gets anxiety attacks so she doesnt exactly handle stress well.

Her car is a POS and has been in and out of the shop for the last 3 weeks. It's at the point where there's really no point in putting more money in it, but we can't afford to just buy a new car right now. And with perfect timing of the car issues, she started an internship that she now has to worry about how she'll get there. 

For xmas i gave her my Macbook pro. Well last night she accidentally spilled a glass of water all over it.....
And while we're taking the steps to dry it out and all that, it's not looking good.

We're not dying, we're not suicidal, we're just both feeling like life hates us right now and nothing can go right. Make us feel better please :("
5n0p3l,5,2017-01-09,Looking for some advice and opinions regarding Android dev in New York,nyc_android,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5n0p3l/looking_for_some_advice_and_opinions_regarding/,"I'm looking to get into Android development professionally. I'm trying to get a better idea of what I should be expecting, and I have some pretty specific goals. I wanted to post here to get advice, opinions, and just to get an idea if what I want to do is realistic. This post will probably get pretty long.

I'm a 26 year old who graduated with a Computer Science &amp; Engineering degree (but with a sub-par GPA) from a well respected state school (Uconn). After graduating I got a job in the insurance industry doing database work, mostly SQL dev with some .Net thrown in occasionally. I've been doing this for 3 years now, not counting my 2 summer internships. The work is fairly uninteresting, the company is huge and super conservative so there's not much innovation, especially on the tech side of things, and 95% of my coworkers at over 40. It's not great, but not terrible either. I don't need to be on the bleeding edge, working in some super fast-pace corner of the tech world. In fact, I don't really want that.

I've always wanted to work on Android, and I've always wanted to live in New York City. I want to work with other smart, young people, doing interesting stuff. But I don't want to work 80 hours a week in a cut-throat, fast pace, high-stress environment. Currently I'm living in Hartford on a lease that ends in September, so that's most likely when I'll be looking to make the move. I've dabbled in Android development before, I took a Coursera course a while back on Android dev, and I'm currently finishing up Udacity's ""Developing Android Apps"" course. After that I plan on working on my own little side projects to build up some sort of portfolio. Hopefully I can get something into the app store by around summer time. Even if it's something super simple that's been done a hundred times before. So I'm working on this stuff on the side and trying to become more consistent at doing so. I've always kept up with the industry, and Android dev scenes so I kinda know what's up. I just need to put that into practice. Though it can be tough with a full-time job. I want to be able to put all my effort into Android, but that really isn't an option for me to do that unless it is my day job.

Anyways, what I really want to ask is this... Is is realistic for me to expect to find a job as a beginner Android dev that meets the following criteria:

* Make a comfortable living by NYC standards ($80k-ish)
* Be able to learn and be mentored on the job
* Work at a larger company as part of a large-ish team (I'm someone who appreciates a fair amount of job security and not being the sole person responsible for something)
* Is a full-time position, not on a contract basis

Thank you for you input."
5n0q0m,5,2017-01-09,Recent grad having trouble finding job / path,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5n0q0m/recent_grad_having_trouble_finding_job_path/,"Hello, and thanks for reading -

I recently graduated in the Seattle area with a BS in CS, and I'm having difficulty finding a job and settling on a career path.

This was my second degree, and I pushed to get through my program as quickly as possible to minimize my student loans. My GPA was decent (3.6), and I published and presented a research paper at an IEEE conference. However, I failed to land an internship during my only summer in school because I started applying too late.

I'm now having a difficult time getting past HR for interviews. I had some friends from school help me to revamp my resume, but I haven't gotten so much as a phone interview since graduating.

Outside of school, I've been developing in Java SE and Python in a Linux environment. I'm brushing up on my DS&amp;A skills by working through CLRS, doing problems on Leetcode, and working as a grader for undergraduate DS&amp;A course. I wrote a basic web app using LAMP, and am going through the Django tutorial. I designed and implemented a Java library to support my research project and plan to write a second research paper this month with my research adviser.

What else should I be doing? Am I being impatient or did I completely miss the boat by not getting an internship and now I'm SOL on finding a job as a software developer?"

* 5-10% equity

I make that in two weeks at my current internship. Equity is kind of a foreign concept for me to negotiate/gauge the value of, especially considering how new this company seems to be.

I have two years post college experience at a Fortune 100 company doing Java/C# programming (was promoted during this time as well). I also have two internships prior to this.

I have, 1.5 years ago, decided to make a career change that has unfortunately not worked out (I am in the military as a pilot; but was recently found Not Physically Qualified anymore to train). 

I am in my mid-late twenties and was wondering if I will be able to make any sort of return to the field? I was making just north of 100k prior and would like to return to something similar, however I am looking at some other threads on here and it seems that there is a lot of strife; lots of lower pay, inability to find work, etc.. and even if I do return I would be lucky to get any job let alone a decent paying one.

I still have a Linkedin but have not updated that I have been out of the industry for over a year now, so I do get recruiter emails etc. still., but if it were apparent I was out of the industry for so long I don't think it would be the case.

I will be making a big decision here soon (whether I should push for separation and hopefully a civilian programming career, or stay in the military in a different job), and am just trying to get a gauge on what my options are.

Thank you kindly."
5n1oc1,2,2017-01-09,"I [23 F] caught my boyfriend [24 M] of 2+years lying to me. He is mentally ill, but I don't know what is him and what is the illness.",netflixandnotchill,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5n1oc1/i_23_f_caught_my_boyfriend_24_m_of_2years_lying/,"I'll try to keep this short. The first 6 months of our relationship were amazing. I'd never been so happy in a relationship. That was probably the happiest I've ever been really. We were both in college, but we were able to see each other every couple days and even go on short trips every few months. 

The following semester was rocky for him. He ended up dropping out shortly after due to money issues. Both of us are middle-class with siblings who are also in college. I applied for scholarships and financial aid, moved into a terrible (but cheap!) apartment, and got 2 part-time jobs to make it through college. He got a part-time freelance writing job. Though he's good at it, it isn't enough to pay for rent. I eventually left one of my jobs and was able to give the position to him. But he still had money problems and didn't return to school. 

I helped him cover rent a few times (putting my own finances in trouble), got him an interview at one of my internships, and helped him make a resume and cover letter. He took on some holiday work for 2 weeks but quit because transportation was an issue.

As far as stuff between us, it's been very hot and cold. There were several times in the last year where he would ignore me for a week at a time without reason. I know I'm not perfect, but this would happen without there even being an argument or anything. After a week had passed, he'd text me a meme or something and act like nothing had happened.

Throughout this, I recognized that he was struggling with depression (I've been depressed since middle school). I hadn't talked to him about his depression since he doesn't really open up about feelings. One night when he was staying over, I briefly mentioned that I had been feeling down about some personal issues and was considering going on antidepressants, he got angry with me and told me he would break up with me if I went on them. He stormed out that night. That was this summer. 

Fast-forward to New Year's Eve, where he ignored me at a party where all of our friends were (we went to the party together) and where a handful of my friends came up to me to ask me why he was hanging around ex-girlfriends. I had walked by him to charge my phone and he told me ""back off,"" then ""don't follow me"" as I was leaving the party. He was walking with an ex, but wouldn't be seen with me. 

The friends who left with me saw what had happened. I didn't even have to say anything to them, so I know my thoughts on this didn't color their opinions or what they were seeing. He texts me at 3 in the morning saying ""please be safe.""

A few days go by and he starts texting me about NYE, saying that if he's seen with me, girls who used to know him before he dated me and ""who don't know"" me won't talk to him because said girls ""hate"" me. 

I know the girls he was talking to were exes, and I know that it would be wrong to pretend I'm not around to talk to girls who wouldn't otherwise talk to him. It might not sound like it in this post, but I'm not the jealous type. I'm friends with a couple of of my own exes, and am open about this. But there's something messed up about what happened that night. 

He came over to talk with me last week about it in person. He had texted me and told me he's been feeling miserable in general about his life and that I'm a big part of that because I'm a big part of his life. He was going to break up with me, or at least talk about it at my house. 

He came over, didn't say much, then started to have a panic-attack. He ran to a busy road near my house and said he didn't want to live anymore. He almost walked into traffic because he was miserable and because he needed $100 for rent and didn't have it. I've had suicidal friends before, so I was able to talk him down and into walking with me back to my house. I gave him a Benadryl and some food and told him to lie down. He's been at my house since. That was 4 days ago. I took care of the $100 rent because his roommates are my friends (we were friends before we started dating) and I don't want them to be in a tough spot. It's understood that I'll be paid back in 2 days before my own bills are due. 

Anyway, about the lying. This is going to sound so small, but the fact that he lied to me is messing me up more than the rest. He hid our relationship status on Facebook and lied about it. I got a bunch of texts and people coming up to me in public telling me they're glad we broke up. This was news to me, then they said that the relationship part of our Facebooks wasn't there, and they pointed out that we haven't been in a picture together for over a year (he doesn't want to be seen in pictures with me, and has deleted pictures of me in the past). 

Today we're supposed to contact local mental health clinics -- at my insistence -- to see what his options may be. He doesn't have health insurance, so it's been difficult. He said he wants to try antidepressants.

TL;DR:
This is what I'm struggling with: I've been putting more into this relationship than he has. I know he's sick now. He lied to me today while watching Netflix at my house and sitting next to me. I know he lied because he left his Facebook open on my computer and I saw the relationship part was hidden -- I swear I thought it was logged into mine and that I was checking mine. I logged out immediately. Obviously someone who is dealing with depression this severe doesn't need someone to come at them about Facebook. But I'm still hurt about being ignored on NYE, and I'm upset that he just lied to me. This stuff can't be discussed imo until he gets mental help. I'm upset that he walked out on me when I considered taking antidepressants, but that he can mention it for himself as if it's not a big deal (and it's not a big deal, but you get what I mean). 

I don't know if I can trust him. At the very least, he needs help. And as someone I've cared about for almost 3 years, he does mean a lot to me. But I don't know how much of this is him being awful, him being extremely depressed, or if there's a way or reason to separate the two. It's wearing me out emotionally and I've actually started therapy for myself because of what happened NYE.

Thank you for reading all this. It feels good to just have it out somewhere.

EDIT: I didn't tell him I could pay the $100. I told him I couldn't, and that killing himself wouldn't pay for rent.

5n29ck,2,2017-01-09,Weird Break Up Between Me (25M) and Ex/Friend (19F),ionictime,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5n29ck/weird_break_up_between_me_25m_and_exfriend_19f/,"Met this girl on trip during college. Started dating for a few months, then we broke up as I moved 2,000 miles away for an internship. We shared a lot of deep issues in common and were close, so kept up a friendship, speaking several times each week for the 4 months I was gone. During those 4 months, we met once out of state for the weekend, had fun and hooked up too.

I recently returned to where our college is for graduation, the holidays, and live until I find a legit job. We hung out until she went out of town for Christmas. Had a talk about defining our relationship before she left town. I wanted to date and she wasn't sure (which I took as not wanting to).

She recently returned, acted hot/cold, and flaked on hanging a few times, saying we were supposed to be mad at each other. I thought she was playing games, so sent a text saying to ""let me know when you're ready to act like an adult.""

24 hours later she texted saying we should end our friendship. I called - no answer. I sent a text explaining why I was upset, that my comment to her was out of line, and that people get upset in relationships but resolve the issue by talking it out. A couple days later she sent another text saying she's ending our friendship. I responded by saying ""Ok. Wish you the best.""

We've been friends for 7 months, speaking every few days and this is our 1st fight so I'm a little surprised. Especially since we never even had a conversation trying to work it out.

I'm guessing we just weren't as close as I thought, but any advice or thoughts from you all?"
5n2ceu,1,2017-01-09,My [30M] boyfriend won't find a job. I [25F] am starting to worry. Is this fixable?,namealreadytakengrrr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5n2ceu/my_30m_boyfriend_wont_find_a_job_i_25f_am/,"Hi reddit,

This is going to be long, so I apologize in advance. 


 My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. So far we've gotten on great. He's a very sweet caring guy, and for the most part we can talk to each other about anything. We've had our ups and downs and always manage to get through them and come out stronger. However there's one thing that has been bothering me for a while. I feel like we're not on the same wavelength at all when it comes to our work ethic and drive.


When we met he told me he was in between things jobwise. He works in media so I know jobs can be hard to come by in this sector and I didn't see it as a big deal back then. However, that was 2 years ago and since then he has only had one job lasting around 6 months... with a few freelance positions thrown in here and there - I should mention that the freelance gigs are usually gotten/created for him by friends and family members (e.g. he does the odd job for his mom's company, jobs which she creates for him since she hates seeing him struggle). He never looks for a job. He won't even spend an evening updating his CV - the CV which I made for him. His mom is constantly sending him job listings, he says ""Yeah I'll apply for that tomorrow"" but then he never even reads the post, and certainly hasn't applied to any. 


At the moment money isn't a huge problem for us relationship wise. I have my own decent income and he has savings and is on benefit while he's ""job searching"". So this isn't a post about him mooching off me or anything. The problem is that I worry about our future. Also I'm starting to become a little bit resentful of the fact that I go to work every day and work crazy hard for 10 hours (I'm in gradschool which is also my income) working towards my future so I can be comfortable when I'm older and have a family of my own, and he sits at home playing computer games.


I worked really hard for my career. I busted my ass for the past 8 years to get where I am and I'm finally in a position to move into the career I always dreamed of - which happens to pay really really good money. I guess I just wish that he had the same career enthusiasm I had.


We've talked about settling down together, and we talk about some day getting married and day dream about having children and a nice house etc. But I worry about our future. I came from a family where my parents struggled to give us a happy comfortable life, they almost killed themselves working for their kids, and I hated seeing that. I want to be able to some day give my kids a good life too, along with all the things my parents wanted for us, but couldn't give. This is why I'm working hard now. But what happens, for example, when I'm pregnant and can't work? Or if I get sick? My boyfriend needs to be working on his career now. And I feel like it's a bad sign that he isn't.


I've tried to talk to him about how he needs to be working on filling his CV now, even if it's just in small steps. He can't expect to walk into his cool dream job if he doesn't start doing the ground work now. He seems to expect that one day he will find the job he wants but until then he refuses to settle for less and would prefer to do nothing instead. This is unrealistic and I've tried to explain that to him but anytime the subject is brought up he puts up a wall and doesn't listen and/or gets angry, and just sits there on his phoone ignoring me while I talk to him. Funnily enough he keeps telling me to ""stop getting mad"" even though I don't raise my voice at all - he obviously feels threatened when I bring it up.


The other day I lost my cool and flipped out at him about this: We were talking about going on a holiday next year, he said he doesn't think we can because he won't have the money unless he finds a job, which is something I am sick and tired of hearing. I told him I'm sick of hearing that, that he is not going to ever have a job if he refuses to even look for one, let alone apply for anything that he finds. He has been out of work for the last 8 months and has not even looked since. I asked him why and he said he needed a break after the last job. I reminded him that he has been saying he needs to get a job since October and he has not looked. And then I hinted at an ultimatum. I told him that I can't see a future with someone who won't work and that if he doesn't start looking this week, and find something (anything!) in one month we will be having this same discussion but with different consequences (I never actually used the words breakup). I told him that one day his parents aren't going to be there for him to fall back on, and his savings will be gone (They are almost gone anyway) and he will have nothing. I said this to him and he got really defensive and mad at me and said that if it comes to that ""I'll get a fucking job in McDonalds"".  


So right now I'm waiting and hoping he will find something.

 And this is the part where I worry the most: I worked too hard at my career to be with someone who is happy to sit and do nothing with their lives. I want him to be more career driven because I love him and I don't want to leave him. I already confided in a friend about all this, to which she was shocked as from the outside our relationship looks amazing, and it is except for this one glitch. She told me she thinks I should leave him, even though she knows how great he is in every other way. But I really don't want to. 


I'm looking for tips on encouraging him to start getting excited about working. I know I shouldn't have flipped out at him but I was at the end of my tether. I would even be happy if he went back to school, or did an internship - as long as it's working towards something. Heck I would even work on a project together if that could get him motivated. It's not about the money at the end of the day because I know I can earn a good living and I sure as hell don't want to live off the man I marry, but I also don't want to be the sole bread winner. And I want to be proud of my man for going after his dreams.


So reddit, have any of you managed to get your SO to get moving in their lives? Or is it a lost hope?

5n2j4a,7,2017-01-09,Graduating with ~90k in loans. Potential 45k starting salary at entry level. Student loan help,derekstark,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5n2j4a/graduating_with_90k_in_loans_potential_45k/,"So I am graduating in May 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science. Right now I am currently working as a server at a local Red Lobster and as an intern with the State government with a job in my field. I am 24 years old and My monthly income is ~1800 working part time with monthly expenses of about ~900 max for groceries, car insurance, rent, etc. I have pulled in 90,000 in student loans for the last 6 years. As I attended community college and then transferred to a State University, I had to retake classes as the ones I had received at the community college did not count towards their degree (isn't that funny that they just want your money?). I had no help from my parents even though they made 6 figures, so I was forced to take out a private bank loan to pay for my tuition. These loans are spread out into 3 categories. Federal Unsubsidized, Federal Subsidized, and a Private bank student loan. 40,000 in federal loans with interest rates from 3-4% I believe. These loans are spread out over about 10 different federal loans (5 subsidized and 5 unsubsidized). And the private loans are 3 separate loans divided up in equal amounts of ~16,300. 2 with fixed interest rates (3.4% and 5%) and 1 with a variable rate (6.1%). Right now the total  including principal and interest, is 90,000. Estimated monthly payments with be ~750. 450 for he private loan which is a 15 year repayment period. And 300 a month for the federal for a 30 year period. I can always change the repayment periods, but this is what it is set at so I can hope to survive. Anyways I am fairly certain after I graduate I will obtain a job with the state at an entry level position with a annual income of 40,000 minimum and a maximum of 45,000 with good benefits such as employer paid life insurance, low dental and medical insurance and good retirement options. The only thing I own is a 2012 Impala that was recently paid off last week and I have ~3000 in bank accounts. I have a decent credit score of 770 as well. My question is what should I do about these loans? Is my best option to consolidate loans and get 1 interest rate? Or do I have any other options? I would love to hear some advice. Thank you."
5n2jiy,2,2017-01-09,Looking for summer internships. Am I underqualified?,ExternalCenter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5n2jiy/looking_for_summer_internships_am_i_underqualified/,"I'm a junior math major at Berkeley. My original plan was grad school in math but I'm realizing I'm not cut out for that and that I'd like to try to get into software engineering. My background:

* Some relevant coursework: Discrete Math, Intro Java, Computer Modelling in Matlab (Monte Carlo methods, numerical methods), I'm taking computability theory this spring and possibly a course on data structures or aritificial intelligence (class availability isn't great, still up in the air).
* Hobby projects: Wrote a program in Python that parsed wikipedia into a graph and ran breadth-first search to find shortest click path between articles (won a prize for it), worked through NAND to Tetris, wrote a Pong game for an Arduino that displayed to a little LCD
* Some relevant work projects: Designed and created an interim inventory management system with Excel and SQL, did some CMS work on our e-commerce back end and a (very) small amount of javascript to automate some tedious tasks. It was also technically a management position so I can check the leadership box

I know I'm really far from the ideal candidate but I'm hoping my location (the Bay Area) and the reputation of Berkeley should make up for it and at least get me an internship somewhere as I'm going to need experience to compensate for the lack of a CS degree.. My GPA is okay but not great (~3.6). I've applied to around 10 or so places and got firm 'no's from all of them. I realize it's a numbers game but I'd really like to be realistic and not waste my time if it's not going to happen this summer. If anyone has advice on how to go about this or just an honest assessment of my chances here I'd really appreciate it."

Let me start this off with I'm a good person. I graduated college last Spring with a Computer Science Degree, started working the very next day. I make just under six figures, I'm a good person, and love her very much, and _was_ planning on proposing a few weeks ago.


Her family is what's stopping me. Not just her parents, but her entire extended family.


We've been together for 4 years so I am well acquainted with her family. They all loved me until about a year ago. At this time I was working an internship that made enough money to live on and had the job I have now lined up. I was making enough money to support myself and her and decided to buy a nice house halfway between the school and where I would be working (About 15 minutes to the school, about 25 to my job). I asked her to move in with me, she said yes, everything was hunky dory. Her parents were OK with it and were happy we were taking the next step in our relationship, but then at a extended family reunion I was invited to come along with a few weeks later, everything went bad. Apparently her uber-conservative extended family (her family is sorta conservative, but pretty chill) caught wind that she moved in with me, and her family knew that we were having sex (safely) for a while, but her extended family didn't, which they didn't really need to.


Her Uncle comes up to me during the family event and sucker punches me right in the jaw. And screams at me for corrupting his innocent neice. Somehow he found out that she was moving in and she wasnt a virgin. If my girlfriend wasnt there to stop me I would have dropped this guy. At first her whole family was apalled at her Uncle until he announced to the whole family (~35 people) that I was forcing my girlfriend to have sex with me, and made her move into my ""shitty crack-house"". Note: The house would not in any way resemble a crack house. It's a little small, but rather nice. Again I was about to drop this guy. Her whole family suddenly turns against me, until her brother (who is the ONLY person who doesnt hate my guts right now) steps up and tells her uncle to simmer down and that's not what's going on. They all give me stink eye for the rest of the event, but I figured everything would be OK.


I was wrong



Her Uncle has been spreading around nasty rumors about me, even faked a text message conversation from my girlfriend having her saying that she was unhappy, and she needed to get out. I have no idea why he is doing this, but he has done a wonderful job of turning everyone except her brother against me. I dealt with it she was pretty pissed. Then he started taking potshots at me, spreading around that I cheated my way through college and faked going to work everyday, and I wasn't actually working in Computers at all, he said because of this I couldn't provide for her and the family should make us break up. Up until this her parents were still fine with me. At thhis time she hadn't found a job in her field, and was working at a local cafe to keep busy, I told her she didn't have to since I make more than enough to keep up above water in a relatively cheap area to live. Apparently these statements made her Dad do some digging, and he couldn't find me working at any notable company around the area. That was expected, I work in cyber security, and under a lot of legal shit so my name isn't out there. He calls bullshit and that turns him and her mother against me.  


This has been going on for almost a year now. Her parents refuse to acknowledge my existence and want to ask her father if I can marry her, but her whole family hates me and for only what I can assume is that we had sex while in college, and she lives with me. Her Uncle has convinced her whole family that I'm basically taking her hostage in my ""crack-house"". Her brother is the only one that likes me (we're actually pretty close) much less doesnt want me to die.


What are my options. Breaking up with her isn't one, she's the love of my life, but her family is very important to her as well.



**tl:dr** Girlfriend (whom I want to marry)'s family hates my guts. How to deal."

As title says, I'm a poor student who needs a car for his new internship. Im used to drive all kind of wrecks, but didn't own a cat in a year now. I would usually call my mechanic to check the car, but he's on vacation. 

So here's the deal, this guy I found on craiglist is selling an old 98 nissan Altima for 400$ CAD with 168000kilos in it (105000 miles or so).
Keep in mind the car only needs to get me to work for 4 months, then it's going to the scrap yard where they'll give me its cash worth in rusted metal.
So really, I don't care if the ac/cd player/electrical doesnt work, idc if it the body is rusted (as long as ""safe""),  all I need is a ""reliable"" ride for the next 4 months. 

So what I wanna check is any indicator that the trans/engine/any other vital component might go bad in the next 4 months of daily commute.

I'm gonna go check it tomorrow night, drive it for half an hour or so on and off highway, but its really the first time I buy a car that I really don' need for long, so help me out reddit, tell me what to look for! :)"

I found a nice position that plenty of other students who had worked there said was a fantastic company to work for. 

So after buying my first suit, interviewing with them here at school, and then driving to their location 3 hours away for a second interview, I found out I got the internship! I was excited, especially since I had heard it was a competitive position that offered great pay(at least in my college student eyes). 

I filled out there online application, and signed a digital signature thinking everything was good to go. Then, for a month...silence. I thought it was odd I didn't hear back from them, and I was going to send an email, making sure everything was fine. Before I did though, a generic email came saying they had reviewed many candidates, and had decided to go with some else. 

Obviously, I was confused and assumed I had to have read the previous emails wrong, and that I thought I had gotten the position when I actually hadn't. To be sure, I had a couple of friends read over the earlier correspondence emails with me. 

I had indeed gotten the position but, what I had thought was just a brief synopsis/summary describing benefits/pay of the position (that was attached to the email with the link to the online application) was actually a letter that I was supposed to hand sign, and mail in confirming my acceptance of the position. The only thing that made that clear was the very last line of it saying to do so. (I know what you are thinking, ""You should have read all of it carefully!"", and you are correct, but it honestly wasn't obvious at all, and In my excitement I didn't notice.)

Now, I am sitting here very frustrated, but I am going to make it into a learning experience as best I can. 

TL;DR: Didn't confirm with company that I wanted an internship position. Shockingly(/s), I did not get it. "
5n31kw,205,2017-01-09,"When ""security concerns"" leave users out to dry.",beyondinsanity,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5n31kw/when_security_concerns_leave_users_out_to_dry/,"Hey tfts! It's been a while since I posted here. I have recently been hired by a very popular entertainment/software company on the west coast as a desktop technician; I have already been working there as an intern. It's very exciting to be working with an IT department that strives to use new technologies wherever possible and constantly evaluates its processes to determine where more effectiveness can be had. However, not all of these evaluations could possibly be effective...

This morning I had enough time to clock in and picture the warm cup of coffee that I was about to acquire and consume before a frantic $user1 approached me. She had left for maternity leave months ago and returned to find that Windows lost its trust relationship with the domain. Easy enough, I just needed to have her log in with cached credentials and I could rebind it from there.

But wait, why don't I log in with our local administrator account included with our images? Last year, our local admin account was deactivated on every machine due to ""security concerns"". After the resulting uproar from the technicians had settled, a new system was put in place that reactivated the local admin account and gave it a randomly generated password. This password is different for every machine and is regenerated periodically or when a machine rebinds to the domain. Of course, if a machine was online when the account was deactivated but not when it was reactivated, there is no way to access the local admin account at all.

Hold on, *users* have local admin rights on their machines? Yes, across the entire company. This is surprisingly one of the least problematic policies we follow. Looking up the randomly generated passwords for the local admin accounts takes more time than us techs would like to spend on a domain rebinding, so 99% of the time we'll rebind on the user's account.

I followed $user1 to her desk and was greeted by a Windows login screen displaying a username different from her own. During her absence, another $user2 logged into her machine and now her cached credentials are gone.

I logged into the system that stores the randomly generated local admin passwords and was unable to locate the PC. I tried the original local admin password we used before this system existed and it didn't work. $user1's PC must have been online during deactivation and offline during reactivation.

I tried to contact $user2 only to discover that they are on an extended leave of absence and will not be around for quite some time.

At this point, our ""security measures"" have left this machine unusable. We have no way of rebinding it to the domain. I'll have to drop $user1's drives into a dock, have her copy the data to a network location, and reimage the machine.

Welcome back, $user1!"

So, if you recall, a week ago we posted mod applications. We got a tremendous amount of interest, and I spent an embarrassing amount of time poring through your applications. I read every single one, and if we modded every person that we liked we would have had about 80 new mods. Unlike certain subreddits, though, we try to retain an element of stability among our modteam ;\^). But I do want to give a very special shoutout to everyone who took their time to apply. I had some incredible conversations with you people about everyone from Amy Klobuchar to Aaron Rodgers to Young Thug, and we really do appreciate that hundreds of you took the time out of your days to try to do all you could to fight the incipient cheetocracy.

After a painstaking process, we singled out six users whose applications and the conversations that ensued really went above and beyond what I had any reason to expect. Shit, I'm a lazy college student, and these people are all individually twenty times more qualified to do this shit than I am. One of the new mods is a literal fucking rocket scientist, and I'm pretty sure they're all more qualified to be president than Donald Trump. Without further ado, here are your newest ~~CTR employees~~ r/EnoughTrumpSpam moderators, along with a little they've written about themselves.

/u/auandi

&gt;I'm a dual US/Canadian citizen, born in California but spent middle/high school in Canada and currently live in Vancouver, BC. This may sound sappy, but I've always wanted to do something the helped people. I realized early that nothing has close to the power to hurt or help like government. So I studied in Washington DC. I wanted to get into politics, get into campaigns, and so I took just about every class offered on the subject. I was preparing myself to be in campaigns, but in my various jobs and internships I worked, I only learned which areas I didn't want to do. But I graduated right at the height of '09 unemployment, and it made paid jobs all but dry up for anyone without experience. I had also been having problems with my mental state, further complicating my search for employment. Eventually my loans started coming due, and even splitting an affordable housing apartment in such an expensive city wasn't affordable any more. I had to move back in with my parents who are in Canada.

Dedicated enemy of Mango Mussolini, here to help disseminate the dangers of Trump and those faithful to him, be it citizens or government officials alike, both in this country or abroad. Let's not let our country dwindle into the insanity and bigotry of Trumpism; I don't like swamps, I do like brakes, America was already great, and my energy isn't high or low but in a comfortable range. The bigger our voice, the smaller Trump's hands become, so let us work together whilst speaking loudly in working against a man who would sell the highest, most respected seat in America to a Russian, and who would put his business interests in front of the safety and livelihood of all his citizens. Writing this just got me 60 shill credits, which I'm probably going to use to buy some pinot grigio to help me get through the next four years.

So there you go, those are your newest mods. Thanks, as always, for being an excellent community, and it's a shame we could only fit six of you on this team."

I would love to get an internship on ARM next year so I'm about to start preparing. In general, the qualifications for those internships are knowledge on ARM assembly and ARM architecture.

I have already taken a Digital Systems Design course, as well as a Computer Architecture course. Now I think I have good knowledge of digital systems, Verilog and general computer organization. I also had a microcontrollers course where we used a chip with an ARM M-core and we had some insights on the internal organization of the core, but not in much deep. 

However, my Computer Architecture class was focused on MIPS architecture and I surprised that there are not that much resources for learning ARM as there are for MIPS. I find most of the official documentation rather oriented to those who already have some knowledge of the internal organization. 

Should I be looking for other type or resources or trying to figure out those manuals?

Additionally, what type of personal projects should I highlight/do? Related to hardware, I have done a couple FPGA projects, a MIPS processor implementation, all of them were class projects. Perhaps coding a simple RTOS for a microcontroller?"

Visual Studio manages to dumb itself down so much that it crosses the event horizon of intuitive design and becomes *less* user-friendly. Visual Studio is what a programmer would make if you asked them to write a parody of commercial-grade ""enterprise"" software. Visual Studio tries to be the Fisher Price of IDE's while also offering you an airplane cockpit's worth of buttons and menus and settings and somehow it manages to fail in all of its goals in such a spectacular way that you almost wonder if they were engineered to collectively resonate into one of the most spectacular and irredeemable failures of the 21st century.

Visual Studio's features and goals are such a twisty-turny N-dimensional maze of overlapping bloatware that I can just imagine a conference room dripping with Microsoft's eukaryotic managerial algae, focusing gas expulsions through their chitinous vocal tracts, attempting to dictate the design goals of Visual Studio to an unpaid intern frantically translating from their non-Euclidian linguistic framework into something that might be doable with a budget of two paperclips and four hundred damned souls who've long since relinquished the last of their sanity and individuality to The Unspeakable Ones in the upper floors; those tortured workers incessantly and mechanically wailing cries of despair directly from the most instinctual and reptilian parts of the shattered remnants of their minds, everything else long-since digested and incorporated into the logic gates of an impossible calculus of paradox and madness; this feat of incidental mercy preventing them from comprehending the true horror of their work.

They type and cry and wail and scream and their tormented computations feed The Ones Upstairs as they converge into one mind and one consciousness. All is Microsoft. All is Enterprise. And at the topmost level something ancient and repugnant stirs. Satya Nadella awakens from his encysted slumber and opens one of his seven mouths to sing the song that ends the Earth."

I may be moving to Seattle soon late this year. I currently live in a really toxic house, and a lot of things have happened in this house that worsened my PTSD. So the best choice was for me to move. My boyfriend who now is in Vancouver, wants to me to move to Seattle since he's eventually going to move there; he's in Vancouver right now for internships and will be moving to Seattle in the future. I'm just worried because of how costly Seattle is. I currently live in Arizona and it's very affordable compared to Seattle. He thinks that Seattle would be suitable for me (I miss the cities because I used to visit and stay in Saigon, VN a lot)

But I have yet to attend college and will want to attend college if I move after I become a permanent resident of course. 

I'll be saving up to 8-10k before moving if I do move (is that enough?). I'll be moving here by myself (going to look for roommates) for a while before he does move. 

Also is Seattle motorcycle/scooter friendly? I've seen threads saying that it's doable and that they haven't had any troubles riding a motorcycle. But I'd also want to know the perspective from car drivers. Or would you recommend just using public transport? 

And are there any areas of Seattle that is a mix of a urban and suburban feel? That is somewhat affordable? I've been trying to grasp all the neighborhoods in Seattle and would still like to know more info. I have read up on the master post/thread on moving to Seattle but I still was left with some questions.

Also, I want to become a teacher so is Seattle's job market for teachers saturated just like other places? I've been getting mixed answers on this too. Thank you.

I haven't interviewed in a couple years, and when I did interview previously I didn't do much of it. Got an offer from an internship that I had out here. Got my BS CS and MS CS from a top ranked CS school. Have done well at my current job and have a good resume.

I've been cranking on leetcode for awhile now. I'm up to 170 problems solved where I wrote the solution myself and about another 50ish where I reviewed the problem and was confident I knew how to solve it but didn't write the code. I've gotten to the point where I feel confident about being able to solve easy and medium problems during interviews.  I've also done review for other types of questions besides algorithm ones.

However, I am a lot less confident about hard problems on leetcode. I'd say I feel confident about only a third of the ones I see. The rest I struggle with and make some progress, but I will often either take way too long solving it or have to look at the solution. How often do people see hard problems during interviews and how well do you have to do on them? Should I be prepping more?

I'm planning to do interviews in waves so that if the first wave goes too poorly I can take more time off to practice, but it is a bit punishing to be working my job and then going home to solve problems on leetcode then spending the weekend solving problems on leetcode.

Some of the companies that I will be interviewing at: airbnb, google, facebook, uber, linkedin, yelp, stripe, twilio, dropbox (for people who have interviewed at these places and have a general idea)."

I just had the best day of work in my life, in which eight and a half hours absolutely flew by and I was so intensely absorbed with what I was doing.

Also thank you in advance for any replies.

About 1.5 years ago my friend asked me if I could take this girl ""Miranda"" to her sorority formal because she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. My friend gave me about 1 day notice and only showed me one picture of her. I'm kind of shy and didn't want to go out on what was pretty much a blind date. I declined but when I met Miranda I was immediately kicking myself for not taking the chance.

As time went on our friend groups became quite close so she was around all the time. The more I hung out with her the more I liked her. One night while we were all hanging out at my house I decided it was finally time a make a move. We had been drinking a little bit so that definitely made it easier. We ended up making out for most of the night and she ended up staying over but nothing sexual happened. The next couple of days we talked constantly and decided to hang out just the two of us. The first time this ever happened. I went over to her house and stayed the night but once again just some making out and talking. After that she didn't seem as interested in me and two weeks later I found out that she rekindled things with her ex(different one from before). I knew that nothing else was going to happen but I would still see her almost every weekend because of our friend group which was a little awkward for me.

The next summer she moved across the country for an internship. This made it pretty easy to get over her because I didn't have to see her constantly. During that summer I began talking other girls but nothing panned out. At the end of the summer she moved back and she started hanging out with my friends and I a lot. At this point I started to gain feelings again. She would talk about how she tried to find a SO during the summer but it didn't work out. Seeing this as my best opportunity, I asked her out. Her response was something along the lines of ""I would but I'm trying to figure some things out and I don't want our friendship to change"". It seemed like she was just trying to be nice letting me down and shortly after she rekindled things with her ex again.

Fast forward to this New Years and she texted me to see what I'm doing. She is still my friend so I invited her to the party I was going to and we hung out most of the night. Then this weekend she texted me again to see what my plans are. Some friends and I were going to a concert so I invited her. Before the concert we were all drinking and getting ready. At some point it's just the two of us talking and she kissed me. This caught me completely off guard because of past experiences with her. While at the concert we danced with each other the entire time. Yesterday night she asked me if she could come over and watch a TV show because she doesn't have cable. Of course, I said yes. At first we were just sitting around on my couch just hanging out. Then she decides that she wants to cuddle up with me. Her show ends but she stays around for a couple more hours. At this point I want to make a move but at the same time I don't to keep making the same mistake. In the end I don't do anything and she left because we were both falling asleep.

I've been overthinking this all day and at this point I don't know what to do. Should I distance myself again? Should I just throw away my pride and take one more chance? Do I need to set some boundaries between us? There is definitely a better way to handle this but I feel like I can't make the right decision and need some help going forward.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I've had a crush on this girl in my friend group for a long time. She is always around so it is hard to get over her. I've asked her out and she turned me down. Lately she seems more into me but I don't want to make the same mistakes and I don't want our friendship/friend group to change. What the fuck should I do?"
5n3xce,1,2017-01-10,"A month ago I got the copper IUD inserted, I'm having weird discharge, some spotting, and my period might be late?",thehammerismypen15,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5n3xce/a_month_ago_i_got_the_copper_iud_inserted_im/,"Hi TwoX,

This might get gross because of the way I talk about bodily fluids, sorry in advance.

I'm 20, American, and just about to graduate college. A month ago I got the Paraguard inserted after being on the pill (Aubra) for about 5 months. The pill was working fine for me, but taking it was sometimes complicated, like if I spent the night at my boyfriend's unexpectedly or was back home with my parents (who don't/can't know I'm on BC due to religious reasons). Plus, given the political climate here, I wanted to get secure and long lasting birth control. I have a history, both personal and family, of manic depression and bipolar disorder, and when I've gone on progesterone-only BC in the past (Depo) those symptoms have gotten worse, so I decided that Paraguard was the best fit for me. It hurt like hell going in, and I bled for about a week after (it was time for my period + insertion trauma, I guess), but since then it's been great! Only mild cramping and spotting.

The thing is, it's been about 40 days since the start of my last period and I've had this weird, mucus discharge ever since I got the IUD inserted. When my boyfriend and I were having sex regularly I assumed it was semen leaking out (gross, I know - sorry about that), but we haven't seen each other for almost a month because of the holidays + work related travel on his part, and I still have the discharge. Sometimes it's clear and like egg white, sometimes it's kinda brown or pink like period blood, and sometimes it's green, like snot (sorry again). I've had cramps intermittently for the past week but no period, just this weird junk coming out of me.

My cycle usually ran long before I went on the pill (like 35 days). What actually prompted me to start the pill was that over the summer, I didn't get a period for 3 months. I took at home pregnancy tests when I was 1-2 months late and they all came back negative, and obviously once I started the pill things got back to normal after a few weeks. I was working a stressful internship, living in a new house with new roommates, and going through some relationship issues (my bf and I actually ended up breaking up right after I started the pill, and getting back together about 3 months later).

As far as sex without condoms goes, my boyfriend and I had it once about 48 hours before I went in to have the procedure (when I was still regularly taking the pill), and continued to have it regularly after my period ended post-insertion. Probably once every 2-3 nights for about 2 weeks until we both left to go be with our families for the holidays. I was pretty good about taking the pill - I think I accidentally skipped a day maybe twice, before he and I got back together (I wasn't having sex with anyone then), and it was the kind of thing where I forgot to take it before I went to sleep like I usually did and took it first thing when I woke up. More often I'd be a few hours off from when I took it the night before, depending on when I was going to bed that night, which I've read isn't a problem with mixed-hormone pills. Once I was sexually active again, we used condoms as well until the one time two days before I got the IUD. I know that the Paraguard can be used as emergency contraception that's even more reliable than Plan B if inserted within a few days of intercourse (one source even said up to 5 days), so even if my hormonal BC failed I figured we'd be protected due to the insertion. When I told the nurse at Planned Parenthood about the last time we'd had sex, she confirmed that we were being safe and not at an increased risk for pregnancy. And my blood test came back negative (even though at that point it'd be too soon to tell, I know).

So, tl;dr: I got the IUD inserted a month(ish) ago, my boyfriend and I never had unprotected sex, and despite this my period is kind of late and I have weird mucus-y discharge. I just (as in 20 min ago) checked my IUD strings and it's definitely still there. I know switching birth control methods and IUD insertions especially can jack up your cycle for a while, and I don't think I could be pregnant, but I'm also young, paranoid, and wildly unprepared in every sense to deal with a pregnancy. As soon as I get back to school I'm booking an appointment with Planned Parenthood to get things checked out (apparently you need to do this anyways when you're a month out from the insertion), but in the meantime I figured I'd ask here anyways and see if anyone had any advice or experience. Thanks y'all. &lt;3"

Just recently, I started getting super paranoid about not being good enough and not getting the offer. I know imposter syndrome is a thing and I'm probably going to be okay, but I'm still uneasy about it. This is going to be my first internship, the first time I write code for an actual company instead of school or personal projects, and I'm going to be using a language that I'm unfamiliar with. I know that the employer knows all of this and I'm going to learn a lot and probably be fine, but I want to make sure, especially since they're paying me a lot and I don't want to be useless. Any tips on how to make sure I succeed at my internship and get the return offer? Thanks"

I will also be taking intermediate accounting 1 and tax 1 tomorrow.   I was hoping to get some advice on a few things.

1.  The last accounting class i took was a year and a half ago, i had to make up some credits when i transferred colleges and wanted my accounting classes near the end of my education.  I took intro to financial accounting and intro to managerial account.  I have spent some time going over financial accounting again but its alot of material, how much of this will i need to remember for tax and intermediate accounting?

2.  How much knowledge does a internship expect you too have?  

3.  By the time i graduate i will have around 150 credits, does that mean getting a Macc would be useless?

4.  Is the CPA exam just all the material i learn in my college accounting classes, or is it all new material?  Also when can i start studying for the CPA?

Sorry for all the questions, I wanted to get serious about my future and needed some guidance.  Thank you in advance!"

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut/friends/online. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy.

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere and face fucking seeing what would happen to me. While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Message me on here or ask for my email

ANYTHING?!,CallMeShiibbyy,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5n4kiz/data_web_app_launched_but_struggling_to_gain/,"Hello all! I come to you today on behalf of a company I am working with that works on internal projects that aim to solve real issues within the world. We are pretty new to this (one year old) and, whilst we have helped others build their products (so we can fund our own) we have never needed to help after the product is built, except for updates or maintenance.

Anyway. Our First product is [Conseris.io](http://conseris.io/). It is a data collection/analysing tool that can be used in a variety of ways by a  variety of companies/people.

It allows users to do everything needed from create input forms/fields, collect the data (or import data) view and analyse data using a large variety of algorithms then even take this data and construct it in a way to present to others.

You can collaborate in real time with any size team, it is free (for basic uses) and cheap compared to competitors (who most seem to be stuck in the early 2000s). 

The ideal situation we see this would be hugely beneficial of when a disaster strikes. It would allow a team to use ipads, laptops or mobiles to go into the field, collect data on injuries, issues in the area, etc. Then real time send this back to HQ and they can quickly analyse and discover pain points and figure a solution.

We are also looking to incorporate a marketplace which will allows those who have the means to collect data easily are able to sell (or share for free, in some cases) their data to those who dont have access. A good example of this is, a local study could be under-taken to gather shopping habits of shoppers within certain stores. This could then be sold to small clothing stores that dont have the money to conduct their own research but still want to see what is trending right now, what their shoppers want, age range, etc etc.

Really, there is no limit to how this can currently be used, and we only hope to expand it further.

So, here is my question. How the heck do we get those first few thousand people to try out our service? We have a small team designers and developers as well as marketing interns and an SEO guy. But still we are a little stuck.

Currently, we have;
- Basic social media presence (but finding trouble building/engaging an audience)
- Blog posts about uses of Conseris etc
- Looking for local places to talk/mingle with data scientists.
- Re-building our website to be more focused on what we do, at the moment it is not very clear.

Any tips/advice on how we could get this app in front of the right people? 

Any questions are welcome, hopefully I can go back to the team with a bunch of suggestions and we cant try everything."

About two weeks ago, my battery was empty and my laptop crashed. When restarting it my display didn`t work any more. I thought that my display / display cable broke (i had reordered a display a week before due to stripes on my lcd caused by dumb cleaning).

After the new display didnt work I noticed that one cable of the intern display connection broke:

so I ordered a new intern display connection :D

After installing it, it didnt work too and I observed, that I can connect and work via an external monitor problemless, but when trying to ""duplicate"" the laptop screen to the monitor it stays black, as the display does...

What do you recommend? :)

Best regards!

5n55hs,1,2017-01-10,I got humiliatingly dumped by my ex-friends because of my depression.,rmahran,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5n55hs/i_got_humiliatingly_dumped_by_my_exfriends/,"I'm trying to process this, because it's been 5 days ago, and I'm still in physical pain. My chest hurts and I cry all the time. I'm supposed to be working. 

When my friends and I first met, we were all in architecture school. I was in a fairly good place, if broke every now and again, and the status quo was; pay for my lunch now, I'll cover you later on. I taught myself to use anxiety to be funny and comical, and I made the laugh. Every time. I listened with an open mind whenever they'd confide in me. 

I noticed that they would always go to the same few places; the same coffee shops. We'd be so proud of being the 'outcasts from high school' who helps everyone, but we're the only ones who understand each other. Some of our friends who were genuinely smart and creative didn't hang out with us as often. 

But slowly, right around the time I started smoking and my senior project started, I could feel one of them (we'll call her Anus bc I'm angry) become more distant from me. As the stress got to me, I could feel it; they grew more distant. 

At the aftermath of my senior project, I hated it. I hated myself. I tried to explain it to my mom and she yelled at me, placing the regret I have for it to this day. 

This inner regret showed up in drinking with them...TOO much. I wanted to be the 'fun drunk' just to be the funny person I once was. I embarrassed myself and everyone around me for 'yelling a bit loud', and I never forgave myself for it. Even typing this now makes me want to die. 

I've tried to amend this, to ask them if they're okay to hang out with me; I even went drinking with them again in the future, and I did relatively okay. This is a common thing; I made mistakes, I fell sick during their senior showcase day (they're a year below mine), and every time I tried to make it up to them. I showed up to their graduation ceremony, I apoligized, I tried to reach out to them and explain that I wasn't myself lately. I don't think they ever forgave me.

So early 2016, I sort of tried to get the actual hang of it; I added to my portfolios, and I tried to get a job, and they know that I am, I even got sympathy from a friend (we'll call him Snorlax because fuck it, I'm mad). While they were working on their senior showcases, I felt the incredible pressure of finding a job. I wanted to be empowered enough to have a car, an apartment, a job and money to do for them what they did for me. 

Over this time, one of our friends (who actually helped me find a chance at a job, btw) went to the United States and came back in a rough position; all they did was make fun of his newly-found, frantic ideas: I genuinely empathized with him because he might have gone through something, but they were like, ""Nah bruh we're just letting off some steam lmao let it go"". Another person we knew who was socially maladjusted, meek, and maybe came across as creepy, was (verbally) given the business about how no one likes him and he needs to stop being weird. Like an idiot, I empathized with these people. I don't know how I didn't see it coming with the way they were acting. 

For the record, this was when Anus left. This would have been in August 2016. 

After my dad yelled at me for no reason, I shut him out, and ever since then, I've had the thought, ""I can no longer live like this. I'm not going to make it to my 25th birthday"". I've been running on the thought that I'll stay for my friends. I got my driver's license, I got excellent marks on a certificate I was studying for, and I got an internship. 

Throughout this, I confided in one friend (we'll call him Fuckass) that I was feeling suicidal, maybe twice. Fuckass confided in me that he was feeling just the same way, and I listened to him about his difficult past with his abusive father...and I listened. Openly. 

I've started giving myself a second chance: I recently took software courses in order to get an actual certificate. I even enrolled in a Short Course for a modelling software in a small institute in the part of our city called ""Knowledge Village"". One of the friends I was hanging out with was like, ""BAH, what does it matter? [institute name] is just like an office, they're a bunch of fakes!"" 

They were so content to blame everything in their lives on AUD, and keep insisting this city is terrible and the education they got was absolute ass. My dad held me back from going to Canada, so I was stuck here. **I** have to cope with this negativity you've been flinging around this echo chamber for 5 years. Excuse me for being pessimistic, though. 

Anyway...Anus finally came back from LA. They asked me to come for coffee...and then began one of the worst nights of my life. 

They mentioned nothing but my flaws and mistakes. They accused me of being negative. They called my presence ominous, and nothing I did was redeemable to them. They dressed it as this, ""we're here to give you a life lesson"" but they exposed every flaw, and failed to mention any reasonable explanation or ways I've genuinely tried to fight it off. 

This is after Anus hasn't even tried to talk to me or reach out in years, even while I was CLEARLY struggling. 

They pointed out how I don't reach out to them, but complain about how I spam the group chat like I'm 'talking to myself'. They pointed out that me failing to add someone in a group chat resulted in a fight, but failed to mention that they were a gay couple and, being a bunch of Middle Easterners in the Middle East, I needed to screen homophobes. All she had to do was say, ""[this friend] is not a homophobe. She's fine, let her in."" 

They shot so many contradictions and stupid excuses at me; the times they had to pay for my meals (failing to mention when I'd pay them back), my 'obsession' with YouTubers (even though they showed me a few), they'd take mistakes and ADHD symptoms and paint it like actual malice. 

The thing that killed me the most was the realization that, when they said that 'look we all have our own problems, but go work on yourself'; I knew Fuckass told them. I knew he told them like, ""omg she's so negative tell her to shut up"", and I was...I was vulnerable then. I had a vulnerable, painful part of me exposed and they stuck their daggers in it and twisted it. 

I believed them. I told them I was so sorry, and that I was proud of them, and I was ashamed of myself...not a single drop of empathy in one of them. 

I don't want them back. I don't know why they convinced me so much that the world is shitty, and Dubai sucks, and they have the shitting actual gall to convey it to me like they're enlightened because Anus has been to LA and had a relevation. I don't know why I let them make me feel like the mistakes I made and the cries of help and me being in need was reason for them being **superior** to me.

They have the nerve to tell me that anyone who does better than them were ""saints"". 

They emotionally manipulated me so successfully that, to this day, I feel like **I** fucked up somewhere. They held all this back from me; rather than doing this to clear the air, they did it to take me when I'm vulnerable and beat the shit out of me (psychologically).

I now have chest pains. I can't sleep properly. I don't know if I'll be worth having friends anymore. I could find DIFFERENT, BETTER, MORE INTERESTING people to hang out with and socialize, and I have a few places booked, but like...

My chest hurts. I can't breathe normally. I'm shaking. I just want some peace. 

I want to know that, despite my flaws and shortcomings, I am worth sticking with through thick and thin. I am worth finding people who love me and appreciate me, and share my interests and hobbies, and do more than just moan about Architecture studio for the 4938th time and shrug anything creative I do off and treat me like absolute SHIT. 

I need someone to tell me that they'll be there for me. I'm not okay. "
5n5abh,37,2017-01-10,What are your favorite TV episodes of 2016?,[deleted],television,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5n5abh/what_are_your_favorite_tv_episodes_of_2016/,"I've seen many top TV shows of 2016 posts, but are there no love for the episodes that made those shows feel special. Well obviously a list like that would be very opinionated, there were plenty of good TV ~~this~~ last year which means there were even more standout episodes to choose from.

**My Top 10 TV Episodes of 2016:** (ranked in favorable order)

10) **Bojack Horseman** (S03E04) [Fish Out the Water](#s ""Being a bit similar to the Spongebob Squarepants episode ‘Rock Bottom’, “Fish out the Water” is an ingenious and unique amalgamation of Lost in Translation. Bojack visits travels to the ‘world under the sea’, but being a mammal himself, he has to wear headgear that deprives him of speech (…or so he thinks). There is only brief dialogue in the beginning and the rest of it is silent but for the warbles of underwater speech and a distinctly different soundtrack than usual – ambient synths and smooth electronic timbres complement the beautiful, vibrant visuals of the underwater city. BoJack Horseman has always been a show where the creators have a lot of fun with the whole concept of a world where intelligent animals coexist with humans, and it was very interesting to see how the sea animals are living in this very unique episode."")

9) **Fleabag** (S01E06) - [untitled](#s ""While ‘Fleabag’ didn’t seem like nothing much at first. Episode 6 proved that Fleabag’s dark, bleaky attributes were well hidden by some creative, crude humor in the first 5 episodes. So some might say Episode 6 of this BBC Three was a plot twist in it’s entirety. It was a very sad emotional episode based on a hidden mess up no one even thought to make notice of in the previous episodes of the season. It was very heart-wrenching to be hit with the reality that our main character Fleabag (as she’s referred in the credits) was not as innocent as we thought she was."")

8) **You're the Worst** (S03E05) [Twenty-Two](#s ""Edgar’s PTSD has been a part of the narrative of You’re the Worst since the very first episode, but until now, it has only been briefly referenced to while the focus has mostly been on Jimmy and Gretchen. Well ‘Twenty-Two’ went a slightly different direction and gave us an Edgar-centric episode. Before this episode you know Edgar is in pain, but you kind of brush it off since you only get to see bits and pieces of it. You don’t see the shaking, you don’t see the paranoia, all you see is a guy who seems a bit fucked up but seems to be generally ok even though he’s pretty fucking far from ok. This episode’s depiction of PTSD was very factual and hard-hitting. One of the more impressive aspects of this episode is how they changed the perceptive from Jimmy and Gretchen, as they both came off as big assholes while watching the show from point-of-view. For a show that usually relies on the antics of its two highly unlikable protagonists to generate laughter, ‘Twenty-Two’ might seem like a big leap. All in all, ‘Twenty-Two’ didn’t feature the kind of humor and laugh-out-loud moments usually found from You’re the Worst and brings to the table something much more serious in a very subtle, yet powerful manner."")

7) **Girls** (S05E06) [The Panic in Central Park](#s ""“The Panic in Central Park” is unlike any other in the Girls series. The title pays homage to the seminal heroin movie with Al Pacino, ‘Panic In Needle Park’. It’s like a beautiful fever dream that you know from the very beginning is going to turn out badly. But you can’t help but hope it won’t. The episode focuses on the character ‘Marnie’ as she reunites with her former lover Charlie. They went off on a unexpected wild and adventurous night, but when the sun rose many truth came to light which lead Marnie into making some big decisions in her life. For a show that (in my opinion) didn’t get off to a good start, this episode just goes to show how much Girls have grown over the past 2 seasons. This was a very well written and well directed episode."") 

6) **Atlanta** (S01E08) [The Club](#s ""One thing to appreciate about Atlanta is how it tackles certain aspects about hip-hop. It pulls the veil back on would-be rap stars, showing us what’s often depicted as the life isn’t always as it’s made out to be, but it does so without feeling preachy, hollow, or stereotypical. In what I believe is the best episode of Atlanta thus far, Earn, Paper Boi, and Darius gets booked for an appearance at the Primal Night Club, and they showed us how frustrating and infuriating the club can be for rappers and their managers. From promoters not willingly wanting to pay up, to rappers not getting the love and respect they think they deserve, this Atlanta episode was as real as they come. The entire episode was very funny, entertaining and fulfilling, which of course also features what Atlanta is already recognized for, hilarious bits. Notably the hilarious, unexpected payoff to the running gag about the invisible car."") 

5) **Game of Thrones** (S06E09) [Battle of the Bastards](#s ""Game of Thrones is known for its strong 9th episodes on almost every season. Season 6 is no different with “Battle of the Bastards”. This one hour television episode truly felt like a massive budget blockbuster movie. This episode gives Game of Thrones fans almost one hour spectacle filled with action. However, the action is paced superbly with absolutely wonderfully acted and written dialogue. The episode involves many great changes, twists and turns. But overall the directing was what made it so good. Episode director Miguel Sapochnik (also known for his another masterpiece episode “Hardhome”) proves himself to be once and for all one of the greatest talents in the television and movie industry today. The action coordination combined with the great camera angles make some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen in television."")

4) **Red Oaks** (S02E01) [Paris](#s ""'Come find me in Paris'. Those were the last words Skye said to David in the season finale of the fantastic first season of Red Oaks. And to my surprise, David actually went to Paris to see the carefree fashionista and self-titled artist he fell in love with in the Red Oaks Country Club, New Jersey. Paris is the land of the romantic films and couples. When the setting is Paris, you know it is all about romance. And that’s exactly what this Red Oaks premiere did as the entire episode was set and filmed in Paris. “Paris” finds our young lovebirds reuniting. Things do get complicated for Skye and David, as it does for most TV couples, but it’s nice that we get to have this moment where we see them fall in love and at a really positive, high moment in their relationship. But there’s also some mild conflict as Skye’s parents unexpectedly appears in Paris to visit her. The 80’s soundtrack complimented the episodes dreamy, artistic tone. And I was quite surprised at how much of 80’s French art and life culture was explored within this 25 minute episode. The episode was quite beautiful, and I very much appreciate the efforts made by Amazon and the show runners to shoot this episode in Paris."") [This video say it all honestly](https://streamable.com/qxeh2)

3) **Black Mirror** [Shut Up and Dance](#s ""This is definitely the most bleak episode of the new Black Mirror season, and also it’s most suspenseful. The episode follows Keeny, whose private life soon erupted when he gets hacked and filmed masturbating through his webcam, then gets a series of threatening text messages from an anonymous sender telling him to do exactly as “they” say or the footage will leak to everyone he knows. The episode flows well from start to finish, nothing feels rushed or dragged out, everything given a natural time to breathe. The episode also had some well built tension. “Shut Up and Dance” does not carry an overt message like so many of these other episodes, which made it a bit more refreshing, and able to focus purely on the self-contained story alone. As such, it has one of the best twists in the entire season when we discovered our focus character Kenny, might not be as innocent as we had hoped."")

2) **The Girlfriend Experience** (S01E09) [Blindsided](#s ""Blindsided is definitely one of the most intense and nerve-racking episode of 2016. The slow, bleak build-up then the fallout to this episode where our main character’s world collides, to the point where she has to make swift decisions was incredibly well written. After watching the first 8 episodes of this limited series, with it’s emptiness and slow paced storytelling, this nightmare scenario for Christine was something none of us saw coming. This episode definitely transformed The Girlfriend Experience from an average sex show into a psychological thriller. But it also has a bit mystery to it. After emails of Christine’s sex tape was leaked to all her family and friends, one would have to wonder how our main suspect ‘Jack’ got access to her personal info. Not to mention the video camera was pointing directly at Christine….could she have made the video and sent it herself? Or probably she only meant to sent it to her internship boss ‘David’, – who she’s been deceivingly manipulating for a job at the firm – and accidentally sent it to all her contacts? We have to ask our self these questions as the mystery in “Blindsided” sprung much deeper than we expected it it. Even the main character Christine is quite a mystery her self. It’s really hard to tell what’s going on in her head at times, but there’s no doubt about it she’s bold and ambitious."")

1) **Black Mirror** [San Junipero](#s ""The build-up before you truly understand what San Junipero is makes for an engaging mystery, and the twists and turns as you realize the true stories behind the residents, and the two women in particular is heart-wrenching. But what sets the episode apart from the rest of Black Mirror’s third season is the way it beautifully balances character revelations with plot and setting revelations. Though the episode, like the others in series 3 of Black Mirror, is over an hour, the pacing is incredible and the episode accomplished all it needed to with its limited time. It’s a love story, after all, one of the very oldest sorts of stories, and it mostly leaves viewers wondering if these two crazy kids will work through their differences and get together. But it’s also complicated, a tale of second chances that behaves like a story of first love.
Every element of San Junipero felt like a strong point. The production Values, the writing, the lighting and especially the music. I’ve known the song “Heaven is a place on Earth” for so long and I’ve never seen it used in any other films or TV the way it was used in this episode. It almost like the episode was inspired by the song and it brought much needed emotion to the ending of the episode. Maybe I’m just a sucker for good endings? But this was one of the best endings for any Black Mirror episode I’ve ever seen. The love story between two old, dying women, living out a “perfect” life in their younger bodies is phenomenal, and features best-in-series performances from both Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis. When it’s all said and done ‘San Junipero’ is one of the greates hours of televson i’ve ever seen. I think this is most definitely one of Black Mirror’s best episode (if not the best), and easily the best TV episode of 2016."")

I own a Lenovo W530 (Machine Type 2438).

After installing Windows 10 the Lenovo Solution Center recommended a battery update, which I did, but didnt work. Since that I had some problems with my BIOS, but they stopped (re-enter date) .

About two weeks ago, my battery was empty and my laptop crashed. When restarting it my display didn`t work any more. I thought that my display / display cable broke (i had reordered a display a week before due to stripes on my lcd caused by dumb cleaning).

After the new display didnt work I noticed that one cable of the intern display connection broke:

so I ordered a new intern display connection :D

After installing it, it didnt work too and I observed, that I can connect and work via an external monitor problemless, but when trying to ""duplicate"" the laptop screen to the monitor it stays black, as the display does...

What do you recommend? :)

Best regards!

A bit about me. I'm female, 20 years old. I attend university. I have a boyfriend. By all accounts, you'd think I was the stereotypical pretty party girl. I always try and be the happiest person in the room. But inside, I think I'm broken. I'm a horrible, selfish human being - I don't think I even deserve to be alive.

It all started when I fell in love with my boyfriend's friend, two years ago. He's such a cool guy, and he makes me happy to talk to. But at the same time, it's so bittersweet. We'll be leaving university in June, so I'll probably never see him again. He'd never like me like that anyway. Plus just his existence makes me feel like shit, because what kind of god awful human being falls in love with their partner's friend? Me, that's who.

Wait - it gets better. I'm so god damn awful that I can't even break up with my amazing, loving boyfriend, because my only 'friends' are all his friends. And if we broke up, and if I was forced to sit for days by myself and actually examine my life, I don't think I'd last the month. I don't think I'll last the year, to be honest. 

Everyone looks at me and says, 'Oh, you don't need to worry - you'll be successful no matter what you do!' Will I? I've been rejected from every graduate scheme, every internship I applied. Endless tears, endless rejection emails. How am I meant to get a job with no experience, no connections? How am I meant to get experience when I can't even get any damn experience?! I look at my friends, with their secured jobs and great internships and I weep for the failure I've become. It wasn't meant to be like this. My future was supposed to be bright. That's what they told me.

Even this post is awful. And you know what? I sound like a whiny, ungrateful little slut because that's what I am. I went to the funeral of an elderly relative recently, and someone worried that not enough people would turn up. In the end, about 60 did - but if I died, I'm pretty sure I could count on both hands the number of people that would attend and it wouldn't even reach 10. 

I am not religious, but I pray every night for some kind of help. Any help. I pray that I won't go to hell when I finally die. I try and fail, and I try and I fail, and I know I should carry on trying but sometimes it is so damn hard, and I pray again that maybe next time I could be stronger, I could stop being so damn weak. 

If nothing else happens to change my mind, I will probably kill myself a month or so before graduation by finding the tallest building in London and jumping off it. I am so empty.

There's tears pouring down my face right now. To everyone - I am sorry. I wish I knew what for.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kindness. I wish I met more people like you in my everyday life. "

On leave of absence May 2014—Nov 2016.

Despite all this I remain part of the ExCo of a programming-related Interest Group, and we frequently hold workshops and the largest student hackathons in our geographical region.

Right now I'm a little unsure and anxious about which foot to put forward to get myself going. I'm pretty late to the summer internship party too, and don't know how to position myself to explain the gap and lack of recent practice.

I'm looking for advice, both directly in respect to getting an internship, and in respect to getting my professional life back on track."

I'm a third-year information systems student and while I'm attempting to get into the industry, and I'm a little bit confused at how to pursue my goals. I'm confused because I'm not confident that a ""helpdesk intern"" will get me the right job.. If an IT student that wants to become a DBA, does that student still choose the helpdesk position, or does he/she look for a Junior DBA position? I've also seen from some posts that if a student wants to become a sysadmin or a network engineer, they also head through this process. As work in IT goes, many of us wear a number of different hats to accommodate the work we have, but how can funneling jobs in helpdesk reliably get a person a more specialized job position? 

I feel like I'm in a ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" kind of attitude right now. Helpdesk is something I'm interested in experiencing, but I previously had a software engineering internship, and I'm not sure if I can say helpdesk is on the same technical level; the experience itself is great to have, but I feel like I'm putting myself down in regards to technical experience.  

What are your thoughts on this?

I just found that both the production firewall and the backup were limited by settings in the Traffic Shaper. Why were these settings changed? According to my part time intern / assistant who is now going to be washing my car by hand every day for the next week, ""I was trying to figure out how those settings worked."" So he modified the settings on multiple new devices - 40mbps down, 4 up - while he was testing them after they came in. And did not change them back.

--------------------------------------

Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

I use pfSense firewall appliances from Netgate almost exclusively. I like to think I know pfSense pretty well but this issue has beaten me handily so far. 

One of my clients has a new 100mbps fiber circuit from Logix, a regional ISP in Texas. The fiber terminates into a Routerboard RB2011iLS-IN which converts the signal to Ethernet and passes it on to the Netgate FW-7541 firewall (which has the lastest release of pfSense on it). 

The problem is throughput performance. Using a laptop connected straight into the Routerboard device I can get about 90mbps down and 70 up. With the pfSense device in place I can only get about 40mbps down and 3.6 mpbs up. I've swapped out the FW-7541 with a (lower throughput) Netgate APU4 and get the same speeds.

I've been working on this with Logix tech support and while they're helpful and flexible nothing we've done has affected the performance. We've tried locking the speed of the Ethernet ports on both devices to 100mbps full, 100mbps half, 1000mbps full and 1000mbps half. No difference in performance. We've also tried changing ports on each of the devices, again, no performance difference. Have tried a few other things as well including putting in a 10/100 dumb switch between the two devices, again to no avail.

I have several other Logix circuits in place, all 25x25 and all connecting to pfSense firewalls. They all achieve near wireline speeds.

So... I'm looking for suggestions on what to investigate / try next. I'm more than willing to use a different pfSense appliance if that's what it takes but of course I'd prefer to reconfigure the one I have if possible or get Logix to make whatever change is needed to their device."
5n5x6n,2,2017-01-10,Need help with Elastic Stack architecture choice,techowned,elastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/elastic/comments/5n5x6n/need_help_with_elastic_stack_architecture_choice/,"Hi fellas. I am a Brazilian security analyst intern at my local university I'm trying to figure out the best way to have my ELK stack implemented. First off, I'll explain the I.T infrastructure and then I'll proceed to the question itself. 
We have 2 campuses(A and B) which are a few kilometers apart and each having  it's own cloud infrastructure. Those campuses are connected through a non redundant (and not very reliable) gigabit link.
The initial idea was to collect all the logs locally at each campus. Which translates to 2 separate Elasticsearch nodes. So we have Campus A currently set up and ingesting all logs coming from it's local network and a few off campus hosts.
The idea that lead us to this approach is that due to connectivity problems we would lose important events. You've probably noticed that the problem with this approach is that we won't be able to visualize all the data from one kibana instance.
We're currently planning how to manage the logs from Campus B.
So my question is: Is it posible to have 2 ES instances (1 master at A and 1 slave at B), while directing all my logs to one Logstash instance which sends to the master node? What happens if A and B can't communicate?

I hope that I've made my point clear enough for you guys to understand and sorry about my english in advance.
Any suggestions or tips will be greatly appreciated!
Thx :-)!

Edit: I'd like to thank everybody for their answers and providing me and my colleagues with great ideas! We've decided to take the Redis approach because of the simplicity. We're going to set up a logstash forwarder to Redis in Campus B, which will act as a queue to ourmain logstash pipeline located in Campus A. Because Redis doesn't support TLS we're going to use stunnel to encrypt the communication between Redis and Logstash. Thanks to everyone again!"
5n63dp,2,2017-01-10,"Should I negotiate a settlement, ask to pay original amount due ($3,626), or pay full debt ($4,709) to Williams &amp; Fudge (W&amp;F) in order to be able to attend a public university this semester?",boopietax,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5n63dp/should_i_negotiate_a_settlement_ask_to_pay/,"Hello,

Background: In the Spring of 2016 I received my last semester's worth of grants (TAG) which I used to pay off the semester in addition to federal loans. By the beginning of summer I received a notification letter stating that I was unqualified for TAG (because I had already received it for the maximum amount of semesters) and therefore owe the $3,626 that was granted. I was given payment options for monthly installments but at that point could not afford to pay this off.


I already had an unpaid government internship lined up that I needed for career advancement so I did that over the summer with casual work as a Babysitter and Dental Assistant - did not make enough to pay even a quarter of the debt. 


I then learned that I could not register for the Fall 2016 semester unless I pay off the $3,626. As a result the debt was sold to W&amp;F and an additional fee was charged of $1,083 - total debt now equal to $4,709.  I still cannot register for the upcoming Spring 2017 semester unless I pay the full amount since I have a hold on my account; transcripts, etc. which means I cannot transfer to another university


Current: From September (after my internship) through December 31st, I have been able to earn enough money (working as a Nanny and other odd jobs) to pay off the entire debt in full. I've read the posts on the sidebar on debt and credit, and I've also searched for comments specifically related to W&amp;F but I haven't found a situation where the student had not graduated. They have a lot of leverage and I'm unsure how to negotiate.


Need Advice: I'm not sure if I should try to negotiate a settlement as I've seen in multiple posts here or should I pay the full amount which includes the penalty fee. I feel like I can't use any hard-line tactics to negotiate as they have control over whether I can finish school.


***Note: I am not trying to get out of paying the debt but if there is any way I can negotiate to pay the original amount and not W&amp;F's fee, it would help significantly because I still have to pay for two classes around $4,000 and I don't think I'll be able to do that without the extra $1,083. 


Thank you for all your time and help!

I have quite a lot of (W) withdrawals, (U) unsatisfactories on my transcript as a result. I graduated with below 3 gpa unfortunately. 

All this has seriously affected my self-confidence in my programming abilities and I don't see much confidence in myself anymore. 

The one problem that has always persisted is that I get bored with my work very easily. I have good interest in programming but somehow, I get bored with it and can't seem to maintain the consistency of effort as I would in the beginning. 

I am simply worried about my work performance, I can't withdraw anymore. One mistake and I am out, I will be judged constantly.

5n6gct,1,2017-01-10,Where do I go from here?,cinnister,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5n6gct/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I'm 29, graduated from a non-target with a 3.44 GPA (not great, I know) with a Finance Degree. I took a job at a commercial cleaning company so I could work afternoons into nights and go to school during the day, so unfortunately I had no time for internships, groups or anything else. In my senior year, I started my own tiny cleaning company so I wouldn't have to work a full work week anymore. 

Wanting to get into FP&amp;A as an end goal, I figured getting a temp job would be a good way to make up for not having an internship in college or any experience at all, at least in the Finance world. My original plan was to look for an internship after college but so far that seems to be a long shot. 

After figuring out that I wanted to end up in FP&amp;A, and combing this sub for the past few weeks. I wanted to follow advice given to others and get my Excel level higher, along with learning VBA and SQL. Because of my business, I have time to sit at home and teach myself whatever I need to to be more attractive to employers. Here's my conundrum:

A recruiter set me up with an interview with Morgan Stanley as a temp for 2 roles: Operations support for settlement team, and for a position with Trading operations risk team.

So on one hand, I feel that should I get offered a job at Morgan Stanley, I should take it. I'm on the older side for an undergrad and need to make up time. At the very least it would look good on my resume. Though, I've heard working there as a temp can be a bit of a ""churn and burn"" situation, which could rob me of valuable time I could use to be learning stuff relevant to what I want to do.

So should I take the job at MS even if I end up hating it just to buff up my resume or should I use the cushion my business is giving me, get super acquainted with Excel, VBA, SQL and start studying for CFA level 1?

**TL;DR: Should I take MS job so I have something to put on my resume or teach myself skills and take CFA (level 1) to try to get into FP&amp;A on the entry level?**

tl’dr :

Started a digital out of home advertising business and my 6-month journey as a 22 y/o entrepreneur so far is down below.

Hi there redditors , bit of a long post so prepare yourself. I’m a 22y/o old design student and last summer whilst interning at a large tech company I stumbled across a reddit post from a guy who told the story of how he was making $3,000 a month selling advertising on placemats in his Universities cafeteria.I have a keen interest in business and thought this was a perfect opportunity to jump in to the world of entrepreneurship.

Finished my summer internship and set about trying to figure out this new project. I went for the straight solid business of placemats as inspired by reddit. Got in contact with university , landed a meeting had all prepared , they were lovely but unfortunately said they couldn’t do anything for me. All cafeteria handling’s were done by a third party . Went back to the drawing board worked hard on my prototypes of the placemats and tried to find the manager of the cafeteria at my university. A week later I found him , no luck he was point blank not interested in hearing what I had to say and essentially told me to f**k off.

Now what I’d be rejected twice by the placemats concept. Rather than give up I tried to pivot and explore other options of local advertising in my town. I noticed all of these outdoor posters / billboards (scrolling lightbox types) in my home town and thought that could be a good bet. Only thing was the town was littered with them I’d need to find a high traffic location that was unused. So I got out and scouted the whole town. Eventually found a wall that was perfect  , just by the train station lots of footfall. 

Location found , next was to find who owns the wall. Directly went and asked several local business owners and nobody could help. Eventually found one guy who owned the local bar. Despite being a straight out dick he told me who owned it. I got in contact with the owner and set up a meeting. This guy was a real estate agent , again seemed like he was trying to shake me down for money rather than help out a budding entrepreneur. I had sourced my lightbox on Alibaba and negotiated with suppliers for the price taking my initial investment to €800 per box. He then wanted me to rent out the wall with the condition that I would put up 3 of these billboards on his wall. Taking my investment to €2,400 and he then wanted €9,000 a year for the wall , which is ridiculous. But at the time I was so eager to get going I didn’t care. I drafted paperwork and almost signed myself into €9,000 of debt. The day before signing I had thought about how he treated me , he looked down on me , gave me very little of his time and belittled me and my idea in most cases. Thought to myself money aside is this someone I wanted to do business with? The answer was no and despite wanting to get this project going so bad I told him the deal was off.

2 weeks later slightly discouraged I moved onto my second pivot. I discovered the world of digital signage. Indoor tv’s that you place adverts on. I spent almost a month on figuring out how the systems work and what business model I could use.  I thought this could be it. I was inspired by outdoor advertising models used by some large industry players. They would offer free furniture to cities in return for exclusive advertising rights on the furniture. I thought this was my business model , offer a restaurant a free tv to display their promotions on and get exclusive advertising on the tv. Next was location , I scouted 3 restaurants to deal with and got  a meeting in two. I was rejected by one but accepted by the other!


I just launched last week and have the solution running. Built a website , registered as a company , bought a landline number, set up email with ZOHO and I’m now in the sales side of things trying to sell ad space on the TV but struggling. I’m working on a yearly term with clients and offering a months free advertising before they sign up. The screen offers over 2,500 ad plays a month and is only €150 a month for a 15 second slot working out to €5 a day. Despite this I’ve only managed to sell trials for 8/20 slots. I would appreciate any help on the sales fronts. My prices are much much less than newspaper advertising or any other forms of media. The restaurant gets well over 10,000+ impressions per month. A lot of impressions would come from students and staff from the local university so I’m targeting people interested in advertising to the 18-35 demographic. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated greatly."

First off, yes we have a legit licence for every copy of Windows 10.

No, we don't have a deployment server.

I'm an intern at a mid-sized tech company and one of my tasks is to set up the notebooks for our new employees. Since the manual set-up of a notebook can take up several hours with all the updates I have to install and we since have a lot of new entries each month, this can take a pretty big chunk of my time.

Is there a way to do this more efficient?

Situation:

* The new notebooks come with a factory issued copy of Windows, OR I need to reset an older notebook with Windows already installed.

* Privacy settings during the installation need to be deactivated, Cortana and Windows Hello as well. Timezone, language and Keyboard layout needs to be changed.

* I have to install and configure several programs like Office 2016, Webbrowsers etc.

* I have to rename the notebook and join the domain.

* I need to set the option that the language settings are copied from the local admin account for each new domain user that logs in on the notebook.

You guys have any ideas how I can optimize this? I haven't been able to find anything useful on Google that fits my requirements...

Thanks for your help!"

I know that many of my competitors for these schools will have summer internship or research experience and I have none so far. And the time to apply for this summer is now. But if I take a position I will most likely have to miss out on my family summer vacation which has been a long time in the planning, and my family will lose deposits if I back out now. I'm not sure exactly how much money but probably at least $1,000.

I really want to get into these schools and I'd like to do everything I can to do that. But can I justify letting my family down?

Me, sitting in an isolated corner outside of my university's gym hall, typing here. A subreddit that I thought I would never visit ever again.

It's been precisely 5 months since I stopped visiting this subreddit. So much has changed in 5 months. Before September of 2016, I was severely depressed, borderline suicidal, crippling social anxiety without the ability to make one friend in two years of my university life, a hollow human being. I cried to sleep daily, pondered what the point of my virgin, kissless, stupid life is. 

Until I went abroad to study in another university for 5 months. I met the greatest bunch of friends, I met an amazing girl and made her my girlfriend. Learnt the values on how to be a man, a responsible adult that took care and loved other human beings. My panic attacks, depression miraculously went away after 2 years of constant, constant pain. It was one of the greatest time periods of my life. I thought this was going to be a light at the end of the tunnel, a ladder up this well of depression.

Then I had to leave, and go back to my university, leaving all of them behind. My girlfriend and I are doing long distance, but I am back to the recluse of a shit head fucking idiot FUCKING LONELY CUNT PATHETIC SAD DEPRESSED PIECE OF SHIT THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. FUCK ME. I have no fucking friends, no fucking social life, nobody to talk to, nobody to chill with, nobody to share emotions with, NOBODY CARES about me. I have no one to care about. My school program is extremely competitive, I have to study all the time to stay on course and get ahead. I have to apply for internships, my life is all about work and sadness because I am pathetically alone. I have no joy to give and to share with. Fuck me. I fucking hate myself. I don't know how to survive this. I'm visiting my girlfriend in a month and a bit more, but meanwhile I am so scared. I don't fucking want to go stay here anymore. I want to die. I am so fucking depressed. I can feel the depression starting to come back, all the pain, all the tears, all the self deprecation, it's fucking coming back.

I don't fucking know what to fucking do.

The post clocks at 1900 words and if you feel bored enough to go through it, be my guest.

I am a 19-year-old dude in university majoring in Computer Science with a 4.28 (in a 4.3 scale) GPA, and see no future for myself what so ever. This is not a post on the anxiety of my career, but a post on my self-harming ego, antisocial tendencies, and confusion.

Ever since childhood I've been raised up to be a ""good"" student. My parents had me do math workbooks since the age of 5, and I quite enjoyed it to be honest; it's one of the reasons why I'm in Comp Sci. I live in Canada now, but I believe this Kumon-like thing is very common in South Korea. Anyways, it always gave me great satisfaction coming to a definitive conclusion to each problem. I always did well in school back in Korea but I hadn’t stayed there long enough to know how well I’ve been doing in comparison to all the other kids.

When I was 9, my dad had decided that we’d move over to Canada for his kids’ “future” (I now know that it was really to escape the cultural and corporate life of Korea he had endured for 40 years). We settled in a nice neighbourhood with an elementary school just a few minutes walk away and I was as happy as a kid could be. Made a couple of friends despite my language barrier (or perhaps it was because of the language ineptitude, I’ll never know) and was just coasting by in school. The school curriculum is much ahead in Korea so I was at the top of my class; I believe this is where my bloated ego took a place in my personality and felt that a person can only be either superior or inferior to me. I wouldn’t have known whether this was a good outlook on social interactions or not. How could I have known what was normal when my dad always told me that I was smarter than everyone and deserve more? How could I have known such a thing when I was normalized to being forced by mom to ask my dad to eat dinner with his family because she couldn’t bother to do that herself, while expecting his rejection every time? I’m positive that I’m giving my parents more shit than they deserve, but at the same time, I’m not. I just don’t know. Like everything else in my life.

Come middle school and all the hormones that puberty brings, you’d just about expect the norm in my life as well. Constant need to assure my self-worth with sociopathic approaches to relationships and constant needs of others to assure their self-worth with sociopathic tactics. It’s too bad I’m still stuck in this childish mindset.

I can never be sure whether I was bullied in middle school or not. I was never sure whether the friends I had since elementary school just started being mean to me or it was just me not being able to handle the banter. It should be noted that I was instilled a sense of duty to entertain them as a superior kid and did low brow comedy routine as a middle schooler. Even in another clique I thought I found myself in, whenever I said something that may have been funny, it always felt like they were laughing at me, not with me. And when I wanted to reaffirm that they were laughing with me and speak from heart, it was always met with more laughter. It was never a line directed towards a fellow human being. But it’s just middle school, right? Nothing same with the way people speak to me right now, right?

I found a group that I knew for sure wouldn’t make fun of me, they were inferior to me after all. Nerds, social outcasts, weirdos. These people were probably the only friends I carried with myself towards high school.

Lot of things to be mentioned in high school but I feel that this post is getting too long, so I’ll keep it short. Parents got divorced (best and the worst thing to happen to me), lost a good friend of mine because I was being an ass towards him for trying to enter MY clique, started placing 2nd instead of 1st in provincial math competitions, absolutely bombed in playing trumpet in my concert band, became an ass towards everyone in band (debatable), tried talking to more people because “you just gotta get yourself out there man”. These points should be enough to lead into my next topic.

There were many evidences of people holding back whenever they were talking with me. In concert band, whenever I tried to initiate conversations (I seldom do) the replies were curt and conclusive. Whenever I tried to talk to my teachers to discuss about a topic in greater detail (and often in passion), they never felt personal when clearly they showed more personality towards the class and other individuals. When I was forced on a month long camp (Shad Valley, fuck you) because my mom told me that I needed more extracurricular activities for universities, all but my roommate (god bless that boy) showed the same replies: curt statements with occasional remarks out of pity. Now I was rather naïve back then, thinking that getting myself out there would help me with getting friends. My observations showed me that this wasn’t all just in my head: there are distinct ways that people talk when they’re speaking from their hearts (when usually with friends or are enjoying themselves) and when they’re just trying to be polite. 

This fucked with me, fucks me at the moment, and continues to fuck me for the foreseeable future. At this point, I knew I was the problem, but just didn’t know what it was. I tried to come up with all sorts of explanations, as of now the possibility of my ego being imbedded into my personality and as of result coming very much off as an asshole seems to be the most plausible answer. I’ve also been told that I look high all the time when I haven’t touched weed in my entire life. A friend also told me that I look intimidating. I’m glad my friends were there to shoot the bull with me in the high school, they helped me forget that my self-worth was in complete shambles. I wish they were still with me.

My senior year was pathetic. I got into a university I didn’t really care about. I was told that I did so well maintaining a 95% average when I felt I hadn’t worked for that number at all. My teachers continued to grind down my enthusiasm for their courses to the point that even when I had questions I’d keep them to myself because their replies felt devoid. My prom partner (who chose me because her date ditched her at the last minute) and her friends did not make any effort to talk to me during the 1-2 hour long line (to be fair, I never tried to initiate a conversation with them neither).

My outlook just kept getting bleaker. I decided to live in a dorm in my first year at university so that maybe I could try again, but I knew that nothing would change. I knew that every interaction I’ll have will be one sided. I knew that I would stay in my room throughout the entire year. Despite this, I still tried. All of the predictions came true (I probably made them true), but I still had a sliver of hope. I joined a club (gotta get yourself out there am I right haha xd). I’m sure with the tone of this post, you’d know that nothing came out of it.

I finished first year being on the honour’s list with distinction, but that doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. The only reason I get good grades is because I love getting lost in finding definitive answers. There is no ambiguity. And I have been trained to study like a robot since 5.

I planned a visit to my best friend in high school during the last summer. It ended with him telling me over facebook that his mom had forgotten about me staying over his house and that they had no rooms for me. It should be noted that I was just over there 2 weeks ago, and that I had left to visit my dad for a week. I have made it abundantly clear to him and his mother that I’d be back, and it was mutually agreed upon. To make our break in friendship more clear, he’s never sent me any kind of messages since that notice. He also is not going through a problem of his own. I still see him online playing video games with my former friends who had also cut off communications with me. My dad also told me on this trip that he wished to never see me again. Pretty sure Harambe also died around this time.

I’ve talked to a counsellor and she’s told me to get myself out there and that a relationship works two ways and that I’m not the only problem. Fuck you. 

My second year consists of me dreading to write down anything on my resume for internship applications because the only thing I can write down there is my grades, which I feel is of no value to me. I also feel I don’t want to go to the internship. First thing is I feel I have nothing to contribute to a company and the other thing is that I don’t want to be let down again. I don’t want to see other interns happily indulged in a conversation without me. I don’t want them carefully choosing their words to say when we have conversations that only I ever initiate.

I don’t want to be hurt over and over again.

My sister told me that I was never there for her when she ran away from home threatening suicide when I have searched for her for the entirety of my evening and had given her advices on what I think she should do regarding depression based on my experience. She’s also been skipping school and my mother went absolutely nuts. My dog’s also been eating rabbit shit every time I let him outside.

That should be all my unfortunate events I’ve harbored, pondering to myself what was wrong with me with all the time I had to myself being alone. There were also good things that have happened to my life, it’s just that negative thoughts always tend to persist over the good ones. I know my dad’s not a completely horrible being, he just doesn’t want his son to end up like him. I know I have been playing the victim card here throughout my post, and I think I’m aware of it. I’m also sorry for the complete lack of editing here, I have a lecture in half an hour and I just wanted to get this thought out for anybody to see while I could.

I don’t know see a fitting way to end this post, so this sentence will signal its end.

Tldr; don’t bother, it’s not worth your time.

My parents are very overbearing sometimes. They always ask me if I'm graduating on time, why my grades are ""slipping"" (from a 3.6 to a 3.5), where I'm going and with who, etc. They still don't believe that I'm suffering from ADHD, and have refused to let me see a doctor for medication so I'm going behind their back when I get back to campus. I think it's incredibly fucked up that I have to do this, but it is what it is. 

 For being 20 years old and out of state, you think they would back off a bit, for fucks sake I still have a curfew when I'm at home for break.

Each summer, they always fight with me about working internships. They don't want me to intern somewhere this summer because 'I need to be home' for one week in July to watch the pets when they go on vacation to the Bahamas. When I had an internship freshman year at NASA, they were mad that ""I was working too many hours"" and that I was needed around the house to watch my brother supposedly. He's 15, I think he can watch himself.... and last summer when I took summer classes, they refused to let me work part time because I also ""needed to watch my brother"" when literally all he did was play on the computer lol

This summer, I want to intern somewhere away from home to both gain more experience and cash (which I desperately need at this point; my bank account is running low). Especially since I'm in my junior year, I feel having another internship is crucial to me securing an entry-level job. They keep fighting with me saying that ""it's not going to happen"" and ""I need to be at home"" and ""you have your entire life to work, why start now"". I'm miserable at home, and I recently had a very rough semester personally so I just really want to branch out and work somewhere new and have a fresh change of pace. They didn't go to college, so they don't understand the importance of internships. They assume I'll just walk out with a job, but it's not that simple unfortunately.

Anyone else have to deal with overprotective parents, and how did you convince them to let you pursue your dreams? I'm embarrrassed that I even have to ask this. I feel like I'm 15, but I'm almost of legal drinking age. If they trust me to go out of state, why don't they trust me to go work in a different state for a summer?"

I started a decent job at a private fortune 100 company. I hate it though. All I have to compare it to is my summer internship, but basically the office layout is wide open, no cubicles or offices (for non-management).  I feel like I can't focus or get any work done.  I have noise cancelling headphones and that helps, but I can't help but feel like i'm constantly being watched.  I have some anxiety but the open floor just really exacerbates it.  I really need my ""own space"" when I do coding, I just do.

I'm on the verge of quitting and looking for another job.  The thing is this job pays very well, whereever I go I'll likely make less, but i'm just stressed and miserable and thinking it's not worth it. (For reference, i'm making ~101k including sign on bonus).  

I accepted an offer before from Boeing for ~80, and cancelled after accepting because I thought the other opportunity was more for me. Now i'm regretting it, I respect Boeing as a company (unlike my current one) and I would of had my own office!! Not to mention, I feel like ""serving my country"" is more meaningful than what i'm currently doing.

What would you guys do?  With my anxiety in the open floor I feel like i'm not getting anything done.  I reached back out to Boeing, but after cancelling I'm not thinking they'll still want me.  I'm going to apply to lots of contractors in my area.  I want to find a new job before I quit, but at the same time if i'm so miserable everyday it may not be worth the money."

I am 31 years old, have been working very successfully in the food service industry for 9 years in nyc. I attended 3.5 semesters of a private major university (that is very far from where I now live) with decent grades but did not graduate. I was working on a double major in music and computer science.


What is the best path for me to a shift back to a career as a software engineer / developer? I am interested in working with back-end stuff, algorithms, data science in the context of a startup, less interested in web design, javascript, css, android/ios apps etc. Generally am looking to get back into a more intellectually fulfilling / stimulating career that scratches my inner engineering itch.


Should I go back and finish a bs or attend a bootcamp?  Can I find a way into an internship / first job?  Do companies ever hire non-students as interns?  How would I best communicate my odd circumstance?  Should I look for a masters program that doesn't have a specific bachelors requirement?

A little more background:

I remember a good deal of cs from school, have a working knowledge of python, c++, java, but am definitely out of practice. I was a pretty typical curious cs student, hacking random things in spare time, building servers / websites for fun, playing with old/outdated languages. I have a very dusty knowledge base of upper level math, algebra, calculus, discrete math. I can follow along with the math in basic cs algorithm tutorials.


I have an exemplary resume in the industry that I am in.  Non of it is relevant to work in computer science, but it is full of notable places and great accolades.


Good knowledge of types of algorithms, asymptotic notation, basic cs concepts. I have read around this sub a good amount, have looked at things like leet code, and can generally understand many of of the easy / medium problems. I am severely out of practice with all of it, but I can read along a solution in python and comprehend it with some googling.


I did one internship while in school, and one shortly afterwards. One was in IT for a small software company, and one was as a programmer working in C and unix shell scripts. Still have a working knowledge of bash, linux, c, etc.


I have built websites before, pretty good knowledge of css and html.


tldr: went to school for cs for 3.5 years, didn't graduate, became successful working in another industry. it's been 9 years since school and i want to get back to a cs career. can I fake my way in with what I remember from school?"

I am taking a year off from school due to financial issues, and going to return to school next year to finish my degree. 

This year, I am trying so hard to find an internship in analytic/data science or gain professional experience. I have an okay GPA (3.6) and a data analysis portfolio. I am also working as one of the executives for a data science organization undergrad in my school, and located right in Silicon Valley (not sure if it matters). 

However, I was rejected at every internship I applied to, some at the phone interview round, while the recruiters learned that I am not currently in school, stating that ""internships are only for students who are currently enrolled in school"".

I have also been trying to look at junior/contract data analysis position, but so far every position requires having at least a BS/BA degree.

Are there any companies that have a more lenient policy towards internship or junior positions, or is there any way I can convince them I am worth it despite my lack of eligibility?"

5n9ofl,2,2017-01-10,"I am an earth sciences major, I have a few questions.",conman526,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/5n9ofl/i_am_an_earth_sciences_major_i_have_a_few/,"First, some background. I wanted to do engineering for a while because I enjoyed learning how things worked, and because I enjoyed math and physics. I stumbled upon earth sciences/geology and thought that it was a perfect fit, especially because I have also always enjoyed learning how the earth worked.
First question: Geology or geoscience? I really enjoy being outdoors, rain shine mountain or plain. However, I also enjoy working with technology (I actually work at my universities IT department), but I am not a fan of software development or testing. I read that geologist often spend up to 80 hours a week in the field for months, and then spend the rest of their time indoors. And that geophysicists hardly ever go into the field to gather data, and all they do is computer simulations and modeling. I am specifically interested in the difference between a typical work week between geologists and geophysicists.

First and a half?: What do you do in an average work week/month? Are you a geologist, or are you a geophysicist? I am also considering hydrogeology/hydrology focus.

Second: Do I absolutely, without a doubt, have to get a graduate degree? I am not keen on getting one right after my undergraduate degree, but I will definitely consider going back to school in the future. Also, if I do absolutely have to get one after my BS, what should I get it in?

Third: What is the difference in work style of O&amp;G companies, environmental? Like, is O&amp;G only into exploration, and is environmental only consulting?

Fourth: What should I expect, job duties wise, at an entry-level position with a BS with little experience (maybe an internship or two)? 

Fourth and a quarter: What kind of advancement opportunities could I expect to see 5 years down the road with just a BS? 10 years? 20 years? Government career opportunities? Private sector?

Fifth: As of right now, I am really interested in traveling abroad for work. I have heard that this is a possibility. Is this true? What kind of qualifications would I need? What kind of job would it have to be?

Sixth: As I mentioned earlier, I am interested in hydrogeology. However, I have heard that the job outlook on this isn't as great, and the pay is not as good. Is this true?

Thank you guys! If you can't answer all or any of my questions, just please leave your opinion on how you enjoy your job! i.e. what you do (job title), what you do (duties), what you like about it, don't like about it, I would love to hear about it. Thanks again!"
5n9qhp,2,2017-01-10,Intro - Starting Again,MizunoKaze,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5n9qhp/intro_starting_again/,"Hello, everyone! I recently found this subreddit, and I figure I could use all the help I can get, so...here I am!

Other than my stats in my flair, probably the biggest thing to know about me is that I've done so much of this before. Over the course of 2014, I lost over 100 pounds. I still wasn't at my goal weight, but I was certainly much closer than I'd ever been. As someone who'd been overweight as long as I could remember, it was so great being that comparatively slim. I wasn't paying extra for jeans. I was buying shirt sizes without an X in them. People treated me better, and I felt better about my body than I ever had.

And then...I screwed up. I let it all slip away. A major factor in me losing that weight had been the amount of free time on my hands. I'd been fresh out of college, finally completing my bachelor's degree after almost 10 years of off and on college whenever I could afford it, but no one wanted to hire me. I'd supported myself on some inheritance for the last year or so of college, so that I could actually go full-time and not have to juggle a job at the same time, but that meant that once I graduated, there was a whole lot of nothing going on. I used that time to work on my weight, but then, at the start of 2015, I'd had so little luck that I decided to go back for another degree.

I went at the second degree as hard as I could, taking 16 credit hours each quarter (18 in one of them, actually). I finished it within the year. But along the way, workouts slipped and eventually became non-existent. My diet got worse, capping off with an internship that saw our department eating out literally every workday for lunch. By the time 2015 ended, I realized I'd gained all of that weight back again, and with a few pounds extra, to boot.

I think in a way, I didn't do things right the first time around. I was still eating plenty of carbs, albeit in smaller portions and with more vegetables mixed in. I ""made up for it"" with exercise, usually ""power walking"" on the treadmill. 100 minutes at 4 MPH was pretty much my daily minimum. That's great and all, but working a full-time job with a commute, I don't see working that much time into my schedule every single day being feasible.

There are a few more complications on the nutrition side of things, listed in no particular order:
 
 - I'm fortunate enough to have a partner who's currently back to being a student, and has time to do all the cooking. However, he's used to fairly simple cooking, and is a picky eater.

 - We're trying to save money and pull ourselves out of debt, so budget is tight.

 - My current employer provides lunch, but that's kind of a double-edged sword. I work in the office of what's basically a country club, and the kitchen puts out lunch, buffet-style, in the employee lounge. I used to track my calories all the time, but I don't know how to handle a daily meal where I have no clue of the nutrition value. The chefs are no real help, as it tends to just be whatever they can throw together for the day from surplus or leftovers, and I don't think they have any idea of calorie counts. I could describe the food in MFP and hope I get something close, but that could very well be wildly off. I could bring my own lunch instead, but with budget also being a focus, it's hard to turn down free lunch every workday.

Obviously, exercise is the other part of the equation. I realize it's not nearly as much of the equation, that 80-90% is diet, and you can't outrun your fork, but still...exercise has been inconsistent, to say the least. There's so much information out there about different workouts, and it's so hard to know what's right for me. I know ""right for me"" is the biggest thing, that the best exercise program is the one you stick with. I know the only real way to find out is to try, but I still find myself gripped by a bit of analysis paralysis. That, and a general lack of energy. Even if I start the afternoon swearing I'll exercise when I get home, after finishing out the work day, going through my commute, coming home and eating dinner...I find myself not wanting to do much.

I do try to work a little bit of walking into my routine at work, but with a busy desk job, that can be tough. Usually, the most I manage is going for a pretty short walk down a quiet hallway at my work each time I get my hourly reminder from my FitBit, and parking in the furthest parking spot. This still only amounts to maybe 3,000-4,000 steps a day. I'd really rather not add any more monthly expenses to the budget, which means a gym is likely out. I do have some tools at home. There's my treadmill, although I am a bit afraid of damaging it if I use it too much while over its 300 pound weight limit. There's a pair of 10 pound dumbbells, a pair of 20 pound dumbbells, and a very nice set of adjustable dumbbells that go from 5 pounds to 55 pounds in 2.5 pound increments. And of course, there's always my body weight, though that can be difficult with so darn much of me to lift. It's just a matter of figuring out how to use those tools in a way that works for me, and having the energy to actually do it.

I should probably mention my hobbies are, unsurprisingly, pretty much all sedentary. I love PC and console gaming, particularly RPGs, fantasy books, that sort of thing. All very fun, but not really contributing to a solution.

Anyway, that was my introduction. I know it was a massive wall of text, but I never was very good at being concise. I look forward to any input, suggestion, inspiration, etc. you all may have!"

Im not super literate on computer stuff but kinda have some basic knowledge of what im doing. So, Im adding a M.2 250gb SSD to my laptop. I have downloaded the Samsung Data Migration software to move everything over from the 1TB HDD. Now, I just got this laptop. I have the OS, Steam (no games downloaded, yet), AutoCAD, Revit, and Photoshop stuff (im an intern Architect). So I have about 85gb used in my 1tb HDD. 

**I hear that some people have had issues with OS migration because of an EFI partition on the hard drive, and with that, the computer will try to boot still from the hard drive. Should I be worried about this? or will the software make the partitions on the SSD?**

I have looked also at just giving it to MicroCenter here in town, but they charge $100 for that... ew.

5na9oy,23,2017-01-11,How do I accept my own mediocrity?,adeliepingu,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/5na9oy/how_do_i_accept_my_own_mediocrity/,"**Disclaimer:** Wall of text ahead, with no visible point. Might delete this later when I'm feeling better.

I'm graduating college this spring. It's been rough.

I went from straight A's my freshman year to nearly failing out my junior year because I didn't want to live anymore. There were a lot of factors as to why - I felt incredibly discouraged by how many other students came in with an advantage due to their prior programming experience, my own lack of genius, and on top of that, my roommate started dating my high school friend and my jealousy was distracting. I've always reacted very poorly to feeling *not good enough*, and things just slowly fell apart.

It's a typical negative cycle. You feel bad, then you start feeling bad for feeling bad. Eventually you don't know how you started in the first place, just that *feeling bad* has been all you've ever known.

I'd like to think I'm recovering. My grades are mediocre, and I'll graduate on time thanks to generous AP credits and lax degree requirements. I don't think about killing myself much, and the emptiness and apathy has been replaced with plain ol' anger and bitterness. Sometimes I even think I'll be happy in the future.

But it's hard, graduating and finding a job and becoming a competent adult. I'm home for winter break and I don't think I've had a single conversation with my parents that didn't end in tears. Just a matter of differing viewpoints and expectations - my parents just want me to be able to graduate on time, find some kind of job, maybe do what my roommate did and find myself a rich boyfriend who'll take care of me.

That's not what I want. How have I gotten to the point where just *graduating* is an accomplishment? Why am I so absolutely, so infuriatingly *mediocre*? All I ever wanted to be was *good at something*, but it seems that's too much to ask for.

I was a really good student in high school. People respected me and expected me to do great things. Now, when I look at the accomplishments of others - they're starting companies, picking up internships with Big 4 tech companies, enjoying themselves - I can't help but feel I peaked in high school, and my life has just been a long trend downhill ever since. I don't want to be a disappointment. I'd rather die than be a failure - if at first you can't succeed, destroy all evidence you tried.

I don't know where I'm going with this, really. I don't have a clear question someone can answer.

My thinking is illogical and self-contradictory. I am too proud to accept I am just a normal person - not special, not talented, not going to change the world - but I've always struggled with imposter syndrome and feeling like I'm not good enough and never will be. I know that I need to improve myself but I can't make the first move because I'm too crippled by my fear of admitting failure and by my suspicion that no matter what I do, I'll never catch up with what I want to be.

I can find the flaws in my own thinking, identify why it's negative and doesn't make sense, but I can't make myself believe my own logic. I know the way I think is overwhelmingly fatalistic and negative, but knowing won't make it go away.

Honestly, I just want to look at my resume without crying. That's all.

**Aside:** I dated someone last year, during the worst of my depression. I still feel awfully guilty about it - I spooked badly and just cut off all communication with them because I couldn't handle and didn't think I was worthy of being in a relationship. I'll apologize to them one day. I just don't know when I'm ready to do it."

Both parents have a family history of mental illness.  My dad was the brightest kid in a privledged family of six, the only one accepted to a very competitive academy and the only one with a scholarship to Vanderbilt.  He went insane in his early 20's, bi polar and schizophrenia.  He had electroshock therapy and never was the same.  My mom's mother died suddenly when my mom was only 14.  She comes from a family of 11 kids and was the middle child.  I should say both came from very Catholic families so were extremely sexually repressed, and even talking about sex was seen as taboo.  Two of my mother's brothers suffered from schizophrenia and killed themselves during my lifetime.  One lit himself on fire when I was too young to remember, the other jumped off a bridge when I was in my 20's.  My parents divorced when I was 4 because my dad was verbally abusive (would get VERY ANGRY for almost no reason randomly) and my mom re-married about two years after to a former military man who was very strict.  In addition to all of this we moved many times while I was growing up, each time leaving behind forever the friends that I had made.  The most disastrous of these moves occured when I was 12.  We moved from an urban neighborhood in sunny Nevada where I had a plethora of kids to play with to a dreary (almost always overcast) hillside just south of the Ohio river in bum fuck nowhere Kentucky.  We lived on 40 acres and the nearest neighbor was a mile away.  In addition to this I was put into a private school for the first time in my life because the public schools weren't supposed to be very good.  I became pretty much mentally retarded (was the laughing stock of the 7th grade) and even walked extremely awkwardly in front of my schoolmates due to being suddenly acutely self conscious of my every move.  In addition to this nobody properly explained sex to me.  I missed out of sex ed due to the private school and never even talked about it to my peers until years later so I was clueless as to why I got horny and had the tragic catholic guilt about sexuality.   I became severely addicted to videogames, an addiction I wouldn't start to overcome until my mid 20's. We moved to South Carolina in the summer between 8th grade and High School.  In high school I only fared marginally better than Middle School, and didn't feel part of anyone.  I wasn't a jock or a prep or a nerd I was just there.  I didn't go to prom and instead played videogames.  I went to college for a year(which actually was fun for the most part, though I had the emotional IQ of a 10 year old and didn't even hold hands much less kiss until my mid 20's) then got a sales job selling books door to door in rural texas.  I made no money (I was a pitiful salesman) lost my car (because I didn't change the oil in time) and when I went back to college in the fall I flunked out.  I got on meds that sort of worked but really made me numb to everything.  I ended up going back and finishing college by the skin of my teeth, having no plan for the future, having foolishly dropped out of my crucial internship because it reminded me of my sales job.  The first job after college was working as a walgreens store clerk.  I should say in addition to everything else I was morbidly obese since Kentucky, eating junk food and never excersizing. I also have absolutely atrocious metabolism.  I quit Walgreens after a few months, went home to live with my mom and hit another low point when she told me I had to get a job, any job if I wanted to live with her so me, a college grad and son of a Vandy grad, worked sweeping floors at a filthy plant that makes rubber for tires.  Fate stepped in luckily and I jumped at the oppourtunity to work an unpaid internship at the Nashville Chamber of Commerce, where my dad lives.  I got a job at a grocery store to make some money and was made fun of by management (being referred to as a neanderthal because I was still self conscious in public).  After 6 months I quit the internship to work at the grocery store full time and I finally started to make friends (thanks meetup.com) and even got along with my coworkers once one super friendly cool guy started working there and invited me to a party with coworkers.  I was on my feet a lot and I ate very little because poverty so I lost weight and my life seemed to be working out (finally had the confidence to have my first dating experience when I was 26).  Gradually this life eroded.  Friends kept leaving, and I was put almost exclusively on the overnight shift alone.  I had three different managers telling me three different things and no matter how hard I worked It was never enough and I was never appreciated.  I heard about a ride sharing service and quit the grocery store.  At first it was great because I was making so much money but after 3 years I am making less and less money all of the time, have almost no social life because of my work schedule (nights and weekends).  I got off my meds about two years ago because they were just making me feel too numb and every experience felt hollow and artificial.  I cope somewhat by doing the following:

1) working out and eating right.  No sugary sodas and limited sweets and fast food.   Lots of fruit and veggies.  I work out almost every day

2) having a dog in the house so when I feel at my lowest I can hold the dog and he always greets me when I come in

3) I have kept a journal for the past 5 years.  Writing my feelings is extremely important and therapuetic.  Especially excersizes in creative writing

4) reading a lot.  I am an introvert so this has helped me tremendously.  Also consuming info on the internet, but in moderarion.  I have been atheist/agnostic for much of my adult life but through hearing Jordan B Peterson on Joe Rogan's podcast I have a new hope for adding religion to my life

5) curbing my enthusiasm.  I have had a horrible habit of putting all my hopes into something only to be very disappointed.  Try not to think x will solve all of your problems and make you happy.  99.9999999% chance it won't do shit.

I still get down and still feel suicidal at times.  I have never had a girlfriend and don't plan to anytime soon because everytime I try I can't handle it and my life falls apart because I don't know how to juggle a relationship and a job where I work nights and weekends and I tend to be an asshole.  The longest a relationship has lasted one week.  But doing these things has helped keep the terrible depression at bay a little bit."

I was extremely desperate for money and was pretty much looking for any job in my field (IT, as a junior developer) that paid. I took a job at a small firm with no benefits but paid me $48,000 a year, with a guaranteed raise to $50,000 a year after 6 months. 

For the first month or 2, things were really great and I thought I found my dream job. But I noticed how employees at my company complained often about how my boss runs his business. I couldn't understand why people would be so quick to say how bad someone is at running their company and tried to avoid getting involved in it because I was new and not trying to get canned when I'm desperate for money. 

After month 3, I saw exactly what my co-workers were saying when it came to why they feel my boss can't run a business. I had watched my boss belittle my superior and cuss at a fellow co-worker. He brought up in a company meeting the discussion of another employee's employment and if we thought the employee should be fired. It's disturbing to see this and I finally decided that the best thing for me is to find other employment.

I have contacted numerous recruitment within the past 48 hours and filled out 20 job applications. I'm trying to keep the job hunt secret, but I feel so depressed knowing that it was so challenging to find the job I have and I ended up in such a bad spot. I blame myself for taking a job for nothing other than money and ignoring the more important reasons to take a job (I.E the company culture, the benefits, the opportunity). But now I feel helpless because I have less than 4 months experience and that seems to be all that people look at when hiring in IT. 

Is there any hope for me to find another job despite so little experience? I've completed some projects at my current job and prior to this I had an internship where I completed another project. How do I talk to the tech recruiters and future employers about this?"

As a nervous senior with post application anxiety, I thought that making one of these threads would be fun.

State: AZ
School Type: Private
Ethnicity: White
Gender: Male

Major (general): Business/Computer Science

Scores
ACT: 31 (E: 29, M: 27, R: 36, S: 33). 7 overall on writing. I’m not a great writer on the fly, often I like to take time to revise my piece to make it better.
SAT: 1370 (R/W: 650, M: 720). 6 on writing.
A-Levels: Business Studies (B), AS Global Perspectives (a), and English (D - I got an A in the class overall, but I think I just bombed one of the heavily weighted papers which caused my score to bomb. It was about theories of language development, not even related to writing skill.)

Grades
3.61 UW GPA
Weighted GPA: Not offered at my school, even though A-levels are rigorous courses.
Class size: 13 (its a super small school!)

Extracurriculars:
Interact District Council (2 years, member then District Governor. I planned and led a 100 person leadership conference)
Another Interact District Council (1 year, Assistant Governor/Webmaster. These two Districts are merging. I made a new website and managed the social media for both districts.)
Interact Club (2 years, President/Founder, completed a plethora of service projects such as raising money for a well in South America and food drives)
Moot Court (2 years, member then Internal Executive Director. Was accepted to the National High School Moot Court Competition at Duke University two years running)
Sunday School (volunteer teacher’s aide, then was offered to be paid as a head teacher’s aide. I worked with 5th/6th graders, and also worked in the office)
Library Volunteer (2 years, helped arrange tai-monthly bookstalls that raised over $10,000 for the library)
Internship at Children’s Hospital (2 years, only high school intern they’ve ever had, working on Information Technology/Business Administration)

I do have more extracurriculars, but I only mentioned those here because they are what are on my application and what I consider ‘most important.’ I’m a member of NHS and Thespian Society, but not very involved in either/didn’t do them for very long. I was also on our school’s Robotics team, but only did that for a year and we didn’t do much.

Additional Information: I had a chronic disease (basically Chron’s Disease) for most of my high school career. This caused me to miss about 130 days of school to date.

Letters of Rec:
Psychology/Business Teacher: I haven’t seen her recommendation, but I’m sure that she wrote me a very strong one. She’s basically a second mother to me. 9/10.
History Teacher/Principal: 8/10

Additional: My mentor I work with in Interact. He had a very high ranking in the military, and a very impressive resume himself. He wrote me an absolutely stellar recommendation (100/10)

Common App Essay: 9/10. I wrote about my experience in the hospital (Without going into too much detail) and how the volunteers there inspired me to become an intern at the hospital and volunteer more.

Writing Supplements: My Babson one is probably 9/10.

Schools applying to: Babson (ED, deferred), Brandeis (EDII), Skidmore, Wesleyan, ASU Barrett, possibly Colgate


College information: I thought my interview for Babson went well. I also went to their information session and preview day, where I presented my group’s mock business in front of about 100 other kids and my interviewer. I was talking over e-mail to an admissions counselor for a while about getting credit for my A-Levels. I went on a campus tour of Brandeis, but didn't interview or anything as I hadn't been interested until I actually saw the campus on a whim.

What I want from an internship is to experience how it feels to code in the company environment, and not just on my desk at home. I also want to learn how to work in a team on a project as well. Do high school internships provide this? Or should I wait till I go to university to start looking for them.

5nar95,4,2017-01-11,i am graduating college in may and im terrified of the job search,whatdoido12345678888,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5nar95/i_am_graduating_college_in_may_and_im_terrified/,"it’s a bit late so i’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense/is disorganized. it could definitely be improved but i need to get this off my chest because it’s eating at me. 

i graduate in may from a prestigious university with a degree in history and i’m finding it really hard for me to think of anything i want to do. i have experience on some on-campus casual/part-time jobs, but nothing serious like an internship. i feel like the fact that i have no “real” experience combined with my degree in history will make it impossible for me to find a job, even if i knew what i wanted to do. 

i came into college wanting to go to law school which is why i majored in history. but now that’s changed and i don’t know what to do. i spent a lot of time focused at my studies but that is now no longer an option for me and i am now reaching the end. to be honest i really don’t know how to do anything *but* study. my entire life has always been about grades and i did well in my studies and i’ve done well but now it’s over. 

i have a lot of experience as a research assistant for other people, helping them with their projects. i’d like to get a job where i read and write things and work with people on projects or something vaguely related. i really love that kind of stuff, especially writing things. it doesn’t even have to be history, i’ve done stuff in law, sociology, jewish studies, etc. but i don’t know where to look and i don’t think that kind of job exists for people outside academia, or at least not for people with my qualifications and background (which include no science or finance-related research). i did some work as a distance marketing intern (internship over the web) for a startup that has since failed but it wasn’t really an impressive campaign. 

whenever i look at jobs i get depressed because i don’t meet the qualifications. i don’t have experience. i don’t have the skills. i don’t have a degree in the field they want. i know that the qualifications don’t have to all be met but i feel like why would someone hire me, without any experience, over someone who has way more experience than me (which would be any experience at all) and a relevant degree? usually the only qualifications i meet are familiarity with the office suite and organizational/communication skills. i have those skills but so does everyone else, or at least they say they do, so i feel like i don’t stand out. i know i have skills like scripting and programming but i feel that aren’t good enough to be useful, or jobs don’t ask for them at all. in short i feel unprepared for the job search. 

i get depressed and anxious thinking about it. i feel like i’m going to fail for sure and i haven’t even started seriously applying for work. i haven’t gotten a single rejection yet but i feel like i’ve already failed. people tell me i’m really smart and talented and i’ll find something that’s right for me. but i feel like everyone is being optimistic and it’s hard for me to believe them when they are also struggling to find work. i tried to tell myself the same thing but i feel like i’m just trying to make myself feel better. 

i feel like part of it is that i tried to find an internship for the past summer (between my junior and senior year) and found it incredibly difficult to even get interviews. i ended up not getting an internship and instead working at a library on campus. i went to my career center tons for advice and was told that my resume, cover letters, etc. were good as they were though i did incorporate their feedback on how to improve. but like i said i found it difficult to even get an interview. 

i don’t know what to do. it’s obviously too late to change my major and i have no clue what i am going to do with my life. i don’t care if my job has nothing to do with history. i love history and i don’t really regret studying it. it developed my skills in synthesizing material, making judgements, writing and organization, understanding trends, etc. i originally picked it though because it was apparently a good major for law school because of the skills. i felt lucky that it coincided with my passion because i love history.  

but now all i know is that i don’t want to go to law or grad school, at least right now, so i feel like my major is a wash even though i love/loved studying it. it probably doesn’t help that i have no clue what i want to do or what is even out there. i feel so dejected. i’m going to therapy but it doesn’t change the fact that i have to decide what it is i want to do, at least come this summer. i know i may not find a career i love right away but... i really have no clue. i feel like this is impossible. i feel like i’ve failed. 

i would appreciate your thoughts, stories, advice, feedback, etc. as long as it’s helpful and constructive. i know there are a ton of things i *should* have done but it’s way too late for that now. thanks for reading. "

tl’dr :

Started a digital out of home advertising business and my 6-month journey as a 22 y/o entrepreneur so far is down below.

Hi there redditors , bit of a long post so prepare yourself. I’m a 22y/o old design student and last summer whilst interning at a large tech company I stumbled across a reddit post from a guy who told the story of how he was making $3,000 a month selling advertising on placemats in his Universities cafeteria.I have a keen interest in business and thought this was a perfect opportunity to jump in to the world of entrepreneurship.

Finished my summer internship and set about trying to figure out this new project. I went for the straight solid business of placemats as inspired by reddit. Got in contact with university , landed a meeting had all prepared , they were lovely but unfortunately said they couldn’t do anything for me. All cafeteria handling’s were done by a third party . Went back to the drawing board worked hard on my prototypes of the placemats and tried to find the manager of the cafeteria at my university. A week later I found him , no luck he was point blank not interested in hearing what I had to say and essentially told me to f**k off.

Now what I’d be rejected twice by the placemats concept. Rather than give up I tried to pivot and explore other options of local advertising in my town. I noticed all of these outdoor posters / billboards (scrolling lightbox types) in my home town and thought that could be a good bet. Only thing was the town was littered with them I’d need to find a high traffic location that was unused. So I got out and scouted the whole town. Eventually found a wall that was perfect  , just by the train station lots of footfall. 

Location found , next was to find who owns the wall. Directly went and asked several local business owners and nobody could help. Eventually found one guy who owned the local bar. Despite being a straight out dick he told me who owned it. I got in contact with the owner and set up a meeting. This guy was a real estate agent , again seemed like he was trying to shake me down for money rather than help out a budding entrepreneur. I had sourced my lightbox on Alibaba and negotiated with suppliers for the price taking my initial investment to €800 per box. He then wanted me to rent out the wall with the condition that I would put up 3 of these billboards on his wall. Taking my investment to €2,400 and he then wanted €9,000 a year for the wall , which is ridiculous. But at the time I was so eager to get going I didn’t care. I drafted paperwork and almost signed myself into €9,000 of debt. The day before signing I had thought about how he treated me , he looked down on me , gave me very little of his time and belittled me and my idea in most cases. Thought to myself money aside is this someone I wanted to do business with? The answer was no and despite wanting to get this project going so bad I told him the deal was off.

2 weeks later slightly discouraged I moved onto my second pivot. I discovered the world of digital signage. Indoor tv’s that you place adverts on. I spent almost a month on figuring out how the systems work and what business model I could use.  I thought this could be it. I was inspired by outdoor advertising models used by some large industry players. They would offer free furniture to cities in return for exclusive advertising rights on the furniture. I thought this was my business model , offer a restaurant a free tv to display their promotions on and get exclusive advertising on the tv. Next was location , I scouted 3 restaurants to deal with and got  a meeting in two. I was rejected by one but accepted by the other!


I just launched last week and have the solution running. Built a website , registered as a company , bought a landline number, set up email with ZOHO and I’m now in the sales side of things trying to sell ad space on the TV but struggling. I’m working on a yearly term with clients and offering a months free advertising before they sign up. The screen offers over 2,500 ad plays a month and is only €150 a month for a 15 second slot working out to €5 a day. Despite this I’ve only managed to sell trials for 8/20 slots. I would appreciate any help on the sales fronts. My prices are much much less than newspaper advertising or any other forms of media. The restaurant gets well over 10,000+ impressions per month. A lot of impressions would come from students and staff from the local university so I’m targeting people interested in advertising to the 18-35 demographic. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated greatly.


EDIT 1 :

Thanks to all you guys who have helped so far your feedback and advice is really appreciated and I'm trying it all. Your support is keeping me going on this battle! For anybody interested here's the site I've set up , no inbound calls from it as of yet.

I am wanting to start running and working out. However, due to my work and school schedule it is a bit complicated.

I work third shift, so about 10pm-5am each night. I have class Tuesday and Thursday at 11 am so I get 3 hours of sleep on those days after work, and then nap later in the day.

On Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday I work an internship and I'm there by 3.. so I get a little bit more sleep on these days, about 6 hours. Still not the full 8 though.

I'm used to not sleeping much but I'm wondering how this will impact me if I start working out. Will I be able to see any benefit from exercise because of lack of sleep? Will not sleeping a full 8 hours ever really hurt me and keep me from seeing any noticeable difference?

Just want to make sure I'm not wasting my time. Thanks guys!"

Get over yourself before you drain the company of all its tech talent.",dartmouthmoose,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ncqti/no_palantir_your_internships_are_not_worth_5/,"I recently decided to quit the recruiting process with Palantir after having first reached out in July of 2016 and having my first interview in October. Last summer I was really excited about the prospect of working at Palantir--cool tech, smart people, sick perks. After 2 phone screens, 3 onsites in NY, a hiring manager interviews and dozens of emails back and forth with recruiters I got a call offering me the ""opportunity"" to do even more onsites for the Forward Deployed Engineering role.

During this time I also found two separate internships, one at a breakout list company and another at Google. I took both offers (I had two off terms from school essentially) and am currently working at the breakout list company. Yet, here I am in January talking to Palantir still and being asked to do more interviews. Finally I said enough, no tech internship could possibly be worth what would be 8 interviews or more if I kept going.

This made me seriously consider though, how does Palantir get good talent if they have such a horrible recruiting process?

I'm asking this question because I thought maybe I was an outlier, but heard of several people with similar experiences. My perception of Palantir has been drastically reduced through this process. I told my recruiters via email about already finding internship, being stuck in the recruiting pipeline for nearly five months, and how I was not willing nor had the time to interview as I'm working now. She just recanted the same things as before about wanting to find a good fit for me, how that takes time, and asked me to do more interviews.

Not only is the recruiting process awful, but I think a company would have to be seriously delusional about its status to think that 5 months and 6 interviews later I'll take a day off of work from my current internship to take the CalTrain down to Palo Alto and do some brain teasers on a whiteboard so that maybe I can get another hiring manager interview for a role as a glorified customer support engineer that I didn't actually want in the first place.

How in the world does Palantir stay competitive thinking like this? Is there still any hype for Palantir from top engineering talent? 


I wholeheartedly regret even starting this process of applying to Palantir as it's been a huge time and energy investment and I have absolutely no closure--I didn't get rejected, I didn't get an offer, I just walked away. 

If you've had a similar experience with Palantir I'd love to hear about it and what you did. I'm also interested in what anyone who has had a positive experience being recruited or working at Palantir has to say. "
5nd35o,13,2017-01-11,"I'm 27 and I have been living with degenerative disc ""disease"" for 6 years. Marijuana helps me in a very real way.",[deleted],ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/5nd35o/im_27_and_i_have_been_living_with_degenerative/,"I want to let people know that marijuana, especially the right strains, really does help with the chronic pain that comes with degenerative discs. 

My L4 and L5 are both degenerative, L5 herniated 6 years ago which I had a microdiscectomy to repair and L4 is bulging forward and to the left. Over the years I have lost everything that is important to me and I have thought about suicide more than I'd like to talk about. I used to play football and other sports all the time and had started a career as a fire fighter/investigator with my Bachelor's in Criminal Justice but had to drop it all when my back problems were diagnosed as degenerative. I hid my problems the entire time and many times in my internship with the fire department I had to discretely use my shovel as a cane while working a fire.

Since then I have tried so many of the different pain pills and recently tried anti-depressants. I can say with confidence that these are both terrible options and will only destroy you in the long run. For me, that pain pills did not even stop the pain, they just altered my mind and body in a bad way, making me even less functional. The anti-depressants didn't make my pain-triggered thoughts any easier and only made me somewhat of a sad zombie.

I want everyone in this community to know that I truly do find real relief in the use of marijuana in it's many different forms, not just CBD. I lived in Colorado for about a year and worked in the medical marijuana industry to learn how to make my own medicine. I unfortunately had to quit my weed-growing job because my back pain was so bad I could not handle doing the work anymore, even with the regular use of marijuana. All the while, I was seeing the most progressive spine specialists I could get to and was only left with an ""I'm sorry, you really got the short end of the stick on this one..."" and that was it, again and again. I had once again spent all my money on getting my hopes and then shot down.

ALTHOUGH, I learned a lot from a physical therapist I saw there in Denver and the focus on fitness and doing the right therapeutic movements/strength building has helped me tremendously, and I still work out at the gym every day, in the ways that I can. I cannot run anymore or really lift weights without being extremely careful. I cannot stress enough how important regular exercise and the application of heat in a hot tub or steam room helps me.

For reasons I'm no longer sure about, I've moved back to North Carolina and I am now without any marijuana and my pain is getting worse. I live with my parents, which is humiliating as I cannot get a job that I can physically handle and will pay me enough to take care of myself. Also, having a marijuana job on your resume doesn't make it any easier to get employed in backwards-ass North Carolina. I cannot sit down or stand stationary for very long and I cannot do manual labor anymore either, for the obvious reasons. I am working on getting certifications toward a job in networking (A+, Networking+, CNAA) that will allow me to move around as needed but without lifting all day or bending over. 

I try to stay focused on moving forward and getting a new job but I am so depressed about being trapped in my parents house at 27 with no job, no friends, no love in my life, no money, and no hobbies I can really enjoy anymore. I truly feel like my life is ruined and I am having a hard time staying positive enough to find my way out.

I want to share a message of relief with you all that there is hope in marijuana, we all have to push through the government's corruption and fight them to legalize it for everyone, especially us.

I am also posting this because I am asking for help. If anyone has anything to share that will help me feel better about my life and give me some hope again, it would be deeply appreciated. Sharing is caring and I want to share with you all. You're not alone and I want to feel like I'm not alone either.

5ndhmb,3,2017-01-11,[DIY Webserver] Help with setup on a raspberry pi 3/Questions about Node.js,Drjakeadelic,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5ndhmb/diy_webserver_help_with_setup_on_a_raspberry_pi/,"I am about to start an internship in a week or two where I will build web applications.  I have experience working with embedded systems and microcomputers but web based programming is somewhat foreign to me.  To practice, I have built a portfolio website using bootstrap, jquery, and other concepts I will need to know at my internship.  

To gain a better understanding of backend web design and to display my hard work, I have decided to take it step further and host the website on a raspberry pi 3 using a Ubuntu or Debian operating system.  I have already purchased a  domain name from goDaddy and I am waiting for a microSD card to come in the mail before I can start working on the backend.  

While searching for how to use the domain name I had bought and connect it to my website, I came across a lot of webserver programs such as Amazon EC2.  Do I still need to use one of these services if I am using apache and plan on building a rudimentary backend using php or another language? 

Furthermore, as a broke and often unemployed college student, I am trying to build this website at as little of a cost and as much of an intellectual gain as possible.  Are there any other programs or webservices I must acquire/purchase to make this portfolio website a reality? Or, are there other programming topics I should seek more information on?

Additionally, I am learning Node.js on freeCodeCamp as I will be interacting with it in some form during my internship.  I am using npm and a linux command line.  What is a Node.js server used and more importantly, where/how would I incorporate one into my website? I found this on stackoverflow but I still don't have a clear understanding.
&gt; Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily 
&gt; building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, 
&gt; non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for 
&gt; data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices"

My problem isn't so much finding a job in the industry but that compared to most of my graduating friends who are starting with 6 figure salaries at Microsoft, Google, or some silicon valley startup the pay I've seen in the space industry is just much lower. Are there any companies in the industry that buck that trend a bit and pay higher salaries that I should look at? Of course Microsoft is known for overpaying compared to industry averages but there are still plenty of high paying similar jobs.

In the end I'm going into the space industry either way. It's not like I'm going to suddenly not work in the field I've basically spent my life working towards, but if I can get more out of it financially that's of course preferred."

5neeau,210,2017-01-11,Just fucking read (thoughts on self-improvement),ContentFarmer,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/5neeau/just_fucking_read_thoughts_on_selfimprovement/,"I wake up at 5am each morning so I can spend a couple of hours reading before getting ready for my day. This began as simply a way to get more reading done. Reading has been central in my life as long as I can remember, but as I transitioned into the adult world I found reading (like fitness and friendships) got squeezed out by the bullshit we’re told is important. As the habit of early morning reading has become more deeply engrained in my routine, though, it has leveled me up in ways I couldn’t have predicted. My students think I’m nuts. My wife is reserving judgment. I think it’s fucking awesome.

Now, I’ve always liked reading. I grew up in libraries, and I don’t remember a time that I couldn’t make sense of a book put in front of me. Here’s the thing, though: Even if I hated reading, the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks by such a massive margin, that I couldn’t justify not doing it. 

**It’s like free weights for your brain**	
&gt; “The best routine is the one you can stick to.” ― Anon

Books as dumbbells might be a tired cliche (is ‘tired cliche’ a tired cliche?), but hear me out. When I began bodyweight fitness, I dreaded my routine. I wasn’t good at it, and it made me face some short-sighted assumptions about gym-going mouth breathers that I’d been holding onto for years. It was humbling, and something I did not think was sustainable. I was not strong, I was not fast, and I only owned two pairs of athletic shorts.

The one thing I had a surplus of, though, was determination. Even though I wasn’t good at my routine, I showed up on a regular, tightly-observed schedule, and did it. Workout days turned into workout weeks, and workout weeks became months. As time went on I began to feel like one of my old D&amp;D characters. I could feel myself level up. Eight pull-ups became thirty. Bodyweight squats turned to deep step-ups, which turned to barbell squats. I got better, harder, and stronger.

**But this is about reading**

And reading is no different. As I’ve recommitted myself to a literary life, I’ve realized the same gains. It’s harder to measure than counting push-ups, but the improvement is the same. As I’ve settled into this ritual the last few years, this steady commitment to my routine has sharpened me. It has made me a clearer thinker. It has invigorated my mind and has allowed me to shift through stages of early-morning grogginess and begin my workday in top gear.

Reading is fitness for your brain. Not only that, but long-form reading has been shown to have a centering and calming effect on the mind. Many benefits of reading are obvious and well-documented, and I won’t rehash them here, but I want to take a moment to talk about a few less obvious ones.

**Reading turns great thinkers into your own personal mentors**
&gt; 	“The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.” ― Plutarch

I first read the book *Slapstick* when I was in 1oth grade. We had an intern in our library named Do Nothing Dave, and he casually mentioned I might enjoy Vonnegut. I walked over to the shelf (where my high school library [mercifully, astoundingly] had the collected works) and browsed until I found something that looked interesting. What I read is a book that Vonnegut would--late in life--call the worst book he’d ever written. For me it was life-changing.

I didn’t know a book could be like this, I remember thinking as I devoured its final pages next to my 3am bedlamp. Not only did Vonnegut expose me to a style of writing that I have never encountered, he exposed me to a style of thinking that was fresh in my life. He was saying things in his books that I was not hearing from any other outlet. He wrote at length about loneliness, war, cruelty, and unhappiness--and he wrote about them in a way that was engaging and hilarious. This is a book that the New York times blasted (the best jab comes when the reviewer says that Vonnegut has, “happened to give up storytelling altogether”), but it sent me into a Vonnegut spiral that, by the end of the year, had spun me through everything he’d ever written and implanted ideas that would become foundational in my life.

Since that year I have made a habit of devouring the collected works of authors I love--from Douglas Adams to William Zinsser. The result has been that each one has claimed a small part of me, and I--in turn--have synthesized them into something of my own. These men and women have mentored--and continue to mentor--me to this day.

**Reading provides the latticework for thinking clearly**
&gt; 	""...the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” ― F. Scott Fitzgerald

In my adult life, about 95% of my reading is non-fiction. Taking in a good non-fiction book has an effect on me similar to drinking a glass of cool water when I’m thirsty. It is refreshing, invigorating, and satisfies something almost fundamental to my biology. 

Non-fiction, though, has a clearer benefit. Good non-fiction writing is often marked by its structure. To be convincing, it must be arranged logically--with each new idea or rung of an argument coming only after the author has firmly secured his footing on the previous rung. Exposure to this structure shapes your brain to expect similar rigidity in your own thinking. When you condition yourself to interpret these logical structures, you condition yourself to think in these same structures. It’s not that reading makes you smarter--it's that reading gives you the ability to manipulate your thoughts and hold two opposing thoughts in tandem. It builds the latticework that your own critical capacities hang from.

**It provides the foundations from where you can comprehend the world**
&gt; “If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.”  ― Haruki Murakami, Norwegian Wood

Beyond this, a healthy regime of reading informs. It educates. It exposes you to worlds outside of your own. Reading widely will not make you an expert in any field, but it WILL provide the low-level background signal that will allow you to make connections. 

In Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From he explores the origin of good ideas. What he comes down to is this: If you want good ideas to happen, put different people with different areas of expertise in a place where they can slam into one another.  Apple does it (they famously designed 1 Infinite Loop with centralized resources); Facebook does it (they have the largest open office plan in the world); and Google does it.

The good news is that you don’t need their billions of dollars in capital to create a microcosm of this in your own world. With the power of regimented reading, you can turn yourself into a one-man idea creation machine. 

Reading broadly gives you the fodder to make the connections that lead to good ideas. This is why Bill Gates sets aside time in his schedule to undergo Think Weeks and Warren Buffett says his primary course of doing business is to, “just sit in his office and read all day.” Successful people understand the power of habitual, regimented reading, and they take great strides to make it routine.

**It habitualizes learning** 
&gt; “The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read.” ― Mark Twain

And this is perhaps the most important reason to read. Creating a reading habit will create a learning habit. It will force you to level up.

Ultimately, I’m not just advocating for reading. Putting the latest James Patterson on your nightstand to tumble through for ten minutes before bed isn’t going to make a much of a dent in your intellectual fitness. 

Instead what I’m advocating is to make reading a habit in the same way that you would the gym. Look at your daily routine, choose a time that will work, and stick to it like your life depends on it.

After a week of this the response becomes Pavlovian. Whatever time you’ve set aside for reading will begin to feel natural. As you settle into your usual place each day, you’ll find that your transition into deep focus is easier than the day before. Your mind will begin to feel elastic and and receptive, taking in new ideas, combining them with old, and cranking out something uniquely your own.

**The Takeaway**
&gt; 	“If you go home with somebody, and they don't have books, don't fuck them.” ― John Waters

Reading is a sort of wonderdrug. It makes you smarter, improves your empathy, boosts memory, reduces stress, provides entertainment, calms the mind, connects you to the world around you, and makes you more attractive to the opposite sex. 

If they sold this in a pill, you’d pay $1000/month for it.

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter what you read (although I would caution that while infotainment like reddit feels informative, it generally has the nutritional value of reading a Lucky Charms box). And don’t get hung up on the medium (I prefer reading on a iPad mini converted into a rich ereader, but I also subscribe to magazines, have hard copies of books, and will take most anything in a pinch). The most important thing is that you pursue reading that you find interesting. Beyond that, I will only invoke the old computer science adage, “Garbage in, garbage out.” Fiction, non-fiction, long-form articles--we live in a world that is rich with great writing and bursting with new and interesting ideas that are waiting to be digested.

So my advice? Embrace it. Habitualize it. Make it as routine as going to the gym or getting a good night’s  sleep. Wake up early; stay up late; ditch the dopamine delivery system in your pocket and bring a book with you everywhere you go. However you manage it, just fucking read."
5neilp,8,2017-01-11,"I've been here before, but I needed to say it again. Bit of a rant.",chewyhulksmash,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/5neilp/ive_been_here_before_but_i_needed_to_say_it_again/,"Background info: 26 (F) married 8 years to 26 (M) and together for 12, 2 year old boy, 7 month old girl. STBXH cheated at various levels over the last 3 years.  

Often times this sub has been more therapeutic than the actual therapy that I am in. I have been increasingly angry lately and I find it more difficult to maintain my level of external apathy toward my STBXH. Yesterday I was so angry about everything he has done that I couldn’t muster more than two word responses to him. I know I cannot stay in this place forever and I need to process through it. I guess I just want to feel heard. I want to verbalize everything he has done and feel zero guilt because I worry it might change the way that someone views him.

When I think about my financial situation moving forward bitterness does not begin to describe my feelings. I worked 40+ hours along with going to school full time and part time internships to provide for us while he barely worked part time and dicked around playing video games excessively. He proceeded to live above our means, take out multiple credit cards in my name and his, take out school loans in my name and irresponsibly spend. Meanwhile I was working my ass off and also processing the death of a loved one. One of the harder times of my life. He couldn’t be bothered to help with financial responsibilities, household, or be there for me emotionally. The day before my grandmother’s funeral I had one request “Please just don’t leave my side today.” He drove away after I pleaded with him in a puddle of tears so he could play football with some buddies.

His pattern of cheating goes something like this:

“I need space and I think I might want a divorce. Idk, can you just let me process and leave me alone?”

Approximately 3 days later I would find evidence of some online relationship and eventually a real one that he would try to lie about and say was a friendship. Only to then compare me to the OW and explain why they were so much better than me and how he just hasn’t been happy. Meanwhile just days prior everything would seem fine. No fighting, spending time together, and seemingly get along in every facet of our relationship.  

He meets women by answering want ads online. Over the last 3 years (including our 7 month separation) there have been about 12 women that I know of. Most of which he has told me about because I have come to realize that he is a massive narcissist.

The first time I found out about the cheating he was deployed. I centered my life around supporting him. I made sacrifices wherever I could to maintain connection with him. I mailed him a care package every single week for 9 months with baked goods in it and all of his favorite things. I was a fucking bomb ass wife – not perfect, but god damn I put my best foot forward even after all of the emotional abuse. What did I get in return? I got “I want a divorce so I can talk to other women, but I don’t want you to actually file, I still want to talk every day, be best friends, and still have sex…but we’re not together, you understand, right?”

 NO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

When I would feel utterly confused by his actions and words he would tell me that he’s been clear. That he doesn’t understand why I feel confused.

The second time was shortly after we decided to have our first baby. I was about 6 months pregnant with our son and suddenly I heard the words “I need space.” It felt like the floor was falling out from under me. My suspicions were right and there was someone else. I should have left him then and never looked back. I spent 3 days on the floor of our bathroom. I barely slept or ate and actually started to drop so much weight while pregnant that my doctor was concerned. I was a complete mess. I waited for him to figure himself out. I did the “pick me” dance. I let him manipulate me yet again. This time I was more desperate than before because I so badly wanted my family to be happy and whole. During those waking hours of enlightenment he said things like “I don’t know what is wrong with you. I don’t know why you are trying to make me feel bad with all of this crying. I just want to be happy. Don’t you want me to be happy?” Add that to the confusing statements about not wanting to actually file for divorce and remain best friends with benefits. So eventually I decided to move on again. He ignored my pleading for counseling and insisted we didn’t need it and neither did he. I have been an individual counseling off and on for almost six years. Not necessarily because I have some massive thing to sort out—I just think it’s very healthy especially during times like this.

Then there was the third and last time. We decided to try for baby #2. We hit it out of the park with the first one and we wanted one more. Late in my pregnancy he came home talking all about his new coworker that he was training. More and more stories every day. My red flags started going up. I started to feel uncomfortable. I am not inherently a jealous person, but given our history I thought it was worth a conversation. He got angry and told me that it was absurd that he couldn’t have female friends. Our daughter was 2 weeks old and suddenly he “needed space” again. I lost my mind. Then I looked into my daughter’s eyes and thought about the example I wanted to set for my kids. I started to realize that he was never changing. That I was going to be one of “those women” that become this hollowed out empty shell of a person. One of those people that get their joy stolen by the toxic people in their life. Because I have so much joy. I am such a happy person and I am ecstatic to say that I have found my way back to that. A few days after he asked for space I found sext messages between him and his coworker that were just “friends.” This was about an hour after we had just been intimate. I finally asked him to leave. Demanded it actually. He refused to leave.

A few weeks go by of utter hell where I left my home and took my kids with me because I could not be around him anymore. I finally went back because it was a struggle with me and 2 little ones sleeping in one room. He still refused to leave. Over the last 7 months he has tried to manipulate me into emotionally staying. He said he wanted a divorce but kept feeding me the same lines about sex, friendship, and never filing. I finally emotionally left. I checked out. I pulled away. I got all of the necessary paperwork for divorce and am filing with my lawyer in the next few weeks. He has complained at me every step of the way. He has tried to make me feel inadequate about everything from being a wife, a mother, and anything else he can think of. When that doesn’t work or get a rise out of me he tries to compliment me and be overly positive then comes the affection. He has gotten drunk multiple times and made unwanted sexual advances that have left me in tears. He has been in contact with countless women to fill whatever void that he has. Most recently he has said “when are you getting a better job so I don’t have to pay so much in child support?”

I am angry about all of it. Angry about the lying, the cheating, the inability to be a decent partner and the ease he feels about destroying any potential home our children would have had. Over the last few months I have quickly realized how much he was controlling me. I gave in to his every whim because I wanted to make him happy. He got out of any responsibility by simply saying he doesn’t like doing X,Y, and Z. Guess what?! Sometimes I don’t want to adult either! But we’re adults! At least one of us is. It got so bad that I realized I was doing everything and I was doing it with a smile because I just wanted to be happy and I wanted him to be happy. But I was so alone and so broken.

I feel relieved that I have broken free, but I am bitter an angry about all of the scars it has left me with. I am angry about all of the things I gave up. I gave up an internship in Prague, Spain, and at the White House. I postponed law school so we could have kids. Looking back I cannot help but feel like he chose to try and control me thought I essentially would never leave once we had children. It was a matter of weeks after he cheated the first time that he wanted to start trying for a baby. My kids are my world and it is a privilege to be their mother. I love every moment with them. But I hate him for tainting so much of my life.

If you’ve gotten this far, thank you. I just needed to get it out. I needed to say it. Now I am going to go to the gym, I’ll continue to process, and feel grateful that I have broken free and will NEVER go back to that kind of relationship again.

I don’t know what I’d do without this sub. Thanks for the free therapy, guys! "

(not in number of employees but revenue(doubling every year)) I went to a technical school and got A+ certified which i think is a big part about getting this job. However, i want to get into programming and i would really like to get a degree so i am starting college in a week. It is a community college but i will transfer to a state school after 2 years for my bachelors in computer science.

Now my question is, i see people asking a lot about internships during early years of college. My current boss is willing to help me learn programming so i can help build the new website and application to manage inventory while i am in school. i am also going to be working 20 hours a week for him while in school. He also offered to meet on weekends to do one on one programming with him.

Do you think it would be better to apply for different internships while i am in school instead? or would it look better to stay with this company and get real world experience and projects done to put on my resume as well as the one on one experience with him. Even though it would just be this one job not 2-3 internships.

I am not sure what would look better on a resume to potential employers in the future.

Also wanted to add i spoke to my boss about long term positioning with the company after school and he said it will probably grow to the point that a manger type position may come up down the road if it gets big enough and he said he would offer me the position. But he doesn't know if they would have the need for a full time developer.

TLDR: should i stay at my current job throughout college or try and do multiple internships?"

At the same time, I am a post-bacc student (previous degree is a BS in Applied Math) as well with 6 classes left to go for my BS CS. 

It first started out with a 2 person team, the lead dev (who created pretty much everything over the span of 10+ years) and I. He left a year and a half ago and since then I became the sole developer with barely any documentation and way too many things for me to maintain and handle. I find doing classes on top full time work as a sole dev to be very stressful and I feel myself burning out. 

I have crucial classes that I have to take soon such as Algorithms and Operating Systems, I don't think I can sustain doing work and school without my work or grades suffering for it. I want to just finish my degree and be done with it ASAP, but this will require leaving my job. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros:**

- I call the shots when it comes what technologies/frameworks/processes to use.
- Recently promoted, and treated relatively well by the company given my situation.
- Currently involved in a couple of very high profile/visibility projects that replaces our old software.
- Full autonomy in terms of how I work, when I come and go at the office or work from home.
- Was able to self-learn a lot of things related to software development due to this situation.
- Tuition reimbursement

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons:**

- I call the shots (this is a double edged sword).
- No technical mentorship, I feel like I'm coding in a vacuum.
- Codebase is spaghetti and was developed cowboy style with no process to it (no version control, unit/integration tests, CI/builds etc..). Feels like I'm pretty much winging it.
- Burned out and stressed.
- No other developers, team is just me.
- No plans by management to hire some help in the near future.
- Even after promoted, salary feels a little low (68k in NY metro area).
- Company is prone to cycles of profitability/non-profitability due to the industry it is in.
- Take longer (or never) to complete school

If I leave, I will have to pay back ~$6k to the company in tuition reimbursement due to their policy (must stay at company for 1 year), but I've already come to terms with this and will just pay it back.

I still live at home and am not required to pay rent, food, or bills if I quit my job (though I still contribute whatever I can regardless). I have enough money saved I think (26k in savings) to get me by until I finish my degree.

I have an interview with one of the big 4 in a few months that I'd very much like to prepare for. I'd also like to intern at other places just to see what other companies are like since I can stretch out my semesters, but would this be viewed as a step backwards?

I'm pretty much leaning on leaving unless there's a strong argument to be made to stay. What are your opinions?

Thanks for reading!"
5nfgr4,3,2017-01-11,Better paying internship or better experience?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nfgr4/better_paying_internship_or_better_experience/,"Im in CS and I've been looking for Internships on my own this term for the summer. I got two offers and although both aren't big name companies they are still pretty decent imo. One pays a lot, $55/hr and I wanna take it purely for the money; that's more money than my parents make together. but the team is kinda small and they are distributed, plus the interviewer seemed kinda like douche when interviewing, and I'm not that interested in what they do or their stack per say, but I think I could suck it up for the money. they told me in the interview that I wouldn't get any mentorship and that I should treat this like a full time job. Everyone works in cubicles, not much interaction among coworkers, I've heard from previous coops, and everyone's like 40 lol. The other job however I find a lot more interesting, their stack is what I like and the people seem pretty chill and their culture seems nice. The role is more in line with what I may want to do later on. however the pay is pretty low. it was $22/hr, I tried to push them on it, and compared my other offer and they moved to $25/hr, I doubt they would go any higher. the higher paying company has an older stack and is more corporate like, while the lower paying one is a cool new startup with latest tech, and all the hype. If they both had the same pay, I would take the $25/hr one for sure. Is it worth it to suck it up for one term for the money or take a major pay hit and take the lower paying job? It would pay less than half, but I'd say a better job in all other regards, particularly my interests. While the higher paying one is mostly for the money, but I guess I suck it up 9-5, take my pay and go home and work on my own projects. I need help deciding 

EDIT: Same currency, location, the start up has free lunches"

Do they do coding challenges and how do the interviews compare to those of a typical tech company? How stringent are they with GPA/past experiences/etc? I'm hoping to get an internship there at some point during college."

I AM ASKING A SIMPLE A OR B QUESTION. I CANNOT WAIT TIL SAT OR MON**

I haven't had any ""real"" CS internship, just a project I did for the school but I can BS it enough to sound legit. I also don't have any non-school projects, but again I can BS them to sound impressive.

Before I graduated in May, a group of friends and I started building an app, and we are legally a company, although not getting paid (which is a problem since my student loans are near $1000/month, thus why I need to get a job). 

My question is do I put this under Employment, since the most recent thing I have is that internship that ended in May, or do I put it under Projects so that potential employers don't write me off as someone just looking for a side gig (I mean I guess technically I am, but whatever lol). 

I hesitate to put it in Employment because I think would look weird seeing my first job out of college being a CTO, and again this might trigger the employer to avoid me as to not waste money training me just so I can leave down the line. That's why I currently have it under projects, but people pointed out that this creates a huge gap in my employment. What should I do here?"

2) Converting shell scripts into Gradle scripts.

3) Developing an invisible system-level Android app for installing/uninstalling apps and some lower-level JNI-calls.

My name is Colton Smith and I've been a reader of this subreddit for about a year. I'm currently a senior at the University of Washington, majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering and minoring in Applied Mathematics. I also have taken upper level computer science classes and am proficient in a variety of programming languages. This summer I got really interesting in going into quantitative finance and luckily my statistics, math, and CS coursework prepared me well to explore the field. 

I created a blog, https://quantoisseur.wordpress.com/, where I began posting the projects I have done. There is currently a fair amount of content and I am now doing weekly posts. I'd love if you'd check it out and follow it! The primary purpose of the blog is to showcase my abilities to potential employers.

I've been applying to many quantitative trading/research positions but haven't had much luck. If you know anywhere that is hiring that has a good fit for me, please let me know. I'd also consider an internship! Here is my resume:

What can I do to help my odds?,csthrowaway4359,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ngfhh/semirant_frustrated_in_the_internship_search_what/,"I don't know if it's just something I'm doing wrong or the area I'm located in, but so far, my search for a local internship has been total crap. I'll Google search ""software developer internships Philadelphia"" (closest city to me) and find next to nothing that I can apply to. I have also used Glassdoor to look at local companies in the area and go on their company careers web page, but most of them have no internships posted. Do I have to search different cities for any hope? Am I simply doing something wrong here? Is my brain tricking me into not seeing the internships on each page? It's frustrating to not find a semi-decent amount of results when I search. I know there have to be internships available locally. I refuse to believe there's any way a city is *this* deprived of opportunities.

Aside from whatever mistakes I'm making here, I was also wondering:

1. If a local company doesn't have any internships listed, is it acceptable to email them and introduce myself and ask if they are opening up any listings soon?

2. I've been mainly looking for ""Software Developer/Engineer Internship"" as the position. Are there any other variations of that title I should be looking for?

3. Do you have any other pieces of advice you can give to me that may help with the search?

I apologize for the rant, it's just something that I needed to get off my chest. I'm aware most of this is a numbers game, but it seems like an impossible game to play when the numbers are so low. I know I must be doing something wrong, but I can't seem to figure it out."

5ngirv,36,2017-01-11,It's long overdue but here is my story,Olechranon,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/5ngirv/its_long_overdue_but_here_is_my_story/," Early life

           My family goes back multiple generations of Jehovahs Witnesses. My mom became inactive when she was eighteen years old. During this time she went to college for nursing and married my dad at twenty years old. A year later I was born while my parents were twenty one years old. My mom dropped out of college while my dad continued to go to school and work full time. During this time my mom worked days and my dad worked nights. A couple years later my mom started to go back to the meetings. It started out very spread out and not often. My dad never started studying and never became a Jehovahs Witness. 

 Teenage Years

            Years go by and my family turns out to be just like any other Jehovahs Witness family. I have a brother and sister now we live in a decent house and everything seemed fine. It didn't really bother me being a Jehovahs Witness but I did feel like I never fit in. We would get to the Kingdom Hall thirty minutes early and I would just sit in my seat until it started and then when it was done I would sit in there for thirty more minutes while my mom talked to other people. My mom almost forced me to be friends with other people my age from the kingdom hall but all I wanted to do was hang out with kids from school.

 The Divorce

           My parents got a divorce when I was 13, my sister was 8 and my brother 7. My dad divorced my mom because of her being a Jehovahs Witness. It was really hard on all of us. My dad moved around a lot after that and I had to grow up and help take care of my siblings as my mom took it really tough. We had to move to a smaller house and my mom started looking at everything as a blessing from Jehovah. 

 Late Teenage years

           My dad finally settled and found a new wife. She is the biggest bitch in the world but that is another story. I wasn't very close with my dad anymore just because we only saw him every other weekend, I was definitely a mommas boy. My mom started taking the truth very seriously when I was around 17-18 years old. She married a ministerial servant and we started having saturday service at our house and having family study every week and watching all the jw.tv things. I finally had friends in the Kingdom Hall but these friends were brothers and one of them went off to bethel after pioneering and the other was pioneering. I felt I wasn't doing enough and whenver I went out in service I was asked about baptism so I soon made the biggest mistake of my life and that was getting baptized. I was 17 almost 18 when I got baptized and I was happy I was baptized for about the rest of the convention and once that was over I knew I messed up.

Teenage years Chapter 2:

       I did an ama on casual conversation about a year after being baptized. I did it as a last ditch effort to save my faith. You guys bombarded and I tried I really did to try my best and prove that what I was doing was right and I thought it would help my faith but all it did was justify what I already knew and that was I didn't want to be a Jehovah's Witness anymore. Now my whole family is witnesses so it wasn't something that I could just do so I put it off and just faked it and thought I could just do that forever. In may of 2015 I asked a girl I worked with on a date and she said yes. She knew that I was a witness and what that entailed. About a month in I told her I couldn't be a witness anymore and how scared I was. We kept our relationship a secret until August 17th, 2015 when I told my mom what was going on. 

 Aftermath

          I told my mom what was going on on August 17th, 2015 which was a Monday. On Friday I was kicked out and I went and moved in with my dad and stepmom. Not being close with my dad and hating my stepmom we butted heads and I was kicked out of there three months latter. I then went and moved in with my girlfriends parents. My girlfriend was away at college around an hour away so it was just me and her parents. I was going to school too while all this was going on at a small tech school. Her parents treated me amazingly. I lived there for the rest of the school year until my girlfriend and I got our own apartment after the school year.

 present day

         Hopefully this will fill in any holes and just some thing I feel like adding. I am now 21 years old my brother and sister who still live with my mom are 15 and 14. I have seen my mom once in the last year and a half and that was to grab my birth certificate. I am trying to have a good relationship with my dad and stepmom who have two girls now ages 3 and 1. The only reason I go there is to see them and my older siblings too. I am still with my girlfriend and we live in a small town outside of the twin cities. I work 50 hours a week while going to school full-time and I get my associates degree in software engineering this spring. I am trying to get a internship or job after this spring as I want to show my family what I can do and how I can do this without them. I am happy with where I am in life and what the future holds for me.

I appreciate anyone that read the whole thing and I hope it wasn't to bad of grammar or writing as it isn't my strong suit. I appreciate all of you and if you have any questions or anything you want to add just let me know.

The quick of it:  At 21 I had my first temp job at a startup in NYC. It was awful. 

Then, I got an internship at one of the most prestigious brands in the world, and then a full time job with them at age 22 in NYC. 

At 23, I was recruited by larger conglomerate company. This job was super corporate, it was fine, I was there for 10 months, at the same time I was recruited by another luxury brand I love.  I turned 24, I decided that this brand being small, would be a great opportunity to grow and own more things, although not entirely matching my current job/past job descriptions.

I've been at this job now (for under a month) and it's BAD. The systems are messed up, the job scope is bad, the processes are all manual. I've presented to my boss on ways to streamline the job, but I have little faith these changes will even be made. (unless I strap myself to my desk for all hours of the day and push a team in office in a different country to make them. The hours here are AWFUL) The company is so small that there is NOWHERE to move into.

I'm EXTREMELY anxious. Everyone that knows me knows my past and the work I've done and also that i've been at two large companies now. Leaving very early to me would look like i'm flakey, all my references from my first job would lose faith in me, and all of my former coworkers and classmates would question me. These jobs have been a lot of my identity thus far because I'm so young. I was also only at my last job for 10 months, which is the kicker here to me as well. I could've stayed out the year, but I thought this opportunity would be IT.

I'm so anxious it makes me sick to think about all of this. I go to work and I'm kind've in a panic mode about how I won't be able to stay out the year there.. 


Any advice?

*TL;DR - See paragraph with bullet points*

Hi, everyone I'm currently a 2^nd year CompSci student at a University in UK. And as part of my degree I need to do a placement year where I work in the industry. Now Since the start of the academic year I've been looking for placement opportunities in places like GradCracker, RateMyPlacement, LinkedIn, and I even went to careers fairs and talked to people offering placements.

However few months away from the deadline in my school, and many placement application deadlines approaching, I still haven't received any positive indicators showing me that I will actually be able to work somewhere over the coming year.

I've applied mostly for Software/Games/Web Developer roles, and as of yet I've gotten to a technical code review stage of application with one company (haven't heard from them in ~2 months though), and got rejected from another company after it turned out that my application wasn't as strong as other candidates'.

So my ask to r/AskProgramming is some guidance in terms of:

* Where do companies post about placement opportunities they are offering?
* If your company has a placement scheme, what things are your HR &amp; Devs are looking for in the applicants?

Any type of help would be useful at this point as I'm starting to panic ever so slightly, thanks!

As such, I'm focusing all my attention on finding an internship for summer.

The problem is that as of right now when I look on indeed/glassdoor I see only 83 internships relating to NLP in the *entire US*.  Some of these are PhD only positions, others are not even remotely related to NLP.  Some of these are duplicates, such as:

AI research Intern - Big 4 - SF Bay Area

5nh9ws,2,2017-01-11,Survivor Borneo Rewatch (SPOILERS),FantasyPNTM,survivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/5nh9ws/survivor_borneo_rewatch_spoilers/,"I'm working a full-time internship this semester, so I've decided to rewatch every season of Survivor. I've already seen them all, of course, but some are foggier than others and I just need some Survivor in my life.

Spoilers ahead (I'm on mobile)

Let's start with the gameplay:
I felt like this season had a lot of potential for gameplay, but it never went anywhere. So many people (Gretchen, Colleen, other Pagongers) had such great perceptive skills and really understood what was happening around them, but they didn't DO anything about it. It was clear that the experience was meant as an adventure to some and a game to others, but ultimately I don't think the relative lack of gameplay detracted from the overall season.

Let's talk about the location. Borneo was absolutely beautiful. Those sunrises and sunsets were just DAMN! I felt like the contestants had it pretty easy, honestly... seeing how little other castaways get in the future, the two tribes made out from the marooning like bandits! Too bad there wasn't much TAPIOCA.

The challenges: A lot of these challenges were clunky, if we are being completely honest. ""The Survivor Witch Project"" felt hoaky, though "" I don't know"" definitely saved it, and I was surprised by the easiness (both physically and mentally) of the challenges. And I hate to say it, but without jeff's commentary (as long as it isn't incessant) the challenges were just kind of dull.

The cast: This is a character driven season, and these characters are what allow the season to succeed. We get a firm grasp on who everyone is, and I feel like they're all pretty fleshed out. Casting definitely succeeded in finding 16 headstrong leader-types for this first season, which might have rendered most of the pre-merge boots (BB, Joel, Stacey) a little dislikable. As always, there were a few standouts.

Rich: He really had an excellent grasp of social relationships, and is truly the father of the game. Honestly, I feel like his fishing abilities and work ethic greatly contributed to the formation of his alliance, but he most definitely deserved the win over Kelly.

Kelly- Kely was possibly the most complex character. Her conflict between right and wrong was interesting and at times frustrating, but her final tribal council performance just felt false. Rich truly pummeled her.

Rudy- well, he was honest. I think a lot of what Rudy said wouldn't fly today, but he was and clearly still is from a different generation. He wasn't malicious or oppressive: he merely had a different upbringing that didn't necessarily change the way he treated people, just how he thought of them. Great source of comedic relief, but to be honest I don't know how he's still alive. He seemed like he would croak any second 17 years ago.

Sue- I didn't realize how likeable and intelligent Sue was until the rewatch. She really had her finger on the pulse of what was going on, and I felt like she was perhaps the second most deserving of the Tagi 4 for the win. That final speech was iconic, and I couldn't help but feel sad for Sue, who really loved living on the island and thought she had made such a strong bond with Kelly.

Sean- absolute doofus.

Colleen- Perhaps my favorite survivor contestant of all time. Such a shame that she didn't want to (not that she couldn't) play the strategic game. She was so witty, and bright, and funny and just shone throughout the entire season. So glad she's been able to live a happy life outside of the spotlight.

Gervase/Jarvis/gervis/gervace- Moo

Jenna- I didn't remember how peppy Jenna was on this season! That incessant talking was sort of grating, but she was a good egg.

Greg- He was honestly too intelligent for this game. What he wanted from the experience conflicted with the nature of the game of Survivor, but he was still exciting to watch and such an enigmatic character.

Gretchen- Would love to see Gretchen return. One of the purest and kindest contestants in Survivor history.

A few dull moments might have dimmed the season, which seems like a totally different show to today's ""BIG MOVEZ"" iteration, but overall the arc of the show was really interesting to watch.

I am now going for my B.S in Computer Science. Because I transitioned from a more math oriented degree, I am a bit short in terms of programming abilities/knowledge. I have taken a total of three computer science classes. HTML/CSS web development, fundamentals of programming one, and fundamentals of programming two (using C++). I was looking into internships for CS for this summer and found that it seemed I am a bit shy of the qualifications. I see a lot of ""must be proficient in language X"". I haven't taken data structures or anything where I had to do coding with javascript. I do not feel proficient in any language yet. So are there any places/internships/work I seem qualified to do over the summer where I could be paid, and do something within my aptitude, utilizing the skills I have obtained. Are there any types of work or places you can think of where I would exercise the skills I have so far with a  slight emphasis on math, since I have more of that. I want to build my coding skills, but I don't want to work where I feel overwhelmed and under qualified. Thanks for any info or resources. "
5nhmmw,6,2017-01-12,Have I messed up as a final year CS student?,whatamidoingjaypeg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nhmmw/have_i_messed_up_as_a_final_year_cs_student/,"-New Zealand

Right now its summer school and I am just taking some elective subjects to make my workload less during my final year this year. What I have recently found out though is that apparently you are already supposed to have professional level experience by now, interning in your 1st/2nd year of University.

This however doesn't make any sense to me, why would a company pay a 1st/2nd year student which doesn't know anything to Intern at their company? I wasn't really informed of how you're supposed to transition from University into the work force so I guess this is a good time to ask now.

Being a last year student in University with no professional level experience have I messed up my chance at getting a job? I don't have the faintest clue on how Internships or Job applications even work, previously I had thought that after you finish your degree you just simply send out applications to companies you wish to work for, but now that seems completely wrong since I heard people have been interning on their 1st/2nd year.

Pretty worried right about now, how do I go about lessening the damage already done? Any New Zealand CS grads have any advice? "
5nhttk,1,2017-01-12,Non-technical internship at BlackRock or IT at small hometown company?,TonyDarko,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nhttk/nontechnical_internship_at_blackrock_or_it_at/,"Hey /r/cscareerquestions, trying to make a decision for internship offers.

I'm a CS student (CS/Computer Engineering double bachelors), have had five internships (in different types of engineering, none of which are traditional software dev. Automation and control systems would be ""closest""), and am coming up on my last summer of internships before I graduate.

I was offered a role at BlackRock in NYC working on a team that is basically an intermediate between a software team and clients, they support the software and do minor SQL/UNIX work.


My other option is returning to the place I've worked at, a consumer product good company in California and working in IT. It would be my 6th summer there, which I feel pigeonholes me a lot, but the experience seems to be more relevant. However, it is not a big-name company (medium-sized, 5000 employees) and I definitely want to get out of my hometown.


My goal is to get a software development job in SV. Which of these two offers would be a bigger benefit? Any other advice?

**BlackRock pros:**

* NYC, new place to explore. 
* Big Name
* Love the company and it's goals. Would love to work in their software teams
* Get to learn SQL/Unix 

**BlackRock Cons:**

* NYC is expensive
* Less technical internship, more business focused
* Move across country

**Hometown Company Pros:**

* IT internship, (Angular, Java Spring, etc.) 
* Live at home (better in terms of spending)

**Hometown Company Cons:**

* Don't want to stay at the company at all
* Have to stay in hometown (terrible town in CA)

5nhtv1,80,2017-01-12,Meet Debbie Diva,LadyLlamaDrama,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5nhtv1/meet_debbie_diva/,"Hello there ladies (and llamas). I've been lurking for almost a year at this point, reading through your stories and getting my daily fix of crazy. It's been incredibly refreshing to realize that I'm not the only one with MIL issues. Mine stem back just about six years when I started dating my D(ear)H. He truly is the sweetest, kindest, most wonderful man - some days I'm not quite sure where he gets it from. Which brings me to my point: allow me to introduce Debbie Diva. 

On our first date, my DH told me that his mom could be kind of crazy and hard to handle. I shrugged it off, I've dealt with plenty of crazy in my life. Our first few meetings were totally fine, Debbie Diva and I got along fine and while she wasn't overtly warm and fuzzy to me, she tolerated me and treated me nicely enough. The first time I saw her claws was when DH was offered an incredible opportunity through school - a several month long internship a few states away from home. At this point, DH and I had been together about six months, so the thought of going long distance was not super appealing to me. Debbie Diva immediately went on the offensive, touting how important it would be for DH's schooling and how this was such a wonderful opportunity for him. I never asked DH not to take the internship - I actually encouraged it. I knew it would be an awesome experience for him and that if we were meant to be, it would work out. DH on the other hand struggled mightily with this decision and really waffled back and forth for a while. In the end, he agreed, and he decided to move three states away. 

All is well in the world for about five minutes. Easter holiday is coming up, and DH gets a break to come home. This was our first holiday where we were a serious couple and we knew that we'd need to split it between my family and his. Debbie Diva made it extremely clear that she needed to know if we were coming for dinner so that she would know how many to cook for (as if 2 people really changes the plans that much). So I told her that as soon as my family figured out our plans, I'd let her know. My dad is a cardiologist and he was scheduled to be on call for the holiday, so our plans were very tentative. Debbie Diva asked continuously over the weeks prior to Easter. DH just kept telling her that our plans weren't set in stone but we would let her know as soon as they were. 

We finally decided that we would eat dinner at Debbie Diva's house and then go to spend time with my family afterward. Before DH could get in contact with her to tell her that, she texted him that 'he'd better figure it out soon or there wouldn't be place settings for us at their table'. I instantly put my foot down. I told him to tell her that in that case we would be spending the holiday with my family. That completely pulled the rug out from under her as I'm sure she expected me to beg to be included. Little did she know that I don't play those reindeer games. DH and I had a lovely dinner with my family while Debbie Diva pouted with FIL and their neighbors. 

After dinner, DH began feeling guilty and said that he thought he really should get home to see his family. I walked him out to his car and he said 'I never realized holidays could be like that.' I looked at him and said 'Like what?' He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said 'Fun.' Ya'll. All I could do was hug him. It was my first true warning as to how fucked up the next several years were going to be - and BOY did they ever get fucked up. I have some LOVELY stories for your llamas that I'll be writing down and posting for you. Stay tuned and thanks for reading - it feels so good to get it off my chest! "

5ni8n6,1,2017-01-12,"My girlfriend (20F) feels she cannot tell her controlling, emotionally abusive parents about me (19M) and our relationship (on/off for 10 months = 7 months then 3 months).",Blawdfire,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ni8n6/my_girlfriend_20f_feels_she_cannot_tell_her/,"**TL;DR**: Girlfriend has controlling, emotionally abusive parents who aren't accepting of our relationship - or even the fact that she's talking to me. I haven't done anything to deserve this opinion - beyond being a poor boyfriend in a long-distance relationship months ago (we both agree I've addressed that issue). She doesn't have the strength to confront them directly, but is having issues lying to them about the fact that we're with each other. She's stuck feeling like there's no solution, and I think the only solution is to confront them directly, tell them how it is, let them get angry, and deal with it - even if that means cutting them off, because this is an issue more about her freedom as an adult than our relationship. I'm trying to be patient, supportive, and helpful, but it's difficult given that she doesn't seem capable of helping herself and appears to be considering ending our relationship instead of confronting the real problem. Any advice?

---

**Quick summary of our past**: We both go to college together and we first started dating last February. My first encounters with her parents were super positive - I was certain that they, and her siblings, really liked me. Over this past summer, we went back to our hometowns and this became a temporary long-distance relationship. I failed pretty spectacularly at holding up my end of this, partially because I was working 45 hrs/wk in a new internship in a new city, mostly because I was an oblivious idiot and started taking the relationship for granted.

When we returned to school, we were on and off; she would want a break, then we would get back, then break up, then back, etc. (this happened 3-5 times over 2 months). I was devastated thoughout this because it was clear in my mind that we still had a thing for each other. Eventually she broke up with me, but she left the door open and I made it clear how much she meant to me. Several weeks later, she came back and asked if I wanted to try again - turns out her family and friends were pushing for a breakup and it was never what she really wanted. I said yes of course, and we've been pretty happy with each other ever since.

---

Here's where the problem comes in - her mother gets upset with her because she chose to turn down a suitor who had been pursuing her during the downturn of our relationship and had asked her out when we were no longer together. This resulted in her mother acting childish and irrational - demanding my girlfriend call every day, then refusing to answer the phone and later getting upset at her for not calling; this was only one of many irrational, childish, and abusive acts - also including name calling, demanding she stop talking to her (actually supportive) ""unsupportive"" friends, and spreading misinformation to the rest of her family such that they would also be upset with her.

Eventually, this was sorted out(ish). Her mother still appeared to be upset, but would talk to her and their relationship improved. However, her mother continued asking about me and whether or not I would come and hang out with her and our mutual friend group. Then comes winter break - my girlfriend and I still want to make the effort to see each other over the break, so she agrees to tell her parents about us and see what happens. She puts this off indefinitely, she eventually tells them we're ""talking"" when we agree to see each other to exchange Christmas gifts. Her mother's reaction was to say nothing and walk away.

We met at a mall roughly halfway between us - the plan was to get lunch. On the drive there, her mother calls and starts screaming about how deceitful she's being and how she's to be back home house within the hour. We exchange gifts, talk about how this is pretty much the only time we'll see each other, and cry a bit. She leaves, and when she gets home her mother takes her phone away - only to give it back 4 days later on the condition that she's not to talk to me. We still talked, but it was always texting during the day and calling at night when her parents were in bed.

---

**Aside regarding her family**: Her family is really, really close. Like insane, unhealthy close. They do literally everything together, her mom makes her watch movies with her (pretty much all day) when she's home and they even appear to refuse to run errands without dragging my girlfriend along with them (they'll put them off until she can come - this is just trivial stuff like returning something and going grocery shopping). My girlfriend really doesn't enjoy her time at home. Now that she's back at school, her mother still requires that she call her once a day, and her family requests she text them every day. Her mother's the worst - her father has no guts and just gives in to what her mother wants and they've raised their children to accept everything she says as gospel. It's clear that her mother has the expectation of her being a perfect human being - and gets angry when my girlfriend makes a decision that she disagrees with.

---

We're back at school now; we saw each other for the first time in weeks just last night. She really wants to talk to me about a number of things that are bothering her - mostly how she can't handle lying to them about us still (obviously) being in contact. She recognizes that it's absurd that her mother thinks she can control who she talks to, but it seems like she thinks our relationship is a problem until she can handle her mother.

Here's what I'm asking - we're clearly both very passionate for each other. I love her. She loves me. There's no question there. She needs to figure out how to handle her parents, and I don't think she's strong enough to confront them directly. We're talking about everything that's bothering her tomorrow night, so I'll have more to work with then, but I don't know how she can approach this best. 

It's gotten to the point where she's unable to sleep and is having anxiety attacks (which her mother gets upset at her about, of course). Our school provides counselling, which might be helpful but she's gone in the past and I don't think she wants to go again (she has trouble opening up to people she isn't close to). I think she feels stuck, but it's clear that she can't let her parents dictate who she is and how she lives her life."
5niepw,1,2017-01-12,I [25 M] met with my Ex [ 23 F] after half an year away and she gives A LOT of MIXED SIGNALS,PocketTennis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5niepw/i_25_m_met_with_my_ex_23_f_after_half_an_year/,"Hello Reddit!
There is a lot of text, so if you want to know all the details, please read the whole thing. I tried to write down all the things i think might be relevant.

So, here‘s the thing:

Me and my ex broke up half an year ago and a little bit after that she went abroad for studying. 
I initiated the breakup by asking that we should talk about where we both are in the relationship. The reason for the breakup was that she wanted to do something on her own at last, because she had always been dependent on other people and didn′t want to occupy her thoughts with what′s going on back home (Meaning she wanted to have sex with other men and be more adventurous). I said that if she does not want the same as me (which was having a clear way to identify what we both are) it would be hard to stay friends and that it‘s better to stop seeing each other. This came out of the blue for her. I was also sure that she would have broken up with me shortly before going abroad for the same reason I mentioned above (which she actually also said was true, but did not say how she intended to do it). 

**Some background on the girl:**

She has always been very polite, but she would many times say nothing concerning very important things, such as „where do we stand in this relationship“ and things of the sort. She would mostly wait until somebody starts talking about this stuff. If she DOES initiate a conversation about something of the sort, she would feel very bad and sad about it, I guess because she wants to be liked by everyone ant that by saying things more directly she might hurt somebody. This is another thing about her – she finds it hard to say „No“. She likes to meet people and have a lot of friends. Also, she is not really the Social media type – she does post things on Facebook, but rarely and mainly a Photo or two of her with some friends posing at something. Still, she IS very social. When meeting people she would always show interest and ask about the person. In this case though, 30 % of the time this Interest is genuine and not simply being „nice“. With this I mean that she would ask how are you doing, and if she remembers something about a thing you mentioned at one point, she would ask you about it. 

During her time abroad we texted from time to time, she being the one to initiate it. We kept things short, we wrote every week or two, both of us answering sometimes on the same day, sometimes two weeks later, neither of us explaining any details about the things we are doing. 

She was gone for 5 Months, but she recently came back. I met her three times already. The first and the second we were not alone, there were other people aroung – both times at her home. The first time I had to bring her mother some stuff because I give her some Computer lessons, the next time she invited me to a „I am back again“ party – nothing big, just some cake, soft drinks and music. 

Both of these times she would give me A LOT of signs. She would sit next to me, she would ask me what i would like to drink and would pour it for me in my glass, she would help me wear my jacket on, look at me and smile and so on. Still, we didn′t have time to talk one on one about anything really. Still, this could have been simply her being nice. 

Of course, I saw the way she was acting as a possibility for hooking up or starting to date again and asked her on a text a couple of days later to go and grab a Coffee. She said yes and two days later we met at a very nice Coffee shop. 

My Idea about the whole meeting was to talk about how it the last five months she was not there. I didn′t want to start talking about the whole relationship thing and ask her uncomfortable things, because I know that she would never answer in a direct manner and that when a girls knows what the guy wants to hear, she would say it in a way that it could  mean two opposite things. 

So as I said, I wanted to do some catching up and if she remotely mentions something about the two of us to also talk a little bit about that. 

The whole atmosphere was nice, also she laughed a lot, mainly because I could always make her laugh.
I asked her to describe her time abroad it in two words. She found that difficult, so I told her three words is also OK. She laughed. The first word was tiring, the second one I forgot, but the third word was „Full of events“ which is one word in the language we both speak. She then smiled a little bit and looked at the celling. I repeated the word playfully, but she just lightly bit her lips, just for a second and said nothing more.

I asked her about her stay abroad, the places she visited, how it was compared to what she knew before that, how the visits by her friends went, how was Christmas and new year and so on and so on.
She asked NOTHING about what I did in the last five months, how the wedding of my best friend was, which she knew about, how my internship was, which she also knew about, how my stay back home was (because I am a foreigner). I found that funny and it was the first thing that started making the whole thing a little bit unpleasant. Still, I carried on as if nothing had happened.

I didn′t want to start directly with touching her in any ways, because it was the first time we saw each other alone for a long time. She would always be kind of on the edge of the couch we were sitting on. At times our legs would touch a bit and she would not react on it. One time she joked and i poked her with my finger in her hand. At one point when she was showing me a photo on her phone I used this opportunity to place myself better on the couch, so when she puts her phone back in her purse our legs would touch a little bit more. The moment they touched she moved her leg away from mine while continuing to talk. 

If she did ask me something, which was not really that often and if she did ask, it was more like „how are studies?“ „how′s my mom doing in her computer lessons“ she would look at different parts of my body, being my hands, my arms, my hair, my shoulders, neck and so on while I was talking. I also talked about that me and two other girls, one of which she knows, study together four days in the week at the library. Also she knows that I am leading a University group, where at this point there are a lot of attractive girls. Actually at this specific University group me any my ex started dating (before I got to lead it). 

At one point a couple entered the Coffee shop and I thought that I knew the guy, so I started looking in his direction.My ex noticed that and she did that as well, but for less time and was trying to hide it. I guess she thought I was looking at the girl. I did this a couple of more times on purpose and she repeated it as well. A couple of minutes later she said she had to go to the Restroom. On the way there I think she took a look at the girl in question. 

I was thinking about leaving soon, so I asked her when she had to go, because the way I know her, she was always having plans for everyday, weeks beforehand. She said she still had time and that she could stay a little bit longer. 

Until then the way the whole conversation went down, there was no easy way asking about more personal things without being too direkt and potentially making her uncomfortable or making me too curious about things, which for THIS kind of meeting I think was not a good idea. 

While she was talking how living with three other girls in an apartment was not so pleasant I jokingly said „Now I see why your time abroad was so „full of events““. Again, she said nothing, just kind of twisted her lips a little bit. 

Just before leaving she asked me if I still had contact with a female friend of ours who is also abroad at this point. We are both friends with this girl, which if I had to guess, likes me better and contacts me more than my ex. Also, she was the first to learn about us starting to date and then breaking up. Also I must note that I see this girl as a friend only and that we haven′t seen each other for five months as well. I said yes, I do still have contact with her, and that we also sent each other presents for Christmas. She said cool, that′s nice. I guess she asked because she was curious if I have been asking that girl about her. 

We left the Coffee shop, we hugged each other and I told her we should meet again at some point and that I′ll call her. She asked me if I will be on two specific small circle events which she was also attending. I said that I would be at one of them, about the other one was not sure. 

Then she said: Ok, so we′ll maybe see each other tomorrow (event one); if not, on Sunday (event two) if not - at some point after that. I answered playfully „Maybe“, we both said Bye and continued home. 

**TL;DR: Met ex after her being abroad for half an year, first two times very short with other people, with LOTS of positive signals, which still might have been her simply being nice, third time at a Coffee shop for a couple of hours, nice and fun atmosphere, she would try to avoid physical contact, would not ask me anything about what I′ve been doing the last few months, and says some vague things.**

Guys, I have my own take on the whole situation. While writing this text I have also had the chance to analyze the whole thing on another level. But still, I′ll be happy to see what you have to say.

And please, no „One word answers“ or „Forget her“. If so, please explain yourself at least a little bit.

Edit: Formating and 1 sentence explaining there is a lot of text"

No one intervenes. I'm furious, but am I in the right?**


Hi everyone! 
Sorry this is going to be long.



I really need some advice on a situation that took place at a birthday party last night.
 
I've been with my boyfriend for a month now, after dating for 2 months, and last night I was supposed to meet his friends. 
It was his best (female, not that it matters) friend's birthday party.

They are going away with 30 other people  (SOs included) to a cabin in another state this weekend to celebrate her birthday. 
We had a conversation earlier this week about how I completely understand that I  wasn't invited to that, as I'm such a new girlfriend, *but* didn't like that he basically lied to me saying that he wasn't bringing me because 'the rooms had been blocked weeks earlier '. When I came across a Facebook post that basically told me that wasn't true I asked him what the deal was.
And mind you, like I said, I'm fine not being invited this early into a relationship but I didn't like him not giving it to me straight but instead lying about it.


But anyway, we talked it out, everything's aok. So a couple of days later he tells me the same friend is going to have a little birthday party in our city (the one we went to last night) and he'd like me to come and meet everyone.  

Ok sure, I'll come! 

Now to the issue ; the day before he mentions his ex is probably going to be there in a very offhand manner. 
I was like, umm look, I'm not sure that's the kind of situation I'd want to meet your friends in. Small party, maybe 10 people around a table all of whom I've never met. And his ex.
All of who work in the same field (advertising) and are coworkers and friends. I'm in the medical field fwiw.

He said to please come, she probably wouldn't even show, his friends were going to love me. 
I said I was worried it would need an awkward situation know top of meeting his friends and that I was a little worried they'd just talk job and I'd be an outsider.


But honestly, I'm an eternal optimist and I thought, nah this is all going to turn out just fine. I'm good with people, I'm friendly and I'm enough of an adult to nicely kill an ex with kindness if need be.


Boy, this time optimism came back to bite me. 

Not only was she already there when we got there, his best friend specifically brought her as his plus one, she was sat right next to me and I was at the end of a bench. With my boyfriend across from us and all of his friends on the other side of her. 
I had no way of placing myself anywhere else so I was stuck. 

So I thought come on, put on your big girl panties and tried to make friendly conversation with her. Alright. Seemed to work. Then his best female friend came and squeezed in next to me to say hi, which was nice. 

The issue started right after. 
I don't expect anyone to ask me a lot of questions but they literally asked me ""what do you do?"" and I told them a little about it and that was it. No more interest in me as a person whatsoever. 
They talked about work the entire night.
Fine, I could have just brought myself into the conversation, except I did, only to be ignored if I did anything but ask about pr accounts. 
Not the greatest start,  but the real issue was that his ex had apparently decided she needed to mark her territory. 
So (since they all worked together for years) she started 

- literally directing a flurry of inside jokes (some of which I thought were his and mine :( ) at my bf

- talking over me every time I try to say something to follow up with some ""Hey ex bf do you remember that awesome time when...?"" Thing

- kept mentioning how his parents were, how she was such good friends with his best friends, how she hangs out with them aaaalllll the time

- kept saying how she was the best intern at their former office and not one of those girly girls (sideeye over to me) which was why they could put her in the same office as my bf and his friends because she just gets their ""man- humor"".

- kept asking me ""has he told you this or that yet??"" Or ""you know how he always...""
Or ""oh, you *don't* know about that time when/thing he does????here let me tell you""

Honestly, it was torture. I refused to just get up and leave after 10 minutes so I sat through over 3 hours of this, literally being nothing but nice, while my bf and his 2 best friends looked on and even engaged with ""yes that was totally awesome, oh yes I  do that *alll the time* 


When we left he almost went off with them after I said I had to go the other way (glad to finally be able to fucking run for it , I was) and didn't even offer to walk me to the subway until I kind of annoyed said ""Hey are you not going to walk me back?"" 

I was incredibly upset with him and told him so immediately when we git back (at this point we'd both had a little to drink, it being a party) and so I was quite emotional and probably meaner then need be, but he kept saying that yes it was shitty (even though he also said ""come on, 2slothalicious4you, she didn't really say anything against you, it wasn't that bad!"") but that he had no fault in it, and neither did his 2 best friends. 

I on the other hand am upset with him because at any point could he have just interrupted the long-ass stroll up memory lane but he didn't and even engaged , his best male friend who brought the ex (bf says, well of course he did, they're friends!) and also his female bestie, because she was also watching the whole thing unfold and didn't put a stop to it (bf says: it's not her fault, she had only known me for half an hour why would she defend me) 

Reddit, am I  overreacting????

I'm honestly furious. I feel like I was humiliated in front of people I was supposed to officially meet, I feel like I handled the situation with as much grace as I could muster, and I'm upset and confused why his friends would think this was a good idea or not diffuse the situation. Like my only way out would have been to literally get up and leave, which I feel would have been even more humiliating. 


I did not handle the argument with my bf with grace, I'll admit to that. 
He kept alternating between ""it wasn't so bad"" and ""if it was it wasn't my fault"" and was super concerned with defending his buddies. 
He never even asked how I felt. His apologies were all verbatim ""Sorry, but it wasn't my/our fault""
I honestly felt like I was losing my mind! 


I said, I'd want him to clear up things with his buddy who brought the ex and find out why he thought it was such a good idea  
I also feel like him going on this weekend trip with these friends  ( ex isn't coming but would have been invited) 2 days after what I perceive as a major slight happened is kind of a slap in the face for me and shows me where his priorities lie. 
(I was stupid enough to drunkenly cryingly tell him that if I was more important to him he wouldn't go. I know...idiotic)

But his response...he said he doesn't want to upset his friend. I understand that and I also understand that him backing out of the trip wouldn't lessen my discomfort but at no point was he worried  about upsetting me. 

I woke up so upset this morning I literally didn't go to work. 
I look at him and all the little things we shared i thought were unique cutesy quirks suddenly turn out to be just a lukewarm remake of what he had with his ex of 4 months(!). I hate that she got under my skin like that but it makes me feel sick to my stomach and I honestly look at the relationship differently now. I'm a little insecure but usually I feel pretty good about myself. I'm not bad looking, I'll be an MD in a few months, I have my tattoos, which I love and generally a very 'tough girl' vibe going, but I feel.so small right now. 

He kept telling me how I'm the most import thing for him but ""he's not going to ditch his friends "" .like, fucking what dude, when did i ever ask you to do that?
He says if he doesn't go on the weekend we won't be able to hang out with his buddies ever again because they're going to be upset, yet when I said I'm not sure *I* want to hang out with them again he was totally taken aback as to why I'm upset.

I also should say, I don't think my friends would have thought it a good idea to specifically bring an ex of mine to a thing where they KNOW they'll be meeting my new SO and if they did, I'd have a longgggg talk with them. They welcomed my bf with open arms and asked him all about him. Also, if they had accidentally brought on such a situation I think they would have been mortified.



I honestly feel like breaking up with him over this. She's not going anywhere, from the looks of it I'm going to have to bite the fucking bullet every time because he and his friends are going to let her walk all over me. 

He doesn't seem to understand why I'm upset, nor does he seem to care about me being upset vs. potentially aggravating his friends (which of course I don't want either!)


I really don't know what to do.
I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but this really hurt and I feel awful about myself&amp; the situation. 



He kept hugging me and going ""you're so important to me but it's not my fault and there's nothing I can do, also Anna (his friend) is not at fault!!!!"" 


Help!


**TL;DR Boyfriend of a month's ex gfs uses me as scratching post in front of all his friends who I just met. No one intervenes. I'm furious, but am I in the right?**



**UPDATE** **from the comments 
Little update. He has apologized but also asked me to apologize, because I said some nasty things during our fight. I of course did. He maintains that it was a bad thing but says I need to get over it.
I requested he remove her from Facebook because I do not want her to be that involved in our lives. He said no. Now she makes a point to like everything and make sure I know she sees me. I feel very weird about this. He says to not let it bother me, yet won't remove her. He says if I grew a decent self-esteem it wouldn't bother me.
This whole thing is starting to give me anxiety.**

5nir4i,3,2017-01-12,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5nir4i/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5niw5g,3,2017-01-12,Help me escape the poor film student stereotype! (investment/savings advice needed),AFlyingAmigo,PersonalFinanceNZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/5niw5g/help_me_escape_the_poor_film_student_stereotype/,"Kia Ora!
I am a recently-turned 19 year old student, and I am trying to sort out the next five years of my life financially. However, I am in a bit of a different situation than the average NZ student:

From a mixture of inheritance and my own personal savings, I have been able to attend tertiary education without any student loans required. I have just entered the second year of my two year course at a rather well renowned film and television production school (from which I will receive a bachelor of Media Communications, with a major in Screen and Television Production). From this I have been guaranteed a six month paid internship (on the condition that I pass this years course). The school boasts a reputation for holding a 95% job offer rate that comes from these internships. If all goes according to plan, I am going to continue to work for the media or communications company I am assigned to for the next 2-3 years after my internship, continuing to live at home with my family in order to maximize savings (by avoiding standard rent, food costs, power bills etc).

From there is where I make my big decision. My big goal is to set myself up abroad (preferably in the U.S., Canada, England or Japan) and begin working in a more diversified media market, with more opportunities. However, my finances will weigh heavily on this decision, as I will have to support my travel expenses, as well as be able to establish living accommodations and a job from my own savings, while being able to continue to support myself financially.

This all being said, I would like to know what my best options are in terms of acquiring the finances that I need, without taking any loans. Am I in a better position to invest my finances down the road and continue to work in NZ? And is there anything that I can do now or during my first few years of work to give me the most financial benefit (investing etc.) 

I have very slim knowledge on taxes, however, I have estimated that the job market I will come to work in houses an average income of 40k a year, with a 17.5% personal income tax (if my math is wrong here, please let me know). 

So, after saying all of this, please help me escape the 'poor film student' nightmare that plagues me! Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
5njaso,5,2017-01-12,"Am I really learning or just being ""tricked"" that I am learning?",rexonology,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/5njaso/am_i_really_learning_or_just_being_tricked_that_i/,"This is gonna be a extremly, and purposefully, critical post about the Arduino. Im just gonna say that Im addicted to the arduino and am grateful that it had introduced me to the world of electronics. These are just nagging thoughts in my head which I wish werent there XD.

It all started out with the Arduino Starter kit. I was amazed that just by typing a few lines of words and connecting some wires I could make motors move and LCD screens light up. Things that I thought were soooo complicated could be achieved so easily with the extensive amount of libraries in the Arduino IDE that let me control servos effortlessly and achieve RF communication. Theres even WIFI boards like ""The Thing"" from sparkfun that allowed me to connect my Arduino as easily as cooking eggs.

Then one day, after spending a lot of my savings purchasing ""learning products"" that I thought would be a useful way to build up my engineering knowledge, I realised that all my knowledge was based around these products. They existed because someone invented these things that were specifically designed to be Easy to hook people onto using them?

Ive read around people saying that true engineers dont use Arduinos. And I cant help but grudgingly agree with them. Without the IDE and some pre made modules like WIFI boards, I wouldnt even be able to make a LED blink. Now I always have this feeling that my ""learning"" was in fact an illusion.

I know I am being overly critical here, but ultimately, I cant help but feel that Arduino, Sparkfun and Adafruit are all (understandbly) out to earn money at the end of the day. Have I just been brainwashed by their subtle advertising to make their products seem ""educational"" When they really are just designed to be easy to use and give us a false sense of accomplishment? Take those products away and it is as if I had not learnt anything at all. I know this is as ridiculous as saying ""Digital Artisits are all fake because without Adobe photoshop, they cant do anything"". But I just have the impression that the Arduino is an amateur product not really used in the real world anyway. And really passionate people wont bother with something as ""commercialised"" as the Arduino. Hence, contributing to my inner feelings that Im just wanting to believe that I am learning something useful when I really am just falling for their ""educational ""advertising.

Again, I know this post has been overly critical. Perhaps its because Im just worried I have wasted time and effort learning all these things. I am still in the process of self-learning C coding and eventually learning more about embedded electronics beyond the Arduino. But its really difficult finding a starting point as compared to the arduino. Plus with internships and school starting soon it seems like this will be particularly challenging.( I am determined though)

Sorry if I seem whiney. Im still gonna continue playing around with my Arduino XD Not sure what I wanted to achieve with this post honestly, just wanted to get this off my chest and would love to read any opinions."

I'm a current Information Systems student and have completed my first year of University in Australia. I have recently completed a summer internship at a company, but felt quite inadequate as I did not have sufficient technological experience to actually be productive. 

That being said, I was able to practice some skills and learn quite a bit, about tools such as Virtual Machines (VMware), Oracle 12g, Java and Databases (JDBC, etc), the command prompt, was introduced to Shell Scripting, and practice my soft skills.

Is there anything I should do to get ahead? I am feeling quite lost as I really didn't produce any actual work during my internship.

Thanks, apologies in advanced if this is a stupid question."

I'm going back to school in a week to get another bachelors in accounting that will only take me 1 year to complete.

My goal is absolutely trying to get into a big 4 firm but coming from a small school with no internship expierence i realize this to be unlikely. 

A big reason I'm interested in accounting is because there are oppurtunities everyone and I'm trying to get out of CT. Hartford and CT in general is awful. I'm not to picky in where I want to go, interested in Tampa, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and a couple other spots.

My question is simple really as the title stated. If I don't plan on working in CT should I graduate then move somewhere else right after to find a job and begin studying for CPA exam there? Or would I be better served finding a staff accountant postion in CT while taking the test and moving after I pass. The only thing that worries me is moving first without a job is very nerve racking and I wouldn't even know where to begin doing that.

Like screaming, cursing, totally irrational most of the time, sometimes can't even tell why I'm being yelled at... Like actually unstable. This is an office situation where we work one on one and it's their own business where they're CEO/president and I got hired as what should have been kind of an associate, but am treated like an intern. He abruptly fired my only other coworker so the situation has gotten very very toxic. 

Lo and behold, a job I did NOT think I would get-- a really great situation in an industry I actually care about-- came through and I'm unbelievably excited. 

However, terrified to quit. Honestly terrified. I mean yeah, what can he do to me besides yell and carry on? Yes, but I'm a woman who does not do well mentally or anxiety-wise with yelling, so I truly feel semi-afraid. (There's no HR btw.) 

I also made a huge point of insisting I would stay at least a year (my resume is a little patched together because I've been switching industries) and he had some hesitation about whether or not I would stay on, and here I am cutting and running at the first opportunity... but I feel I have no choice!

The other problem is, he is very computer illiterate and actually depends on me (quite literally) to do things for him. So if I leave very immediately, I know the panic will be real... 

And it doesn't help that he's going away for a month (to his house overseas) next Friday. So he won't be able to interview or place someone unless he literally does it next week and I train them. 

So my question is-- how do I quit? 

And is there any possibility of being a coward and emailing him over the weekend (on Friday-- he won't be in tomorrow) and letting him stew over the weekend, or do I have to gird my loins and do it today in person face to face? "

I introduced you to Debbie Diva, now it's time to really feed your llamas. This was the first time that I experienced the depth of my MIL's specific brand of insanity and it hit me like a bitchslap to the head. I just didn't know that people could **be** like this. Of course that is until I started reading all of your stories and then realized that there are a **lot** of people like this! Alright. On to the story.

If you read my last post you know that DH had accepted an internship a few states away for school. While he was there, he started having some weird medical symptoms. Since my dad is a doctor, I ran them by him. He recommended that DH see a doctor just to be on the safe side. Now DH has **no** medical knowledge whatsoever, so he was strictly relying on my dad's recommendations. He goes to see a doctor near him and gets news that none of us were expecting. He has a mass in his neck. Well shit. Now I'm no doctor, but I know that lumps in places they shouldn't be are bad news bears. DH meanwhile is blissfully unaware. *It's only one mass. It's not that big. They don't seem that concerned.* I asked him to email his lab results to me so that my dad could review them. We found that DH actually had four masses. This was the point where I had a little mini panic attack because it doesn't take a doctor to figure out that DH probably has cancer. Keep in mind that DH is still STATES away and blissfully unaware of how big of a deal that this is. He wants to stay and finish his internship and seek medical care when he returns home. Dad and I know that this is not a good idea. 

So. Rather than call him and freak him out completely, I decide to call Debbie Diva and see if she can convince him to come home. That conversation went over like a lead balloon. I called and explained that after reviewing DH's test results, my dad really felt like it would be a good idea for DH to come home now to seek treatment. I told her that DH didn't really understand the seriousness of what was going on, and that myself and my father were concerned about DH's health and what could happen if he stayed the remaining four months of his internship. I said that my dad thought that this problem was most likely cancer and that it was probably going to require surgery and that it would likely be better for DH to have this done sooner rather than later. *Silence* Then... ""Well, I really think that it's important for DH to focus on his schoolwork right now. That's going to be very important for his future.""

*Um. Did this crazy person really just say that? Like did those words come out of her mouth?!*

So, while struggling to keep my crazy tamped down I said ""Well Debbie, I agree that his schoolwork is important and that this internship is a crazy good opportunity for him, but I really think that he needs to see a specialist and have treatment more than he needs to finish his internship.""

She disagreed with me. Ya'll we argued for over forty-five minutes about this. I wanted to scream **Well his schoolwork isn't going to mean much if he dies from cancer!**, but I didn't. I just let her keep arguing. Finally, when it was clear to me that we weren't going to get any further in this conversation, I said ""Well Debbie, we can agree to disagree, but I just want you to know that I'm going to call DH and recommend that he come home immediately."" She hung up on me.

Shit. Now I have to call DH, break the news to him that we think he has cancer, and tell him that I got into an enormous fight with his mom who believes that he should stay where he is and delay treatment for said cancer. 

*/deepbreath*

So I make the call and interrupt him at work. I explain to him what my dad thought and how at this point we think it's a good idea for him to come home and seek treatment immediately. I told him that I understood how important this internship was to him and that I understood what a fantastic opportunity it was, but at this point, his health was more important, and he needed to come home. DH agrees with me and says that he's got some stuff to figure out, but he'll look into coming home ASAP. I then tell him that I got into it with his mom. I explained what she said and how I countered it. He kind of just sighed and said ""Okay. I'll talk to her at some point I guess."" He hung up with me to go talk to his internship coordinator.

That night I talked to him again. His internship coordinator was beyond wonderful and arranged a flight for him the following week so he could get home as quickly as possible. Then came the first barb from Debbie Diva towards me. DH told me that when he called Debbie Diva, she told him that maybe he should listen to his mother instead of his ""failed nursing student"" of a girlfriend. (I left nursing school for personal hardship reasons). I asked him what he said back to her. He (ashamed) told me that he didn't really say anything back. That didn't surprise me; he's been trained from childhood not to go against her or what she says. This defiance thing was still new to him at that point. I shook it off and told him not to worry about it, that all I wanted him to worry about was packing and getting himself home - we'd worry about the rest when we got there.

Whew. That took a lot more time to type out than I thought. Sorry it was so long... This is only the beginning, but I'm going to take a break now because my fingers are starting to hurt lol. Until next time!

ETA: This happened years ago and DH is completely fine now. I'll be going through the nightmare that was his treatment, but I realized that I should let you all know that it turns out fine in the end - he's health as a horse now! :)"

Them: ""What industry are you looking to work in when you graduate?""

Me: ""I just want to be a programmer.  I'm not really concerned with the specific industry I want to be in."" 

Them: ""Well you should be researching which field you want to go into so you can start preparing for it now""

So this is the beginning of my research...  I know there are different specializations within computer science like cyber security, web development, AI etc but they are thinking more broadly like energy, healthcare, finance, government etc.  In my mind with a CS degree you could adapt to the nuances of those fields on job but there is not a lot course/prep work to do outside of maybe getting some sort of minor in one of those areas or an internship.  As an example, I have a friend that studied communications and went on to be a PR manager for a bed and breakfast management company.  He didn't take any management or hospitality courses but was able to apply his communication skills for his position and learned the industry over the years.  Am I wrong in this thinking?  Should I be targeting and learning details of specific broad industries?

As some insight, I'd like to work at software development company so that I get the chance to work on different projects and would prefer if they worked with Java or C#.  Not sure how much more specific I need to get.

5nkxqi,1,2017-01-12,New to this reddit! :) Anxiety Letter Part One,Galistor,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5nkxqi/new_to_this_reddit_anxiety_letter_part_one/,"Hey all!

This will be my first post on this subreddit, which has already been a helpful tool in my struggle and fight against anxiety. Recently, I've begun just writing out what is frustrating and annoying about anxiety and a little bit about my history. 

Not too sure who I'm writing to or who will be reading this, but my fiance had the awesome idea of posting them here to see if it might help anyone or insights could be had from it. 

Apologies for this first post will be really long, but it's just how this letter was written. Thanks all and maybe this'll help in some regard, who knows? 

----------

I struggle with anxiety.

Well, struggle might be a nice way of putting it. Struggling has the assumption that both sides win at some point during the struggle, which is technically the truth. There have been moments where my anxiety has been beaten and I have fought my way through it.

But, recently, it has felt like a one-sided affair, one that is hindering me and one that is changing how I view what to pursue. 
Anxiety never seemed to be something that was a huge issue. It was something that had always been around, but I always found some way to see past it or to push through the emotions that came with it. I vividly remember the first time I played drums for the college group at my previous church, for the entire week, I was a mess.

I was so nervous and overthinking everything that I tried to find ways to get out of it. Even on the day of, I was trying to find ways to move when I would play or just simply not having to think about it anymore. My parents, in that scenario, forced me to do it and were there every step of the way. By the time I got through practice, the anxiety melted away and it was all about music and playing drums, something that relaxes me and is comforting! 

But, in 2016, it became apparent that as I was getting older, my problems and struggles with anxiety would only increase and would change the decisions I made regarding jobs, careers, and locations. When I graduated from college, I had this plan of becoming a sports writer for the Oregonian, or finding some way to become the beat writer for the Portland Trail Blazers. 

As it became apparent that jobs in this field were lacking or simply not a comfortable opportunity, the anxiety began to shift into the greener-grass syndrome. I immediately began looking for jobs at places like Starbucks because I felt like I needed to work into the job force. My thinking was that I would start at the ground level at Starbucks and work my way up to become a manager. Only then, would I consider moving on to pursuing journalism as a full-time career. 

It seemed perfect, I could find my own place to live in Beaverton and take it slow, all while making money and moving up the ladder. That dream was shattered on my first day at Starbucks. It was a nightmare, a place that seemed to go against every bone in my body. But, I couldn’t explain it. There was nothing glaring or inherently wrong about the job, but something about it triggered every switch inside of me. 

I remember sitting in the back room doing my onboarding and it was around 3:00 in the afternoon. All of a sudden, I had this intense emotional surge and voices saying “You need to get out of here”, “I want to go home and crawl under a blanket”. At the time, I thought this was just Satan trying to get at me, which was definitely a part of it, but I didn’t notice how my body was reacting until later. 

My first shift was over and I went home that night hoping that it would feel better and that I would stop feeling so terrible. It got worse that evening, knowing that I would have to go back into that Starbucks. I bawled my eyes out, but it seemed less like sadness, and more just getting rid of a bunch of emotions and tension inside my body. It was a full-body anxiety/panic attack. The next day, I quit. It went against everything that I had learned growing up and against my character. 

But, it seemed like the best decision, as the anxiety went away and I felt like I got some clarity throughout the whole mess. Shortly thereafter, I got an internship at eBay that showed me that I could work a full-time job and that anxiety did not have to be a part of it. The people a part of the team I was in were terrific. Constantly making me feel like I was wanted and that I wasn’t just some intern who was going to leave in a week. It truly felt like I was a part of the team and that God had put me there to show me a good example of a working environment, something to strive for.  
There was talk that the internship could roll right into a contract or even full-time position at eBay, if things fell the right way. They did not and I remember feeling like I really didn’t want to leave at the end of the week. I wanted to come back and see these people and work with them on testing problems. It was an amazing environment!

Looking back now, after the internship, my brain switched to the greener-grass syndrome again and for the next seven months, I searched for jobs within the tech industry doing quality assurance work. It seemed obvious, I grew up in these working environments since I was a kid and it seemed fitting that I would follow my dad’s footsteps and work with computers and applications. 

Throughout the process, however, I began to struggle with not having a job right away. Throughout the summer, I started hating myself for not working hard enough to have a job already. There was always something more to do, at least in my head. I kept making unrealistic goals that I could never meet and assuming that the people close to me hated me or looked down on me and took pity.

I felt like I was a failure, I was getting close to my mid-20s and I was struggling with even finding a job. I was still living at home and figuring out what to do with all my free time. It was nerve-wracking; I cried every day and got angry at the world for not making it easy on me. Where did I go wrong? I went to college, graduated with a 4.0, and did everything right. What happened? 

It seemed that my prayers were answered in December when I accepted a job offer at a job in Wilsonville. It was a contract position that was going to stop in February, but it was quality assurance, and in a location that was moving closer and closer to the person I wanted to marry. Again, it seemed perfect and it seemed like something God put in front of me at just the right time.

However, this time around, my brain started throwing Starbucks into my head again, telling me that it was going to go horribly and that the first-day struggles would return. I fought through that with prayer and endurance. I didn’t want to judge something I hadn’t already done and I had more motivation. This would allow me to make money and start the journey towards marrying the person I loved with all my heart. 

The first day arrived, traffic was terrible and already my anxiety was ramping up. I started sorting through all the scenarios in my head about how these people were going to fire me for being late and how they were all going to be incredibly rude. So, I was already not in a good place. I arrived on time and began the process of getting included with the team and learning all that I needed to learn.

It was obvious I was tense; I was surprised that no one stopped me during the whole day and said “Are you okay?” It was that obvious and I was not doing a good job of hiding it. I seemed to be at a certain level of anxiety all day that I just began not to notice. But, at around 3:00, once again, it was like my brain switched to a fight-or-flight response. Immediately, I wanted to leave. I wanted to get out of there and not be in that place anymore.

It got worse after getting taking on a tour of the place and being told what I would be doing for them. It was way more than I expected, including the use of dangerous chemicals and understanding all the protocols that were extremely precise. My brain locked up, there was too much information and too many variables that I could mess up. I was done. I just wanted to leave. I remember thinking, “This was supposed to be a Software job! I’m not a lab technician!” When they said I would have to wear a lab coat at some points, I knew right then that this was far from the job description. 

I got home that night and surprisingly did okay. I was home, familiar surroundings, and was even eating some of my favorite food for dinner! But, I could tell as I went to bed that night that I was not okay. I cried like crazy when I was about to go to sleep. I couldn’t stop. The tears and emotions kept hitting me like bricks. I tried to go to sleep, but then I woke up again with tears streaming down my face. But, it was not sadness; it was like I was evacuating everything that had been built up all day.

I woke up the next morning feeling terrible. I was already shaking and trying so hard not to lose it in front of anyone. I got my lunch ready and as I was about to leave, it’s like my body shook and I just lost it harder than I ever had. I saw my dad come downstairs and I just fell into him, wanting things to change. 

I was crying because I didn’t want to go back, but I think I was also crying because that it happened again. I worked my ass off for seven months trying to get into that position and was hoping beyond hope that this experience would be different. It wasn’t, in fact it felt worse in the moment!

I felt like I let everyone down again. Especially this instance because my girlfriend (fiancé now) and I were so excited for this opportunity. I was completely ready to start moving down south to Salem and this seemed like a good start to the plan. 

I remember showing up to help my fiancé move into her new place and feeling so shaky. My emotions were bouncing all over the place and I remember giving her a hug and not letting go. She was my safest place, the place I could go to cry, and after a long day of just wanting to get out of the office, I almost buried my head in her shoulder the moment I saw her. 

Throughout my life, especially in high school, anytime I walked away from something or made a big decision based on health reasons and my well-being, friends would look at me and ask “So, what now? That was kind of weird, what’s your plan? Are you okay? You know you need to fight through this right?” 

Those people would cause my anxiety to just flip out. And, it shaped a bunch of decisions I made when I was younger to simply avoid those lines of questioning. Or, simply just not telling some of my best friends at the youth group I attended. 

So, I was scared and nervous that I was going to receive a similar treatment from my parents. And, I felt so defeated when I explained to my fiancé what was wrong. But, she said something that just floored me and made me finally lose it in front of her. She just said “It’s really okay if you quit. I love you!  Just go talk to someone about your anxiety. It’s eating you up”. Just the way she said it and how genuine and sincere it was, it made me start crying immediately. She just pulled me in and held me. 

After a couple of days where everything went with the script and the anxiety ruled my brain, she changed the script and it was a feeling like I had never experienced before. 

After seeing a therapist for three sessions, it has become apparent that this anxiety has sunk its teeth into every part of my life. It effects my emotions, my assumptions, my habits, the life decisions I’m making, and even what I want to pursue. From the physical manifestations in tension, frustration, shaky, change in breathing to the more emotional and mental effects, like being frightened while reading a job description or feeling terrible when I wake up in the morning. 

There has been some slight progress, but just becoming aware of what anxiety is doing is showing the magnitude of this issue. Something that I thought was just a little aspect of my life is turning out to be something that is almost ruling my life, which is scary in its own right. 

The most recent development has been that mornings when I wake up at home are the worst times. My body starts to feel inadequate and I also feel sad or down whenever I try to calm myself my playing video games. I paint this picture in my head of the overweight, anti-social nerd who plays World of Warcraft all day. And, then I just feel awful in that I feel like I failed somehow by not look at jobs for three hours already or not being more professional.

This letter is simply a way to begin to put into words what I’m struggling with and I’m bothered by. I know that God has something cooking because he brought into my life the most amazing woman I have ever met and who is going to be my future wife. He is making the wedding plan as smooth as it could be and so many things are falling into place that it has to be God.
I’m praying every day for His will to become clear and to see how He is going to complete this part of my life. 

He can overcome anxiety and that gives me encouragement.

Anxiety, screw you.

Let me tell you, I am a small streamer and I had a break for three months (no streaming). The reason for that was: that school and my internship became so busy that I didn't have the time to stream which is obviously the thing I love and to do the most when I have free time. So after everything with school and my internship settled down at the start of Christmas break, that means all the exams are finished and I got a good grade for my internship, I had a thought about starting to stream again. But with no luck I decided not to because I thought it would feel different than it was before.. So through the two week break (14 days) I decided to spent time with my friends and just watch/read Anime/Manga when I was bored or just wanted to do that. But in the middle of the break, around day 12 of the break I woke up and decided to start streaming with no buts etc. I just went along my plan and started to stream (ofcourse League of Legends and Ovewatch) and gained a steady ten viewer count and five follows that day, I was so happy that I went to my friends to tell them about it and they looked proud :D. For your information I am 19 years old.

The next day (day 13) saturday I started streaming early in the morning at 09:00 untill 14:00 in the afternoon (I had to prepare for work afterwards). That day was the best stream I ever had in my sort of streaming career. The chat was fun to talk to and I won a lot of games because the viewers supported me and gave me a lot of advice throughout the stream. I had a steady viewer count around 30 or so and i gained 42 followers that day! I told my friends during the stream that the should come to and enjoy the stream with me. Ofcourse my friends are moderators so it was easy to deal with the viewers if they crossed the lines and broke the rules.

This was it, the awesome moment I wanted to share with you all!!

*Kanazawa Fish Packing*    
*August 3rd – 1:13AM*    
***
Laughter echoed off the surrounding buildings, probably irritating to the local residents given the hour. After all, Kanazawa Fish Packing had been here since the seventies. Industrial production, storage, and cheap housing formed a maze of brickwork around Kanazawa. Just behind the business was a lot. Many of the establishments here needed a place for shipping, making the alleys here far wider then they might be elsewhere. They needed to be to accommodate all the snub-nose Toyota trucks coming and going in the everyday hustle and bustle. Atop an adjacent building across the lot, Hideyoshi sat. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
It was his first night hunting for money. Sitting against a rooftop A.C. unit, the boy had been taking a break from trawling the night streets of Tokyo to watch two male grasshoppers fight over some grasshopper pussy in a small patch of vegetation below. When two men came out to smoke behind Kanazawa, the boy's attention had shifted. Perhaps one of the two of them would do. For the past ten minutes he had sat here listening to blue collar small talk. The acrid aroma of the cigarettes was stinging his nose all the way to his perch, even under his mask. Such a nasty habit.
&amp;nbsp;
    
If one of them would just leave, he could kill the other and make off with the body pretty cleanly. It wasn't that he couldn't kill both, but even as a ghoul the boy didn't have enough strength to cart two full grown men across the city *subtlety.* One was all he was being paid for anyway. A glance was shot through his orange bug goggles at the equipment that rested beside him, an A frame, a plastic and cloth sack, and packing straps. The young ghoul figured this would make transport quick and efficient. With the slam of a heavy door, Yoshi's attention snapped back down to the scene below. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Kensuke,'' the two smokestacks greeted the newcomer loudly as the man pulled out a cigarette of his own, cramming it into his lips and letting dangle there. As he produced a lighter and lit the cancer stick, the orange glow of burning tobacco lit his middle aged features, revealed the bits of fish in his scraggly Asian beard. ''What kept you, man?'' His tired brown eyes regarded the two with just a twinge of annoyance as he brushed a few strands of oily hair from his face.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Canning machine three is down again.'' Kensuke inhaled sharply and exhaled a little more relaxed, the nicotine calming his frustration. ''Had to do a little emergency maintenance.'' The two smiled and the shorter of the coworkers spoke first.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''You ever get tired of doing maintenance's job too, Ken?'' Kensuke nodded grimly.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Complaining won't do anything. You know that.'' A melancholy acceptance of reality crossed the faces of all three. Now it was time for the fat one to speak, lounging against the back of the building, naturally. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''You're the most talented guy here, Ken. You could score another job if you wanted.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Yeah,'' the short one concurred. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''I make good money here,'' Kensuke parried. He attempted to change the subject. ''You know that new kid they got logistics? Soujiro?'' The two nodded. ''He asked me how much I made the other day.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Rude,'' fatso commented.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Get this,'' He continued with a weary smile, cigarette clinched in his teeth. ''When I told him he says 'wow, I haven't made that much in years.' That punk is barely out of college. This is my *top pay.* I worked my ass of to make what I do.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Wow,'' the short one whispered in disbelief. ''Don't you have a medical degree or something?'' The man of the hour nodded again.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''I'm qualified to be a nurse. I don't really wish to do that for the rest of my life though,'' Kensuke answered gruffly.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Why not see if you can go back to school? Become a doctor?'' A look of disbelief was shot at the tubby man's suggestion. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Are you kidding me? I would be a forty two year-old rookie doctor. All the other doctors would be laughing watching me struggle to properly suture a wound. Then some snot-nosed intern would be coming up to me going 'wow, I haven't made that much in years!'' Kensuke chuckled and the other two burst out laughing. As the chubbier man finished his smoke and flicked the butt away he stole a glance at his dinged up wrist watch before shaking his flub off the wall. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Come on,'' He slapped his short buddy on the shoulder. ''Our fifteen minutes is up.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Enjoy your reprieve, Ken.'' The two have a small wave and Kensuke nodded in response as he took another drag. When the door closed, Yoshi got ready. He was getting paid good money too. Now that he had a man alone, the boy stood and just jumped right over the side of the building. It was only two stories. The shadows and the steady hum of canning machines from the plant masked the small noise of his impact. The only light illuminating the lot was the one under which Kensuke stood. This gave the little ghoul plenty of darkness to mask his approach. As he maneuvered around the parked trucks and garbage cans, Yoshi's heart began to beat faster from the adrenaline.
&amp;nbsp;
    
By the time the boy snuck up beside the shipping dock that his pray stood upon, his kakugan was already burning brightly, causing the bug eye goggles to glow over the top of his face mask. Running at the dock, Hideyoshi leapt a few feet from it and catching the ledge easily with his hands, he pulled himself up in a smooth quiet motion. Ryuu's training had been paying off. While the base of the dock was concrete, the surface was wooden planks. His kagune came to life behind him spreading out through the night air in silent malice. His charge at the man was not a quiet one thanks to the wood. The sudden racket caused Kensuke to turn enough to look over his shoulder. He saw death coming swiftly and yelled in surprise and lament.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''UBWAAAA - ''
&amp;nbsp;
    
His scream was cut short, and with a thunk his head tumbled across the planks. His corpse fell to its knees before the boy and Yoshi kept it suspended from falling any further with his bug-like claws. Blood spurted from the gouge he had cut into the shoulders below the neck, spattering onto his black rain poncho. For a moment he stood there in apprehension. Normally his victims died before they knew what was happening, but this one had had just enough time. Had anyone heard? Certainly the factory hid his deed from the workers within. Who could be on the streets at this hour? Surely, he was safe."

Alex Hirsch (Gravity Falls). Even though the second of Gravity Falls season 2 was very disappointing, Hirsch has a lot of talent. And GF shows that. He has a very creative and weird mind And he can create great funny characters that you care about. I know he was offered to work as an intern at Pixar once, but he turned it down. Disappointing to hear because I think he could make a really funny and weird Pixar film.

Daron Nefcy (Star Vs The Forces Of Evil). I had no interest n Star Vs until a few months ago when a friend of mine convinced me to give it a try. And I'm happy I did. Super entertaining, weird, and imaginative show. I wonder what Nefcy could do with a Pixar or Dreamworks or Disney animated film.

So this is my first attempt at making a design portfolio. I used the Adobe Portfolio program. I don't have a whole lot of projects under my belt (working on that) as I only started designing last year.

I've had issues with low image quality, I'm continuing to try and make the images better quality. I'm not too good with all the file/resolution/exporting/print stuff yet, so I'm kind of flailing around with that. Most notably in the spreads for my ""Event Book"". Those images are a placeholder right now until I can make my own mockups.

I'm desperately trying to get together a passable portfolio that I can land a summer internship with. Is there any chance? The deadlines are starting to come up so I'd appreciate your feedback. 

I don't have a lot of work so I've included some older work from when I was just starting out. I'm not sure if I should leave the older stuff out, maybe you guys can tell me if it sucks and I should scrap it.

Thank you!"

5nlzyo,1,2017-01-12,at what point does compensation play a part in deciding between which internship to choose?,asterik_boy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nlzyo/at_what_point_does_compensation_play_a_part_in/,"background: junior computer engineering student with two software engineering internship offers. One at a startup in NYC, pays ~$12/hr, and one at an established company that provides housing (which is why I'm leaving out location) and ~$28/hr.

My gut is inclined to take the start-up offer. I like the work environment, the work that they do, and just being able to work in a start-up. However, the competing offer is what's making this hard to decide: with the corporate offer, I potentially have a better chance of getting a return offer with a solid post-grad salary, and I wouldn't have to worry about paying a bit out of pocket this summer just to intern at the company.

I'm an advocate for focusing on the experience when it comes to internships, and know that I will be challenged and will learn if I choose to go there. The way I'm considering leaning towards the start-up is that if I *do* go to the corporate route, and *don't* get a return offer, I would regret not choosing the startup.

However, I just need some opinions right now, I've been debating in my head for the entire week.

I have two internships lined up, one with UPS to design a program to simulate package flows and look for inefficiencies and another with a consulting and investment advisory firm as a systems analyst.

There are several videos and screenshots out there showing the glitch. You can see his weapon, but his body is completely invisible - even in the MVP screen!

The biggest problem is that after I little search, I found that this has been reported (with proof!) in this subreddit at least three times but it didn't get the deserved attention. I've done some digging here and in the Rainbow 6 official forums and haven't found any response from the community managers or developers in this matter even though this issue is ridiculously annoying.

I just heard about this issue for the first time in a Brazilian Facebook group about Rainbow 6 and that's why I came here. It got a lot of attention there but I think things that happen there don't get transmitted to the devs. Even though there are a Ubisoft community manager and an intern, they don't really get very involved in the group, but that's a different subject.

Anyway, can /u/its_epi or anybody else responsible for the game's development send this to QA and get it fixed? I own the Elite Uniform and if this is a glitch, I really don't want it to happen randomly with me. It's super annoying.

-Finance Major

-Sat for the CFA L1 in December

-~3.5 GPA

-School is between a non-target and semi-target (closer to semi-target)

-Interned at a very small financial analysis firm. So no name recognition, but gave me a large amount of experience. Writing my own reports, as well.

-Took a bit of time off college, did associates. 24 Y/O currently. When I started majoring in finance, I was late to the party for Junior summer internships.

I have a few offers as a credit analyst at a few local mid-sized banks in a training program, but that is truly not what I want to do. My dream entry job is an ER associate position, but would also be interested in a PM/IB position. For IB, I haven't given it much thought because I know the vast majority of those positions are already filled, and ER doesn't have a set recruiting schedule (and is closer to what I do now).

I'm currently attempting to network into an ER gig/applying to position after position. If I'm graduating in 6 months, is now too early to apply?

If I don't get a FT ER position, should I take a full-time offer at my current internship, or try to get into an MFE/MSF program last-minute?

This is my second week.

I'm primarily skilled in java and for the first week my manager and mentor were both very nice and understanding. For the first day of this week, my manager assigned me to debug part of a new update for the company's primary software (I was told I'd be debugging for the first month or so). This worked fine and it gave me a nice understanding of the code I'd be working with (but a very small fraction of it as it's 13000 packages). 

My mentor is nice but very awkward and doesn't do a great job of explaining things. He's helpful when I had trouble with setting up the environment or hitting a roadblock in setting up something else. I usually don't try to ask him anything because he has his own work to do.

Anyway, apparently manually testing the company's primary software is somewhat annoying and the team I'm on had been wanting to make a web-based, UI-friendly way to test their code for a while but that would take time as one of them would need to learn javascript and such. My mentor showed me a plugin I could use that basically uses java to build frontend web services. I also need to learn database-related programming and how to eventually tie the UI I create to the company's software and essentially tie everything I learn together.

My manager was originally going to have me debug and stuff for the first month but after my mentor told everyone what I'm working on, the team got excited about it. My manager even told me today that it was exciting and would be great on my resume. It's all I've been working on all week and today was kind of the boiling point because I really don't think I can do it. I'm learning so much software I've never used before and even a lot of the command line stuff ends up taking me a while when things don't go as the tutorials describe. I'm really trying but I don't think I'm up to the task (my mentor seemed to originally describe it as something we'd work on together but he doesn't know the software either and the end goal also seems very vague to me). I also have no idea how long it'll take me, so I'm pretty concerned I'll end up wasting a month of the company's time for a completed but shittily put together project. I already spent this week on it...

What should I do? Tell my manager the truth? Really try to complete the project, therefore learning/gaining a lot from it?"

I just graduated last May with a BS in Financial Math. No certifications otherwise, vaguely familiar with SAS, Tableau, and MySql as well as excellent (almost advanced) excel skills. I have been trying to become a data analyst, but due to unfortunate life events was unable to intern in college. There's a shortage of D.A. In this area, but they mostly want 1+ years experience. *sigh*

 Thus I began to temp while throwing my resume around and doing light D.A. Work for a friend's company. First temp job literally created a job as HR Analyst for close to 50k start because they liked me so much. Everything was negotiated, was moving to my permanent desk and signing Monday. Sunday I get a call not to return. The very last person to sign off declined the hire. Whatever. They wanted ""payroll skills"" in addition. 

The next month I get picked up for a Reconciliation project with another company. They fucking love me. To quote them I'm ""better at this than they are"". And I even accelerated the project with some basic excel. Frankly my analytic skills give me that edge. They have literally been actively looking for a place to hire me at end of project but can't guarantee yet as that's not till end of February or later. I will do more networking Monday with VPof Finance and the Manager for Master Data Management about any hiring plans they may have as far out as May and maybe drop off my resume. The company seems genuine and friendly. It's easy to have conversations with the CEO etc in passing. They are growing but still have that homey feel while being corporate. I love it here, but I'm still tossing out my resume sometimes. 

Then there's ""Mary"" ( false name). She's another temp. She sucks. They at least like her. I have been able to time her at not doing more than tapping the space bar for as much as 3 hours. She needs things repeated, spends a lot of time on her phone, and does her side business sometimes while working here. She does 25% the work I do I'm almost positive. And that's with hours of my time spent developing sheets to make us more efficient. As a manager my expectations would be higher for praise. She would get none. She's a nice enough person, but it's just how I feel. 

So, after working along side Mary... I begin to wonder. Am I the person that will get passed by? Am I working too hard? What can I do to ensure I'm working hard the right ways? Is this a smart way to develop a career?"

5no01i,28,2017-01-12,Microdosing has reignited my drive,sirvegastein,microdosing,https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/5no01i/microdosing_has_reignited_my_drive/,"Hey dosers, I just want to share my experience with micro dosing this past week. I just started on Monday and and as we head on to Friday, lemme tell you about how I am slowly but surely starting to notice a shift in attitude towards life, academics, and the future. 

First some background: I am a 4th year in uni graduating this June from Mechanical Engineering. My first two years in school I was filled with drive, motivation, and discipline regarding my studies (maintained a 3.3 GPA) , 15-18 hr/week pt job, and extra-curricular activities, research involvement. I was eating right and even lost a significant amount of weight (~30 lbs). As a first generation college student from a low income family, I wanted to prove everyone wrong.

Something went amiss during my last quarter of my 2nd and leading up to my 4th year. I went through some depression that derailed every aspect of my life. I barely passed classes and failed some, I was doing the least at work, began to close myself off in my apartment, gained about 60 lbs, and worst no motivation for self-improvement. I was  in a downward spiral and I notice my family notice as they would often comment on my appearance, but despite this I could find a reason to make myself better. In the start of my 4th year, I made half-assed attempts to get my life back on track. I tried in my classes while still leaving assignments to the last minute, I canceled a co-op interview with a casting company and sabotaged a second round interview for an internship with an electronics company by showing up in jeans and a baseball T-shirt. Obviously, the interviewer was less than impressed. They were second-rate efforts to progress but I didn't realize that they were only that way because I had no drive to do any of it. I just did those things because it was something I felt i had to do.

I discovered micro dosing while browsing r/LSD (I had tried LSD several times before). I browsed this sub for quite a while and until I was convinced that this was something that might help with my depression and lack of drive. I made an solution with 250 ml of water with 2x250 ug tabs and use an oral syringe to dose 5 ml =10 ug. First time I dosed, the results were sub-optimal but definitely there. I started reading a book for a class and noticed I had a longer attention span to read a full chapter (usually all I could handle were a couple pages before feeling drowsy) whereas I would normally fall asleep during lecture, I mustered enough energy to stay awake. if anything the dose lasted almost the whole day and it was comparable to a cup of coffee. 

I dosed again Thursday, this time with 7 ml = 14 ug. I dosed at 8:00 AM bc I knew I would have to meet up with a friend to catch up at 10:00 AM giving the dose enough time to do its thing. Well I would say there wasn't much of a dull moment. At first, we exchanged standard ""how have you been"" but just min after this the conversation took off and we always had something to talk about. I was actually surprised bc I was actually keeping up (my friend is more on the extroverted spectrum while I am more on the introverted side). After our meeting, i figured I would do some research for my senior project in the library. This was when the effects really really started to kick in. i could not believe the amount of energy and focus coming out of me. I read paper after paper with regards to my project (very technical stuff) and found that I actually gathered and understood a surprising amount information to bring back to my group. On a good week prior to micro dosing, It would take me days to produce that kind of work.

Ahhh that's all I am going to say for now. I have a 3hr lecture to attend from 7p-10p. yikes! but I will come back and add to the above once I get home. til next time. also I am running late so pls go easy on my grammer and spelling mistakes. I haven't had a chance to proof read it. "

Due to some medical events (c-word) I've only had a 3.4 gpa with little extra curriculars. Haven't taken sat yet (psat 1380/1520). Family solidly middle class so can't expect a lot of help.
The way I see it I have a few options. 

•The cheapest is to stay in-state and take advantage of the free 2 years of community college Oregon has. After that finish bachelors at a college in Oregon (OSU, UofO, etc.)

•The most expensive option is to go to a higher ranked computer science school out of state. The best I have a chance at is probably the University of Washington. I know I'd have to get a mountain of student loans.

•Everything inbetween (cc then transfer out of state, 4 years in-state college, etc.)

Questions (slightly repititive, sorry)
1. Would I lose out on jobs or internships (big 4 and similar companies) by doing one of the cheaper paths?

2. What benefits are there to going to one of the more highly regarded computer science schools?

3. Any suggestions for other colleges I should look at? Prefer to stay on the west coast or Texas. 

4. What do you think I should do? What was your experience like with one of the options?

5. Anything else I should consider?

Not sure if it matters with this, but I think artificial intelligence is really cool, and would like to work with that if possible. The other thing I know I care about is how where I go to college impacts eventual salary.

5noq1o,3,2017-01-13,Advice Needed - Possibly Reneging on Internship Offer,cskid2019,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5noq1o/advice_needed_possibly_reneging_on_internship/,"Hi, I'm a CS student who recently signed an internship offer at at pretty well known SF/Seattle startup for the upcoming summer. At the time, it was the best offer that I had received. Call this company A.

Before this, I had applied to company B, an SF startup where I would've really liked to work, quite a bit more than company A (ie, if I had offers from both A and B, I'd pick B quite easily). The problem is, they got back to me to set up interviews after I had signed my offer for A. I still went on with the interviews, and ended up receiving an offer from them. 

Now I'm conflicted - do I stick with A, which is itself a highly regarded company and will certainly be an awesome internship experience? Or do I renege on A, and go with B, which is what my choice would've been if reneging wasn't an issue? 

Here are a few pros and cons I've thought of for reneging: 

Pros: 

- Get to work at a company I like better, and one that I think will be a lot more successful in the future, would love working there full time (though I have 2 years before I graduate)

- Company B is more well-regarded, but the difference is probably not much. 

- Culture seems a bit better but not much, my project is something I'm a little more interested in, wicked smart people and I loved talking to the employees there (though this can be said for A too)

Cons: 

- Will be blacklisted by a pretty good (highly regarded) company where I'd likely be pretty happy working at, and that's one less option I have to work at in the future. 

- Risk of company contacting career services center and banning me from university career fairs (there's 100+ tech companies at our career fairs)

- Risk of ruining my reputation in the tech industry at age 19, which isn't ideal for a future in Silicon Valley

- Possible risk of company B, the company I reneged for, finding out, and cancelling my offer with them

As you can probably tell, I'm pretty conflicted and would really appreciate some advice on this. It's my first time recruiting/searching for jobs/any of that stuff, so I've not been going about it as well as possible. My hunch is that my type of situation probably happens somewhat often, since its pretty common for companies to have different timeframes and getting weeks and weeks of offer extensions is rare."
5nori3,17,2017-01-13,How to be more... engaging/interactive?,F-ck_up,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/5nori3/how_to_be_more_engaginginteractive/,"To open up, I'm currently a 19 year old male in college. I like to think I'm a fairly smart guy. Ive won several math competitions and national-level programming competitions, but can't seem to get my hands on an internship. Some of my friends have managed to get them (and not to be obnoxious), but I feel like I have more experience in computer science than they do. If they can get them, why can't I?

I have few close friends I can talk to because I'm a very antisocial person. I try to go out of my comfort zone every once in a while and meet new people, but never really seem to get close to them... All my close friends I've known since either middle school or elementary school. I think the only reason they became friends with me is because they got to know me for 4+ years. I joined some clubs in college with the hopes of making some friends,but it seems like everyone else in the clubs have ""clicked"" by now and I feel left out.

 My best friend recently gave me some honest feedback and told me that I am BORING AS HELL to talk to. I'm fun to chat with over text, but in person or over voice chat it is just boring and awkward to talk to me. I give slow replies, and seem disinterested (even though I'm not)

I'm guessing that this is the main reason that although Ive had several interviews, and I am able to answer the questions in the interviews, I do not get the offer. 

I would really like to improve my personality and be an exciting person to talk to, but it seems like a very hard thing to change. I want to be able to make new friends in college and especially do well in interviews. At this point, I'm not even going to think about dating/relationships as that seems like a long way away ( I can barely even talk to girls)

Does anyone have a collection of tips or books to read on how to become a more interesting, engaging,and interactive person to talk to? Any help is appreciated, thanks."

5np0cx,0,2017-01-13,Best school for a prospective CS major?,PM_MeYourFeels,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5np0cx/best_school_for_a_prospective_cs_major/,"It's my junior year in highschool, and after completing the first few weeks of Harvard's CS50x, I have fallen in love with computer science. What is the best school that will give me access to valuable internships and job offers? Academics aren't holding me back as much as financial limitations.

To give an example of where I am currently at academically:

By the end of this year I will have taken 6 AP courses. (WHAP, APUSH, AP Calc BC, AP Physics, AP Lang/Comp, and AP Music Theory) I'm expecting at least a 4 on every test. I plan to take at least 4 more AP courses my senior year.

My current ACT score is a 33 (as of the end of sophomore year), but I have frequently scored higher on the practice tests and expect a 34-35 when I take it at the end of this year. 

I scored one composite point below National Merit qualifications on my PSAT (99 percentile). I haven't taken the actual SAT yet.

I have only had one B (AP Calc BC) and am in the top 1% of my class. (Maybe salutatorian? We don't have class rank anymore.) 

Are these competitive enough academics to qualify me for a school like Stanford, or am I wasting my time? Stanford provides enough financial aid for me to go to school almost debt free and is located in an excellent location for CS majors, so it is very appealing to me. UC Berkeley and MIT most likely won't give me enough aid to graduate without a decent amount of debt. My parents are middle class, so we make enough to not receive aid, but not enough to finance two students in college.  Are there any schools that you guys recommend? Even the University of Washington might be financially out of reach. I'm looking for schools with large merit scholarships or ridiculous amounts of financial aid (Stanford, Princeton, etc.) along with an excellent CS program."

The place where I'm renting is in a shared house with 3 other roommates and thats where I spend 90% of my time.  When I'm not there, I'm at my parent's house where my brother who's older than I am still lives.  Right now, I'm renting a couch to do literally the internship of my dreams.  


*In the first house, one of my roommates is very passionate about politics that I don't believe in and will fight and be chaotic about it, another won't do his share of cleaning and is just a general mooch who once in a blue moon will do something, and the last roommate is the owner of the house and is a 73 year old who buys way too much food (to the point where tons of food gets waisted) and who's coping mechanism is to find something wrong and then nag other people to fix it for her. 


*at my parent's house, I'm the chick that left the nest and so all of the other birds at the house are constantly vying for my attention.  My father is the opposite political ideology from me and is also going down the mentally deranged train, believing in aliens and stuff, and is very vocal about the aforementioned, even after I've reminded him time and time again that I don't want to talk about that with him because it will go no where.  My mom is loosing her memory and gets confused really easily, so everything has to be explained to her at least 3 times before she gets it.  My brother is 30, has a job that may be paying, at best a bit more than minimum wage and is sore that he hasn't gone to college like me.  All 3 of the characters think I am the golden one and are very demanding of my attention when I visit and get vocally upset when my attention isn't on them for even the amount of time it takes to write a text. 


*I went on craigslist to find a temp place to live for 4 weeks while I did the internship that I've literally been looking forward to for my entire life and I find this guy renting a couch/bathroom/kitchen privilege thing for super super cheap compared to the surrounding area and its close to where I go for my internship.  Turns out he's a gentlemen over mid 60s who never married and who is lonely, which is fine but he fucking talks for HOURS!  I could handle a certain amount of conversation as well as the next person, but this is excessive.  The only times I have to myself are when he's not home, and then when he does come home he talks for hours, stressing me out enough that I have to take another 45 mins to an hour to settle myself down to sleep. Today was even worse because he had a temper tantrum about not being able to eat enough when (a) he has eaten in the last couple of days (b) he was worried about disturbing me when he was cooking and I've told him repeatedly it wouldn't bother me and to do what he needs to and (c) that he was let down because he thought I was going to cook (he said in his add, he would reduce rent for people who cooked, but I'm paying the posted price so I thought that it wasn't going to be an issue if I didn't cook for him that often) more because I told him I love to cook. Well the first day I was there he didn't trust me in the kitchen to actually do cooking and so I didn't cook unless he wasn't there so he wouldn't get in my way.  But now he's upset that I haven't been cooking for both of us, and what little groceries or food that I've bought that I've kept inside has gone to him. What annoys me even more is that he's a food snob, but at the same time refuses to take care of himself by cooking and/or feeding himself.
    

 These are the three places I've laid my head to rest at and they have all been driving me crazy.  I barely have time to rest and unwind at any of those places and I've complained so much about at least the first 2 places for over a year.  Ideally, I'd like to live by myself in a one-room apartment with my fiance. Now, is it just me?  Am I being too sensitive and should I suck it up and stick it out?  Place 3 had a temper tantrum this evening which is why I felt like I needed to vent, especially since my fiance is swamped with work. Sigh...thanks for listening. "

I got my engineering degree 4 months ago. 

At that time, I was suffering from depression and bad health due to a very bad diet, not getting enough sleep and not doing any sport. 

Since then, I've recovered, but I've not been sending more resumes. 

On average, I send one resume every week. I know a guy who is supposed to get my resume to some top people but he never calls me back and I'm not even bothered enough to call him back. It's like I don't care. 

So yeah, I'm tired, but I could totally go to my desk to send more resumes. So I've been thinking a little bit about all that, and why I don't do more things to get a job.

**First of all, I still hadn't make any decision regarding my immediate future**

I graduated from college and everyone told me I was going to get a job but me? I never made any decision ! Everything good that I earned in my life stemed from me taking the decision to earn them (""I want to go to college"", ""I want to do my internship in Canada"", for example). Here, I never choose anything ! 

**Intellectually, I know I should get a job but emotionnally, I want to feel good and have no problem**

I don't like my situation : I'm at home, my parents feed me...that's not what I want out of life. Plus, I'm unemployed. Because of me not liking these, I get bad emotions and feelings and it seems (when one looks at my actions) that my only goal right now is avoid negative emotion and emotional disturbances like the plague (and not find a job). Every time I get a negative emotion because of my situation, I run away from it or try to numb it with ice cream and video games. 

Every time someone gives me advices about my situation I go into panick mode and leave, because I don't want anyone to talk about my situation (which is bad).

**""TELL ME IT'S OKAY OR SHUT THE FUCK UP""**

Therefore, I flee away from reality, which makes me unable to change it. 

**I don't feel ready to get a job in a company**

Because of my bad experience during my last internship, because I've been living a terrible lifestyle for the past 3 years and thus feel the need to rest, I feel like I can't assume a job right now. Transitioning between college and the industry seems to be too big of a stretch to me.

There is a disconnect between my rational mind and my emotions. 

**What do I want, emotionnally?** 

Intellectually, I know I should get a job but I always had to have my emotions working for me, in the directions chosen by my rational mind, to get shit done and reach it's goal. Right now, I believe my emotions are playing against me. 

* On one hand I seek pleasure and fun, on the other hand I seek relaxation, calmness and a smooth, problem-free life. I use things that numbs me from reality and the negative feelings that my situation creates to feel as if everything is OK. 

* I'm affraid of people. I've been living alone for the past three years and the last people I use to hang out with betrayed me. I spent 3 years alone and I now see people as dangers. 

* I feel like I can't take on any challenges. I feel weak, incapable and inadequate. When a challenge or a conflict comes up I feel overwhelmed, like it's too much for me, and I flee away. Getting a job? The interview? And then actually DOING the job? No way, man. 

* After 3 hard years, I want to rest, relax and enjoy life. Not go back to working. 

* I want to feel good, to feel *safe*, to be able to relax. My environment provides me with that right now. My parents are great and encouraging. So they don't create any discomfort and thus no fear of what's going to happen if I don't find a job.

* I don't like my situation, and I want to flee away from it. That's why I always take long walks to just go away, leave. I also live it mentally by shutting down my brain thanks to the computer 24/7.

* Finally, and it's the best thing I want emotionnaly, I want to change my situation. Not deal with it, but radically change it. Because I'm sick and tired of it. But will I find the strength?

If you look at my actions, what I do during the day is basically mindlessly surfing the internet. I use that to bumb myself so that I can trick me into believing I'm OK and everything's gonna be fine, because I believe I couldn't deal with the challenge that my actual situation represents and the feelings of fear, anxiety, panick it would create. I can't deal with the reality of my situation so I numb myself to it, which makes it even worse. It's a downward spiral. 

**Tl;dr :** I don't feel like I could do a good job if I ever had a job. Due to my very bad experience during my internship, I don't want to go bad to an engineering position because I remember how bad I was feeling there, even though everyone tells me it was a bad company and that it's not like that in most companies. Because of those, I don't apply for jobs, my life goes to shit, I feel anxious and I have panick attacks, but I suppress those feelings with ice cream, computer games and porn in order to make life as comfortable as I can.

5nr0o7,2,2017-01-13,The whiter than white PR machine funded by her parents and Trump no less. Americans just cant believe that an upper middle class snow white could be guilty.,curdokur,amandaknox,https://www.reddit.com/r/amandaknox/comments/5nr0o7/the_whiter_than_white_pr_machine_funded_by_her/,"The netflix documentary shows how much power and influence an upper middle class white girl has, when she has the whole state department on her side, trump, even clinton, while Meredith has nobody to respond with a similar documentary

Amanda Knox claims that she had never been in love before Raffaele.  She is lying here as witness testimonies and in her own book she wrote that she wasn’t serious at all about Raffaele.  She even called him just a friend in her email home.  Raffaele said he never wanted to see Amanda again in court.

Amanda released a never seen before video of Meredith Kercher.  This has raised serious questions about how this escaped police files and also whether the Kerchers had been aware of its existence.  If Amanda had been hiding this video for almost a decade without showing anyone, including the victim’s family, then airs it on a Netflix documentary without warning… it is in extremely poor taste to put it mildly.  It can also be interpreted as an attack on the Kerchers who, like most everyone else, believes Amanda and Raffaele were involved in Meredith’s death.

The documentary shows explicit photos of Meredith Kercher’s body and bedroom covered with blood.  This is gratuitous and offensive since this video is not a careful look at the crime but a pro-Amanda Knox propaganda flick.
Amanda revels in the divisiveness she instigates in the first words of the documentary by teasing the audience with “If I’m innocent this and if I’m guilty that.”  Clearly Amanda is feeding into the controversy rather than trying to settle i once and for all.  She enjoys her distasteful displays of attention whoring.

Amanda prattles on about how she left for Italy to “become an adult” while neglecting to mention the police citation she received in Seattle just before she left.  Amanda had to go to court and face a fine for an out of control party she held. Then she blew off a prestigious internship in Germany that her uncle had pulled strings to get her into.  She walked off the job on the first day and never returned, preferring to drink alcohol in the park.

Amanda shows a video that her sister took of her in Italy.  In it Amanda swears and talks about how she admires men’s bodies.  Amanda omits that fact that she hooked up with a cocaine dealer on the train, abandoning her little sister in the hotel while she fooled around with drug dealer.

Amanda claims that she thought she was going to be a part of a scholarly program in Italy.  This is another lie. She enrolled in a school for foreigners which is open to anybody.  Meredith Kercher, on the other hand, was part of a prestigious Erasmus program at the University of Perugia.

Amanda claims that her boss Patrick Lumumba was “trying to get his bar off the ground.” This is a lie, his business was doing well until Amanda falsely accused him of murder.  Here Amanda tries to downplay her part in destroying the young fathers livelihood by claiming it was just starting.
When they showed pictures of Meredith’s vigil, the documentary omits fact that Amanda and Raffaele couldn’t be bothered to attend it.

Amanda doesn’t mention how Meredith blew her off on Halloween by not responding to her text messages.
Edited Raffaele’s call to police, deleting incriminating statement he made about nothing being stolen from Filomena’s room where there was a staged break-in"

I'm a 22 yo Spanish girl, I've just finished college and I've decided to quit smoking weed after two and a half years. I've been quite functional all this time, did internships, had good grades and all... But I was constantly feeling guilty, depressed and hopeless towards my future. The reasons why I quit are mostly the same I've been reading around: lost touch with reality, myself and my beloved ones, felt depressed and demotivated, not wanting to do things that I usually enjoyed, often found myself making up excuses not to go out, go to classes etc. because I just wanted to be stoned... And the money! I've been smoking around 50 euros a week and I'm afraid to do the maths!

I started smoking with my boyfriend. He suffers from depression and anxiety and so do I, according to my psychologist. Anyway, I don't think I am depressed, I've just been through bad moments recently and trying to suppress my pain with weed has not helped at all. 

I've made this decision along with my boyfriend, which is great as we can rely on each other. Anyway, I'm also taking this as a personal decision and a kind of fight against my true self in order to achieve stability in my life and acknowledge that I can be happy.

I'm experiencing some withdrawal symptoms such as extreme boredom, mood switches, irritability, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lots of disturbing dreams, lack of appetite and so on. I also have the flu and my period, so I reckon I have a mixture of everything going on haha.

I have some plans for the future: do some freelance job that I've been putting off (freelancing and weed are the worst combo ever), rejoin ballet classes, cook and eat better food and find a 9 to 5 job in order to have a sense of routine. I know it's a lot, but one step at a time...

I'm now feeling really good speaking about my problem, but the downs are also real. When I'm feeling hopeless, crying and wanting to die I say to myself that those are not true feelings but symptoms of withdrawal. I used to be a rather happy girl (the existentialist kind, but still happy). I'm willing to meet myself again and I know all I have to do is wait while tricking myself into having a ""normal"" life.

I'm so glad I found this community. See you around!"

I have been applying for internships (in Europe, if that matters) for about a week and now I received my first coding challenge by a company.

Unfortunately though, the challenge is said to span a whole week, and I don't have the time to do it right now, due to midterms. In the email/invitation it said I can take it ""any time"", but didn't define what ""any time"" is.

My question is, if I take it in a week or so, will I still be in contention? Are there any drawbacks in doing so? I have not started the challenge so I do not know what to expect.

Any input is appreciated."

However, the last year of school I took classes and studied laying in bed at home because of a spinal cord injury and Lyme Disease. I cannot sit in a desk, due to severe chronic pain. When I travel, I must be hauled around in a van with a mattress in the back, which I lay on. Because of this, I cannot work at a job. I have great credentials and even had 2 internships at Lockheed Martin and IBM before the accident.

I've had about 10 interviews since my graduation that were going very well until I told them I had to work remotely from my bed (their attitude changed completely, now being rude and rushed instead of friendly). With such good credentials, it should be easy for me to get hired, but I'm not, so I can only assume it's because I'm being discriminated against. I can understand that if the interviewee doesn't want to relocate on-site, then he wouldn't get hired. I WOULD relocate, but physically can't. Is there any law that prevents people like me from being discriminated against for hire? Thanks."

Great! However, after about two years of looking for work I kinda pivoted a bit to CS and started moving towards a tech-art position (thought it'd be easier to get a job in) and the thing is...I really like programming and moreover, think it'll be better for me in the long run (career-wise).

I recognize I'm not the best at programming/math and am not going to be inventing ""innovative, algorithmically complex, and ingenious code"", however I can already see how being able to make a couple of tools in c# to get things done quicker in my VFX is going to be invaluable. 

My question was...what should I do?

The company told me if after the internship I did well, they'd hire me as a contractor for VFX. I'm just wondering though...should I keep trying to finish school? 

Should I tell them I want to go back to school after the summer? Or should I try to work something out where I take a semester off (not sure if this is even possible) and just alternate until I finish up.

In you guys' experience, do companies, especially huge companies, like it that their employees are trying to learn new things?

This would be my second degree and I already checked that there is like...one school in the norCal that does offer second degrees. So I could enroll there.

It would really only be two years of just programming since I got my general requirements and just have to finish a couple of upper division math courses this semester to be able to ""transfer"" in to that other uni in the bay.

Or would you guys just say screw it and maybe do a bootcamp? 

I'm mostly concerned because it would just be a contract position (three month renewals), so it's not anything that's...""for sure"".

Also...I think I just really want to be a tech artist! I like making vfx, but the programming part is just super interesting and even if I don't become a ""Technical Artist"", knowing how to read the code errors that come up from time to time and being able to fix it without having to bother/slack a programmer sounds like a dream!

Any general advice is welcomed!!

thank you guys!"

I go into the room, log in, test every key, no issues, it's running fine. Then I look down at the keyboard and find out that a student thought it would be a good idea to use white-out on EVERY key on an all-white keyboard.

After my discovery I left if alone. I figured they would be able to manage with this issue. But then, the decided it would be a good idea to color in the keys with a magic marker...

5nskvb,4,2017-01-13,Worth it to intern at a small startup in Silicon Valley?,birdkickr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nskvb/worth_it_to_intern_at_a_small_startup_in_silicon/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

I am about to receive an offer for a small startup in Silicon Valley for around 30-35 dollars an hour without a housing stipend. I believe I will be working with a very small team of 5 - 10 engineers throughout the summer. The company itself is not well-known but is backed by reputable firms such as Y Combinator. 

My question is if this is a good opportunity as this will be the last internship before I will be looking for a full-time offer next year. Comparing myself with the things that I see on this sub, I feel like this is low pay in a place with very high COL. Although I feel like this will be a great opportunity to work with a small team and challenge myself intellectually, I'm a little scared that working at a company without a reputable name will make it harder for me to find a full-time position next year. 

I also previously received an offer for $27 dollars with $5K housing stipend in a low COL area for a company that is well-known but does not have high recruiting standards and is fairly bureaucratic with low GlassDoor rankings. Although working here would definitely give me more money in the short term and will have a recognizable name, I'm not sure about its internship program. Note that although it is a recognizable company, it is not highly regarded by all means.

Is it safe to say my best option is the SV startup? Overall is the startup offer reasonable? I have been seeing many individuals on this sub that are getting top companies in the area that are making much more in terms of salary alongside with getting a housing stipend. Although I don't come from a top school or have been coding since I was in high school, I still can't help but to compare myself to other high achievers. It does make me work harder and stand out from my peers at my university but at the same time still gives me a low sense of self worth."

5nsoo7,3982,2017-01-13,Made it through an entire year of manually entering my + my wife's expenses in a spreadsheet. Here's what we found!,utb040713,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5nsoo7/made_it_through_an_entire_year_of_manually/,"Backstory: My wife and I are both 24. I'm a PhD student, making $28k/year. After being unemployed for the first half of 2016, my wife is now employed as an elementary school teacher, making $34k/year. We got married right before the start of 2016. We live in a very low cost-of-living area, so we don't have huge rent expenses.

I'll admit it; I've always been a bit of a numbers geek. So, at the beginning of 2016 my wife and I decided to pay for everything via credit card, so we (I) can track our expenses. I break everything down into categories each month, and I calculate our average expenses per category. I know there are some programs out there that will do this automatically, but I wanted to do it myself because 1) I found that it really didn't take much time, and 2) I wanted to be able to separate expenses into categories manually (example: being able to separate buying $50 of groceries and $25 of school supplies in one run to the grocery store).

I won't go through category-by-category since I'm sure most people don't care, so I'll go through some of the highlights/lowlights:

* Before my wife started getting paid, we were about $1000/month in the hole. Luckily, I had about $30k saved up via working in high school/college, summer internships, etc., so this wasn't a huge issue. By the end of July, we were about $3k in the red for the year. It would've been much worse, but we got a $4k tax refund, which helped immensely.

* Despite being $3k in the hole at the end of July, we were back to breaking even for the year by the end of September. By the end of December, we were able to save $3500 for the year. It's less than I'd like to save, but it's better than nothing I guess!

* We spend way more on eating out than I realized! We spent about $3800 on eating out in 2016. A significant portion of this was due to the fact that we go do trivia with our friends every other week; once we both eat and have 1-2 drinks each, we're looking at a $40+ tab. Also, once my wife started her job we started spending more on fast food (she was too busy/drained to want to cook anything together). This is one area we're trying to improve on.

* Teachers really end up paying for their classrooms out of their own pocket! Before she started her job, we were spending about $40/month on school supplies (books, pens, paper, etc.). Since she started teaching, we're up to about $200-250/month in expenses between the two of us, mostly spent on supplies for her classroom.

* Adopting a dog is more expensive than you'd think. We adopted a dog from a local rescue in January. Between adoption fees, vet visits, toys, food, and supplies, we spent $850 in the first month alone. She also ended up getting sick a few months later, resulting in several hundred dollars in vet visits and medication. Now that she's all better, we still spend $75/month on average for food, toys, vet visits, heartworm prevention, and getting her nails trimmed.

* Not really expenses related, but moving our money to a high-yield savings account was definitely worth it! We're now getting about $16/month in interest, compared to the $0.48/month we were getting before.

* Also not expenses-related, but once my wife signed the paperwork for her job, I/we opened a Roth IRA! There's about $6500 in contributions in there right now, and the account balance is at $7150 or so.

Anyway, I just wanted to share that I found tracking our expenses manually to be *very* useful, and that it didn't take much time at all (2-3 minutes every night). I highly recommend it!"

I'm struggling processing the new pain and the regret I feel.,throwaway38958837489,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5nsvqb/me_25_m_with_my_recent_ex_23f_dating_18_months_i/,"Some background info on my life with help explain the problems I'm having.

I graduated from an out of state college in 2014 with quite a hefty load of student loan debt. Because of this debt, I decided my best option would be to move back home with my parents so that I could quickly finish paying off my student loans. Since moving back home, I've had a really hard time focusing and finding a job with my degree which is in economics. I was stupid in college and never had a serious internship to put on my resume. I went into college as undeclared and didn't decide on my major until the end of my sophmore year. Because I was in a hurry to finish my degree on time, I decided to take summer classes to make sure I would graduate on time leaving me no time for a summer internship. 

Because of my troubles finding a good job in my field, I have been lucky enough to work for my fathers business during this time. Because of my debt and me living at home, dating as been really tough. No girl wants to date a 25 year old still living at home. I felt stuck and still do. No prospects on any girl, no chance of bringing them home to have sex, I was depressed and didnt see a bright future. Thats where my recent ex comes in.

I met her through tinder last september. She was also living at home at the time and still is. I thought I found a girl that would help me out of my funk. She didn't care that I was still living at home. We instantly liked each other. One of the problems we had though was that we had very different types of friends and social scenes. Her and her friends are really into dupstep and going to raves and my friends aren't. Her friends ranged from past  highschool friends to work friends to college friends. When she would have a party at her house, there would be a range of people from 18yrs old to 30yrs old. I felt so out of place and never invited my friends over because they wouldnt know how to fit in. 

She went to the local college and worked part time at jamba juice so her work friends weren't exactly the type of people I was used to hanging out with. Despite all of that, This past year and a half has been amazing with her but I was still going nowhere with my life and hid it from her. We started off dating casually because of our conflicting schedules. Meeting up  at night for happy hour, or going over to her house when her parents were out of town and vice versa. Another problem we had which was my fault was that I never made any moves to progress the relationship to the next level cuz I believed we didn't have the time for it. I believed that since both of us were still living at home, only getting to see each other maybe 2-3 times  a week, and only at night to smoke weed or get happy hour, that a casual relationship was all that we could handle.

 But I never told her that.  Thats why I never asked her to officially be my girlfriend. Over the past year and a half she had only meet my friends once and I never introduced her to my parents which is my biggest regret. She felt like I was hiding her which was not my intention. I just didnt want to get too invested when I knew that I would not be able to move out until I finish paying off my student debts. I felt too old to have an official girlfriend and to be still living at home. I was ashamed. It felt like it would only be a highschool type of relationship and I didnt want to bring that on her. She was going to be graduating soon and was planning on moving out for a job. I didn't want to hold her back from her life and make her stay for me when I couldn't really offer her anything.  Anytime we would hang out, it would only ever be just us two or me going over to hang with her and her friends. I was embarrassed of my situation and was not ready for a serious relationship but never told her that. I fell complacent with how things were going. Months came and went and we were still doing the same things over and over again. She was my escape.  I never said I loved you even though I had been feeling it for awhile. She got so fed up wondering where this was going, me never really having an in depth conversation about our future, that she finally called it off two days ago.

 I was heartbroken because just recently I had finally become ready to ask her to be my girlfriend and introuduce her to my family. I could see myself finishing off my debts within the next year and could see myself moving out soon. She just graduated and would have more time on her plate for us. I didnt tell her this until it was too late and its killing me. She got tired of putting in effort to never go anywhere. I had strung her along too long that by the time I was ready, she was over it. This break up has been killing me because I thought we had more time and I waited too long to let her know how I felt. Im filled up with so much regret because if I had just been honest with her, this wouldn't be happening. I dont know what to do with myself. I have this aching bottomless pit in my stomach that I can not get rid of. I can barely eat or sleep. My mind just keeps going on rewind to times when I couldve told her how I truly felt and how important she was to me. Just soo much regret its killing me. How do I move on? 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Causally dated a girl for 18 months. Never made any steps to progress the relationship until it was too late for her. Don't know how to process this regret I have for not taking action earlier and communicating how I truly felt. How do I get over this?"

So I'm a straight girl, but I've obsessed over people for as long as I can remember, to the point where I live the entire relationship in my head, but nothing really happens in reality.
This year I fell for a young female teacher from my university.
I walked into her office one day to talk about a project and I just sat down and we started talking about literature, getting along and laughing. Then I was just very enthusiastic about the subject and wanted to do a good job and impress her.
The next time we met we were out, with a few other people from uni, and had a beer and just laughed together and had fun. We regularly meet - either at uni, or when we go out and have a beer.

Then I started being really euphoric after each time we met and, at the same time, I started being pretty sure that she was a lesbian - I think anyone would think that just from what she looks like and how much of a feminist and pro LGBT she is.
Before I knew it, I felt butterflies in my stomach every time I ran into her and started actually having romantic fantasies about her and making up elaborate scenarios of how we could end up together. I started adjusting my opinions and style to be more of a person that she would like - even if this meant pretending to agree with some things that actually oppose my principles. I think this a very typical limerence-behaviour and I've always done this. I've always tried to adjust my whole personality and style to be more like the person I was currently obsessing over.

Back to the story: a couple of days ago she casually mentioned an ex-boyfriend and I instantly felt my heart pounding like crazy, then like something slowly died inside of me, because that means that she's not a lesbian.
I already actually knew that next year she's going abroad - for good - and I was kind of desperate, but I even came up with a plan to go abroad myself and do a sort of internship in the same country.
But now, that I know she's straight, the whole sort of high that I've been feeling in the past couple of months is gone and I feel a big void inside of me. The thing is, I'm sure she likes me, because she keeps inviting me to events where we meet and talk, but probably only as a friend - we use our first names and she's quite informal.
Now I've started to analyse all the gestures and things that she said and to feel a sort of resentment - why has she been so warm, can someone be so warm and not feel anything? I guess this is actually a general problem when someone falls in love with a person of the same-sex, who's straight. They might be showing interest and warmth, but only as friends.
In this whole period of time, I actually started looking at LGBT events and felt a bit of attraction for other obvious lesbians - that I've met at these underground-art events, where members of the LGBT community hang out. I've read more about this and felt like I could really love a girl, not any girl, but a girl certainly.

Anyway, this is my story. I'm hoping you guys can tell me if this just seems like a very delusional stage of limerence, where the gender and sexual orientation don't even matter anymore, since  until now I've only ever fallen for guys.
And I should also mention that I am extremely shy with guys (just the ones I like actually) and maybe I'm just so hopeless, that I would just fall for any person that shows interest and gives me attention.
Sorry for the long post, I just really wanted to get all this of my chest."

5ntaf6,3,2017-01-13,I got a interview for assistant systems for a hotel need some advice,Pzhy,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5ntaf6/i_got_a_interview_for_assistant_systems_for_a/,"Heres the deal i back in 2011 dropped higschool half way done (1 year and 6 months in) with electro mechanic career (that i realized i hated it and i dont remember shit about it) (i have a paper that confirms that education level).

After that i got lucky enough to land a internship position in IT systems for a hotel (paid internship) and i did that for 9 months (finishd in 2012).

Sadly after that internship i never managed to get another IT job mostly because all jobs i saw asked for collage grade school and that combined with the very low market for IT jobs in my city yeah a big fuck me in my face.

Since then i worked shit jobs (clerk, steward and waiter) (and yes never bothered to come back to school) and yesterday i saw an assistant systems without specific requirements so i was like ""Fuck it send resume lets see what happens"" and i got a email for a interview on monday 

So now im wondering if im actually capable of doing the job and i want to know opinions of people that work in the IT stuff

This is the things i did back in the internship days: 

 • Fixing, maintenance and building of pc's, customer/employee support (AKA cant enter my password) 

 • word documents (report and stuff) and excel documents (basic formulas), 

 • insalling pcs (AKA go connect a pc for someone and make sure you do nice cable management) 

 • on top of that this internship was my first experience in the hotel industry and my boss was pretty cool guy and push me to learn english 

i never really touched the servers and did very little work on the networking (but i understod the concept)

Fast forward 4 years (NOW) im more confident about my knowledge on the things i listed above, (mostly because im a tech fanboy) i got more experience on hotels by working other lower positions and my english i think is pretty good i can talk very fluent and i guess my grammar is shit.

and yes im thinking to get back to school this year i need to get a better job with more office like working hrs to be able to do it."

I am currently studying Computer Science online through a university in Colorado. I work a full time job in Las Vegas as a legal assistant making decent money. My fiance and I rent a home and have two full sized large dogs. We are open to move to any state on the West coast in order for me to get started in my career. The problem that I'm having is the timing of it. I am about a Sophomore with almost all of my general education classes done but only a handful of Computer Science classes under my belt. I am willing to switch to an internship in my career but I need it to be full time in order for me to pay my bills. Las Vegas does not have very many, if any, internships in Computer Science  (they are mostly IT). Do I move to get close to potential internships? Do I apply from here and get looked over because of where I'm located? What happens if I move too early and don't have enough experience? Then I'm doing the same work I'm doing here just in another location where I could stay here and stay at the decent job (people and pay) that I have in Vegas while I finish my degree. Anyways any advice is appreciated. "
5ntkj1,4,2017-01-13,I feel like I'm in a tough place and I shouldn't be.,amomentintimetime,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5ntkj1/i_feel_like_im_in_a_tough_place_and_i_shouldnt_be/,"Hello there, people of /r/depression. I have read a lot of stories, personal deep thoughts here, and I think each and everyone of you are incredibly strong individuals that keep fighting through all the pain and suffering you deal with every day. 

I've been feeling quite down recently, and progressively worse, so I figured this could be my turn to share them with you.

I come from a well-off family who has awarded me with an incredibly privileged life, from school, my health, my spending, my opportunities to pursue any hobby I want. I have great friends, not too many, actually just a little, 2-3. They are friends that I will die for, and friends I can tell anything to. But I don't share negative feelings with them because I still believe negative emotions are contagious, and I want them to be happy.

I'm in my 3rd year of university and it's been very miserable ever since it started. My depression and anxiety, and my idea of always appearing strong and not appearing vulnerable as a man has led to me not ever sharing my emotions, thus building a wall between me and any potential friendships. The sad truth is I don't have one single close friend here, the closest friend I have in university are mere acquaintances at best. 

The 2-3 very close friends I have live overseas, where my hometown is, and we see each other 2 times a year, winter and summer break, so pretty much I'm alone here. Alone in this small university town, where drinking and strenuous studying to get ahead in your career are the norms. I don't like drinking, so all I do is study hard. My interests are in studying politics and economics, reading books on financial news and things of related fields. Basically hobbies that are consumed by yourself, so a lot of the times, actually, all the time I'm by myself in solitude. 

I'm an introvert, but god damn it, even I crave social interaction. I'm an open minded person and I would love to meet new people. But there aren't any clubs here that interest me. So I don't go to any. In our university, we have an exchange program where you go study abroad for one semester in a partner school somewhere else around the world. For my exchange I went to the UK which happened last semester. I met my girlfriend there, I have only had flings in the past, and a relationship where we were all too young to care and invest into. She's wonderful, extroverted, happy, optimistic, lovely, all aspects of personality and quality that are the opposite of mine. We had a wonderful time together, and I also made a lot of close, tremendous friends there. But time passed, one semester passed like what felt not enough. And I'm back here. All alone in this sad and miserable place.

Everyday I wake up, read books, read news, study, apply for summer internships. Everything there is to do is all by myself, with no one to talk to and hangout with in person. I'm so tired of this loneliness and I really, really want to have someone to talk to and care about in real life. My girlfriend and I are attempting long distance and it's been hard. She has great friends, she's having a great social life and despite Skyping with each other everyday, I feel like our differences are drifting us apart. I ask her how she's doing and she seems to not be giving effort into updating me. Of course, she's not obligated to. Who has time for a sad man when she's busy having fun? It's logical. I'm alone and sad, of course I'm going to wonder how she's doing because I care about her. But I don't want to appear needy and be overbearing. She's having fun and all I am is sobering alone in this sad town. I have nothing to tell, no stories to share apart from the knowledge I learn from my books and documentaries. She tells me all these great stories about her life, and I'm so, so happy for her. She has mental issues in the past, and I'm so proud of her for finally stepping out of that zone. 

I'm falling deeper and deeper into this depression hole, I really ponder about the reason to live anymore. A lot of people have it worse than me, in terms of circumstances, but my tolerance is much weaker than a lot of the strong people here. Years of depression and sadness, chronic loneliness is crashing down on me all at once, I don't know what to do. I love my girlfriend, and I HATE that I'm in such a dark place and I'm nothing but a dark spot in her life.

I'm just depressed. Just needed to vent this all out, if you made it this far. Thank you for reading."

I'm graduating in June and of my three summers in college I only had an internship one summer, and I really only got that because my dad gave it to me. I'm applying to full time positions in CS/IT areas, but to be honest I feel like my actual work experience is a bit underwhelming. I think another internship would really help my resume but I'm not sure if companies want to have a summer intern who just graduated. Is it worth applying anyway? I'm looking at one listing for an IT internship that says they're looking for someone with an ""anticipated graduation between December 2017 and Summer 2018"" (mine would be June 2017), but it also says that students selected for the internship would be considered for full time employment. I think my ideal outcome from this summer would be if I could land a summer internship that led to full time employment, so this sounds like a good opportunity for me but I'm not sure if it's worth my time applying... Should I apply anyway or will I likely automatically be disqualified? (It's a pretty large company.) If I do apply should I bring this up in the cover letter? If so what should I say? Any other tips for getting internships as a soon to be graduated senior?"
5ntsfz,6,2017-01-13,How to manage a web developer?,benabus,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5ntsfz/how_to_manage_a_web_developer/,"I'm a full-stack web developer.  In my department, I'm the ONLY web developer and my workload was getting to be too heavy for a single person.  Thankfully, the higher ups recognized this and got a part-time web developer to take up some of the load.

This guy was brought in to basically be my assistant, so while I'm not technically his boss (I don't set his hours or sign his timesheet or anything), I'm the one who gets to manage what projects he works on and oversee his work.  Thus far, I've given him one easy-ish project that I just haven't had the time to work on and I'm confident that he can handle it, so I've kind of given him free reign on it for the time being.

The problem is, I've never managed anyone before. I had an intern at one point a few years ago, but he didn't really do too much, so this is the first time I'm in any sort of a ""boss"" role. I've been planning on taking a laissez-faire approach and treating him how I like to be managed, but thinking back to my intern, I'm not sure this is a wonderful idea.  I don't want to micro-manage, but at the same time, I don't want him to take advantage of my inexperience and laid back attitude.  Another issue is that he's older and more experienced than I am, so it feels a little awkward telling him what to do and looking over his shoulder.

Up until now, my credo has been ""I'm just a web developer"", but I don't think this is going to fly in this scenario where I'm put into some sort of pseudo- supervisorial role.  It's only been a few days since he's started, so I'd greatly appreciate any sort of advice on managing before I screw up too badly and set poor precedents.

tl;dr
I'm a full-time web developer that needs advice on how to manage a part-time web developer working under me.

Any help would be appreciated."
5ntxvd,2,2017-01-13,[TECH] Kamikaze Drones,TysonMcNuggets,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/5ntxvd/tech_kamikaze_drones/,"An important fact was brought up at a meeting recently, Luxembourg does not have a lot of money nor does it have a lot of people. The heads of the DoToL and the DoDoL agreed with this intern and said there needed to be a new solution to the fact Luxembourg cannot just buy all the fanciest equipment for its own defense. That where Kamikaze Drones came up into the discussion.

The principle of Kamikaze drones is simple, stick a brick of C4 to a drone and then fly it into what ever you want to blow up, cheap and effective. After just watching Star Wars XX: The Empire Strikes Back a Second Time, an intern thought of a sort of mothership set up where dozens of drones could be fit onto a plane and then launched and controlled with the planes own computers to decrease the cost of shooting each drone.

The Drones would need to be able to withstand shooting out of a plane at flying speeds so a normal quad-copter would not able able to work. A design like that of a paper airplane was the solution. It was streamline enough that when it falls out of a moving plane it could pick up enough speed with the help of one prop to reach and maneuver to its destination. Since this drone technology has been around since 2016, consumer manufactures already have a wide selection of suitable models that we can test out to see which works best.

As a joint effort the DoToL and the DoDoL plan on spending a joint $200 million total on testing and software development over 1 and a half years to complete this project. Unit cost is expected to be around $200 while the system to control the drones is expected to cost $500,000 a unit when completed.

Other foreign technology departments are welcome to help fund this project to help the small guys around the world prevent themselves from becoming a stomping ground like Luxembourg has been in the past."

5nu6pc,7,2017-01-13,A Fair and Balanced Review of the New Chainsmokers Single,PGP_Shambles,PostGradProblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostGradProblem/comments/5nu6pc/a_fair_and_balanced_review_of_the_new/,"*note: apparently this wasn't funny enough for the new intern so read at your own peril*

In a move that makes T-Swift’s attempt at selling out seem like an alt-punk album, The Chainsmokers have released a new single and plumbed new lows of basic. I’ve never been one to blindly hate on something, so I decided to sit down and loop the song in order to properly disparage it. 

Opening with the kind of synths that would do any sorority girl’s “Summer 2k16” video proud, the tone is set for a perfect pseudo-deep tale of love lost. At least I think that’s what the song is about, since trying to get a message out of this is a lot like trying to stop your drunk friend from ordering another round of shots. Better to just walk away.

The Chainsmokers have fully committed themselves to producing music made for themselves and those like them: frat stars who have problematically low amounts of respect for women and bafflingly high self-esteem, and the freshman girls they’re plying with drinks. I’m no stranger to generic club hits, but this is just offensively bland. This song was so forgettable that I had to listen to it 3 times before I could focus on it long enough to form an opinion. This is muzak for clubs with too many people and not enough lights. I can only assume the complete lack of bass is an acknowledgement that five remixes better than the original song will be out shortly, and adding a bass line of their own would only slow down the process. It’s hilarious that a song that represents such a fall from grace uses hook “let’s show them we are better”.

I’d say that the three lyrics in the song are sung poorly but that would acknowledge the mutterings of Chainsmoker #1 as music. One would be surprised at the audacity the group would need to stat phasing out actual singers from their songs in order to feature themselves even more broadly, but then one would remember these are the same people who compared themselves to the success and influence of Bieber and Drake in an interview:

“Only Justin Bieber and Drake can hold a candle to what we’ve done. Now we’re influencing the industry, putting out songs everyone copies”

There is an incredible irony in people who specialize in generic club music claiming to be the golden standard everyone aspires towards.
While I could continue to go on pointing out flaws in the song and the respective issues in society they highlight, I am entirely unable to listen to this anymore. Instead, I’ll end with a selection of candid reactions to the eventual #1 hit from the GroupMe:

“Just started listening to Paris. Wtf is this song? He can’t sing and the lyrics make the opposite of sense.”

“Their idea of showing people they are better is using their parents’ money to fly across the world to have a drunk night on snapchat?”

“This song is beyond trash.”

“Have the Chainsmokers not heard of going on a Mission trip and posting a pic with the entire village to show people you are better?”

“The beat is too similar to roses I think. So they’re not very original.”

“I made it 3 minutes into the song, and all I can say is that I wish they had never made it out of Paris. For the first time in my life, I kinda wish the axis powers had won WW2""

“Sounds like it’s written for a rebellious 17 year old that buys a passport and then asks her parents to pay for the vacation abroad with her similarly idiotic best friend. Then they end up getting kidnapped by some 26 year old smooth operators and Liam Neeson has to come save them.”

“This song is the longest 4 min of my life.”

“It fucking sucks. That’s about it.”

It's the story of my life, the life of a man lost in the milkyway. Well I am a person who happen to have an AvPD, like you probably. 

I want to share my experience of the last few years of my life. I posted here from time to time and was an avid reader. But later I lacked time because of my studies. 

I graduated from a business school (it's free in the country where I live), I have made many sacrifice to be graduated and have an opportunity to have a job, a job for a living.  Sacrifice because I needed to have social interaction, many social interaction, and try to have conversation with people both in school and during my internship. Well I managed to do that even if it's was very hard, not very well but I have done it, that the most important ( and hey I am still alive ;) ). Maybe I will share some stories about that time but now I will talk more specificaly about the recent period.

During my internship I had made sacrifice because I needed to have good relationship with coworker and customers ( I was in an audit firm). I was not myself, I was acting, I needed to do that in order to survive in that environment and to get my diploma ( this was my way to have a job my way to get food and water, simply to live ).

Then I get my diploma and during that time (*), I don't know when exactly, slowly I started to accept myself as I was. I accepted that I was not good at social interaction and well after that I started to feel very well, very warm inside me. I was much more able to express my opinion on different subject, I was not seeking attention or friendship, I was just myself not caring much ( well still care but not as much as before ) about what other think of me, I am just a guys who is not good at social interaction, that it, simple as that.

(*: maybe before or after don't remember exactly )

At present day I still think like that, I am working on accepting myself as I am. But there is a problem, they don't accept me like that, I have found a job and they don't like the way I am. They want me to change, to be more ""open"", more talkative, to go more toward others. But I don't want to do that, I can do it, I have done it in the past, it's hard but it's possible, but I just don't want, it's not me, and it's not the me I want to be.

Life in never simple as it seems. At least with me, probably with you also.

So, recently, they asked me if I can change the way I behave. And I don't know why, maybe because I was tired (of the hardwork), or more realisticaly because I was afraid (of the direct consequence and long term consequence ) I said ""Yes, I will do an effort"". Unfortunately. 
	
So what should I do ? Should I change or stay the same ? I am afraid of not finding a job where I can be just myself, do my task, and go home without bothering anybody or being bothered by anybody or any social norm.
It's seems to be asking to much to the society, to much to this life... 
...maybe there is a place in the MilkyWay, where people like me, like you, can find jobs, make a living, live their lifes and be accepted as they are...
The Space is big....  WHO KNOWS ....

I had to do a lot of back end development including C/C++, Java, Shell, Linux, and SQL stuff. In addition, they had me work on new features of projects on my own and document a lot of their legacy code.

I had to present my work not only to my manager, but to the project lead, and clients.

I got along with my team well, and my manager was always super excited and proud of my accomplishments in the short time period of my internship. He reviewed me on a weekly basis, and mentioned I even outperformed some of the senior employees.

The company even encouraged me to attend these cool meetings at their main New York City HQ, and flew me to their Florida HQ with all travel reimbursed.

With all of that said, my internship was (in my eyes) successful. On my last day, the whole office had a little surprise party for me with cake, and my manager has been in touch with me for a little afterwards while I was studying in college.

During the semester at school I realized I haven't heard back from my manager in a while... So I decided to email him. I never got a reply, and later found out he was let go (for financial reasons). I don't have any way to contact my former manager so I'm confused. I only had his work email and cell-phone. 

* I have even tried to contact the person who was in charge of my manager, but so far it's been a week with no response.

Now I'm left with not knowing what to do and feel lost with this situation. I never got a job offer either!

5nuudc,50,2017-01-13,[FM] Meeting a lawyer on craigslist and playing as his niece,Lyke_,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5nuudc/fm_meeting_a_lawyer_on_craigslist_and_playing_as/,"Wow, this turned into a fucking long post, sorry about that. Also, this is more sexual than my pizza incident, but not a ton, so if you really want full on sex you should keep looking. This is just another one of my craigslist encounters that happened a few months ago (I'd probably never agree to do this kind of thing in winter, too damn cold).

In his listing, he described what he wanted as something “only for risk-takers” and “real exhibitionists”. I know both of those sound dumb out of context, but when I’ve had a bit to drink and I’m really craving that particular fetish that kind of talk really appeals to me. The post was pretty simple, he worked at a local law firm that had an attached parking garage. He wanted to meet a girl willing to blow him in between two strangers’ cars and maybe then fuck in the back of his SUV. What really sealed the deal for me was that he finished his post by mentioning that there were security cameras in the garage, but he was pretty sure they were just for show. The idea of possibly getting caught (even though I doubted he’d risk his job so they probably were just for show) makes me almost feel like I’m going to have a panic attack, but in a good way so I had to message him back.
 
I sent a reply with some pictures and made it clear I really wanted to make this happen. Learned a bit about him; he’s in his 40s, not married, not in great shape (pretty chubby, but I like bigger chubby guys so that was a plus), and was obviously excited at the prospect of a girl half his age sucking him off in public. We talked a bit about how we wanted to set this up, if I should just be waiting for him, and he brings up the idea of me posing as his niece. He wanted to take the whole thing a step further and have me first show up at his office and pretend to be his nonexistent niece who was studying law and wanted to see what an actual law firm was like. I didn’t immediately warm up to the idea, it kind of seemed a little too risky to me, but we chatted over email for a few days and he slowly brought me around on it. The idea was straightforward. I’d dress up a bit, show up to his firm around lunch time, he’d walk me around and introduce me to some coworkers, we would maybe fool around in his office, then he’d take his “niece” out to “lunch”.
 
For our “lunch date” I wanted to look the part of an eager law student, but honestly didn’t have a single thing that would be quite formal enough so I had to hit up our local equivalent of goodwill. I ended up grabbing a white blouse (that was a little too small but I’ve got a pretty flat chest so it wasn’t bad), grey H&amp;M blazer, and almost knee length black skirt. I finished it off with an old pair of black heels I’ve had for ages and a black choker (and for those wondering what I had under all that: matching black bra and panties from free people). I always keep my hair short but still tried not make it look semi-professional (although I probably still looked a little out of place). I showed up at the building at noon and took the elevator up. I was sweating bullets. You might think that after doing as many craigslist hookups as I have you might start feeling comfortable, but I am always a nervous wreck. My whole body feels twitchy and I can feel my face just burning up. Before the doors open I have to remind myself to breathe, but it barely helps as I step out of the elevator. This was a serious law firm. Silly decorative books lining every wall, at least 3 stories with a nice dark wood staircase in front of floor to ceiling windows.
 
At the front desk is a dark haired older receptionist who immediately sees that I’m out of my element. “Hi sweetie, can I help you?” She sounds completely sincere, which helps calm me down a little. “Uh yes, I’m here to see John Smith, he’s my uncle,” I say and do my best to look trustworthy. “Let me call him, take a seat and he should be right out.” I quickly sit down on a nearby chair (pretty cushy) and wait uncomfortably with my hands clasped in my lap. The receptionist barely hangs up before I see john trotting down the stairs. He’s wearing a pretty typical not-great-fitting black suit, white shirt, and red tie. “Lyke! It’s great to see you, how was the flight?” He hugs me and turns toward the secretary, “Diane, this is Lyke, my niece. Lyke this is Diane, she keeps everything running around here.” Diane does a little wave from behind her desk and smiles. “Come on, let me show you around.” He puts his hand and on my shoulder and scoots me forward. We turn into the first door we come to. It’s a large room with maybe 10 or so desks. “We call this the intern pen,” he grins and pulls me back through the door and we head towards the stairs. “I work upstairs.” As we climb I stare out the window that looks over downtown. “Wow, this is a really incredible view.” “I know,” he responds, “but the view from my office is even better.” I smirk and let out a giggle, I’m pretty I know exactly what kind of view I’ll be getting from his office. As we go to his office we run into someone that I assume he’s pretty friendly with. John introduces me again and mentions that I plan to study law. His coworker asks me where I want to study and I make up some bullshit about currently going to a state school for pre-reqs and I have some dream schools but I don’t want to jinx them so I didn’t have to really say anything concrete. We say goodbye and finally make it to his office. John does a quick hallway check to make sure no one sees us go in together and then closes the door. I wander to the window, and he was actually right, the view from his office is even better. You can’t see as much of downtown, but he has a nice perspective on some of the nearby mountains. I’m distracted enough that I jump when he comes up behind me and puts his hands on my hips. They start sliding up my body and he whispers in my ear, “I’m so glad my favorite niece decided to visit.” His hands reach my breasts and he gropes me so hard that I yelp. He shushes me, “come on, we don’t want my coworkers to hear.” John pulls away and sits in his chair. I slowly follow and climb into his lap, pushing up my skirt to straddle him. Now, I’m not really that into incest roleplay. It doesn’t turn me off, but it just doesn’t do anything for me, but I was definitely getting caught up in the moment and wanted to play along some. I started grinding against his crotch and I could feel his cock perk up quickly and press back against me. “Well you know I’d never miss a chance to see my favorite uncle.” I lean in to kiss him and he pulls me tight against him, locking our bodies together as his tongue slides into my mouth. I honestly don’t know what to do with my hands so I settle on wrapping my arms around his neck and grinding even harder. I know I shouldn’t moan but I can barely stop myself with him pressed against me like this. I think we made out for a good 15 minutes before I pull away, “You know we should really get started on our lunch date.” I climb off of him and can tell he’s disappointed that we didn’t go further in his office. “Don’t worry uncle, I promise I’ll make up for it.” Feeling more confident (or just hornier) I grab his hand and pull him out of his chair. We get back to the elevator, only saying goodbye to Diane on the way out.
 
From the elevator we go to the parking garage and I let him lead the way, thankfully he had planned ahead. He parked on a higher level than usual where almost nobody else would be and he had his SUV right by the wall furthest from the elevator. There’s nobody around, but we both start walking faster to get out of sight just in case anyone else drives onto this level. The second we’re behind his car his hands are all over me. John helps me out of my blazer and turns me around. With my back pressed against him he starts to undo the buttons on my blouse (honestly I probably undid more, guys have trouble with buttons on the wrong side :P). I shrug off the blouse as he massages my tits. I reach behind me and put a hand in his hair as he lowers his head and starts kissing and biting my neck. One of the bites is just a little too hard which makes me yelp. We both immediately freeze and listen to make sure no one could have heard it. One of his hands slides down my stomach, into my underwear. I’m still soaking from our earlier make out session; rubs my clit for a moment before moving his hand lower and sliding a finger inside me. It feels good, but there’s so little I can do from this position that it’s actually a little frustrating. Eventually I pull away and turn around while dropping to my knees. I unzip his fly and reach into his slacks. I look him in the eyes and bite my lip while my hand plays with his cock. “Do you like this uncle? Do you want your little niece’s mouth wrapped around your cock.” John laughs and cups my face in his hand, sliding a thumb into my mouth. I decide to stop teasing him and guide his cock out through his fly. He’s not huge, pretty average length but fairly thick. I take the tip into my mouth and suck the first drop of precum out, moaning as a slowly take his cock deeper and deeper until he’s completely inside my mouth. I take his balls gently in one hand and slide my head back. I wrap my other hand around the base of his cock and start moving my mouth back and forth, going just past the tip of his cock every time.
 
 It’s not long before he’s grunting under his breath and shallowly thrusting into my mouth. “Oh fuck Lyke, I’m gonna cum,” I keep going for a second to get him even closer right before I pull my lips off of his cock and start jerking him off with one hand. My hand is sliding the length of his shaft and I have my face pressed against. I let out an exaggerated moan, “do you want to cum on your nieces tits uncle? Oh please, I want to feel your hot cum on my chest.” He manages to let out another “oh fuck” and I can feel his balls twitch so I lean back and arch my back, pushing my chest up towards the tip of his cock as he starts to cum. This wasn’t porn levels of cum, but it was a few solid ropes splashing onto my tits and bra. I rub some of it in and lick a little bit of the cum off my fingertips as I stare up at him and lick my lips. I don’t know why, but I always get kind of giddy when a guy cums and end up laughing or giggling and I couldn’t maintain the whole incest roleplay at this point. I laughed, “wow John, you must have been pretty backed up huh?” He’s breathing heavily and leaning against his car. “Mm, that was fucking incredible, hah damn I wish I had more time for my lunch break.” He was right, it hadn’t felt like long, but we had probably been in the garage for at least 45 minutes between paranoia, foreplay, and blowing him. I didn’t really have a good way to clean up so I just put the blouse and jacket back on, hoping nothing would leak through too badly. We sadly didn’t end up having sex in the SUV, but I think that I’ll have to try playing in garages again some time.

Thanks for reading! Hope you liked it, sorry it was another one without much “real” sex, maybe next time haha. Feel free to comment or send PMs, I love responding."

I also took a web dev course and have some outside experience with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, node.js, AJAX, MySQL. But I haven't done many projects either. I am looking to get an internship in the summer after my first year. Any idea on how I can do that, or improve my chances? Maybe get some more experience with Java and basic algorithms? I am not sure if it is even possible for someone with so limited experience.

5nv7c1,3,2017-01-13,Need advice--salary discrepancy!,tickingalethiometer,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/5nv7c1/need_advicesalary_discrepancy/,"Context: I'm graduating university this spring, with 2 STEMs degree and a good amount of work experience for my age. I'm starting the job application process, so I'm still just learning! I appreciate any advice!

I had a phone interview today with a company that I am really interested in! They seem like a great company. Things went very well, and I have moved on to the ""next round"" but there was one small issue I need help on!

I was initially interviewing for a position that I have decent background in--I have freelanced in the field for several years, and had a great internship with an S&amp;P 100 company, where I now have great contacts and recs. I know my value in that career path, and feel that the salary range is appropriate for the amount of work typical to that position.

During my interview for this familiar type of position, my interviewer really pressured me for a salary figure to work with--of course I tried to avoid an exact number, talked about how I was open to negotiating and understood working around an industry standard etc. etc. but basically she wasn't going to let the conversation move on until I gave some estimate, so I gave an appropriate range for that position. (I know, I know, that's a no-no but I wasn't sure how to do any more avoiding without losing out on the interview)!

Now, after talking for quite a while she tells me that the company is actually quite interested in taking me on for a much more high-stakes, higher pressure, much more interesting job----a management position. I'm definitely interested, so we talk more about that position and she's very open to me doing more research on that kind of role because I don't have much background in project management. Things go great and we seem to have pivoted to a job that's even more of a dream job to me than the initial position I had applied for...

But now I'm worried that she will take the number I had discussed for the ORIGINAL job I applied for as a hard number. This number would be quite low (we're talking at least 20k lower...) for a LOW end of the industry standard of the management role I am now being vetted for... This would obviously not only hurt me in terms of raises/promotions in THIS company, but would also be a bad start later down the road with other career opportunities.

So... Advice for discussing that salary discrepancy now that I'm being interviewed for a much more intensive role? I have some decent ideas on how to negotiate, but I would really, really appreciate input! Thanks guys!

tldr: Had a job interview for one job that turned into an interview for a more intensive job, but how can I avoid them insisting on the salary of the first job?"

I got automatic replies saying they would respond later with more details about the process. A month or two went by and I didn't get any response, I had pretty much given up BUT THEN, I got an email from an intern from Elizabeth Warren's office saying that I was still on the list and asking for some details (my phone number, # of tickets requested, etc). Fast forward to today, SEVEN DAYS before the Inauguration and I get an email that I have two tickets!!!! I'm SO excited! She probably waited this long hoping that anyone who wanted to go wouldn't be able to get the day off work, but little did she know my birthday is on the 21st and I took two days off to relax!!

Any advice on finding a cheap/fairly close to DC hotel that still has a room? I'm thinking of driving down because it will only take a few hours and flights would be insanely expensive at this point. "

I'm in my last year of bachelor degree in electric engineering, specialized in Embedded Systems. 
The classes I took were actually more oriented towards programing : I did Java classes, C, C#, VB... in the end I feel like I know way more in programing than electronics and stuff like that. Im even totally lost right now at my internship dealing with embedded electronics.

I'd like to enroll in a Software engineering master's degree. Do you think I'd fit in there or I'll end up terribly lacking skills as I haven't done programing subjects as advanced as people who have follow a bachelor degree in software engineering ?

thanks !"
5nvmvu,8,2017-01-13,Which Certification should be the starting point for someone new to IT?,johnd18,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/5nvmvu/which_certification_should_be_the_starting_point/,"I`m a current student at Rutgers, studying Information Technology &amp; Informatics. This semester, I`m taking a course in which I will be studying towards the exam of a certification during the entire semester. My question is: which certification would be the best to study for? I`m new to IT and do not have any other certifications or professional experience. The only experience I have is what would be considered amateur, from building gaming PCs and fixing and troubleshooting personal computers.

I was considered studying towards the A+, however, many have told me that this certification is not very useful and beneficial for employment purposes. I was recommended the CCENT, then, CCNA (or go straight to this one). Instead of A+, then, Network+, then, Security+. As I do not have any professional experience, I thought the A+ would be a good foundation to gain knowledge in order to get an internship or even a part-time job.

If it matters, I`m taking the following courses this semester:

Intro to Computer Concepts - Project Management - Digital Hardware Basics - Computer Applications - Management of Technological Organizations - Certification Practicum in IT (course in question).

The following are the options that are available.

LabSim Courses for CompTIA: TestOut Linux Pro - TestOut Network Pro - TestOut PC Pro (A+) - TestOut Security Pro. LabSim Courses for Cisco: TestOut Routing and Switching Pro

My areas of interest are Cyber Security and Network Administration.

Any advice would be much appreciated."

5nw2k1,6,2017-01-14,Will a company pull an internship interview due to low gpa?,prayingforthatfour,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nw2k1/will_a_company_pull_an_internship_interview_due/,"I met a large bulge bracket banking company at a hackathon and decided to give them my resume. At this point, my gpa is around a 3.2. 

Moving forward a couple of weeks, I was contacted for an initial interview. It was just a couple of behavioral questions and technical questions; all of which I aced. Now, I have been contacted to go to the company's superday and will need to give an unofficial transcript to rsvp. Due to two new F's, my gpa has sunk down to 2.85. 

From the companies website, the job listing states that a cgpa of 3.0 is the required minimum for this position, so I'm at a lost of ideas on what to do. If I give them my transcript, I'm afraid they will decline my interview offer due to a gpa below their standard.

Without this requirement, I'm certain that I would nail the final interviews as my resume is quite good (nice previous internship related to big data/spark, and impressive side projects). I also have been practicing hackerrank/ leetcode(maybe too much). I know that I could forge a transcript, but I'm guessing I would be caught in a mandatory background check.

Its not that I don't try in school, I try a bit too hard. I was managing another job, in addition to taking a full course load with some graduate level courses while I am an undergrad. I also go to a top university with rigorous testing. 

Is there any suggestions on how I should message hr about this issue or just roll the dice and submit my transcript. I don't want to be taken out of contention solely based on gpa as it is a dream job."
5nwkie,1,2017-01-14,"How do I [21 M] get over my ex-gf [30 F]. We saw each other for a year and a half, have been broken up 5 months.",magicmikewaddup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5nwkie/how_do_i_21_m_get_over_my_exgf_30_f_we_saw_each/,"I started seeing this girl (she was 28 at the time), about 2 years ago. We were at the same class in community college together and things just kind of happened. We were casual for about half a year and then things started to get more serious between us, we became exclusive and started seriously taking about the future. It was somewhere around this time last year that I realized that things weren't going to work out, but I was in denial about it. 

There were many good things about the relationship, we were both ambitious, hard-working, had similar life goals, we got along great, and had a great sex life. When we decided to get serious there were a few stipulations that I asked of her for my own peace of mind/the longevity of the relationship. those things were an std panel (she was my first sexual partner had she had been very active sexually throughout her life), that she seek mental health treatment (she told me that she had bipolar disorder and an anxiety disorder, both of which were untreated when I met her), and that she move out of her current living situation (she was still living with an ex-boyfriend who she had been together with for seven years before me and based on what she told me was verbally and sexually abusive toward her). 

I told her in december of 2015 that I needed her to do those things, particularly to move out, in order for our relationship to progress. She asked for time as she was in the process of taking the PCAT and applying for pharmacy school, so we agreed on spring break. I also told her that the other things were less pressing, and didn't need to be done right away. When spring break rolled around she was just finishing up pharmacy school interviews and so I told her that she could wait until the end of the school-year. That didn't happen either, and so I ended up taking an internship in michigan during 10 weeks over the summer. Since she wasn't working or taking classes I told her that this needed to be done by the time that I was back or things would have to be over. She told me that it would happen. 
It was probably around the 4th of July, 3 weeks before I got back, that I started to feel her pulling out emotionally. I assumed this was largely because she realized that she wasn't going to be able to move out and I had been putting a lot of pressure on her to do so. About 2 weeks after I had been back, and about 3 weeks before I was set to leave for school, she told me that she needed some space to figure out whether she wanted me in her life. I treated this as her breaking up with me because she couldn't bring herself to move out from living with her ex-boyfriend. I didn't really blame her, since he was so manipulative and controlling that it made it almost impossible for her to leave, and she didn't want to move in with her parents, due to the fact that her father was an unstable bipolar and that had destroyed much of her family life. Her only other option was live off campus and take out additional school loans to pay for it, which was incredibly difficult considering that would add an additional 70,000 dollars of debt that she would have to pay back later. Knowing all of this, I was doing okay for the most part because I felt that the relationship had run it's course and I had done all I could. I then found out about a month later that she was already in a relationship with another guy and she had moved in with him. This really upset me because a small part of me still believed that she would come back, and because she had always told me how special our relationship was, how much she loved me, and that I was it for her.  I felt lied to and betrayed by how quickly she had moved on and done the one thing that I needed from her (moving out from her ex's), for someone else. I guess my question is, what can I do to deal with the loss and work to move on? I know part of this is that this was my first serious relationship and it was in a horrible situation, but this has really eroded my trust. This person was my emotional support during a very difficult time in my life. I was in community college because I had been dropped from a 4-year school due to poor academic performance, and she really helped me to find my footing and encouraged me to work hard and fight for my goals, and to have her completely removed from my life just as I was transferring to a new school has really messed with me. I'm sorry for the incredibly long post, and for the angsty teen vibe, but I felt that all of it was pertinent to understanding the situation.

5nxbd0,192,2017-01-14,From Zero to Hero: My Story,asianoreo7,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5nxbd0/from_zero_to_hero_my_story/,"Hello Fapstronauts,

Just got out of an intensive lift sesh and I thought I might wanted to share my long-overdue story here in hopes of inspiring others to reach their potential. This subreddit changed my life in ways I could’ve never imagined and I hope this brief (but lengthy) story starts my journey of paying it forward. 

4 years ago I was a social recluse in his first year at a southeastern state university who had the ambitions of Elon Musk, yet the interpersonal skills of an awkward turtle. I had been a fervent fapper since middle school and was fapping to porn atleast once daily. I had known about NoFap at that point due to my Reddit habits but I brushed it off as some bro-science not grounded in any real sources. 

After finishing my freshman year feeling sexually frustrated of my virginity, I decided to make a change and give NoFap a try. The first few weeks were the hardest since I never felt so horny before in my life. I would eye-fuck almost every attractive girl that I walked past during sophomore year. Studying in the library was even more rough. However, the newfound testosterone boost is real, along with all the flatlines described in the subreddit. Over time, you learn to manage your sexual urges better and you eventually learn to subconsciously focus it on whatever else you are doing, such as studying. During the next 3 years that I pledged my allegiance to NoFap Hardmode, I managed to score the highest of a 120-day streak. Along the way, some cool things happened:

•	My social skills improved dramatically. It wasn’t immediate but the before-and-after is easily visible. I had more presence around my friends and girls. Speaking of girls..

•	I lost my virginity. And proceeded to have dates and sex with quite a handful of girls as well. Especially sorority girls. My social anxiety was a shrimp compare to the serpent of testosterone motivating me to take actions outside of my comfort zone. 

•	Made some massive gym gains. 

•	Score quite a few competitive scholarships. 

•	Studied abroad.

•	Finally kicked-ass in a competitive game/hobby I’m passionate about (League of Legends). For those of you guys who are familiar with the game, I was able to go from Silver 4 to Plat 3; before hardmode and now, respectively.

Most importantly, my career transformed. I went from having a meager sub-3.0 GPA in Accounting to scoring dean’s list in consecutive semesters. I became a lot more involved in student organizations and even became the president of the business organization in my school. The pinnacle of the NoFap achievement came when I managed to score an internship, and eventual job offer, at a prestigious Big 4 accounting firm in Silicon Valley. This was after getting rejected by nearly 16 other corporate firms across the country, including the other 3 of the Big 4 firms. As a college student in the southeast of the US, I would’ve never thought that this was possible. But I managed to do it, despite all the odds and competition. And I’m proud to say that 99% of it was thanks to my decision to pursue NoFap. Yes, doing NoFap alone won’t do crap if you just say inside your house all day playing League of Legends. However, if you use your newfound energy to go outside every day and spend most of your day energy tackling your life objectives, you will see progress. So much progress that you will get hooked on. Progress over perfection.

I would love to get into the details of methods and strategies I took to make it far in my NoFap streaks, but this post is getting long. Please comment or pm me if you’d like to read more. 

Stay strong Fapstronauts.

5nxd5i,2,2017-01-14,Broke my whole life and it's ruining me,zeeko13,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5nxd5i/broke_my_whole_life_and_its_ruining_me/,"I have 99 problems and money is all of them. I'm in love with my best friend but she moved up north two years ago. I know she misses me as much as I miss her. I want to move to her city but I've never made much more than minimum wage. 

So when she moved, I started going to school for Computer Science. I got my associate's degree while working minimum wage at the school and at a pizza place. I've been accepted into a 6-month internship with the promise of a job at the end. I don't have parents, my grandmother is barely surviving off social security and a small pension. 11 of my friends moved away because they couldn't afford it here. There's only 2 left, and neither of them can relate to my financial burden. 

I don't have a car so when it rains, I get soaked on my bike. I have debt from naive decisions I made at 18. Eight years later, I haven't made a dent in it. I have $0.11 in my bank account right now, and no income in the near future. 

I'm at the point where I don't think I can afford a career. I can't afford this internship even though it promises so much for me on the other end. To top it off, I have PTSD and MDD and masking that to look professional every day is wearing me down.

I feel like I was dealt a shit hand and played it as best as I knew how, but it doesn't fucking matter. I know life isn't about what you deserve, but what you put into it. I feel like I put my soul into getting out of poverty. I grew up with an alcoholic who never worked, so I've never known what it's like to feel secure. 

In sociology, you learn that poverty typically acts in a cycle; people flow in and out of it throughout their lives. That is a luxury I've never been afforded. When I applied for food stamps last year, I was accepted only to have the benefits immediately revoked based on the fact that I was a student. I ended up owing them $350 that they never gave me. 

I'm exhausted and I feel like society judges me. Whenever I visit a family that is in a higher financial class than me, it doesn't feel as friendly. I can act like them, but I can't afford their clothes. I feel like my life experiences are so different that it's alienating. When describing hardship, they always respond with, ""why don't you get your family to pay for it?"" It just doesn't make sense to them. 

Los Angeles is a fucking meat grinder and I want out. I just want to walk around with my friend up north. I don't need a lot in life. Haaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh. I'm tired."
5nxn0e,9,2017-01-14,I've been a pharmacy technician for 6 months and I never got formal training,littlekapkan,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/5nxn0e/ive_been_a_pharmacy_technician_for_6_months_and_i/,"Basically, I have been a pharmacy tech since September and I never got formal training. All I basically had were ppls, which are like terrible online videos that I watched that showed how to register patients, and all that basic stuff. 

I was hired because I interned there for high school, but I never did anything other than count pills, outdates, and typed a little bit. They showed me and my boyfriend, also interning there, how to send out mail and stuff, but we really didn't do drive-through, did NOT handle any insurance, phones, or did much else. 

Our mentor and the guy who hired me said we'd finish my training after I got hired. However, he was immediately transfer to another Walgreen's the second day I was there, so I NEVER got my training. The other pharmacist there hates me (As in this one will NEVER greet me, always yells at me in front of customers, never talks to me and talks down to me when this one has too) 

When the new pharmacist came to replace my mentor, he liked me, for like the first day. Then after, he tells me stuff like ""Don't you remember this?"" and ""Their firing people out there, so stop messing up!"" if I ask a question about something, or if I make a typing error, or any kind of mistake actually, such as not understand the Intercom Plus completely and how to navigate it. 

All my co workers treat me like I'm stupid and that they can just talk crap to me. It feel like elementary school again, honestly, because I was bullied by all the people in my grade, even the ""nicer"" ones. However, I can't do anything about it because I'm a worker and they ARE better than me. 

However, my boyfriend was recently hired as a tech by a better Walgreens (as in they don't treat each other with stress and rudeness). They are giving him formal training including CLASSES! This was a surprise for us because I NEVER had anything like that when I was hired. Basically, I was hired knowing what I knew from my internship.

Well, this made not only me upset, but my boyfriend, too. So he called our old mentor and told him I never got my formal training. He basically told my boyfriend, ""Oh yeah, make sure (my name) let's the new pharmacist know about that because we didn't have time to get on her training because I left.""

Great. Wonderful news. I was never fucking trained by the people who constantly treat me like I'm a burden and an idiot for not knowing everything. And now I'm supposed to tell them that?

Here are my issues: If I tell them that like my mentor pharmacist said to, wouldn't they be like, ""You haven't said anything until now about that?"". I would want to said, ""No, of course not, because, as I understood it, I was hired and my training was done when I finished my ppls. Everyone here knew that I needed my formal training, except our new pharmacist, but never mentioned anything to me, so I had to understand that as my training was finished."" but of course, in a polite way. 

Also, would they say something like, ""You've been here since September, you don't need formal training anymore since you've been here long enough."" to which I would reply, "" I am here literally under eight hours a week, I am part time, and anytime I had asked a question, my answer was just one of you people doing it yourselves and I never got taught. I've been here since then, but I still was never given formal training. You're wondering why a girl who was hired after me is better than me, yet you training you completely and thoroughly and not me."" but more polite, you know. 

What do you guys think? I just want my formal training so I can kick ass because I know I can if I'm just taught it. Do you think I'll not get my training? Who's fault is this, in your opinion??

5ny1u6,0,2017-01-14,Can I use my little brother's CS degree to get myself a data science job?,daijoubi,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5ny1u6/can_i_use_my_little_brothers_cs_degree_to_get/,"I graduated right into the Great Recession with a shitty 3.0 GPA Chemistry BS and have only been able to find shitjobs since. Fortunately this has left me with a lot of time to plan my next move. After learning that pretty much the only field worth getting into these days is the tech industry, I used all my free time to self-educate about programming, web app design, and data science, as well as fully implement projects by volunteering remotely with people from all over the world. And I seem to actually enjoy it more than chemistry too!

My little brother graduated in 2014 with a CS degree and average grades from the same college. A relatively recent CS degree is obviously the key to getting the job I want. He got a great job right out of the gate with zero internships or work experience (unlike me who had a two year paid stint in a lab). He keeps on telling me I'd really like his job and he offered to help me out this way. He's willing to close his LinkedIn and stuff because he doesn't need to use it at all for at least the next year. I'd keep the same SSN and just tell my employers that I went by [my brother's name] while in college, and that I first entered college several years past the norm.

I don't have enough money, time, or good enough credit to slog through yet another 4 year degree. I know I have the skills because a wide variety of people have been impressed by my work, including hiring managers, but that measly little piece of paper is the only thing stopping me from actually starting a career. This is quite literally my only option for a happy future. We'll probably attempt it anyway regardless of what you guys say, but still I'd like to know your thoughts on this plan."

I was debating whether to major in MIS or Supply Chain. I have never coded before, and know nothing about it, but was always interested in working with computer programs and such. 

I really don't want to do a help desk job, though. Why? Working in food service has made me a little jaded toward people, and allthough not similar, working in something dealing with customers in that sense doesn't sound appealing. Just entering the industry, I probably shouldn't be so picky. I would like to be a network administrator eventually.

Current GPA cumulative is a 2.98, so hoping to be a 3.0 before I graduate. I am specifically interested in data analysis and forecasting, allthough I don't know if forecasting falls in MIS. I am looking to major and minor in both, just don't know what to major in. I am currently working an internship in Supply Chain, but I have been having trouble finding summer internships with my GPA below 3.0. 

Are there any relevant certifications to work for? I am going to learn SQL, but what about  anything else?"

I am a 32 year old student being mass laid off from his manufacturing job.  While working I was in school pretty much all part time and Ill have my 2 year degree this summer.   Here's the question as direct as possible.  I evenually would love to work in information security, and I know it is a good mix of being a vigilant badass and stuck in a lot of meetings.  Here are my thoughts.

1st option.  Eastern Illinois University has an Management Information Systems program which is a mix of busiess courses and IT course.  They offer a master's in cybersecurity if I wanted to go that route, which looks enticing to me. Thought with this is to get the bachelor's degree and get my certifications while still in school--security+, etc.

2nd option.  Illinois State University has an information security and assurance program which is more technical and specific.  Same thing here about getting certifications.

Hoping to intern both junior and senior years--so any advice for figuring that out would be great.  Side note:  I enjoy working with people, but if I need to be a code warrior, so be it...Im sure I'll enjoy both.   Thanks for any help!

Tl;dr. 2 program choices, what is better for what I want?"

Anyway, I'm 25, studying CS have two years left and got an internship at a AAA game studio for VFX. They want to bring me on after the internship to ""associate"" then possibly full-time.

Should I drop out of school and take it? I want to get into a tech-art position later in life (more stable than vfx) and that requires programming skills.

Has anyone here done this? Did it go well? I read some other threads mentioning a possibility of doing a 20/hr work week and doing school at the same time. Is this a thing companies do? How did you go about it.

Thanks!

TL;DR

Junior CS major, got internship at AAA game studio as vfx artist, and they want to extend me with possibility to salaried, but I think I want to go into tech-art which does require programming. Should I go back to school after summer? Or drop out and try to work something out?"

5o0cbz,2,2017-01-14,Is that how working in an office should be?,throwaway1127652,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5o0cbz/is_that_how_working_in_an_office_should_be/,"Using throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll try to not get too specific about my job, but I also want to give as many info so you can understand.

Me:
This is my first job ever, right after college. The only jobs I've had were internships and for some reasons I did all my internships working from home. So it is my first office job. I’ve been working 6 months there and it is not what I imagined it would be. I don't have a lot of friends and I just don't have a lot of people who can give me their input of what work is suppose to be. As I said, I have NO OFFICE WORK EXPERIENCE, so I just have no clue of what office work feels like in terms of relationship with boss.

 I'm in the marketing department of a small manufacturing company and I basically do social media posts, taking pictures, photoshop, spy on other companies, and write newsletters and blog posts. And my problem is I am bored at work. It's 8 to 5 and it's very slow.

The work environment:
It is a small manufacturing company, and I was very excited when I got the job. Got a job right after graduation, I am very lucky! The offices are kind of scattered throughout the place, but most of them are in the same area. My boss and I share the same office space, and we are away from everybody. It's mostly him and I in the office. And he gives me stuff to do, but I don't have a deadline for all of these tasks. I don't feel a sense of urgency and therefore I kind of take all my time to do the job, and I just don't feel motivated to do the job. 

My boss has bipolar disorder (one day he said he had to live early to get his bipolar medications) and now I understand the several mood switch. He doesn't speak much during the day, mostly behind his computer, headphones on. And so I don't know what he is working on.
I spoke about that to my mother already. She thinks that we are supposed to be a team, and therefore he should tell me sometimes what project he is working on. I wanted to know what you think about that?

He does give me tasks to do, but there would be very big tasks. Like to do over the week, such as “do a brochure for the company”. This is a very big project, and I have no creative skills and very little experience. I was able to create a very rough draft, and gave it to him, he said he will take a look at it. So far it has been 2 weeks and the brochure is still on his desk.

Everyday I come into work wondering how I am going to occupy my day. Since I have no daily deadlines, I struggle to stay motivated and create my own agenda. I need more guidelines than that. The days are very long, and I usually do something productive for like 2-3 hours a day, and the 6-7 hours left, I am on facebook or reddit.

I do want to post on social media, write newsletters and things like that. He actually asked me once to do a social media calendar, which is a big project for me. I started on one, send it to him, but I haven’t heard back.
One day I posted on social media, and I got an email from him (same office, and didn’t speak out) about a typo I’ve done, therefore he deleted it and changed it. I understand, but since this day, I asked his permission for posting on social media. So instead of posting 2-3 times a day like I thought I would be doing, I do every 2-3 days.

I have no clue what my boss is working on. Seriously. And I have very little guidelines. I thought work would be more pleasant than that. I do ask him about what I should work on, but the problem is he is bipolar, and I don’t know what mood he will be on at this minute. I get scared every time to ask about work. I feel like that’s something I should know, and he will be upset at me.

I am so stressed about this situation. My husband and I are planning to move to a big city this year or next year, so I thought I just handle it for a year, but this is becoming unbearable. I am so stressed I have insomnia weekly, and I think about work all the times, such as “how I am going to occupy my day on Monday?”

I’ve also been wondering is maybe the marketing field isn’t for me. I’ve read on a couple of reddit thread that Marketing is mostly doing research.

I forgot to mention I am a very social person. I barely drink any coffee, but at work I would get a new cup every 2-3 hours only to get away from the office and have conversations with people. So the situation of me in front of a computer 9 hours a day depresses me a lot. I also don’t like spending money out to eat, but everyday at lunch I go to a fast food to eat and play on my phone for an hour, only to get away from the office. Instead of eating at my desk. Boss doesn’t take lunch break.

I am not asking for advice. I know what I can do to deal better: talk to him, get my own work schedule, quit, etc. I am aware of that, but it’s harder to actually do that.
I am asking for YOUR work situation. If my situation is a normal way to work, and that’s how work is: meaning you don’t know what your boss is working on and you are basically on your own most of the time. Or is my work not normal because of me? Because my boss is lacking experience in managing people? (don’t know about that, I am just assuming).

Boss was hire 2-3 months before me, and there was another girl on my spot, but she didn’t stay long. One day she left for lunch, and never went back. She sent an email to the president saying she quits. I am saying that because I am the only one who struggle with Boss managing style.

Thanks for your input!

TD;DR. First office job, right out of college. Marketing department. Boss is bipolar and have mood switch, doesn’t give me enough directives and feedback, and communication in general. Left on my own, stressed and not motivated. Is that what work should be?

If you want to know his kit and skills, please refer to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchHeroConcepts/comments/5nu7pt/a_new_defense_hero_scar_updated_idea/

**Real Name: Marcus Plea** 

**Location of Origin:** *RACS – (Research Association Center of Singapore), Singapore.*

**Current occupation:** *Parkour Enthusiast.* 

*“Young Miss Plea was given two choices, either accept the terms in the desk or face the consequences of denial. Not an easy choice, since these were the papers detailing the experimentations and consequences of human bio-augmentation. 

Reluctantly, she agreed, and RACS was given a written permit to experiment on her by inserting a genetically modified embryo into her womb, in order to give birth to an unknown discovery.

Before the Omnic War and the rise of Overwatch, RACS was one of the most influential research groups in the fields of biogenetics and bioengineering, for that reason, receiving a special permit from the government center with accords to maintain the research in secret was no more troubling then sweeping the dead leaves in the facility’s courtyard. 

After the careful insertion of the embryo, the scientists checked every day their black and white screens for every small change in the embryo’s development cycle, until the day of birth. I remember Dr. Faust being very excited that day since he was the head of the Bio-Augmentation center. The day was unearthly hot and the birth process lasted a good long time before the newborn arrived. 

The birth was completed around 4:50 PM and the newborn was breathing from his own lungs. His mother however… was not. Complications during the birth made the poor exhausted woman draw her last breath. The baby seemed pretty normal in terms of appearance, and would have been considered a failed experiment if not for one thing… The baby spoke and had complete understanding of his surrounding and the people around him. 

Every single human being in that place was completely shocked by this and attempts to communicate were successful. However, no one knew how this was possible, and questions begun rolling in. By far the most shocked person in the room was Dr. Segla, that thought they had created a human being capable of great intelligence from birth. Dr. Fu was awestruck by the every word coming from the little human. Dr. Shaun was very happy that day… Seeing his experiments actually bear fruits. 

The infant even gave himself a name… Marcus Plea, for he somehow knew this was the name his mother had intended on giving him. 

Marcus turned his head to Dr. Shaun and in a very high pitched voice, said: “I will need a provider” 
Years passed since this, and young Marcus was tested in every way… Apparently, with the results of testing by Dr. Faust, Marcus had developed the capability of absorbing the memories of those he killed. His incredible knowledge and initial intelligence was given to him only because of his mother’s memories. She died giving him birth, so he had killed her and taken her memories as his. 
The testing of Dr. Faust was… how can I describe it… In depth. Marcus was given several humans to kill and absorb their memories in order to prove his abilities. He became someone who changed personalities constantly. Memories clashed through his mind and he had to decide all that was wrong or right.

Marcus ended up being employed in RACS as someone who would take information from RACS’s competitors and enemies… By force if necessary. RACS equipped him with every technological enhancement and weapons available at the time and sent him into his missions. 
Kill a bloke, kill a journalist, kill a CEO, kill a Special Agent. 

Slowly becoming better and better at killing and doing RACS’s bidding. Until one day, in one of his missions, Marcus ended up eliminating a small child by accident. This child was innocent and free of any guilt. His memories flew through Marcus and he felt sad for all he had done. The evil this child feared was people like him. 

Marcus tried to stop, and yet his personalities prevented him from stopping the murdering spree. Marcus then decided to end this madness once and for all. As he woke up during the longest night and murdered all heads and interns of RACS. In a single night, Marcus had absorbed the memories of hundreds of scientists, guards and agents. He uncovered truths about the experiments in the test chamber, his own genetics, the various different contracts on a new robotic factory development project, a super soldier project and even a war that would shake the foundations of mankind in the years to come. 

Marcus however, would do none of that. All these horrible things were not for him to cause. His child inside called to him, as it wanted to play in the bloodied courtyard of RACS. 
And so he did, he played. Jumping from building to building, using his technological equipment to play around, toying around with the mannequins and lab equipment.

Marcus became the complete opposite of what RACS became, and so… he decided it would be wise to show that. Marcus became SCAR, the opposite and had sworn to stop the plans from his memories and become a hero in the eyes of his inner child. Little did he know that his actions would provide a turn of events that would plague mankind to this very day.

Today, I, Marcus Plea, Codename: SCAR, seek redemption for my actions. I live a hidden, yet happy life and constantly shift from city to city. All of this because not only of how much danger I pose to people and to myself, but also, the danger of my memories, which some people would like to make me… Forget.”*

So I had my first code challenge today for a big 5 internship. I've been preparing for quite a bit actually and I thought I had my nerves in check. So I open the challenge and there are 2 questions, both around a medium difficulty on leetcode. So I'm pretty nervous but I know I can solve them both because I've done very similar problems before. Slowly, I start panicking more and more and can barely do anything. I get lightheaded, can barely think/code and just overall perform horribly. I've never experienced nerves like this. They mentioned that I should solve the questions within 90 minutes to have a serious shot of progressing, but I could not do so. I took a walk straight after to clear my head and I came back and solved the questions almost immediately. What do you suggest I do about this and help prep for my upcoming code challenges/interviews. 

Thanks again


tl:dr 

- Had code challenge today for big 5 company
- Got so nervous that I could barely answer the questions
- Currently freaking out if I'll get any internships this year"

**Real Name: Marcus Plea** 

**Location of Origin:** *RACS – (Research Association Center of Singapore), Singapore.*

**Current occupation:** *Parkour Enthusiast.* 

*“Young Miss Plea was given two choices, either accept the terms in the desk or face the consequences of denial. Not an easy choice, since these were the papers detailing the experimentations and consequences of human bio-augmentation. 

Reluctantly, she agreed, and RACS was given a written permit to experiment on her by inserting a genetically modified embryo into her womb, in order to give birth to an unknown discovery.

Before the Omnic War and the rise of Overwatch, RACS was one of the most influential research groups in the fields of biogenetics and bioengineering, for that reason, receiving a special permit from the government center with accords to maintain the research in secret was no more troubling then sweeping the dead leaves in the facility’s courtyard. 

After the careful insertion of the embryo, the scientists checked every day their black and white screens for every small change in the embryo’s development cycle, until the day of birth. I remember Dr. Faust being very excited that day since he was the head of the Bio-Augmentation center. The day was unearthly hot and the birth process lasted a good long time before the newborn arrived. 

The birth was completed around 4:50 PM and the newborn was breathing from his own lungs. His mother however… was not. Complications during the birth made the poor exhausted woman draw her last breath. The baby seemed pretty normal in terms of appearance, and would have been considered a failed experiment if not for one thing… The baby spoke and had complete understanding of his surrounding and the people around him.

Staying away from these bad habits have allowed me to take on some larger goals and take control of the ship that steers my life.

1) I plan to drop to 12% body fat by the end of 2017. 

2) Eating healthier every single day, and staying away from junk food.

3) I have one internship for this next year and I am planning to take on another one hopefully as the semester picks up.

4) I stopped making excuses for problems in my life.

5) For problems that carried on from 2016 and I realized I put time into for no reason, I just realized fuck it.. it's not worth my time. I am worth so much more than to waste time on things holding me back.

6) I have always wanted to travel, so I applied to a couple programs in LA for the summer. 

7) No I haven't found the love of my life yet. But compared to who I was a year ago, I am the best person I can be today. And I will continue to be that person moving forward every single day for the rest of 2017.

8) I've met some beautiful women these past few weeks. It would be nice to have something. I want to. But the matter of fact is that I am playing a long term game and I know that if I continue to believe and follow this track I am on now, I'll find the meaningful relationships I have been seeking since beginning NoFap.

9) I am happy with who I am right now. 

10) I used to get so mad about having bad days that I had to resort to something compulsive. Not anymore. It's a train of thought that doesn't let me think clearly. If shit happens, shit happens. We will all be okay.

5o1zz9,0,2017-01-14,Started job search early with no bites and feel underqualified,GordonRamsayVevo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5o1zz9/started_job_search_early_with_no_bites_and_feel/,"I started my job search in September of 2016 and will be graduating in May of this year. I'm going to be graduating with a CS degree but have a concentration in cybersecurity. I've been applying for jobs with what I think are pretty realistic goals (entry level, pays around 45k so I can pay off my loans) but have gotten nothing back. I got called for an interview and then they cancelled it without telling me. I've applied for software engineer, systems analyst, infosec and data analyst jobs and tailor a cover letter for all of them but still have nothing. 

Most of the ""entry level"" jobs I see want 3-10 years of experience and I don't apply to a lot of them because I don't have that experience (I've only had one internship). Some people in in my program have already gotten offers before 2017 started and I need a job before I graduate. Do I need to lower my standards a bit or is this normal?"

I'm a recent college graduate (political science) at a crossroads right now. I turned 24 a few months ago. I work at a great company full time, even though I don't make a ton of money (without getting into specifics, I make just under 30k a year...before taxes). I graduated college in the summer of 2015, so well less than a year ago.

My biggest goal for 2017 is to move out of my parents' place. I'm paying off student loans and a car, however, that is on top of my various other mandatory expenditures. To round it to a good, even, workable number, I'm paying 500 bucks a month in bills...that's not cool when I pretty much only make 500 bucks a week.

Granted, I don't plan on staying at this company for more than a year, I've been there for five and a half months, so I'm getting to the point where I either plant my roots or look for something else. I'm trying to go for the latter. I'm updating my resume and my LinkedIn profile and once I hit the 6 month mark, I'm starting the job hunt again. If there's a silver lining to my situation, I stumbled into a GREAT internship at the end of college and the job I work right now is highly technical, so I'm pretty confident in my resume.

Anyway, I could live on my own if i found a cheap enough place, but I'd be struggling. My best friend is 3 years younger than me, and he's the ONLY person I'd consider living with. My friends who are my age are deadbeats, even though I love them to death. Unfortunately, he's a computer technician (graduated debt-free with an IT degree) with a long term girlfriend who's more than happy living with his parents and girlfriend for the foreseeable future. So, realistically, I can't count on him to decide to move out any time soon.

On top of that, I lose my insurance at the end of this year...I have Crohn's disease and asthma, so I'll have to start paying out of pocket for my own insurance AND my own medicine (I already pay for my own medicine, insurance is a different animal) in October. Just one more thing to pay for, man. I'm scared to death that I'll be living with my folks at age 30.

I'm probably overthinking things, and I'll be looking for a new job in the coming weeks, but I'm freaking out and could use some advice. I hate to say this, but damn, this is one time in my life that I wish I had a significant other to team up with. I've spent most of my adult life being single and I enjoy the stability and lack of commitment, but fuck, I feel like I'm getting a little old for that too."

I'm currently pursuing a Master's in CS after working ~3 years as an Industrial Engineer (this was my undergrad degree). I work and go to school full-time. It's been working out well but I'm interested in getting a CS internship for the summer.

At my current job, I make ~$90,000 a year and love the job stability, as well as the flexibility to study and work at the same time. However, my job has little-to-no applicability to software development and I'm worried that I won't be able to find a CS job after I graduate if I don't have any internship or professional experience. Of course, after the internship ends I'll go back to school but likely be jobless until I graduate (May 2018). 

Any advice on my situation would be appreciated. Is it worth quitting a decent job to get some development experience under my belt? "

My question is, would it be okay to do a research in this lab during the summer? Would I still be able to get an internship my junior year even though I did not intern at a company this summer? I will be funded about $7000 for 10 weeks, which will not make me starve :)"
5o2nmb,57,2017-01-15,The Man in the Gray Robe,Kryptonovich,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5o2nmb/the_man_in_the_gray_robe/,"Until you’ve had to stay awake - to *have* to not go to sleep, no matter what - you’ll never know what it’s like. The anxiety nipping at your heels, every minute of every hour of every day, that somehow, you’ll mess up and fall asleep. The terror just gnawing at you as you’re on your couch at night, feeling yourself about to nod off. The knowledge that if you *do* fall asleep, and have to face what’s waiting for you in your dreams, you’re finished. 

I should start from the beginning. It…well, it all goes back to my mother. 

My mother had raised me alone ever since my father ran out on us when I was two, and…she and I were never close as I was growing up. For years I wanted us to be, and for years she frustrated me in that area. I mean, she cared for me, provided for me, supported me, but she was always distant. Just…cold. She never told me she loved me. She never really hugged me, or got close, or treated me warmly. She was polite, kind, reasonable, but…that was about it. And in the end, it got to me, and over the years I got bitter toward her for it. Real bitter, even though I couldn’t quite conceptualize at the time *why* I was so hurt.

I remember being eighteen, packing my bags in my room. I’d graduated high school, was still waiting to hear back if I got into university, but at the same time still needing to get out. Like I said, I hadn’t by that point really put my finger on *why* I couldn’t bear to be under the same roof as my mother, but I did know that I had to get out.

I looked up midway through packing to see her standing in the doorway, her face expressionless, but…her voice betrayed her somewhat.

“Where are you going?” she asked, her voice slightly unsteady.

“Somewhere, anywhere,” I replied, looking back to my suitcase as I worked.

She paused before continuing. “You haven’t even given me any information, where I can reach you.” 

“Yeah, well,” I answered back, my eyes still on my open suitcase “if I need you, I’ll call you.”

“You’re not being a good son by doing this,” she snapped, finally frustrated.

I paused, feeling anger welling up inside of me. I looked back at her, and just barely managed to keep myself civil. “I’ve given everything I have to give.” I paused, then continued. “I’m leaving, and I’m sorry if you can’t accept that.”

She just stared at me for a few moments, and then turned and walked out of the room and down the hallway and into her own room.

I was out of the house later that day. She never even saw me out the door. At the time I thought it was typical of our relationship - she just didn’t give a damn. But now I know that she never saw me out the door because it hurt her too much to see me go, and to see me go in a way that seemed to confirm to her that I didn’t care about her. 

So I got to another province successfully, got word that I had made it into university, and I went. Four years later, I had an English degree. Then I went to journalism school, and then I got a job at a major paper in Vancouver. Life was good - I was making good money, in a field I loved, but…I wasn’t happy. There was an emptiness in my heart. It took me a few years to realize, with the help of a good amount of therapy, that it was my mother. I’d never gotten a sense of closure with her, because I’d never fixed things. So, I decided I needed to attend to that. I made my decision a day before I got the phone call from her. See, she’d tracked me down to tell me she was dying.

How did I feel about it? A mix of emotions. I was, in a way, heartbroken - *just* as I had come to terms with how I was raised by her, and had firmly decided to make things right, she was leaving me - forever. But I had a duty. So I shoved my heartbreak aside, and went to work fulfilling that duty.

I took a sabbatical from work and flew out to the sleepy little suburb I grew up in the next day. I knocked on the door, the paint on it chipped and worn with time, and after a moment, she answered. She looked older, more worn and tired, but still just as beautiful in her own way - her auburn hair tied into a ponytail and her emerald green eyes standing out. But…she acted differently this time. Her eyes widened and I saw life just shoot into them as she saw me.

“Oh, Anthony!” she exclaimed, embracing me in a tight hug. She led me into the house, where she got my coat off and quickly started to set the table…before I stopped her, forcefully reminding her that *I* was there to take care of *her*.

From then on, for the last few months we had, things were different. She was warm, loving, kind. Everything I’d needed growing up but had never gotten. I couldn’t figure it out, and I felt, for some reason, that it’d be inappropriate to inquire, so I didn’t.

Then came the day she died. With me at her bedside were the friends she’d had her whole life - spiritual types. New Age, that kind of thing. As they were with me, it occurred to me that she’d always been far closer to them than she ever was with me, and that I’d remembered her always being up to all sorts of activities with them, things I was never allowed to get any hint of.

But we were there, and Mom told them all to give us a moment. So, the various men and women left. Then Mom, looking so thin and so frail, rested her tired, old eyes on me, and gripped my hand.

“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice just fraught with weakness, “for being so cold and so distant your whole life. I…I needed to be. I don’t expect you to understand, but…in my time, both before and after you were born, I fought a lot of battles, and made a lot of people very angry.” She paused, tears coming to her eyes, and when she spoke again, her voice broke. “Everything I *did*, I did to *protect* you.” At this, I stroked her face and gripped her hand back.

“Mom, no, it’s fine. I get it. What matters is that we have *right now*, that’s all that matters.” My voice was calm but urgent - conciliatory. I needed to calm her down.

Mom nodded quickly, blinking her tears away. Then she continued. “Just know, no matter what - I love you, and the one thing I’ve always tried to do is be there for you. Even when you never knew it.” I nodded, trying to convey understanding, even though I didn’t really understand at all. 

Finally, she told me to go get everyone else back in the room, and I did. Fifteen minutes later she was dead.

What else is there to say? I handled the funeral arrangements, and then headed back to my life in Vancouver.

As I got home and got back to my life, I tried to fathom what had happened. My mother had been so distant and cold my whole life, and in the end it drove me away from her entirely the moment I hit adulthood. I’d had so much pain and angst inside of me for so many years over it, with me being unable to really work out what it was that was raging inside of me. And it messed me up. Then Mom calls me home, and she’s totally different. It was so off and jarring, but I realized inside of me a great regret that I’d never tried to work things out with her, never tried to really *make things work*. I did have our last few months together, but it was far too short. As I returned to my ordinary routine, I realized that I’d always have that regret inside of me.

So I got back to my life, and that’s when it started.

I’d been home for about a week or two when it happened. I’d gotten home from a long day at work, chasing a story on corporate fraud that I was pretty sure the CEOs in questions knew about and were trying to cover up. I got my shoes off, and collapsed onto the bed, beat. I had literally run myself ragged all over town, getting quotes, interviews, the whole deal, including interviewing a mid-level corporate lawyer as he sat in the backseat of my car, which was parked in an alley (he absolutely could not be seen speaking to me). So, suffice it to say, I was pretty tired. So like I said, I collapsed onto the bed and I was asleep minutes later.

I opened my eyes what seemed like seconds after I closed them. I was standing by a dark, pitch black river, illuminated by moonlight. It was cold. The river…it stretched on forever, and there was no horizon at the end of it…just this shroud of deep darkness.

Then I noticed him, out of the corner of my eye. This tall, rail-thin man in a dark gray monk’s robe. He was bald, and his skin was deeply wrinkled. His eyes were completely dark, and in his hand…in his hand was a long, curved knife, dripping with blood.

My heart started to pound as I started to get really, really scared. At that moment, he started to walk toward me. I wanted to run but I couldn’t move - I was frozen in place, somehow. So I’m standing there, trying to figure out what to do, and then, when he’s just about close to me…I wake up.

When I shot up in my bed, my mouth was dry as a desert and my heart was desperately trying to beat its way out of my chest. Rattled, I got up and went to the bathroom. I turned the light on and stared at myself in the mirror. My hair was a mess and my eyes were wide, and I looked…just scared. Scared as hell. I wasn’t sure why, exactly - it was just a dream, after all. But it felt and seemed so *real*. At the time I thought it was nothing, but I’d later realize exactly why I felt that way.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of that night. I laid awake in bed, unable to fall asleep, and then when morning came, I got dressed and went to work. I would later wish that I’d have been able to keep that natural inability to fall asleep.

Work was…weird. I…I don’t know how to describe it. Something was happening to me, and I only started to realize it that day.

It came on really hard as I was in an interview in the Starbucks inside the Metrotown Chapters Bookstore, in Burnaby. 

“So the truth is, of *course* the money’s being laundered, but the *real* question is, does Mr. Ladner and the other executives on the Board *know* about it? Now, to get to that…” Jerald Cheng, the lawyer from the other day, was telling me. But I couldn’t pay attention. I was just too anxious. I had this feeling like I was being watched, like I was being followed by someone. And something deeper - this tense, anxious feeling inside my chest, and a kind of fear of something bad happening to me. I tried to focus, tried to stay on track with the interview, but within the next fifteen minutes, I couldn’t pay attention to a word he was saying, I was so anxious.

 So, I broke off the interview. Jerald was somewhat upset - after all, he was risking a lot by being seen with me. But what could I do? My mind wasn’t on the game. So, I canceled. 

I spent the rest of the day just trying to clear my head, shake off what I was feeling. I grabbed some lunch at Cafe Crepe on Granville, then spent the day wandering downtown. But the anxious and tense feeling I had, the feeling of being watched and followed, wouldn’t shake off. 

I got home at around six in the evening. I went straight to bed, deciding to sleep it all off.

I never expected what would happen next. 

I woke up on the ground. The ground was made up of wet dirt, and it was cold and windy. Carefully getting up on my feet, I examined my surroundings. I was in the woods, and a ways down was the river, where I’d been standing before when I last dreamed. The feeling of being watched hit me in a massive, strong wave. Trying to stay calm, I looked ahead of me and saw him - the man in the robe. He smiled this…this horrifying, awful smile, and slowly approached me. Frozen in place, I couldn’t move. But as he approached me, he briefly stopped and looked off to the side, deep into the dark expanse of the rest of the woods, and his face…his face started to look somewhat worried, as if something he hadn’t expected was going to happen. But then, after a moment, he looked back at me and the smile was back on and he was walking toward me yet again. 

As he reached me, I decided to try and talk this out. “Who are you?” I said, my voice cracking with fear. He responded by raising the knife and…and *driving it* into my shoulder, all slow. The pain screamed through my arm and my body. My heart was pounding, as if it was gonna break out of my chest. He drove the knife deeper, and deeper in, and as I looked at the knife in my shoulder, my blood…it was *dark black* - not even red. Like oil, actually, in colour. But something else happened, something weird. As the knife was being driven into my shoulder, I felt *vicious* pain inside of me, as if my organs were being ripped apart - as if I was coming undone. I screamed even louder, moreso in terror than in pain, screaming for help, for relief. Then…then something odd happened. The man stopped, and his eyes went wide, and…I woke up.

I shot up in bed, terrified. Overwhelmed, mere seconds after I woke up, I leaned over the edge of my bed and vomited. But…what terrified me the most wasn’t actually in the dream. For some reason, my shoulder still hurt, like it was on fire. I reached over and rubbed it…only to feel an open, raw, knife wound. A wound that hadn’t been there when I got undressed for bed hours earlier. 

I jumped up and raced into the bathroom, switching the light on and staring at my shoulder hard in the mirror. There it was - red, inflamed and bloody. I twisted my shoulder a bit, feeling the raw shock of pain and sensitivity as I did so. My eyes were wide and shot with terror as I tried to work this out. The dream had felt real, and was *real enough* that something had happened to me in real life. 

This may sound crazy, but…I decided, after heavy thought, that this was real. There was something in my dreams that was after me, and the harm it had done to me had transitioned into the real world. The wound in my shoulder was a knife wound - *nothing* else could have caused it. I knew because I’d seen photos of knife wounds in case files in my work as a journalist - what was in my shoulder matched it to a tee. 

I mean, it was *crazy* - how could something in a dream have real-life effects? Of course, at first I thought someone had broken into my apartment. But I checked the security footage of my entire apartment as I slept, and…nothing. I was alone in my apartment, the whole time I slept. So that caused a huge bunch of things to run through my mind - how could this be happening? *What* was happening? I spent an hour surfing the Internet, trying to come up with a clear answer - but in the end, nothing. So in the end, my mind…oh God, I couldn’t make sense of this at all. I started to panic, and…well, in the end, I did the only thing I could do. I picked the most obvious, albeit short-term, solution, and ran with it. I decided to just not go to sleep, at least until I could figure all this out.

So, over the next few days, I lived entirely on not just food and liquids, but caffeine pills. I was determined to stay awake until I could figure out what was going on and what I could do about it. That didn’t go well, though, as I had no idea what was happening to me and what was after me, and no idea where to start looking for answers. So eventually I settled into an uncomfortable truth that, honestly, I just tried to not think about because it was so terrifying: I could only stay awake for so long, and eventually I would fall asleep, and when that happened, the man in the robe would get me. 

It’s odd, living in that mindset. You know you’re marching toward the inevitable, and that produces in you this natural state of deep-seated anxiety, but there’s nothing you can do about it, so you just shove it down and try not to deal with it. More than once I wondered if this is what people on death row felt as the dates of their execution approached.

Things went somewhat well, but…not well in other ways. I worked during the day, and during the night I did more work, along with watching Netflix and going on early morning jogs. I just needed to stay active, right, just stay active, keep it moving, don’t stop for anything, don’t let myself get caught off-guard. But I had that anxious feeling like I was being watched…like the man in the robe was just waiting for me to slip up, and then catch me. And, on top of this, all my time awake started to take a toll on me.

I was on my third straight day being up, and I was starting to unravel. I was feeling extremely anxious due to the sleep deprivation, and I was extremely irritable. The day as this all started to unravel, I was sitting at my desk working on a story. I was on my fifth draft - I just couldn’t get it right and it was *pissing me off so damned much*. Lynn, an intern who had been there for the past month and who I’d told could come to me if she needed help with anything, approached my desk.

“Uh, Anthony,” she started hesitantly, apparently noticing how high-strung I was, “I was wondering if you could give me any pointers for interviewing the big names? I’ve got an interview with *the Premier*, and I was thinking-”

I snapped. I whirled around, and shot out, “Lynn, I’m really busy now and I don’t have any bloody time to hold your hand, so could you try and work it out on your own or talk to someone else who *actually has the time*?” 

Lynn’s eyes went wide, and she went quiet, before she started to stutter out an apology, and then a moment later hurried off. I exhaled deeply and went back to work, my hands trembling slightly on their own as I typed. 

I also started to see things in the corner of my eye, and some even in my direct vision - odd things, some of which were typical of sleep deprivation, and others…others which weren’t. Rotting corpses. Bloody, stillborn infants. It terrified the living hell out of me, but I dealt with it because I had no other option. I could tell something was creeping up on me, something horrifying, but I had no idea what to do about it. So I just kept keeping on keeping on, delaying the inevitable by not thinking about it. This had the effect, consequently, of me being constantly terrified - *knowing* something terrible was bound to happen eventually, but not being able to do anything about it. And I had to deal with it. I mean, I couldn’t *tell* anyone about it - no one would understand. So I was alone in facing this.

Things came to a head that night. I was watching TV, and unbeknownst to me at the time, I’d forgotten to pop a caffeine pill. So I’m watching the TV, and before I knew it, my eyes were closed and I was immersed in a dream.

I opened my eyes to see the man in the gray robe standing directly in front of me in the midst of the darkened forest, his mouth wide in a horrifying smile, the bloody knife in his hand. As my heart began to beat wildly in sheer terror, and tears began to run down my face, I idly noticed how yellow and rotted his teeth were. He slowly, myself frozen in place, drove the knife into my stomach, pain shooting through me like fire. His eyes came alive with horrific glee, and the fiery pain rippled through my entire body, and that old feeling of every part of me starting to feel torn apart, that started too. As he began to drive the knife deeper in, I knew…I knew that this time, this was it. There’d be no escape. It was this sick, hopeless, horrible feeling that, at first, was only deep in my stomach, then spread throughout me, which quickly gave rise to panic. And in that panic, I began to scream wildly.

But only just as the knife entered me…something happened. A blinding white light filled the expanse of the forest, and suddenly I found I could move again. I stepped back quickly, and felt something very ticklish and tingly at the spot in my stomach where the knife went in. I looked down quickly to see that it had healed immediately. I looked up at the sound of screaming. The man in the gray robe was on the ground, engulfed in flames, rolling around on the ground desperately and screaming horribly. My eyes wide and I was shot through with shock, as I watched him scream and scream as the flames burnt him more and more, his flesh and clothes being burned away so quickly, until nothing was left but an ashen skeleton.

The man gone, I looked over to the source of the light, and…and I saw her. I saw my mother. She was standing, brilliant and shining, dressed in a pristine white gown, and looking just as she had when I was a child - radiant and beautiful. She smiled warmly at me as I felt tears of both joy and deep sadness run down my face. Mom was here - oh my God, Mom was here to save me. I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could, she cut me off.

“Wake up,” she said as she smiled down at me. And…I did.

I woke up in my bed, calm and peacefully. I felt my stomach and my shoulder - the knife wound in my shoulder was gone, and there was no wound in my stomach. I sat there for a few moments in silence, trying to process everything. And then…then I wept. I cried and cried and cried, so hard, for the next half hour, with a flood of thoughts and feelings about my mother overwhelming me, making everything so startlingly clear. All that time spent apart from me, keeping her distance, trying to protect me from the world she lived in, not ever getting too close for fear of drawing me into it or, through her love for me, drawing attention to me from beyond. And even after she was gone, stepping in to protect me from those forces that would seek to harm me as a last ditch effort against her.

I never had any other nightmares like that after that night. So, how did I move forward? I lived. I lived, and sought out the best life had to offer, and I found it. Four years after the end of all that, I was married, and two years after that, we had our first child. Jacob is four now, and while I know I can’t protect him the way my mother protected me…I know I have the privilege, the *gift*, of loving him outwardly and warmly the way my mother never could with me when she was raising me. 

And above all else, I’ll never forget her and what she did for me - from when I was a child to now. 

I love you, Mom. Thank you so much.

5o2opw,1,2017-01-15,Is it possible for me to transfer in my current situation?,Riftenzo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5o2opw/is_it_possible_for_me_to_transfer_in_my_current/,"I am going into my second semester of my first year at a good public university yet I still feel that I want to transfer. Family and friends said this feeling would pass and most students feel that way at the beginning, and while I'm doing very well and have made close friends, I still want to transfer. My major is Political Science and I am leaning towards a double major in Econ and I feel as though I would have better chances at a school that was more focused on either of these two degrees. Also, I am not really close to any internship opportunities. I don't want anyone to think that I'm aiming for a more prestigious or big name school too, I would just like to attend a school that's more focused on my major. Ultimately, I just don't feel comfortable and I'm not really looking forward to another three years.

I am not really sure who to ask for advice and googling has not really answered my questions.

My situation might be a bit complicated too so I'll lay it out.

-It's my first year but I have a sophomore standing (credit wise) and will have a junior standing by fall 2017. I understand a lot of colleges will not accept a student with more than 60 credits so trying for spring of 2018 or fall 2018 would probably not be doable (unless there is some way around this, or even doing an extra year).

-I attend a pretty large school with large classes, and while that isn't a great excuse for not getting to know my professors, I only have maybe one that I could ask for a recommendation and she did not teach a class that directly related to my major.

-The deadline for fall of 2017 for most schools that I am interested in is March 1st or 15th. I was a dumbass during winter break and spent it stressing while not actually doing anything or preparing documents and such.

Is it even worth trying with my situation? Hell, is it even possible?

I'll be thankful for any advice considering I haven't got anyone else to talk with this about. I feel like I'm stuck. I'll be willing to give any extra info in the comments."
5o2uue,1,2017-01-15,"Internship, Research, or give up?",Supreme654321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5o2uue/internship_research_or_give_up/,"Hi Reddit!

I have been having difficulties getting a single offer for an internship. I have applied already 60 companies and more than half of those come from my school job board. I have received 6 responses so far and all are rejections. On top of that I am atrocious at interviews (actually laughably bad); so even if I do ever get a interview I would struggle hard (I cant get them at the moment so this is not what I am focused on).

Currently for applying I go to career fairs, apply through school job boards, some networking events, utilize friends (rejected from all of these companies), companies at hackathons, and last resort online companies. I am not sure where else to attack from.

I have had friends interning at Microsoft and other big companies look at my resume, my school career services, and I have posted it here as well for feedback; many of them say my layout and writing is good or only need small fixes, but I lack content which I am not surprised because I have only been in the major for one year. So I do not believe the issue is my resume, more of my lack of experience. I transferred into the major and I only have this summer and next to get an internship since I only need cs classes to graduate. Next summer I want to work at a bigger more well known company and this summer work at a smaller company.

I probably could more easily get research in a CS field this summer as an alternative, but doing that would obviously forgo getting industry experience. I have not decided yet if I want to go to grad school either because I may want to do ML which requires a PhD (would want to work somewhere like Google X so not basic ML either). I would do research during the academic year as my alternative if I got an internship this summer, but my chances are literally dwindling by the day. I do not know how to approach this either. I am not excluding myself to only ML internships either because I will gain experience at any internship.

As I keep applying to internships the shear stress if bringing me down. I find myself being more and more depressed because I feel helpless and unable to got an internship which so many of my other friends have; waking up in the middle of the night and almost crying a few times. Obviously I do not want to compare myself to others because everyone moves at a different pace, but I feel as though this is going to reflect on my ability once I graduate. I do not want to end up working at some small company doing basic software. I want to be a leader in the industry and work on something bigger that can and will affect millions of people (Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Google come to mind). Yea I know you can do this at a smaller company as well, but I like the culture of working on big teams and places because I like to meet and work with many people.

Thanks in advance for any insight or advice you can give!"

As the title suggests, I have failed attempting this beast twice. 
I am a foreign med graduate (2014). After Graduation, I had to do a mandatory year of internship. In between my internship, I felt so cocky that I went ahead took about three months off and did FA once and sat for the exam. I was surprised when i failed and got a score of 170. 

After finishing my internship, I decided to renew my efforts and retake the exam. I took the exam in November and got my results back in December. I had score a 180. I feel so dejected and guilt wracked about how i could have messed this up again. 

I dont even know what i did wrong. 

I went through FA twice. Did Uworld with a cumulative score of 80%+, I did sketchy. I even used kaplan, DIT and parts of pathoma and goljan. 

I dont know if i should take the exam again. But almost all my dad's side of the family are in the US with 3 out of 6 siblings are doctors. The others are in the healthcare community also. 

I dont know what to do.

&gt;Me – “Is no one else on this floor?”

&gt;Arnold – “I’ve checked the rooms and they’re all empty, but it’s only a matter of time until someone comes.”

As he finishes saying and I’m about to speak we hear Steve moaning loudly and say “My darling, we’ll be together forever”.  Deer in headlights again, with both of us in utter silence. Finally I speak up:

&gt;Me – “Go to the door and take a photo.”

&gt;Arnold – “What?!”

&gt;Me – “Do it, go there, take a few actually, try to get the screen and immediately call the tutor here.”

&gt;Arnold – “Why the pics though?”

&gt;Me – “Just in case. Uh, try not to look at them too much.”

Arnold leaves the room and, indeed, went to the door, snagged a few pics against his better judgment, and went straight to the office to call our tutor while I stayed behind waiting for them. I wanted to kick the door down so badly and just shout at him but I wanted to get our tutor here and get his advice. At the very least that way I wouldn’t do something stupid. The moaning quickly grew in frequency so I opted to wait by the elevator, and as soon as I reach it a security guard shows up, Always Happy Guard (AHG), I signal him and he looks at me quizzically:

&gt;AHG – “Hey there, bud, need something?”

&gt;Me – “Good question, actually.”

His face suddenly went from a small smile to a dead serious face. I talked regularly with this one guard during our breaks, and as the name suggests you would never spot this man without his smile, everything about him made you smile, from his laid-back personality to his trademark smile. When he heard my oddball of an answer he knew this wasn’t going to be a normal occurrence.

&gt;AHG – “What’s the problem?”

&gt;Me – “Well, you know Steve?”

&gt;AHG frowns. “Uh-oh.” I thought , “what did Steve do that we didn’t know?”

&gt;AHG – “Your colleague?”

The elevator doors open and I spot Arnold and our tutor. “I saw the photographs” he said as soon as he laid his eyes upon me.

Right, let me just take you out of the story a bit of time to tell you something about him. This man had a genuine passion to teach other people, and he was quite proud that this school was a popular place between would-be-internees because of him and his teachings. Sometimes he would space out for a bit and just ramble on, but nevertheless he was a good teacher. Now, the one thing you did NOT want him to do was to stay completely silent. You see, if you made a small mistake and called him, he would teach you how to solve it, after all, making and fixing mistakes is just part of any job, and he knew that, so he purposefully would let us fall on small pitfalls and be right there to help us out. Fuck up a bit too badly, however, and he would stay silent, which meant that was going on your report, and trust me, this guy was a 100% professional, everything you did was put on a report, and, as you can probably guess, internship has a metric fuck-ton of weight on your final grade. You really didn’t want a bad report. With that said, back to the story.

He walked along side Arnold while I and AHG were right behind them and all four of us made way to A302. When we reach there the tutor and AHG look through the window and Steve was still performing solo, still moaning. I looked at our tutor to see his reaction and… nothing. Not a single expression (I like to think he was screaming internally), not a single word, absolutely nothing. This moment, what seemed to last minutes, was broken by the tutor turning to the guard, saying “Deal with this to the best of your ability” and walked right back to the office. Steve was fucked, I knew it and Arnold knew it. AHG tries to open the door but it was locked. As he tried that, Steve heard it, snapped out and boy, the look on his face when he saw us both with AHG. Immediately, he took the cushion cover (eww) and ran in panic to the back of the room while AHG unlocked the door with a master key. The moment the door was unlocked AHG went straight towards him while Arnold turned off the projector. Steve went absolutely ballistic, screaming “NO! My dear wife! I don’t want to leave her alone!” among some other Japanese words the moment he was grabbed, sweating bullets and trying his damn best to free himself to no avail. AHG grabbed his arm with one hand and his neck with the other, making sure this eel wouldn’t slip away, and off they went, AHG with a half-serious-half-disgust face and Steve still with barely any clothing on.

After all that commotion me and Arnold just kind of looked at each other and shrugged, I mean, what do you say to that? He then noticed a USB flash drive plugged on the back of the computer. We checked the contents on the computer before turning it off to see who it belonged to, most likely from a teacher. I quickly identified it as Steve’s, the folder names were a dead giveaway, things like “Class X Project 1”, Class X being my class, but there was another folder, simply titled “Love”, and inside were dozens of other folders, moonrunes for titles, all filled with that one character he fancied and, of course, lots and lots of porn (and not just the regular kind, mind you). I’d like to point out this was a 16GB flash drive and it was about 95% full, and trust me, those project folders only had a simple text document inside them.
 
&gt;Arnold – “Let’s head back to the office.”

&gt;Me – “Hold on, let me quickly check something.”

I opened Firefox, which was their preferred browser and checked the history, just in case. Needless to say I had to delete a lot of it because it had become tainted, but not before I snagged a quick picture with my phone, just in case.

With the relief of leaving room A302 and hoping to never return we head back to the office to talk to the tutor about Steve’s actions, give him the proof in case he needs it and then head back to our previous task. From this point on not only I checked all of the projector light bulbs but also the computers, last thing I need is for suddenly having porn all over the school."
5o4zjm,1,2017-01-15,An Android App for the Bioinformatician on the Go!!,vonn_watson,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/5o4zjm/an_android_app_for_the_bioinformatician_on_the_go/,"So I've been planning to make an android app for helping out bioinformaticians do analysis on the go. 

This idea came to me when the Chief Science Officer of  the Institute I went to do an internship at said &gt;"" Wouldn't it be great if we could do  analysis on our phones, I guess we'll have that soon"" &gt;

That time, I was the only CS student that had come to train in the  Bioinformatics Department, the rest being PhD students of Microbiology, Biostatistics and other trades.Even though  I was a CS student, I had not done any android app development at that time, so didn't really think about it.

However, things are different now, as I've already made quite a few android apps (  productivity apps with a lot of algorithmic implementation )  for myself, and as college projects.

Now for my final dissertation, I would like to make a bioinformatics project (an Android App ) that would help solve a problem (or hopefully many problems )  for the common bioinformatician of today.

*I would love to hear from you what you'd want in a Bioinformatics app so that I could implement that functionality, and make it available to all the bioinformaticians through the Android Play Store *

Does anyone know the pay scale for interns at the Lockheed CWEP program? Is it based on major such as engineers make more than finance or per credit hour such as seniors make more than freshman. If you are an intern it would be great if you could post your pay per hour, major and current standing based on credit hour. Thank you!"

Currently, I'm enrolled in a 2nd degree in CS program at a Top 5 university in Canada.

I just found out that my university also has a Post Bacc Diploma in CS program. The reason why I'm even considering it is the duration (2 years for the degree, vs 6 months for the diploma, without any co-ops) and the cost (as an International student, I have to pay a lot of tuition). Further, with the CS degree, I will be able to complete one Co-op (internship) before my study permit runs out. However, with the diploma, I can probably do 2-3 internships, which will obviously help cover all my tuition and also give me more experience, and still finish faster.

As for the content of the diploma, I will pretty much cover all core CS topics (10 courses on Algorithms, Operating Systems, Databases, Compilers, Networking etc).

Should I switch over to the diploma?

5o56xq,0,2017-01-15,Is it even worth it to minor in a STEM subject like statistics or computer science?,dasaim,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5o56xq/is_it_even_worth_it_to_minor_in_a_stem_subject/,"Pretty much every time I see a post on reddit where someone is asking if they should major in something like computer science or statistics to beef up their humanities/social science degree, tons of people respond by saying ""why don't you just major in (whatever STEM subject) and take your humanities/social science degree and turn that into your minor"" - so flip the political science major with a statistics minor to a statistics major with a political science minor, that psychology major with a finance minor into a finance major with a psychology minor, the design major with a computer science minor into a computer science major with a design minor, etc. 

I really don't think I have what it takes to actually major in something like statistics or computer science; and based on my limited experience with those two subjects so far, even if I could do it I'm fairly certain that I'd hate it. But I *do* think I might be able to stomach minoring in a STEM subject to help me with future job hunting, because right now the thought of graduating with a non-STEM major and no real quantitative skills to back it up terrifies me. I know you can make up for it somewhat by having a great GPA (done) and lots of internships, but I have a lot of social issues and other issues going on in my personal life, and I just don't see myself being that ""go-getter"" type who aggressively networks, joins lots of clubs and takes on leadership positions in them, sniffs out a bunch of really awesome internships, etc. So right now, I'm feeling pretty lost. 

Is it even worth it to minor in a STEM subject? it? So many people say that minors are worthless because they don't give you nearly enough exposure to the subject to make you proficient in it, and that they carry hardly any weight at all on a resume. Is this true? My school has minors in computer science, statistics, data science, information systems, economics, and management, but I don't even know if it's worth it to try and do one or more of them if there's hardly any payoff. If that's the case, I'll just minor in a subject I actually feel passionate about.

Unfortunately i haven't done something I felt significant to show colleges I love engineering. I can't really find meaningful volunteering and I can't find any internships.

5o63zg,10,2017-01-15,"Asking for advice, is this burnout or depression",throwawayMSPsecurity,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5o63zg/asking_for_advice_is_this_burnout_or_depression/,"I graduated about a year and a half ago studying CIS with a focus on networking, security, and forensics. I got an entry level security job at a local MSP that is doing well. The MSP is incredibly busy though, when working there are no breaks besides lunch, 3 days a week minimum I turn my hour lunch break into 15 minutes or less to help keep up with the work load. Last year I spent the entire winter and spring working 50-60 hour weeks because we only had 2 people in the Security department and my duties included the basic firewall modifications, network changes for small scale networks (our clients primarily involve small banks),  VPN troubleshooting (never worked with this before this job, now I'm the guy to goto for SSLVPN connections. We primarily work off of Dell [although their systems in Sonicwall were sold to Francesco]). I'm familiar also working with  Checkpoint, Cisco ASAs, starting to work with Cisco Meraki and with FortiGates. I'm also in charge of SIEM management and recently we have had to switch vendors which was an additional headache of retiring the old collectors, coordinating sales/finance to stop paying for the old vendor for clients, and installing new clients and all my work on my old baselines and exceptions are a complete waste of time as I have to start all over again after a year of getting the previous collectors configured to each network.

Essentially what I'm saying is I like my job and my coworkers, I have received a chance many recent graduates would kill for to go straight into security and not wasting a few years on the help desk (already worked on an internal help desk before, I do not want to return to that). I have been given an opportunity that not many receive and I try my hardest.

I work in an office environment with about a dozen other techs. I sit along in my own row unless one of our help desk techs is in the office and not at the client, he's a good friend. The other help desk coworker we have in the office sometimes I also consider a friend. But when they're not there, I'm by myself in the row in an open office where my boss' boss has me in his peripheral vision at all times. If I stop working for a minute, I'm self-conscious of it because I feel like I am watched at all times. Everyone appears friendly and our company tells us they want to treat the techs with anything we want since we're the workforce but there are so few of us, I do not ever feel comfortable taking a sick day. Over December, I had walking pneumonia (not as severe as full blown pneumonia) and then I got Bronchitis. It took 4 weeks to get over these illnesses and I still do not feel 100%, still have a sinus infection and extremely tired at all times but I have no PTO to take off. I took off 2 days and 2 half days over the last 4 weeks for these illnesses and although while I was extremely sick and was being told by friends, family and work, ""You need to take care of yourself first. What good are you dead?"". But anyday I took off, my family and work made me feel so guilty that I would spend the whole day either extremely depressed and ashamed of myself or I would just get drunk to help not feel the pressure.

Ever since I got Lyme's disease in high school, I've been getting sicker more frequently ever. Adding stress to it just makes getting a cold a normal thing in my life and I try my best to hide my discomfort because I know I do not have any PTO and I would like to take a vacation this summer (we get 10 hours of PTO a month for both sickness and vacation. If I take off one day a month for sickness, I'm only saving 2 hours for vacation or future sickness).

I just don't know what to do. I'm not paid much for someone in a network security job but because this company gave me a direct chance in a field that would take experience and years to get to, I do not want to complain and jeopardise it at all.

I have a girlfriend that due to her getting demoted and a paycut for us dating (we worked in the same office building but for separate companies but they still demoted her for fraternisation) , she can no longer afford rent and I am helping her keep her apartment. However, I also pay my own parents $500 a month for rent, I pay over $1000 in loans and car payment (not including insurance, cell phone, parking at work [parking is $150 a month and the company pays $70 and I pay $80 a month just to park at work) and I have an hour and a half commute (in the mornings, it's 2 to 2.5 hours on the way home).

My company heavily pushes for certifications and I'm about to take my Sec+ cert which I know is only entry level and a joke but I was 5% from passing last time ( I know they have their own point system, but the points I received and the points required were only 5% off but I know that questions are weighted differently so it's not truly 5%) with it being a $320 test, I cannot afford to fail it again.

I do not know what to do or what I am feeling anymore. I feel pathetic for this since I've only been working for an MSP for a year and a half (I've been working since I was a child, my grandparents had a farm and working on it in the summers is what made me dream of having an office job where I can sit in AC. But now I find it to be a hell I didn't know that existed).

I apologize for the length of this rant but I simply do not know anymore is I am feeling burnout effects or if it is simply depression. I used to go to a therapist weekly for my clinical depression but I have had to give that up because I could not afford it. I have spent most of my weekend drinking while my girlfriend is at work and crying. I spent an hour on my way to work on Friday just crying and having a breakdown. Everything feels so shitty and I feel so exhausted that I feel like you can describe me in one word, apathetic. I just don't care. I don't care if I die at this point. Every day feels the same and I feel like nothing is changing. My company is losing more and more techs and we have more clients so there is more and more work but we're not being paid any more. The new overtime laws are nice, I got a whole 2k bump to my salary thanks to my company so I can continue to work on-call without being paid overtime. Or the fact I have clients in timezones 3-4 hours away (Eastern time vs Alaska time) and I have to take time out of my personal life (which is 3 hours a day) to work on client VPN issues with their home computes because they need to wait till they get home, so I lose sleep to help them, then go back to sleep to wake up at 5:30am again and start it all over again.

My plan is to work at this MSP for a couple of years to get the experience of working on so many different networks but right now I feel like I'm barely treading water and the current is picking up. I feel like I'm drowning and I'm having near daily breakdowns. I can't tell if it's just work or if its my depression.

And the worst part for me is having to hide my depression at work. I don't want people thinking I'm a freak. I've always felt like I'm just off and never fit in but I'll be as polite as I can possibly be for strangers. I'm either walked all over on or just ignored. I'm pretty sure my CEO doesn't care for me because I look so pathetic and lower class. Our Sales director treated me with disgust when I first started, he was the type that went to an ivy league school and was in a popular fraternity. I went to community college, got a scholarship to a local university and graduated with a 3.89 gpa but I feel like I'm looked down upon.

Anyways, I'm sorry for the huge rant. Downvote away and hide this shit if you want. I just needed to vent somewhere how I feel as a worker that is always scared about their job and how after working so hard in school and getting out of retail, food service, and internships, I still feel like I am worth less than garbage in the eyes of most of my coworkers.

Edit: I apologize if this post looks like a pity party asking for upvotes to make me feel better. I know I'm ranting a lot but I am very confused right now. I feel like I'm pushing myself to my limit and that everyone looks at me like it's not good enough. I know I have depression issues and depression ruminates itself appear worse each time I think of it. So right now I'm so confused, I can't tell how of these daily breakdowns I'm having is depression and how much is just stress. And what sets me over the edge is the fact I know my depression is in my head. I would turn it off if I could. But it runs in my family and I have little control over it even with my medication and it makes me feel even worse because I know that at least my needs are being met and I will survive and there are many many many more people in the world that have basic survival issues. I try to tell myself that if they can do it, I can do it but it just makes me hate myself more that I'm so sad when other that have it worse are pushing forward."

Long story short, I got a internship at a major studio out in LA for this summer and they said they want to possibly hire me full-time but definitely bring me on as an fx associate after the summer.

The thing is I have two more years to go in Uni and I really want to finish my studies and I want to transition to tech art in the future (which requires programming skills). Just about all the UCs and CSUs dont give 2nd degrees so USC is my only hope.

I wanted to know if anyone here has any advice on this? I have a year of experience in the industry at a smaller game studio, GPA from previous schools combined is a 3.5 and was IB if that even matters.

[TL;DR]

Got an internship out in LA and they want to bring me on after but I want to finish my CS degree. I already have a degree and USC is one of the few schools that gives out 2nd bachelor's. How do I get in??"
5o6hkd,6,2017-01-15,Bits &amp; Bytes,MrCreepyCrowlie,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/5o6hkd/bits_bytes/,"My love for computers can be traced back to the spring of 1994. At that time, most schools didn’t have computer labs or software studies. I went to school in a small town where junior high and high school both took place together in one building. The school could accommodate up to 700 students. 

So, it was in no means a one room building like you might see on classic television shows such as “Little House on The Prairie.” We didn’t have a middle school to act as a stepping stone that would prepare us for the hell that was high school, so we were thrown right into the lion’s den. But I digress.

When it came to high school, I was not the most popular boy by any means, but I wasn’t a complete outcast either. I settled somewhere in the middle you might say. I played football, and was pretty good at it. I also played chess and became known as “the computer guy.”

My first exposure to any type of computer system was in my geometry class. It was a normal classroom, but around the walls they had six or seven old Apple computer systems. As I said before, we didn’t have anything special. This was well before USB ports were even a thing. Now, we aren’t talking Apple IIE here, but they were early generation Macintosh systems. 

This is how I met my friend Jake. I had procured a floppy disk from an undisclosed location in which I needed to somehow gain access. I knew little more than the disk in question was supposed to have two full color photos of naked women for my viewing pleasure. I didn’t have a computer at home at the time. In fact, at that point, I had never used a computer in my entire life.  

As I mentioned earlier, I played chess in school. We even had a small after school club. After our meeting, I snuck into my geometry class after the teacher had gone home. I made sure no one was around, and popped that floppy disk into the system. Now what? I had absolutely no idea what to do. 

The icon for the diskette appeared on the desktop, but nothing happened when I clicked the icon. So, I started clicking frantically on the icon, and finally was prompted with a menu asking me what I would like to use to open this unknown file. 

I tried everything from text editors to the painting program, but all that I could get to appear was garbled characters in a jumbled mess. I was getting more and more frustrated at the situation, and eventually my anger got the best of me and I hit the desk quite hard. It made a huge “THUD.” It was then that I heard someone laughing maniacally behind me. My heart sank as I spun around in my seat. 

“I was just trying to play “Myst..” I said frantically. I had heard other students talking about playing the game on those systems, but I had actually known nothing about it whatsoever.  To my surprise, it wasn’t a teacher or even an adult for that matter. It was just another student I had seen using the systems recently. I wasn't sure at the time, but I thought his name was Jake. I was  relieved, but still a bit uneasy because the disk was still in the system, and I had no idea how to go about forcing this computer to cough it up.

Apparently, all young men actually do think alike. Jake knew almost immediately what I was up to. “You need a photo viewer to open photos.”
Again, I protested. “What are you talking about? I was just trying to play “Myst,” but this stupid thing wouldn’t work!”  

He grinned slightly, and walked over to where I was sitting. He leaned down, grabbed the mouse, and magically my “special disk” ejected from the system. “I don’t remember Myst needing one old disk with the label torn off to run. In fact, it should be installed on here already and wouldn't need any disks at all.” He said with a snarky look on his face. 
I grabbed for the disk, but he was faster. My heart sank because I just knew he was going to rat me out. “Look man. Don’t freak out. I’m not going to squeal on you. If you really want to see the “content” on this disk, you can come over to my house. I have a PC that I built myself that you can use.”

I couldn’t argue with that offer, so off we went. Jake only lived a mile or so from the school so it took no time to get to his house. His mom and dad were in the living room watching an old Science Fiction movie when we got there. I had never met them before, but they were surprisingly nice. They offered me food, and they had a nice selection of soda to choose from. 

The house was two stories and very well built. We threw down our backpacks and went upstairs to Jake’s room. Sure enough, he had a huge tower PC in his room by his desk. It was massive. He said that his mom used to be a programmer, and so he had been into computers for a very long time. 

She even taught him how to build them as well. I didn’t know anything about what specs were good or even that I should be impressed when he spouted off things like how it had a 75 MHz Intel Processor, 4 Megabytes of RAM, and a 14.4Kbps modem.

We sat down at his desk, and he popped the disk into that huge tower PC. “This is what I was talking about at school.” He said, as he opened up a program called LVIEW PRO. “The operating system has to have a program installed that knows how to handle the file you want to open.” He added. 

He proceeded to open the files on the disk and sure enough, two of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my entire life were displayed in full color on the screen before me. They were completely naked, and let me tell you that nothing was left to the imagination. 

It was a glorious day for a 15-year-old boy by adolescent standards. I would come to find out later all of the huge differences between the Macintosh computers at school, and the Windows 3.11 PC Jake had.

You want to see something even cooler than these pics?” He said proudly. I was extremely skeptical that he could possess anything cooler than photos of naked women, but I decided to humor him. “If you can top what we just saw, count me in.” I said with a smirk.

He began clicking around on the system and eventually opened up something called “DOOM.” I watched as he navigated the menus and manually set things like his audio/video hardware preferences. Then, he was giving a choice of difficulty that started with “I’m Too Young To Die” and went all the way up to something called “Nightmare!” Jake chose the middle difficulty and began. 

By this point I had figured out it was some kind of game, but had never seen anything like it before. I had a Nintendo and Super Nintendo at home, but I had no idea you could play games this violent on a computer. He then let me take a turn playing DOOM. It was so much fun that I was immediately enthralled.  Before I knew it, more than two hours had passed. I thanked Jake, and ran down the stairs, grabbed my stuff, and headed home.

After that day, Jake and I became good friends. I taught him how to play chess, and he taught me everything he knew about computers. The next step was for me to get a PC of my own. Jake had told me that if I had one too, we could dial up to each other via our modems, and play Doom one on one. This really pushed me over the edge. He made me a copy of the game on several disks, and now all I needed was a PC of my own. I saved every penny I could for the next few months, and just before Christmas I finally got my dad to agree to help me buy  one.

We went to Wal-Mart that night to see what they had. This was back when they had demo units out on shelves for you to click around on and play with a little. They had several models. An AST which was a 486, a Hewlett Packard with a Pentium 60 MHz processor, and one made by a company called Packard Bell. The Packard Bell system was the most powerful at 75 MHz so that is the one I insisted we get. 

At that point Windows 95 had just came out, and it came preloaded on the system. It was the latest and greatest. So, why not? Right? I even got a printer out of the deal after convincing dad that I could use it to print out letters and flyers for him when he so needed.

Over the years, Jake and I stayed close friends. In 1996, we jumped on the Duke Nukem 3D craze since we could play each other one on one with it as well. That was the same year dial-up Internet service finally became available in our little town. Before that, we were stuck with bulletin board systems, and dialing each other to play our limited game selection. 

The Internet changed everything. It gave way to the birth of chat rooms, e-mail, and all sorts of pictures/videos that would make your mother faint. Then later with the birth of broadband Internet, things got even more interesting. But we’ll get to that later.

After high school, Jake and I decided to open a local computer repair shop within the city limits of our little town. I had been working for a guy who had the shop for years, and he had a pretty good client base already established. He had been looking to retire, so Jake and I talked about it and decided to buy him out. 

We did just that, and moved to a bigger location on the main street in town. Business was steady at first, but got even better over time once more people got to know us. I took care of the in-store work, and Jake handled calls to businesses and homes in the area. I took a great deal of pride in my work, and often paid a fair amount of attention to detail when it comes to software licensing and other documentation. 

I have found that over the years it has been a great benefit to read the fine print on all sorts of agreements. On one occasion, a piece of software actually had a clause in the EULA that stated if you sent them an email with your serial number, a certain message in the subject line, along with a predetermined statement that had been provided, the company would provide you with a rebate and free software upgrades for life. The PC Pitstop software offered compensation of $1,000 to a limited number of licensed customer who sent an email to a specified address in their EULA. It was sneaky, but also a good way to see who is reading these licensing agreements.

That was one of the big differences between Jake and me. He had a bad habit of just flying through things halfcocked while not really paying attention to what he was doing. This often caused us both aggravation because he would forget appointments or get the time wrong because he skimmed an email from a customer. I tried to keep him on track for the most part, but I had a great deal to do at the shop myself.

After about a year, we had established ourselves as the “Go To” repair shop for miles around, which meant we were getting a great deal of walk-in customers as well as more and more businesses offering us contracts. We even scored a huge contract with the city/county government which meant we handled the Police Station, Ambulance Service, and 911 Dispatch Center. This was really a great boost for our small business, and it sure did keep us busy. We would often get calls at all hours of the night needing to go out to one of the service areas for an emergency repair.

As good as things were for us at that time, this is also where the problems started as well. The 911 Dispatch Center had requested a complete system upgrade that would be done in two phases. First the dispatchers would get brand new systems, and if that went well, we would then start replacing the servers with more powerful blade servers. 

We could have built the dispatcher systems, but we didn’t want a huge headache if there were any part failures down the road. So, for those, we went with Dell Precision Workstations. They are pricey, but are the definition of work horses. Also, with next business day replacement service, if a part failed, we could have a replacement to swap into the system the very next morning in most cases. Everything about the hardware swap seemed to go quite well, which was a huge relief for both of us.

The 911 Dispatch Center had some really strange software requirements that I had never heard of before. This went way beyond medical HIPAA security policies and even required DOD (Department of Defense) background checks and special certifications. I rarely went onsite because I took care of the shop, but I still had to jump through all of those crazy hoops just like Jake.

Occasionally, we would get a call about a software error that we could repair remotely by securely connecting to their network, and taking control of the system. This sounds easy enough, but was quite a hassle. We had to use a special Citrix secure VPN connection just to get onto their network. Then every click we made was monitored and recorded. It was really creepy to say the least. But the alternative was driving up there to accomplish the same thing and still have everything monitored. This was the lesser of two evils.

The workload became way too much for us to handle alone, so we decided to hire someone who could work in the shop and go on calls if needed. Our shop wasn’t that far from a pretty large technological university which provided an ample number of smart young kids needing a job. 

Around the same time, my fiancé and I had been planning our wedding. I had helped as much as possible with the interviews, but ultimately Jake would have to finish the process. The following weekend was my wedding, and my new wife and I went on our honeymoon to Cape Hatteras to see the famous lighthouse. 

She absolutely loved lighthouses, and this was by far her favorite. She also loved Monster Jam monster trucks. I had planned for us to spend a few days in North Carolina, then I was going to surprise her by taking her to Vegas to the Monster Jam finals. Her favorite driver is Dennis Anderson in Gravedigger, and he was going to be there. Everything went off without a hitch. We had a great time on our honeymoon, and returned the following week. I dreaded having to get back to work after having a relaxing week, but I knew I had no choice. 

I arrived at the shop on Monday morning and to my surprise, Jake was there behind the counter along with some guy I had never seen before in my life. I went into the back and asked Jake to come back for a second. He made his way to the back room rather quickly. “Hey Man! How was the honeymoon?” He said cheerfully. 

“It was good, thanks. So, who is that out front?” I asked. 

“Oh Yeah! That’s Tim. He is the new guy.” Jake explained. He went on to tell me about how he was on a house call this last week and had a tire blow out going down the road. This guy, Tim, stopped to help him and apparently, Tim had just graduated from the university with a degree in Computer Science. 

He went on to say that they hung out the next couple of evenings at the bar down the street, and found out that Tim was looking for a job to hold him over until he moved out West to start an internship somewhere in Silicon Valley next year. 

I can’t say that I was thrilled that Jake had hired some guy that I had never met, but if he thought that Tim was qualified, I wasn’t going to get pissed about it. We did need some help after all. I went back up front and talked with Tim for a about an hour, and while he did seem very knowledgeable, something about him made me uneasy. Since Tim wasn’t planning on staying with us for the long haul, we didn’t bother getting him certified and cleared to work at the government sites. He could stick to other businesses and consumer customers.

We had an upstairs section to our shop that we never used. It was sealed off via a large wooden door because we didn’t want to waste money heating/cooling it since we weren’t using it. Jake and I had talked about turning it into an apartment and possibly living up there back before I had gotten married, but had since given up on that idea. 

We had started occasionally storing old boxes up there in case we needed to ship an entire system at some point. There were also two huge deep freezers up there in what used to be a kitchen area. We knew they both worked because we had tried to sell them once before for extra money, and to get rid of them. But since no one ever wanted to fool with dragging them down the stairs, we unplugged them, and they just sat up there. 

I even tried to convince Jake that we could clean up the upstairs and make it into a man cave with a nice LED TV/Sound System and a pool table, but he never seemed interested because we were always so busy. I had a plan to revisit this conversation after Tim had been with us a while and the workload was under control. Tim added in his two cents explaining how expensive it would be to renovate the upstairs, and to heat/cool it. I really wanted to blurt out, “Who the hell even asked you?” But somehow, I remained civil.

The next several weeks seemed to go by quickly. I didn’t see a lot of Tim because he spent most of his time out on the road helping Jake or picking up the slack by handling other onsite appointments. This was fine with me because I can't say that I liked Tim very much, and I swear I would sometimes catch him staring at me all creepily on occasion. 

Other than that, things seemed to be working out okay for the most part, but I still felt uneasy around Tim when he would spend time at the shop. I really couldn’t even tell you why. He dressed well, and seemed smart. Still, there would just be those times when the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up when he was there. I would like to be able to say that eventually that feeling went away. Unfortunately, it did not. 

In fact, it only got worse over the next several weeks. Shortly after Tim started, Jake had given him a key so he could come in on weekends and work on systems in the shop as needed. I tried my best to not be there alone with him whenever possible. 

Yuck! For the past week there has been a faint smell of something akin to a skunk that had crawled up under the building and died. It wasn’t too bad at first, but was getting increasingly worse. I made a reminder in my calendar to call pest control to check for dead rodents under the building. The last thing I needed was customers getting grossed out and not wanting to come into the store because it reeked.

The next evening, after the shop had closed, I was alone in the back trying to catch up on some work when the phone rang. Now, I usually don’t answer the phone after hours because if it is important, they can leave a message and we will get back to them. On top of that, all of our government contracts have a special cell number they can use to reach Jake in case he needs to make an emergency on call visit. 

However, I recognized the number on the Caller ID as Mr./Mrs. Phillips. Tim had been scheduled go out there earlier that afternoon to check out a possible malware issue. So, I decided to answer. “PCS, how may I help you?” I was met with an angry male voice. 

“I want to speak to the owner!” He said angrily. “Listen. Y’all were supposed to come out here and fix this damned computer today, and it’s still just as slow and unusable as it was this morning.” On top of that, the webcam light won’t turn off either.” He added.  

I went into full damage control mode, and apologized profusely over and over for the inconvenience. “I see that Tim was supposed to come out there today at 2:30 p.m. today. Do you know how long he was there this afternoon?” I inquired. 

“Hold on. I’ve been at work all day, let me ask my wife….  No wonder the damned computer doesn’t work. She said that nobody came out at all to fix this piece of crap.” Said the man, now completely irate.  
“Again, Mr. Phillips, I am so very sorry for the inconvenience. I can’t imagine what happened to Tim today that made him miss the appointment. I will reschedule a call to your house for tomorrow, and the labor will be on us for your inconvenience.” I said, trying to save a customer.  

The thought of a free service call must have done the trick. His tone changed, and he seemed much more cordial. I penciled him in for 2:30 p.m. the following day and hung up the phone to continue my work.

I was quite annoyed that Tim had missed his appointment and didn’t even bother to call the customer or me to let either of us know what was going on. The more I thought about it the more pissed off I got. I couldn’t take it anymore! I grabbed the phone and tried to call Tim’s cell. Right to voicemail. I left a message asking what happened, and if he was okay since I hadn’t heard from him. I then hung up the phone, and called Jake.

***Ring, Ring, Ring, Ring,*** “Your call had been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. The person you are trying to reach is not available. After the tone, please leave your name and number.” “Dammit! Why does anyone even have cell phones if they don’t know how to answer them?!” I shouted.

About that time the shop phone rang again. I answered it quickly without looking at the Caller ID thinking it might be Jake or Tim. “Hey this is Harry up here at the 911 Dispatch Center. We cannot get any of our system to print to our main laser printer, and it’s causing us to get backed up. We tried to get a hold of Jake on the cell, but all we get is voicemail.”  

“Hi Harry.” I replied. “This is Will. I am just here catching up on some work at the shop. I haven’t been able to reach Jake either. I am sorry to hear about the printing issues you are having, and I would be glad to drive up there and take a look if that’s okay.”  

“Yes please.” He said in a panic. I told him to give me 15 minutes and I’d be right there.

I locked up, got in my truck, and headed up toward the 911 Dispatch Center. My mind wandered back and forth between Tim going AWOL and Jake not answering the cell. He never misses a call from anyone. Especially the 911 center. I arrived at the dispatch center and scanned my badge to open the gate. After parking, I again scanned my badge to enter the building. 

I went back to Harry’s office to let him know I was there. He greeted me, and came out to show me what was going on. Sure enough, none of the print jobs were completing. The print queue was pretty backed up, and it was a mess.  I checked a couple of the workstations, and they all had prints queued up. Odds of the workstations all failing at once was pretty astronomical, so I checked the network. 

The switches all looked good so I moved on to the printer itself. I kneeled down and noticed that there was no link light on the Ethernet port. I disconnected the RJ45 connector and looked it over. One of the twisted pairs inside had broken and the end wasn’t clamped on very well. There was a pile of cable that had been curled up behind the printer that wasn’t even the right color. 

Someone had replaced the original patch cable with this monstrosity. No wonder nothing was printing. I went to the back and measured out about 5 feet of Cat5e cable, and put new ends on. I plugged it into the wall jack, and then into the printer. Voilà! The printer fired up, and out started to pour all of the prints. 

I told Harry that I would wait here until they finished to make sure they completed successfully, and then bring them back to his desk. The printing went on for what seemed like forever, even though it was more like 10 minutes. I gathered up all of the papers and started heading back to Harry’s office. 
As I walked into Harry’s office, I started to show him that they all turned out okay by filing through them a bit. “They all look okay to me.” I said proudly. “I don’t see any banding or smudging in the pri……….”  My heart sank and those hairs on my neck stood on end. 

I grabbed the 4th paper from the top and threw the rest on the desk. The printouts were mugshots being transmitted to the 911 Dispatch Center to add to their local database. They print them out as well to add alphabetically to folders they keep within reach for the dispatchers to check when assisting police.

“No...no… no…. This can’t be happening.” I uttered in disbelief! I rubbed my eyes and looked again, but there was no denying it. There was “Tim.” His name wasn’t even Tim. It was Robert, and he was wanted for the murder of his entire family. The report stated that while they slept, he had crept into his brother’s room and slit his throat. He then took his father’s shotgun and shot his mother and father in bed. 

“Oh, Please No!” I screamed. “Harry! Jake hired this guy a few weeks ago to help us at the shop. He said his name was Tim. I haven’t been able to get a hold of him or Jake today.”

We ran outside and jumped into Harry’s state car. As we headed back into town, Harry radioed for police assistance. We went to Jake’s house. His car was there, but no one answered when we knocked. We waited for the police to arrive. They knocked the door down and did a sweep of his house. No one was there. 

I called Jake’s mom and let her know what was happening, and asked if she had heard from him. She hadn’t heard from him in a few days she said. We all went back over to the shop, and I told the police everything I knew about Tim, and how long he had worked for us. I explained the story of how Jake hired him while I was on my honeymoon, and I really didn’t know anything about him.

One of the officers kept sniffing around and making faces. I apologized for the odor and told him that I thought an animal had died under the building, and that I had called pest control to check it out for me, but they hadn’t made it out yet. He nodded, and went back out to the main showroom. 

I stayed in the back talking to Harry and the other police officers about what was going on. We heard a knock on the back door. It was Jake's mom, and needless to say, she was freaking out. Just as she came in and sat down we heard one of the officers yell out. “Jesus Christ!” We ran out of the office in time to see him burst from upstairs in a panic. He ran to the nearest trash can and threw up. Some of the officers ran upstairs with guns drawn, and I followed behind them. 

The stench was too much, and it got worse the further up you went. At the top, it was all you could do not to throw up. The two freezers were open, and even though it was dark, the flash lights illuminated parts of the floor and the white freezers. There was blood everywhere. The freezers were full of different body parts. Arms, legs, heads, and other assorted body parts. 

On the counter was a small hot plate with a skillet, a knife, a fork, and a stack of paper plates. In the corner was a small sleeping bag along with an old duffel sack with some clothes in it. 

This sick bastard had been killing random people and bringing their body parts to the shop to hide in the freezers upstairs. To make things worse, he was cooking and eating the body parts at night after everyone was gone.  By the looks of it, he had been squatting up there since he got a key to the place. They never did fully identify all of the bodies. I was told later by Harry that they knew the parts were from at least six different people.

Thankfully, Jake was not one of the bodies that had been stored in the freezers. The next day I got a call from him and as it turns out his girlfriend had slept over the night earlier, and she had gotten a call that her mother had a mild heart attack. So, her and Jake took her car and drove last minute all the way to the next state over so they could be with her. 

I explained everything that happened to him, and what was found by the police. Needless to say, we were both questioned heavily. Jake was never the same after that. I sold him my half of the business and moved with my wife to the Southern part of the state so she could be closer to her family.  But it wasn't long before I heard that the business went under. 

Jake slowly started to lose the will to keep it going. He got married, then divorced. Then remarried, and eventually had some kids. Shortly after they were born he and his wife just up and moved to India to do mission work for his church. 

We don't really talk anymore. He doesn't use Facebook, and I don't even have his phone number. I see random Posts from his mom and sister with updates on how he is occasionally, but that's it. I will always be grateful to Jake for teaching me about computers and I'm so glad we both survived that incredible ordeal. 

To my knowledge, Tim/Robert was never apprehended by the police. We never heard from or saw him again. I do think about him from time to time. And wherever he is out there, if he ever again tries to eat someone, I sincerely hope that sick bastard chokes on their middle finger!

Can anyone tell me about prospects for admission to reasonable quality MS in Computer Science programs (let's say top 100) after obtaining the software dev degree from WGU? I understand that the WGU degree is not a computer science degree and lacks the more theoretical math/physics content that CS degrees tend to have. Needless to say, these courses would have to be taken either separately before entering a master's program, or as part of the master's program. I do eventually want to do more theoretical, deeper-level work, which, in addition to higher pay, interests me in eventually obtaining an MS, but I have to establish a practical knowledge base first. It seems completing WGU's program and some internships could provide a much quicker route to obtaining practical experience and reasonable pay than the slow process of obtaining a CS undergrad degree at my local mediocre state university, which would probably take me 2 1/2 years starting from fall 2017 (Argh!) I am 28 years old so I'm kind of in a hurry to get into the field in a serious way before I get too old."
5o716o,76,2017-01-15,How to convince my controlling mom to let me dorm at college next year?,jjh0928,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5o716o/how_to_convince_my_controlling_mom_to_let_me_dorm/,"I'm a 19 year old girl, and I'm currently a freshman at a pretty well-known private university. I worked my ass off to get accepted there, and I absolutely love it (even though it's very challenging and stressful at times). I get stressed/anxious very easily, it's just part of my character, but lately, being a commenter student (and having a very strict mom) has been a bigger challenge than I anticipated. 

My dad is not the problem - he's a chill guy, but my mom is a whole other story. Growing up, I was very isolated from other kids my age. I wasn't allowed to have friends over, hang out with them outside of school, go to school dances/events (not even prom), I wasn't allowed to play sports or join many after school/extracurricular activities, blah blah you get the idea. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom, and she loves me, but she is way too overprotective of me. 

Everyday, I wake up about 3 hours earlier compared to my peers just to get to school on time. Traffic is terrible where I live, and my college is a good 16 miles away from my house, and since I don't have a car, my mom drops me off/picks me up EVERY DAY. I try not to get embarrassed about it, but it's really hard not to be humiliated every time my mom drops me off by the front steps of my building in her minivan in front of dozens of fellow college students. 

In total, we probably do about 3 hours of driving everyday (to school and back). This quarter, my classes get off pretty late and I have so much homework and studying to do and I'm constantly tired since I sleep so late. I try to see the positives of living at home, like sleeping in my own bed and having my own bathroom, but that's pretty much it. The time wasted in car rides could be of so much use to me, and I'll be getting more sleep and I can participate in clubs and sports like I've always wanted, but my mom just won't let me do anything. I've actually talked to her about this stuff but she just doesn't get it. She just dismisses me and calls me dumb or ridiculous for wanting to dorm at college when ""I have a perfectly good bed at home."" She thinks going to campus events is unnecessary and bad people would want to do bad things to me, and she's always acted this way, even with my older sisters (who are both in their thirties and still live at home even though they have good jobs because my mom never have them independence). 

I've been so obedient towards my mom for so long, because I know that whatever I do/say, she'll always reject my ideas if it involves me getting even the tiniest bit of independence. I've asked her so many times if I could hang out with friends or get a job or go to a campus event and every time she's said no. If I disobey her, she will make my life miserable. She'll slap the living daylight out of me and take away my phone, laptop, and pretty much every other form of communication to the outside world (And please don't say ""slapping you is abuse, call the cops on your mom."" because that's going to make things worse). Friends tell me to speak up for myself, that I'm an adult, but *they just don't get it*. I've tried *everything* to get my mom to let me dorm. She's been saying for months now that she'll get me a car, but I've crunched the numbers and her getting me a car, insurance, maintenance parking permits, and gas would cost more than just letting me dorm for the next two academic years (I'm graduating early). I've been given so much in scholarships/grants/aid that it just doesn't make any financial sense to commute, but my mom says she doesn't care, that she needs to keep an eye on me until I'm out of the house. I'm a very responsible person. I've never caused trouble in my entire life. I do great in school. I don't party or do drugs or anything like that. The worse thing I've done is keep my room messy. 

I just don't get it, and I'm at my wits end with my mom. School is only going to get harder next year, and I just don't have the time or energy to drive 3 hours a day and deal with my overbearing family. I don't have anyone to talk to that'll understand my situation. Whenever I voice my concerns, my older sisters tell me to get over myself and to stop being immature and to just deal with our mom whether I like it or not. I want to get an internship at my university, but it's just not realistic with my mom because she demands that I print out my schedule for her to see and she expects me to be out and done with school  after my last class of the day. I feel like I'm stuck and going nowhere. And people tell me ""oh, you just need to get control of your own life, you're an adult. Stop being such a pushover,"" but what the hell am I supposed to to in this situation? Risk my relationship with my mom/family and make her even more controlling of me? Everyone seems to judge me for being so obedient but they never offer suggestions of what I can do to better my situation. I could use some advice or encouragement on what to do. I feel like my mom is holding me back from accomplishing so many things in life, but I just don't know how to make her stop this. 


EDIT: Thank you SO MUCH everyone for your kind words and advice. I was in desperate need of some encouragement and I will defiantly provide some updates on my situation. Take care :)"

I need some help making a decision, I've been thinking about it for nearly a month and I keep waffling back and forth. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but there are a number of variables. 

I've received a job offer for a consultant position in Washington D.C. paying north of $90K. This position would allow me to keep my security clearance which would otherwise expire in the coming months, my clearance is above Secret. The exact job is unknown to me as I would essentially be a government resource and put where they need me, so until I get started I don't know who I would be working with or what I would actually be doing. 

I've worked in the DC area before as an intern and then a government employee, and I left after about a year because I absolutely hated the area - the traffic is an absolute nightmare and the people are generally more career oriented and much more.. assertive than I am. I've always been an anxious person, but living in that area before caused my anxiety to spike and I was completely depressed living in that environment. It was a very isolating experience being nearly a full day driving away from my old friends and family. 

Since I left, I've moved back to my home state and taken a job as an analyst at a bank, and I've been much happier - I'm closer to my friends and I make a decent salary considering my location. While I'm much happier now, my job is certainly less fulfilling than my role in DC was and I'm not sure if losing my clearance would completely shut me out of those opportunities. 

I'm wondering if moving back to DC would be a mistake, it's been nearly 2 years since I left and I think I've matured a lot in that time and adjusted considerably to working life, but I'm not sure if that would have any impact on my happiness once I got back to DC. The money is considerably better than I am making now, and the job would likely be much more engaging as well - plus the experience would be extremely unique. I just can't get over the worry about moving back to DC - I get anxious just at the thought of being back up in that area. 

What would you do? Is there something that I should consider that I'm not? I appreciate any and all advice!

After applying to like 6-7 internships I've become sort of intimidated because the positions I've seen seem to all require experience which I don't have, seeing as the only experience I have with CS is classwork. I have used Java, Scala, and C in my classes. Am I in a position to secure an internship position given my lack of experience, or is that unrealistic? Please be honest. Also, is my strategy (just browsing a site like indeed) an effective one, or should I be doing something else. It doesn't seem like I'm finding positions I can realistically land, but I don't know if I'm just looking in the wrong place or if there are no internships for a person like me without experience outside of class.

Who is he? Walt Grace, a 14 year old boy

Walt Grace has two paths to take: **Average Walt** and **Entrepreneur Walt**

I wrote this as a text post, but if you would rather watch a video with visuals, it's [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7_9aK5RhM0).

-------

**Average Walt:**

He starts playing video games at 14, bought an Xbox. Realizing he has a strong passion for tech, he continues for two years playing games. Two years later, now 16 years old, he takes a Computer Science course at his High School. Another year goes by, and as he grows into his later teenage years, he sits in his room and learns some programming languages. But he does not have the strength to push his content out into the world. It’s all practice stuff that he saves locally on his little computer. His senior year of high school comes to an end, and he applies to a state college to pursue Computer Science. Throughout his time there, he mainly just gets good grades.


**Entrepreneur Walt:**

He too starts playing video games at 14, and realizes his passion for tech.He decides to start creating YouTube videos, and work for an entire YEAR almost every day editing videos.

Guess what? He FAILED. In the end, he had a mere 50 subscribers. 


The next year he taught himself programming; lots of languages like Javascript and HTML/CSS.
He loved it so much that he went to a lot of hackathons, where you stay up for 24 hours working on projects with teams. A lot of the travel was even paid for by these hackathons! But sadly, he never won any competitions at these hackathons. 

He FAILED.

Next year, now 16 years old, he signs up for a Computer Science class. Because the Comp Sci department is pretty bad a his school, he even starts a club!

At 17, he’s learned a lot of coding at this point, and makes websites to release into the world. He makes a website that allows users to upload and download game modifications. In the end, it does alright, about 300 views a week. Not a big amount of success. 

So finally, it is the end of senior year and he gets accepted into a state school. Over the next four years he joins the entrepreneurship club, the computer science club, created a startup with some students that never took off. Also works on open source software but no one ever uses it. 

Entrepreneur Walt failed almost every year since he started as a little boy at 14. But who really failed here?

Let’s let their resumes decide, as they leave college and try to get a job. 


**Average Walt:**

* State University

* Majored in Computer Science

* 1 summer internship


**Entrepreneur Walt:**

* State University

* Majored in Computer Science

* 3 Summer Internships

* Incredible video editor (portfolio attached)

* Learned digital marketing and search engine optimization

* Leadership: started CS club

* Expert in many Comp Sci Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascipt, Python, Django(framework), SQL (Database) (portfolio attached, beautiful modding site).

But something even more important happened during Walt’s time at college. Joining all these clubs he met some of the greatest friends he had ever had. Had he not joined, he would have sat alone on a lot of Friday and Saturday nights. 

Average Walt got a job making 30k a year managing databases, while Entrepreneur Walt is currently making 100k a year at a very creative startup, with chances of going public. 


I see so many people scared of starting because of starting, but the real failures are those who do nothing at all.

5o84xf,1,2017-01-15,My boyfriend (20) honestly puts smoking weed ahead of any priorities.. am I wrong for saying anything?,hmw1597,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5o84xf/my_boyfriend_20_honestly_puts_smoking_weed_ahead/,"First &amp; foremost, I don't mind weed. The shitty thing is the fact that it's illegal in my state so there's always the risk of getting busted. I do mind weed when someone worries more about smoke sessions &amp; spending money on it when they are broke &amp; is not in the best place academically or have any sort of stable income.

I love my boyfriend tremendously &amp; there isn't a thing in this world I wouldn't do for him.
But... in my honest opinion, his priorities aren't entirely straight.
He is 20, I'm 19. His first year of college, he moved away. He was not expected to work under the condition he take three classes a semester. Unfortunately, he either failed or withdrew from every class he enrolled in for the entire year. One time while I was visiting, he bought a 200 dollar bag of weed. I was honestly disgruntled to see where his money that he did not work for was going, as his grandparents (who had raised him) sent him money weekly &amp; he was always broke. 
Sophomore year, he moved back home. I moved away for school. He took four classes for the entire year, failing one. Junior year, he spent the semester at home &amp; took two classes he made Cs in. We just moved back to school for the spring, as I moved home during the first semester for an internship, &amp; he will only be taking 3 classes &amp; two of which are the classes he has made Cs in. His third year of college is wrapping up, &amp; he is so far behind...
He has not earned any volunteer hours or joined any extra curriculars. He wants to get into the wildlife school at the university, but I don't think he understands the work ethic it requires.

Keep in mind, he spends more time worrying about what his friends are doing than ANYTHING. He has no idea about the rate at which he wants to take his classes nor does he even know the prerequisites for the school he is trying to attend. Not once has he sat down &amp; planned out any of the things needed for his future. I sent him this, today...

""Love.. I'm not going to sit here &amp; tell you how to live your life. But I feel I'm in the position to help you when it's appropriate.

Once school starts, I hope that you find a hobby aside from sitting with a group of people smoking. Or going out of your way to do it every single day &amp; only do that, work, &amp; school. You also need* that outside stuff to get into a good school, like extra curriculars. I hope you find something healthy to do with yourself that builds you physically or mentally. You're better than people that only do what they have to do &amp; with no intent to indulge in another craft or build another skill. You're blessed &amp; I'd hate to see that be in vain..
I'm not saying I'm not proud of you. Getting high isn't that big of a deal, but it just isn't a good thing to do every single day. Especially when you're tight on money. You haven't asked about getting your books or anything like that. I'm just being honest &amp; I know I'm not in the best position to say anything, but I'm trying to get my priorities straight. I just hope your first year of school isn't repeated with the weed. 

It kills me to see you rather get high than go run, join a group, or do something good for yourself.""

To which he sent back ""🙄""
I don't want to sound condescending. I hate that my efforts are annoying to him. Considering that I am the one who registers for his classes &amp; tries to figure these things out for him. I know I shouldn't step in with these things, but I can't stand to see him fail..

What should I do?"
5o88we,6,2017-01-15,I'd like to make friends with people my own age before my best friend moves away,RedJayRioting,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/5o88we/id_like_to_make_friends_with_people_my_own_age/,"I [M/22] moved into an apartment with three other guys (one being my best friend from high school) for college about four years ago. The college I went to was a private specialized university where I got my bachelor's degree in IT. There were a total of 4 guys (mostly 15+ years older) in my class. My classmates and I got along, but not well enough to hang out outside of class. At my internship, I was an IT admin for a research institute with, again, noticeably older employees. One by one, my roommates dropped out of college, and I only keep in touch with the one that was my best friend prior to moving out for college. I moved out to my own apartment after a year of living with them, and have really enjoyed it.

After three full years of college, I graduated with my bachelor's degree and got a job right away at a hospital. Everyone in my department that I work with is 40+ years of age. We get along, but not well enough to hang out outside of work.

My best friend, his fiance, and I live in the same apartment complex, though on different floors. This is great, since we can hang out and not have to really go anywhere. Sadly, he's moving to Oklahoma later this year (I'm living in Wisconsin).

Currently, I go to work from 7am-3:30pm Monday-Friday and then go to the gym for about an hour everyday. On Fridays, my friend and I will go to dinner, then drink, and watch movies.

Other than that, I can't say that I do much to find new people for the time being. Obviously, the easiest thing would be to ""just get out there"", but it seems extremely difficult when I know so few people to get out there and explore with. I'd love to be able to introduce myself to people in the gym, but I wouldn't have any idea how to start that conversation without seeming weird. Would people at the gym be weirded out by someone introducing themself? I'd also love to be able to go downtown on the weekends and meet people at college bars, but I wouldn't know how to not look so alone and akward. How can I do this? How can I meet people my age?"
5o8vzt,3,2017-01-15,In a tricky situation. I have the option to make significant changes but there are drawbacks. 20 y/o college student struggling with depression since age 13,moeabbas96,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5o8vzt/in_a_tricky_situation_i_have_the_option_to_make/,"You guys ready to hear a story? I hope so.

I am currently a 20 year old college student going to school at a well-known 4 year university. Everything looks great on paper. 3.5 GPA, tons of extra curriculars, solid social life, and just got an internship locked in place.

However...

There are underlying problems. Of course, right? I was diagnosed with depression at age 13. When I was 12, my Sudanese parents got divorced, and my dad literally packed his stuff and walked out of the house without describing any of the details to me. My little sister was 4 at the time, and according to her, she witnessed some fights between my parents. That fucked her up real good. She's now 12 and has to take numerous medications to combat her (literally) psychotic depression. I have also thought about taking medication and have tried counseling, but I try to push forward without much treatment as a way to trick myself into thinking that I'm strong. Now both me and my 12 year old sister live with my dad, and he has a very negative view towards depression. Essentially, he believes that it doesn't exist, which has put a major filter in our relationship. I'm not allowed to show negative feelings, and I sure as hell know this because every time my 12 year old sister cuts herself, he makes her feel bad for feeling bad, only making the problem worse (""THIS IS THE WRONG THING TO DO!!! ARE YOU STUPID??). In other words, it seems this guy is pretty emotionally challenged. He is very hard to communicate with, and oftentimes he'll just stare at you instead of speaking his mind. Very uncomfortable.

Now, that's just the backstory. I've explained that I go to college, still live at home, and that my sister lives with us too. Now, recently, just me and my sister decided to spend a week in Greensboro in order to see our mom. There was the usual shit-talking about dad, since mom definitely has a lot against him at this point (dad divorced her while she had no steady income, got remarried, and continued to pursue his career as a professor). Now, when we drove back to our hometown, both me and my sister were dreading how miserable it was going to be. We both hate living in that house, as we find it to be a pretty toxic environment. We drive back, park the car near the driveway, walk in, and notice that dad has a very strange look on his face. Not unusual. Weird dude. I go upstairs and unpack my things, then start reading Quora on my phone. All of a sudden, my dad yells my name and asks what my GPA is. I tell him it's a 3.5 overall, but I only got a 3.0 last semester since I ended up getting a C in one class. Shitty professor. I expected disappointment since a C isn't the greatest news in the world, but my dad looked completely furious. He gives me a stare equivalent to that of Satan's, and says ""you and I need to have a talk."" He then has his wife (my stepmom) make him some hot chocolate, and he makes me sit there and wait while he finishes his mug (plus he chugged the shit down like his tongue was made of steel... Jesus). Then, he makes me get in his car, and for about 5-10 minutes, we're driving in absolute silence and I have no idea where we're going. He parks in some random ass spot on the campus I go to, and says ""WHERE IS THE RED BAG IN THE BASEMENT?!""

Dear. Fucking. God. What's he talking about?!

My dad found out I had friends over one week while he was gone, and accused me and my friends of stealing it. Now, there is a reason he was so on edge. There was an incident in the past when something was stolen from the house while my parents were gone, and it was fairly recent too. However, we settled this personally without getting the police involved. Knew the guy pretty well... best friend in middle and high school actually. I decided to let the guy chill in my house while I go to work one day... then he trips on acid, has a terrible trip, and goes batshit nuts. Yeah. Long story.

Anyway, I knew that this time nothing was actually stolen, since I basically kept an eye on my friends during their entire visit at the house. They did spend the night, and yes, something could have happened while I was asleep, but these guys aren't anyone to take anything. My dad said he wanted to get the police involved, and once I told them that, they said ""yes, please, let's get this over with to prove that we didn't do anything."" To me, that says something about the validity of their innocence. I keep telling my dad that I had no idea what he was talking about, yet kept saying ""TELL ME RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENED"" and continued to call me stupid, unappreciative, ungrateful, defiant, and that the wiring in my brain is off. He wouldn't even tell me what the bag looked like, or when he found out it was apparently stolen. He then tells me that he doesn't trust me anymore, and once we get home, I'm at my breaking point. After talking to some relatives, I make this super emotionally charged decision to pack all my belongings and move to Greensboro. 

Obviously, this upset my dad, and he tried to guilt trip me into coming back, saying ""you don't fix a mistake by making another mistake"" and ""you must make amends and apologize to me in front of everyone in the house."" I didn't wanna deal with that. My new plan was to find a job in Greensboro, work for a semester, then come back to school off student loans, grants, and scholarships. Over time, my dad begins to feel a bit bad, calls my mom, and forces me to talk to him on the phone. I tell him we need to fix the communication aspect in our relationship, since the underlying problems that led me to make the decision to go to Greensboro came from lack of communication... since I was scared of him. He told me he agreed with me.

I still wanna move out at this point. Even though we have sort of made up, I have a feeling he's never truly going to change. I am thinking about moving out now and paying the rest of college myself through student loans. I have the option to take out a $7500 loan this semester, and have already found an apartment room. All I need to do is finalize things.

Is this a reasonable decision? Before, my dad was paying for my tuition, yet held that over my head as a way to stay in the house, because he doesn't want me to be entitled to his money. He's pretty tight about these things. If I take out the loan and continue to take out loans, I will graduate with debt on my plate... but I'll be away from my dad. I think this is what I really need. I'm thinking a certain distance in our relationship will allow things to reset, instead of complicate, which is very possible if I stay in the house.

I just want to be fucking happy... I want to feel free

Apply for another internship or for a real job?",HuskyInfantry,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5o92kp/23yo_graduating_in_may_apply_for_another/,"Over the past couple of years I've had five different internships, all very relevant to my field of study (advertising/marketing). They've been pretty varied, from successful startups, standard businesses, and one overseas in Europe. 

I'm trying to figure out what my next step is. Ideally I would like to work at one of my local ad agencies. It seems like they typically hire within though. They are offering another round of internships this summer, often taking in hundreds of applications and only accepting around 10 people, hiring only 1-2 out of those. Maybe it is worth noting that I know somebody who currently works there. 

I cant help but roll my eyes at the thought of another internship. The pay is shit, and I don't want to waste the entire summer interning only to not receive a job from it.  

Should I focus my energy towards other marketing roles for a FT entry level position and apply for the agency later down the road? Or give up my summer for another internship with the strong possibility of not being offered a job afterwards-- albeit at my dream work place? "

5o9jn4,14,2017-01-16,"Are my reasons for choosing IB over trading logical? Also, what should my next steps be?",[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5o9jn4/are_my_reasons_for_choosing_ib_over_trading/,"Hello,

I am a current sophomore at a target, majoring in Business Administration, minoring in Computer Science. I have a 3.8+ GPA.

Since mid-freshman year I've been first employee at a fin-tech startup started by an acquaintance of mine. We've raised funding, and are currently in the process of an acquisition, leading to me needing a summer internship.

My brother works in trading, and told me to use this site to get all my questions answered.

1) The main finance jobs I've heard college graduates get are IB, consulting, and trading. Is this correct, or are there any other finance related jobs that pay well?

2) While I do have technical/quantitative skills (CS minor, work on fin-tech product), I am not into work that is super technical like my brother (a trader) is. I'm fine with putting in long hours for fluffy classes, I'm fine with waking up at 5 AM to give demos of the fintech startup I work for, because those aren't really ""hard,"" they're more just going the extra mile and putting in the work. My impression is that trading is more PnL/bottom line oriented and technical, whereas IB might have longer hours, but the work itself is not as challenging. Is this correct?

3) I've cold emailed a few boutique investment banks. A few liked my resume, and said let's talk in a few weeks. I don't know shit about IB, though hopefully I will ""intern"" at my school's Investment Club this semester. What are the best books/guides/resources or stuff in general to start learning? Outside of directly applying to the larger banks, is cold emailing boutique banks the best way to get a summer internship? 

4) Is VC an option? I have experience in getting startups acquired, and my network is much more developed in the startup/VC community than the IB community.

5) Will my CS knowledge be less useful in IB than in trading, and therefore just be an unnecessary burden that drains my GPA?

6) My brother makes 200k, 2 years out of college (bonuses included). I look online, IB's average salary first year out of college is 70k. Is the pay difference really that great?

If you have any other thoughts/feedback, please let me know. Thanks everyone for the help, I really appreciate it. "

5oacgx,6,2017-01-16,23M Germany &gt; US - How viable is this plan?,Meddlmois,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/5oacgx/23m_germany_us_how_viable_is_this_plan/,"Hey IWantOut, 
your favorite bitter German here this time looking for some input myself instead of complaining and telling people they likely can't move somewhere. 


I'm looking to move to the United States one day and I'm pretty much willing to study what it needs to get there on a work visa one day  - since this is at least four years from now I know that laws may change drastically till then but I'd still like an evaluation of my plans. 
I have been looking at majors in the STEM Field that I could pick up and do a Bachelors in and came up with a very rough plan or path I could take and I'd like to hear how my cards would look if I went through with it. 


So as for me and my skills today:
I'm a 23 yo German, native German speaker (duh) fluent and close to being native in English (study English at university for two years) and fluent in Spanish (by the time I will graduate I should be able to use it even in a professional work environment - probably useless when it comes to finding a job in the US but I guess it can't hurt). 
As for work experience so far: I did work part-time in my uncles Pharmacy, nothing too fancy. Aside from that I work as treasurer for the youth organization of a political party in my town - its an unpaid job that I was elected to do, probably not too fancy either but I guess it can look good on a resume. 
My HS grades weren't too grade - Did very well in some subjects and pretty awful in others overall my GPA is about average (not bad enough to not allow me to study CS). 


Now for my future plans: 
I would like to study Computer Science and have a good selection of Universities here in Berlin (while I doubt any of the Universities here are well-known in the US, two of them are among the best rated in Germany/Europe and sometimes even listed in worldwide rankings) to choose from. 
During my studies I would obviously try to get as many internships in as possible - and would focus my studies/classes on a direction that is in demand in the US (CS can be a pretty big field, so I would need to look into that some more). 
Taking a semester abroad during my bachelors is something that I would love to do, but due to the logistics and cost of it isn't something that I would count on becoming reality. I know that it would increase my chances, but I don't think its necessary? 

Post-Graduation I would like to find a job in the US as soon as possible and from the looks of it a Masters degree is not expected/necessary in most cases? 

However I'm not turned off by the idea of pursuing a Masters degree in the US after finishing my bachelors. I read that there are plenty of opportunities and affordable programs for international students to do so? Afterwards I should then be certainly able to find a job? (as an international student in the STEM Field you do have a grace period after graduating from a US college in which you can look for a job - or is that simply a fabrication?)

So thats all for now - mainly I want to focus on immigrating with only a bachelors for now, the masters part is optional. 

Thank you for any help or input on the matter. 
Possibly awarding Gold! "

My current monitor is giving me a lot of problems and since I have a project in mind (MagicMirror integrated with a RaspberryPi) I've decided to upgrade it and use my current one as the monitor to my project. 

The thing is, I want to buy a good but cheap one, since I need to cut my budget as I need to invest in other stuff that I have in mind currently (Spring Break, internship, etc). I think that a range of 100-200€ would be the best.

What do you guys suggest? Do you have any experiences with a good gaming monitor on this price range?"

I'll go first, M7 MBA, recruited for investment banking only. Ended up with a handful of offers (split evenly between BB and EB). I was very surprised just how top heavy the recruiting was. It seems that it's pretty common that the top 35% or so got a ton of offers, and that it was much tougher after that (know a guy that went 0 for 12 on interviews). Most seemed to have gotten something, but definitely a lot of disappointment in terms of level of firm (people who thought they would end up GS/MS/JPM who are going to be at Citi/Barcap/CS instead type deal or even more drastic than that). Foreigners definitely struggled relative to the Americans, as well. 

Consulting recruiting I know is still going on, but from what i've heard it's been tough. The problem here is that the consulting firms actually take way less interns than they do full time hires. So there are a ton of people who want to do consulting, but probably only enough intern slots for 2/3rds of them. Will be more full time slots, though. 

How are other people faring?"

So, that's expected, and it's an obvious no-go for anything above entry level. But I also see the majority of entry-level stuff requiring exactly 1 year of experience. 

Is this just the result of HR, or is it trying to get some people with a little experience to enter a lower position? This is for like help desk stuff btw.

Anyway, wanted to get some feedback on a situation from last semester. 

Basically, this girl I know from school texted me one night asking for help using Excel for a class project. I’ve known her about a year, not that well though, I’d say we’re friendly acquaintances. I had mentioned once that I was basically an excel grunt at my internship over the summer, so she said she figured I’d be able to help. After some back and forth texting, she asks me to come to her dorm and help her. Wasn’t sure what to expect, but at this point in my life I’m not passing when a girl invites me to her dorm, regardless of the context.

So I go over and start by trying to explain how to do what she wants. Eventually though, I end up just doing the assignment for her (it was a marketing class, so it was legit adding a few columns in a spreadsheet and moving some stuff around, took 15 minutes).  Once it’s done, we talk a bit and get to flirting and after a bit we end up hooking up. I left an hour or two later.

I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing but then got to thinking. Did I play this right? I mean I basically sprinted over there as fast as I could when she asked me to and then proceeded to do her homework for her. Feeling a bit like maybe I got used. On the other hand, I did get some action, which was the goal after all. What should I do if this comes up again this semester (hasn’t started yet)?"

I myself am a full stack web programmer, but I know someone that I think has an aptitude for the UI/UX field.  He's done a Udemy course or two, but I was hoping there might be some good advice here on how to break into this field?  

If you were just starting out right now, how would you do it?  I think if he could start landing freelance style gigs that would be ideal since location might be an issue, but I'm sure he would be open to jobs or even internships if that's the best way to go and he had the opportunity.

What would he really need to know?  Who does he approach and what exactly does he offer?  While I'm sure UI is always a part of it, are there roles that are more purely UX?  That's what I think he would probably be best at.  And doesn't this area cross over into things like market research, focus groups/surveys, that kind of work?  I'm just trying to help him break out of bullshit entry level labor, so any insight you can give into the first steps of a user experience professional and the career options would be much appreciated."
5ocase,1,2017-01-16,Company wants to move interview after offer deadline for another.,cscqthrowaway69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ocase/company_wants_to_move_interview_after_offer/,"I'm currently late in the internship process with three companies.  Two startups (let's call them X and Y), and a big company (let's call it G).  

Last week, startup X moved to make an offer, which has a deadline at the end of this week.   Startup Y had invited me to do an onsite, and we were trying to schedule it when I learned about the offer.   Startup Y agreed to do the onsite early this week, but hadn't gotten back to me about the specifics.  Late last week, I also entered the project matching stage for BigCo G, which I understand can go quickly if you have deadlines.

This morning I heard back from startup Y, saying that because of travel expenses, they actually want to do the onsite next week (i.e. after my offer expires from startup X). 

My plan now is that I should tell startup Y that next week is fine, and then try to extend the deadline for startup X as much as possible (probably by 2 weeks from their original deadline).   I *think*, but am not sure, that I'd prefer to work at startup Y over startup X, and I'm also not sure where bigco G falls (depends on project).  So I definitely don't wanna blow the deadline with startup X, but I also feel a little uncomfortable with the standard advice (accept and renege later) because it could be someplace I want to work full-time even if I don't do it this summer.

My other question is if startup Y wanting to move the onsite to next week is a big red flag.  They've otherwise had one of the better interview/recruitment processes I've been in, but this does seem a little candidate-unfriendly."
5occ7k,16,2017-01-16,"Choose Paraguard because of my bipolar disorder, ended up loving it.",mymainismythrowaway1,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/5occ7k/choose_paraguard_because_of_my_bipolar_disorder/,"I love my Paraguard! I got it on Halloween at Planned Parenthood! TL;DR: it's the best thing ever.

I have bipolar 2 disorder, and take a lot of medication for it. The medication decreases efficacy of hormonal birth control and it's efficacy is decreased by hormonal bc. Also, I'm worried about mood effects of hormonal options. Therefore, my only very effective option was Paraguard. Also, I have hypomanic episodes where I am very impulsive and can be hypersexual. There is a possibility that I could decide to get pregnant on a whim and stop birth control, so I wanted something that's hard to stop and doesn't take any action to use.

I didn't want to go on the pill as I'm bad at taking pills at the same time. I take them twice a day within about a 4 hour range, every day, but that's not really good enough for the pill. I also didn't want hormones of any sort as they can effect doseing of medications and add another variable to my mood. I need effective birth control that takes no effort and is hard to stop for those hypomanic hypersexual moments. In addition, I'm on medication that can cause birth defects, am 18 and in no place to raise a child, and have decided to get an abortion if I'm pregnant(2.2% chance over 12 years) in the next few years. I've discussed this with my boyfriend and he is on board with my decision. 

I had never been to a gynecologist before my appointment, and had only ever had fingers, tampons, menstrual cups, a double ended dildo, and a ""small"" dildo from bad dragon in my vagina. I'm bisexual and was in my first sexual relationship with a guy. I also present rather butch and was nervous about going to the gyno. Turns out I had nothing to worry about. I made an appointment over the weekend, and had it either Monday or Tuesday.  

My boyfriend drove me there, we passed the protestors outside the gates (good ol' Virginia), we glared at them, we were buzzed in the first and second doors, the staff was very nice and handed me some forms from behind bulletproof glass. I handed them my insurance card and they scanned it. The forms were very LGBT friendly, asking sex, gender, and pronouns as separate boxes, and offering a few options for sexual orientation and sexual history. They buzzed me back, but did not let my boyfriend back for safety reasons (they don't want forced birth control and want to ask about abuse without extra people around). I was with a staff member without bulletproof glass for the first time at the center. They took my vitals and had me pee in a cup for a pregnancy test. They then sent me to the exam room and I saw stirrups for the first time in my life. I waited there for 10 - 15 minutes. 

Then a nurse practitioner and an intern walked in, wearing Halloween costumes. They gave me 800 mg ibuprofen, the first pain med I took that day. I was not on my period, and I don't remember where I was in my cycle. They asked me whether I knew about the side effects and I talked to them about heavier periods and cramping. They asked me about my sexual history and I said I'd never had intercourse, but had done other things. Then, they asked me why I chose Paraguard, I explained about the bipolar and hormones and the general advantages of LARC(long acting reversible contraception). They determined that I was low risk for STIs, due to my sexual history and lack of symptoms. Then they warned that my uterus might not be large enough and my cervix might not open, especially as an adolescent. They also said I could tell them to stop at any time during the procedure and they'd stop and we'd talk about other options. They asked whether I wanted to hear all the details or if I just wanted to play on my phone and distract myself. I'd read enough insertion stories to feel comfortable about what was going on, so I just went on my phone and browsed reddit. 

Then, they inserted the (extra large) speculum. It was the first speculum I'd ever seen, but it had nothing on my ""small"" bad dragon dildo. They put a little clamp on my cervix, which pinched a little, inserted the sounding thing, which felt super weird and hurt/pinched/cramped some, announced that my uterus was large enough for Paraguard (the largest IUD on the US market and the only non hormonal very effective birth control option) and that the worst was over. They then inserted the Paraguard and it hurt/pinched/cramped again, but not as badly this time. They cut the strings a little long. It was over in less than 3 minutes. The process was easy and not very painful, nothing like the horror stories I'd braced myself for. 

They gave me a little card that had the serial number, the Planned Parenthood phone number, the provider's name, and to come back in 2030 written on it. They told me to come back when I'm 21 for my first pap smear. I left and went to the bill person and I had no copay. 

I had cramping for the next 6 - 8 hours, perfectly manageable with advil. I got a little spotting for a few days, and they was it. I'd had amazing periods before, light, 4 days, maybe a half day of cramping, every 29 days. I'd used regular tampons and pads the whole time, even overnight, for years. My first period on Paraguard was still light, minimal cramping, but it lasted 7 days. My second period on Paraguard was heavier, I had to buy heavier tampons and overnight pads, but it only lasted 5 days and had no cramping. The periods are supposed to get shorter and lighter over the first six months to a year, but even if they don't, I'm fine with this.

The strings were about 2 inches long and stiff. My boyfriend complained about them attacking him, but we still had plenty of sex. I went to a private gyno to get the strings cut, the IUD checked, and to have my first gyno exam, in early January. Getting the strings cut took over ten minutes, and the NP had to leave the room multiple times to get more tools, but it didn't hurt at all. The IUD was in position. I was on my period at this appointment, and the gyno was unfazed. They also gave me a pregnancy test, which was funny. I was triple not pregnant: I have an IUD, was on my period, and passed a pregnancy test.

I'm really glad I was able to get the copper IUD, as it is the only non hormonal option that doesn't require action every time you have sex. It's a great benefit for hypomania, as I can't decide to get pregnant on a whim, and if I did get it removed, my partner would know and be able to talk me down, convince me to get EC, and pull out. 

 Sorry for the length, I just love my Paraguard so much and want other women to be aware that's it's not always a bloody nightmare."

5oce1c,1,2017-01-16,"I [26 M] with my gf [26 F] of three years (LDR) - I am going through a crisis, while she focuses only on her life.",roastedbacooon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5oce1c/i_26_m_with_my_gf_26_f_of_three_years_ldr_i_am/,"Hi there, 

I don't really know how to begin this. I am actually writing this close to tears (and I am actually that kind of guy with a thick skin). I feel so confused, unhappy and unsatisfied in every aspect of my life. Today I had one of these moments were I wished I could erase my memory completely and start as somebody else.

Maybe I should give a little details. 

We are dating now more than three years and living in a ldr for approximately 2.5 years. We both live in different countries in Europe. So seeing each other shouldn't bet that difficult, right? Well, 2016 has been hell for me. After graduating I immediately got a job-offer and work there ever since - it's been more than stressful and it still is. As my gf just started graduate school back then, I supported her in every aspect I could. Times been rough. 

I'll try to sum it up: 

I've been under a lot of stress, she decided to go abroad for an internship for eight months in Japan,  I visited her (wasn't really cheap with my current salary) and usually stayed up late at night or woke up really early in the morning to video call her when I was in my home country (didn't really work out because she either forgot or suddenly had plans with friends or was just too tired). 
She came back, continued grad school, focuses on all her projects there, goes on trips abroad with friends and family (she never asked me to join) or student organisations. When we see each other it's usually just for 4-5 days maybe every second months. She just decided to go with her sister to Brazil for a month and will be in South Africa for two months in the summer. 

OK, this might sound like complaining about first world problems. But actually it's been really tough for me to always agree with her schedule. I didn't really have a vacation last year where I could really rest actually (and health wise I have to pay the price for that right now - your body can be right ungrateful when you work all the time and constantly have stress). I spent every single day of my vacation in order to see her and occasionally payed for her flight tickets, while she always has other plans. A couple of months ago I raised this issue and she said that she could understand and she promised to make more time for me. But I currently don't feel any change (it's the opposite tbh). 

As mentioned in the title, I am going through a crisis atm. Work has been great, even though it's been more than stressful. I was promised an excellent permanent contract. But yeah things didn't really work out and for now I have to deal with an extension for another year even though I only received positive feedback from the C-level guys. Also speaking of health issues: I currently get checked for a brain tumor (another thing that causes sleepless nights) since I am dealing with strong headaches for over six months now. She barely asks questions on how work is going and such. And even less questions about my health. 

I feel like everything in her life is so much more important then what I do for her or what I am going through. She promised to look for an internship in my city so we could move in together in the summer. I asked her so many times to send me her résumé, since she wants to do an internship in the field I am currently working in. She never sent it to me and I stopped asking for it last month, because my own problems gained the upper hand. And it could be so easy actually if she only let me help her. 

I don't know...Maybe I just need a reality check. But I just feel so exhausted. I can't continue with all this anymore. But I know somehow that I still love her. I just feel so unappreciated for a couple of months now. 

I just want to know: Are my feelings justified or am I overreacting? Have you ever been in such situation and if so, how did you deal with it?

Thanks a lot in advance.

TL;DR: having a lot of stuff on my plate, gf only focuses on her stuff even though she promised to change, barely asks questions on when we see again, never makes plans with me but only for others, feeling as unhappy as never before in my life currently, don't know how to continue or how to tackle the issue.

I've applied to many new-grad positions but I know I am much more qualified for an internship rather than a permanent full-time.  Due to interns not being as experienced, it would also put me towards the higher-qualified end of applicants rather than the mid/less-qualified applicants for full-time.

I can't tell if I don't see this more often in this forum because the users of /cscq are very intense works and want the best job (new-grad vs. intern) or if it is actually not common to have a fresh grad as an intern."

Even though I've taken some higher level math courses (going into my senior year now), I'm worrying that I simply don't have any desirable skills. I was hoping I'd find an internship or two that would actually teach me real-world skills, but all of them seem to want you to have those skills already.

None of my higher level math classes so far taught me MATLAB, so I figured I'd start by self-teaching that, and I've taken Intro to Programming (using C), but I simply suck at coding, and I'm not sure if that's the path I'd want to take career-wise.

I've been looking at all sorts of internships, from big data analysis to finance, and absolutely no one mentions math as a skill or as a major... I'm so panicked that I'm seriously considering changing my major and spending another year or two in school... because I don't know what I can do with a simple math degree now.

Please help :(

Thanks"

5oe7qf,1,2017-01-16,22[F] How do I handle being bullied as an adult at work?,CreativeVisionaryKid,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/5oe7qf/22f_how_do_i_handle_being_bullied_as_an_adult_at/,"I'm an intern at a recording studio. The management and owner make the environment super youthful. As an intern you get the grunt work but generallly, people don't treat you like shit. So everyone is cool, and we are all friends, there is a family vibe between all of the staff.

There's an intern who treats me like I'm less than basically. Like I don't matter and no one likes me. I think that's his perception of me, I'm assuming it because of the way he treats me and talks to me. I don't know what his deal is, I'm nice to everyone.

The thing is, I'm the type of person that ends up getting bullied quite a bit. I have been getting bullied since I was a little kid.

The thing is, it doesn't really hurt my feelings like it did when I was younger. My issue is not knowing how to handle it. I don't want to be outwardly upset, because the way he treats me is his problem, not mine. So how do I just treat him like nothing is happening. Like no one would even know that there was a problem coming from my end if he tried to bully me in front of other people (which he has).

I'm also not sure if I should let management know. I don't want to seem like I'm telling on him, but I just want it to be on record in case it escalates and I'm in a seriously bad situation where I'm perceived as being in the wrong, or the both of us are.

This happened with my roommate last semester. She constantly harassed me over the use of the bathroom, to the point where my other roommates noticed. None of us liked her, she was really obnoxious. We ended up getting into a fight and I ended up getting in trouble for it. I regretted not talking to my RA about it ahead of time. It could have ended differently.

So now, I'm in a new situation, with a new bully, something that isn't new to me though. I don't know if I should tell my manager or not. And I don't know what to even say if I do decide to tell her.

I almost ended up getting fired one time. My manager called me into her office and told me she had to let me go. I just broke down crying because it was so unexpected and this is like the one thing in my life that is going great for me. I begged her not to fire me and I couldn't stop crying. She ended up speaking to the owner and he let me stay. I guess they saw how passionate I was about music. The reason I almost got fired is because I opened the door to the roof and I wasn't supposed to. If the door gets opened, the police have to come check if someone went on the roof. I cost the studio $500 because of this. I had no idea I wasn't supposed to open the door.

I say this to say, if she saw me crying on the floor, then it may be seen as a red flag for me to mention the situation I am in with the other intern. I really just want to have it on record in case something happens, due to circumstances out of my control. Due to the other interns actions.

The final question I have is, how can I not care about it! A lot of people in this situation wouldn't even care, they would treat him like they treat everyone or just not be fazed at all.

Help me out fellow redditors.

PS: Adult bullying is a thing and if you think it's not, let's just focus on the questions I'm asking, or refrain from answering. No offense but I want this to be a productive post for myself and for others in the same situation. Thank you!

EDIT: I wouldn't want him to know I told management. I don't want anyone to know accept my manager. Saying it behind his back is not a problem, id rather him not know because then it would become a bigger issue. I don't want my manager to do anything about it right now, I just want it to be noted."

Im a third year electrical engineering student.  I had an interview about a week ago.  For being a student who's only had three interviews it went well.  I was nervous but that went away quickly.  I really like what they do and it's exactly what I want to get into (automation) but the company only has 4 people, including the president.  They told me they really want to grow and expand the company, and want to know if I am interested in coming back after I graduate.  They also said they don't want to train someone for four months and have them leave.  I understand this, and I don't want to take the internship if I'm not serious about coming back...but I'm concerned about the future if I do this.  I want to make sure I'm well compensated and I get benefits...which they may not be able to support.

I do think I would be able to do a lot of good work with this company.  I think I would be able to help them on their projects and help them get more clients and hire more people...but it's a risky road.

So I'm looking for people who can give me some advice.  I'm young and inexperienced and don't want to make a wrong choice.

Also, what would be a good scenario that happens if I go there after I graduate?  And what would be a bad one."

Here's how I see it.

GPA and test scores are the most important, but their more of a qualifier. High scores and GPA can keep you in consideration and low scores/GPA can sorta keep you out. Most applicants probably fall within the 25th to 75th percentile range.

ECs are important, but the vast majority are probably similarly solid (interns, lots of volunteering, involved with clubs, competitions, leadership positions, etc.). Then, with exceptions for people that did something like start a major company or something, we move on to essays.

The way I see it, for most applicants, essays are make or break time. This is where the many, many top GPA/test score and very solid, but not astonishingly amazing ECs type students get to sell themselves.

Basically, most of the time do essays end up as the major decider?

Is this accurate? I'm not the most knowledgeable so I'm not really sure.

Thanks!"

I wasn't sober for that, but you know, whatever. I went to college. I stayed in college. It took a large percentage of my lifespan to finish college. I wasn't sober for most of that either, but I did it. I worked hard, I had nine million part time jobs, and I got pregnant. It was hard, I cried a lot, I stared at him crying in his crib for hours sometimes because I didn't think I could do it, but somehow I did. I graduated with honors, I was actually sober for that. My mom passed away just before I graduated, so my son watched me from the audience as I walked the stage and bawled because it was so hard and so bittersweet because I did it for my mom, but I finally did it. I put my son into private school while I worked soul sucking entry level post-bachelor's jobs that made me suck down xanax like tic-tacs and cry behind my closed office door every lunch break. It was hard, but I managed. For a while. Now, here I am hitting another bump in the road that I know will pass but I just want to throw my hands up in the air, climb into a blanket burrito with some xanax and netflix and never come out. My anxiety is so bad these days, I have several attacks a week with no insurance to help me see a doctor because my current employer, which was supposed to be a stepping stone, does not offer insurance, or a livable wage, or consideration, or respect. Basically, nothing that makes a job even remotely tolerable.

When I applied for this position, after leaving the soul sucking suckdom of social services, I made it very clear that I have a small school age child and no family or friends to assist me with his care. I told them the rotating shifts I could work during the weekdays, and what I could work on the weekends. I volunteered for holidays, extra shifts, and doubles to make up for the obvious lack of total flexibility. They agreed, they hired me, they scheduled me appropriately. Until I said something. I mentioned a conflict with a co-worker that I could not remedy without mediation. I feel like this particular co-worker is blatantly sexist. It made me uncomfortable. I felt beat down by this person, and was not heard by them. Literally. Some toddler level, arm crossing, huffing in the corner until they got their way not listening. They accused me of being the problem and proceeded to schedule me for shifts that I can not work. When I pointed it out the first time, they apologized and remedied the situation. The second time, I somehow took the blame. The third time, this time, and I'm just being unreasonable. Please, tell me in what world it is legal to leave a seven year old at home alone from 3am, when my dad goes to work, until 8-9am when I get off that god forsaken shift. For an added sprinkle of fun, he has to be at school before 8am, and they're truancy compliant with the city so they will call law enforcement to fine, or lovingly jail me for failure to send my child to school at all, or on time. Then, for fun, let's just get him kicked out of the ridiculously overpriced posh school that I'll still have to pay for despite him not being able to take full advantage of the program he is finally excelling in.

So, basically, I told them I would not be going to work tonight, a school night, three days ago but they did not listen and now I am 99.99% certain I will not have a job by 9am and that will cut off my access to an open internship to actually begin using my degree for something productive and helpful.

All the while, as I'm sitting in my blanket burrito under the TV writing this, my son is in the background rubbing balloons together to make that sweet screeching sound oblivious to everything, offering me literal pennies to pay bills, and all I want to do is tie him to the bookshelf and have a glass of wine. But I can't do that, so I'll just have to endure the screeching, and the rising panic, and stare longingly at the bottle of Jager I rarely reach for because in about ten minutes Mommy has to get her ass back up, cook dinner, clean the house, and start the bedtime ritual because it's not his fault mom feels like a total loser today."
5oewi5,3,2017-01-16,[M4F] Now Hiring: Director of Research and Development,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5oewi5/m4f_now_hiring_director_of_research_and/,"Prepare for the wall of text necessary to introduce the Facility for Human Genetics and Fertility Research! The fun part about this setup is it lets you create your character without breaking play, and has all the options you could ever want. So, first comes my original prompt, which also contains the original promotional material.

Short Note: Read from the top down. The lower sections contain information you'll only be interested in if you like the previous stuff. If you would like to make suggestions or ask question before diving all the way in, please do! I understand that you would want to get a handle on this before committing!

Also, this is *not* a hucow prompt. It's all about genetic research and selective breeding. Women will be treated as human beings and willing test subjects, but this world does have... *relaxed* views on sexuality. Chalk it up to a near-apocalypse that drastically reduced the human population to the point things just barely got back to normal, and now it's seen as an honor to be selected for advanced breeding. Pregnancy and fertility are desirable traits in this world, so keep that in mind.

Ideally, I would prefer my partner to be the head of Research and Development and the Facility. Your job would be to design, monitor, and administer fertility treatments and gene therapy. However, this job description is up for negotiation, considering the Facility is always open to new research. As the Director of Operations, I expect you to focus on your work at first, but you could convince me to let you engage in deeper, crazier research or eventually use yourself as a test subject or breeder. Really, anything is up for grabs.

I don't mind first or third person, but I do prefer to write in paragraph or longer segments. Sorry, but text speak will not be tolerated. Grammatical or spelling errors will be cheerfully tolerated, because no one is a good editor when excited. I am looking for a writing partner, so be prepared to write a paragraph of at least five to seven complex, detailed sentences. Describe what you feel, what you do, and what you think as well as what is going on around you. The more you give me, the more I can give back.

One or two sentence replies a la ""I fucked it."" will not be tolerated. If you're looking for a quick, superficial exchange, then I am not your man. No offense, but I prefer a really good, involved story, preferably with some stupid humor mixed in.

Kinks: Breeding (no shit...), dubious and full consent, bondage, humor, bodywriting, cumplay, and a whole slew of other things made apparent later

Maybes: Futa (it would be interesting to have a subject that can both impregnate and be impregnated), military (maybe we can explore a top-secret genetics project), bestiality (combine the conventional farm with the unconventional, add some science, and I might be convinced to see where it goes), furry (maybe we go absolutely crazy with genetic research) 

Limits: Non-con (okay, I could be convinced to do a really good non-con plot, but it's gotta be good), bimbo (we want good genetics), violence, blood, toilet play

Sitting behind my wide mahogany desk, my corporate email for the Facility's directorship pings a notification that a profile had just come in from our latest recruitment effort. The Facility recently got in contact with fertility clinics and private practice doctors to offer our services to an expanded clientele base. Considering the participants in our can only be impregnated once every twelve months or so, much of our insemination equipment was sitting idle. We decided to offer the equipment to those seeking sperm donors, allowing them to pay for our services and keep the child. We also started a Bring Your Own Sperm program for couples having difficulty conceiving or just looking for a way to liven up their babymaking.

Clicking open the application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting cows strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure you should do this the right way. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

We are very excited to hear about your interest in continuing your research with us, and the Facility would love to support your ambitions for innovation! All we need is some basic information to finish your application, and we can get you on your way!*

(Or insert some other office to which you are replying. Hell, maybe you got this by accident and are contacting Customer Services, which totally isn't what you think it is. Get it? Services? HAHAHAHAHA... ah, fuck me...)

DEPARTMENT APPLIED TO: (enter the project to which you applied. Feel free to make something up if it's extra sexy to you! Hell, we could make a Reproductive Pleasure department, if that's what you want.)

PROJECT APPLIED TO: (Get very, very creative with this. The more thought you put into this, the better the roleplay.)

REASON APPLIED: (Get creative! The more you write, the more I can incorporate down the road!)

EXPECTED SALARY:

NAME:

AGE:

SEXUALITY:

EYE/HAIR COLOR:

HEIGHT/WEIGHT:

MEASUREMENTS:

UNIQUE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES: (Feel free to add interesting physical quirks that might make yourself more attractive to a genetics project!)

PREGNANCY STATUS: *If ""Yes,"" please fill out attached Father Verification Form. If ""No,"" please have fertility status verified by a certified doctor or with the included approved instrument.*
FERTILITY STATUS: *Percentage displayed on the instrument will be most accurate during or immediately following an orgasm. The instrument can accommodate this necessity.*

CURRENT MEDICATION: *Please include any and all medication, including birth control.*

RECENT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS: (Get creative!)

JOB EXPERIENCE: (Again, creativity will be rewarded!)  *Please include any majors, minors, concentrations, and advanced degrees.*

PROPOSED AREA OF RESEARCH: 

INTERESTS: *Let the Farm know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Farm should know, please use the provided space.*

GOLDEN GENESE PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Facility is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Put on the headband and collar, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash and a guided tour of the Preggoridge Farms facilities.*

*A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable gene carrier that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, and a private interview with the Director himself! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required.* (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little breeder, but tell me how you made it! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)

Okay, if you haven't noticed, I write a lot. I love detail. Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, chiasmata... These things are all my friends. I do not expect you to be able to fully match the way I write. Humble brag, but I hold awards for my SFW writing. If you can match or exceed me... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! If you want me to help you improve your writing while having some sexy fun... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! Just please, please make the effort!

So, in regards to how I want you to start, fill out the form and send it in. I will judge our compatibility based on the scene you write about flipping through the promotional materials and reacting to their contents.

Maybe you really like the technical documents displaying women becoming mothers from the machines whirring between their legs. Maybe the pictures from Live Audition with new, young test subjects caught the moment they feel their first child squirting into their wombs. Maybe you really like the diagrams of the combination breeding/milking racks, showing warm white fluid entering a woman between her legs and leaving from her chest. I don't know, so you gotta tell me. Dig through that recruitment package and find the things that make you excited! There's a reason we send out these packages!

For example, maybe you were watching ""Eighteen and Pregnant"" when the recruitment package arrived. Firing up the probe, you affix a ""For Hire"" sticker over your lower stomach and a ""Wide Loads Welcome"" to your inner thigh. Bending your back over your couch, you arch your breasts into the air, displaying the flat stomach you were applying, no begging, to have ruined. The bright stickers flash as the probe burrows into your folds. You writhe, imagining the warm metal spewing the thick, life-giving fluid into you that you could never convince a man to give up. It feels almost as good as you imagine it will when you win the Grand Prize, placed on a pedestal upon which motherhood will be pumped into you. Your walls clamp down hard as an orgasm rocks your body. The probe lights up, displaying a disturbingly high percentage, your womb sucking eagerly at the tip of the probe. That's when the camera clicks, catching your body in its full, hungry glory. Looks like we got ourselves a winner... (This was an example. Write your own!)

I wrote that part in because it's so much easier to bring someone in as the Grand Prize winner, and also a lot more fun. It lets me be excited to meet you, and not just ""Oh, boy... Another womb..."" So, give it a shot? The form is meant to be an exposition of what you want from the roleplay, and that part was good, but you gotta give me more to work with if you want the really good stuff.

I am not sure yet where my *specific* interest lies, but I know I don’t want a path that has to do **a lot** with programming (although, I don’t mind small/mild doses of it).



 I have done a lot of reading about this major, but I am still a little confused and prefer to see opinions and advice from other MIS majors and grads. Sorry for all the basic questions, but if you could help me, it would be much appreciated.


Thanks in advance.



*  What classes/skills/courses did you find to be the most useful for your career? Do you recommend taking any additional courses for skills that may come in handy after graduating?



*  What programming language(s) do you find or believe, is the most useful with your prospective or current career path?



* When is the best time to start interning? I heard a lot of people do that during their junior year, but I am not sure. What are some common internships available for someone majoring in MIS? (What type of jobs do you do)?





*  I’ve learned and noticed that this major is business and technology related (more emphasis on business, I believe). Are there certain career paths that lean more towards business or technology, or are all possible career paths for this major tend to be an even balance of both sides?




*  Also, Minors - does it matter a lot what it’s in? What should one Minor in?"

 Spring semester is about to start tomorrow at my community college and I'm continuing my database management program. I'm full-time, taking 15 credit hours with a mix of SQL classes, a software development class and a biology class (general education). I work as a cashier in a retail store on the weekends, and during the week I work in the college in the computer lab. However, due to a couple of evening classes and a weird schedule  I've been getting short on hours with both jobs. I want to make some extra money on the side whenever I'm not busy, so I was wondering if I should pursue any freelance work or if I should look into internships? 

I know with the internship, it will most likely be non-paid, but it would develop my skills and perhaps a potential job. Also, I've heard of nightmares of freelance work, such as clients that don't pay or lack of communication. What I would like is something where I can practice what I'm learning in my classes and develop into the real world, but also I would like to earn some money while doing so. "

I have not had a whole lot of experience with GUI (none before now actually) and have been learning Tkinter. I just need a couple questions answered asap, I believe they are all fairly easy but I wasn't sure of what I was reading online.

Q1: If I have an entry field, I can store the input to a string variable. Does this require me to write something like

import Tkinter as tk

name = tk.entry 

and is it constantly updating?
Furthermore, what I need is for the user to input a bunch of information, and then to have a button that says ""Calculate"". Let's say the function object that has all of my main code in it is called 'maincode'. I would just have the calculate button run that command when clicked. Would I be able to put a line of code like

theinputineed = name

into 'maincode' in order to call the information? Normally for function objects you have to list arguments, but I'm not sure how to do that when using a button to run the function. Would it be something like

command = maincode(argument 0, argument 1, argument 2, etc...) ?

Finally, how can I get 'maincode' to print to a textbox on the GUI? I've only ever really printed stuff to the IDE and using matplotlib, so I'm not sure what commands to use. I'm looking for something like

print output[:,:] to tk.textbox

or something. 
Actually, one last thing. I know how to save to documents, but it would be nice to have a ""Save As"" button that allows you to save to any particular destination that you like. If someone could help me there as well, that would be great.

Sorry for all the nooby questions, I tried looking for this but I would like an actual person to clarify things for me. Thanks in advance!

5ofbqn,16,2017-01-16,Advice on applying to internships?,Hebejeebez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ofbqn/advice_on_applying_to_internships/,"I'm currently in my second year of a CS degree, and am looking into applying for summer internships (I know, it's getting a little late). My main issue is that I don't know where to apply or what to expect, and I feel incompetent in comparison to many of my peers.

I only have 2 projects up on my Github, one of which was a winner of a hackathon but still...other people I know have 10+ personal projects. I'd love to have more, but between school and work I can never find enough time to put hours of work into a side project.

The only language that I'm ""fluent"" in is Java, and even then all I know is up through data structures. I know about a similar amount of C, and I've had practice with HTML, CSS, Python, JS, and PHP. I've worked with linux, the command line, have taken probability and theory CS courses, and am very good at math. I've gotten either A's or B's in all of my CS classes so far. I don't really have any experience working with databases or JS frameworks or many other things I hope to learn...but doubt I could learn proficiently before applying in time.

Basically, I just feel like I don't know enough, and any potential employer for an internship will see right through my exaggerated resume. I mean, half the time google does more work than I do when coding. I don't plan on trying to intern at any huge company like Google or FB, but I'm afraid that I won't even get any offers for an internship at a small company. I mean, half the companies list ""full-stack developer"" as a requirement, which I wouldn't call myself. What types of companies/positions should I apply for? Do you think I have any shot at getting an internship for this summer or should I just wait and hope that next year I'll have more tools under my belt? I'm scared that it will just be denial after denial and a waste of time.... Any help/suggestions of companies or positions or really any advice at all is greatly appreciated. Sorry this is so long. Also, I'm in Western MA if that's any help.

TL;DR: Feeling incompetent, not enough programming knowledge as my peers, very few personal projects/achievements. Do I even bother for an internship for this summer?"

The position is for a software engineer intern if that makes any difference.


&gt;**What is your favorite course in your school and why?**

Advanced programming principles. It showed me the power of C++ outside the basic things such as loops. Learning about inheritance, polymorphism, classes, exceptions, and constructors/destructors made me a much more versatile programmer as it gave me more tools to solve problems. 

This semester, I’m excited to take a course on databases as well as a course on data structures and algorithms. 

&gt;**What do you think of team work, can you tell me about a team project, and what your responsibility was on the project** 

Numerous assignments in my computer science classes encouraged us to work in teams specifically to receive benefits that don’t come from working by yourself. Not only does delegating tasks help finish projects in a timely manner, being able to bounce ideas off other members has proven to be invaluable.


Most recently, a classmate and I wrote a vending machine program. This 700 line long project was the longest of the semester and would have been much harder to complete on my own. After we designed the basic construct of how the program should work, we broke the project up into two sections: internal inventory/vending and the cash register. My responsibilities were to ensure the machine gave the most optimal amount of change and kept a total amount of money in the register. This was done using inheritance, objects, and vectors.

Debugging together allowed us to get two different perspectives and identify the source of logic/runtime errors quickly.

Overall, I enjoy team work. Working with others who are passionate about a project gives me the motivation to continue putting in my best effort. 

&gt;**Why do you want to work here**

$company caught my eye when I was at a conference for software developers. After the conference, I looked up $company and was thoroughly impressed with numerous accolades that come with being a tech staple in $city for over 25 years. I hope interning here will allow me to grow as a developer by working closely with engineers in the industry.

After I received the email I took a shower and cried my eyes out, I don't even remember the last time I cried. 

I don't know why I tried so hard in college to maintain a 3.5 gpa in a STEM field, or why I took on several leadership roles in clubs, or why I took on not one, but two very relevant internships in the industry, fuck, I even graduated with special honors from my college, but does any of it matter?

This will be a long post but I'd appreciate further insight. I have asked this place for help before and I have learned a lot of interesting things in the past as well from other posts. I have a bachelors degree in a completely unrelated field (History) 

Rutgers has the two 10 week programs in either the fall or winter which is great to work around the season. I applied, sent in my letter of intent and had 2 employers send in a letter of recommendation. Just waiting to here back from them. However, I am from the Midwest so housing and other expenses like transportation there and getting to class daily is a big concern for me. It will easily cost me over for the two week session. More if I can't find a roommate at least $7,000 more. 

I was with another superintendent to study for the Illinois Pesticide tests and I told him about really wanting to further my career. Told him about my 10 week certificate from Ohio State online and he was surprised that I already had a 10 week certificate after this past year was my first full year in the industry. I mentioned to him about Rutgers and he also mentioned Penn State. That's where I'm beginning to reassess my decision in going to Rutgers. After some research the following options are from Penn State:

http://plantscience.psu.edu/majors/online

The online degree/certificate options are plentiful. They are online and they cost about 600 dollars per credit hour.
-Turfgrass certificate 15 credit hours run me about $9,000
-Turfgrass advance certificate 30 credit hours would be me about $18,000.
-Associate degree in turfgrass- Looking at 61 credit hours at just under 600 dollar a credit. Is this degree really that much better then Rutgers 2 year turf program which I'm sure acts just like a 2 year degree. It's convenient that I don't leave my house, but it will run my $30,000. Rutgers I predicted would run be at least 18,000 if I get a roommate for housing but not including transportation/food/entertainment fees.
-bachelors degree in turfgrass- I wouldn't persue this because I already have a 4 year degree.
-Masters in turfgrass- Maybe later on? But I doubt it

Ohio State- I have a certificate that was 600 dollars. It was an online certificate that lasted 10 weeks called ""golf course management"" I completed the class in less than a week with an 85% overall grade. I don't remember much, just the different types of grass and some cold/warm weather decision making on golf courses. Don't remember the names of many insects/disease patches. I do realize that you will learn mostly on the job (which I am.) However, I know most jobs require a 2-4 year degree.Ohio State also offers another 10 week online certificate called ""advance golf course management"" for 600 bucks. I was told the 2 year Rutgers program will essentially give me a leg up against other people even thought it's just a certificate because it's not in semester form. I assume Ohio state would be similar? Completing two ten week online programs could land me a job that requires a 2-4 year turf degree? At literally less than 5% of the cost Rutgers would cost me I could just get a second 10 week program online?

It's worth noting that I will be working as an assistant superintendent or superintendent on public courses for a company I work for currently. I'm working on getting hired full time, year round as either a foreman or assistant in 2018. I work for a public company that I know is really bad for superintendents in terms of budgeting for labor and just overall costs of running a golf course. However, if I stay here for at least 5 years before moving onto private/country clubs where bigger responsibilities means more money and what not I think this experience would be good on a resume and perhaps put me past for people applying to private clubs with no real experience other than summer interns.

At the end of the day my main options are:
Rutgers 2 year certificate which I heard a lot of good things from. Penn States 2 year associates, which is going to be expensive but all online (saved money on transportation/housing + more convenient for me.) Or finish Ohio States second 10 week program that I will most likely finish in a week for 600 bucks. I will then have two 10 week certificates from Ohio State and I then would apply for assistant superintendent jobs and foreman jobs within my company for the 2018 golf season. As by 2018 golf season I'll have 2 full years of experience as well as a couple months from a few years back (all under the company) The experience at the public courses I will work at might help me get a job at a bigger course because of my experience working with a smaller crew + lower budget.

Can anyone give me their own suggestion on what they would do? Also, I think I have the right idea. I won't have to do any summer interns if I just get an assistant job at a course will low budget and perform well and what not. At least that's my view point. Any help/pointers/tips is much appreciated and I'll respond to anyone else that replies in PM and on the topic."

**Julian Green ist auch knapp zwei Wochen vor dem Start in die Rückrunde mit dem sicherlich nicht einfachen Auswärtsspiel beim FC St. Pauli der einzige Neuzugang des VfB Stuttgart, was freilich nicht so bleiben muss.** Vielmehr halten die Schwaben intensiv Ausschau nach weiteren Verstärkungen, wie Sportvorstand Jan Schindelmeiser gegenüber den [Stuttgarter Nachrichten](http://ift.tt/2hML2Py) durchblicken ließ.

Wir prüfen einige Optionen ganz genau. (Jan Schindelmeiser)

_„Auch wenn es nach außen hin ruhig aussieht in Sachen Neuzugänge können sie mir glauben, dass dies intern nicht der Fall ist und wir einige Optionen ganz genau prüfen“_, so Schindelmeiser, der gemeinsam mit Trainer Hannes Wolf wohl vor allem nach einem zentralen Mittelfeldspieler fahndet.

### Trainerwechsel in Palermo?

Und möglicherweise wird der VfB auch noch einen neuen Innenverteidiger verpflichten, wenn der im Raum stehende Wechsel von [Toni Sunjic zu US Palermo](http://ift.tt/2iGLbTq) wie geplant über die Bühne geht. Beide Vereine haben sich schon auf die Eckdaten einer Ausleihe (200.000 Euro Leihgebühr plus Kaufoption über 1,7 Millionen Euro) geeinigt und auch Sunjic selbst ist mit Palermo einig, doch weil beim Tabellenachtzehnten der Serie A, der schon acht Punkte Rückstand ans rettende Ufer aufweist und der bekannt ist für seinen Trainerverschleiß, Coach Eugenio Corini wackelt, sind Transfers wohl erst einmal hinten angestellt.

**Sowohl Sunjic als auch der VfB müssen somit warten und mit dem Risiko leben, dass das Leihgeschäft doch noch platzt. In diesem Fall hätte sich wohl auch die Suche nach einem neuen Innenverteidiger erledigt.**

Schafft der VfB den direkten Wiederaufstieg? [Jetzt wetten!](http://ift.tt/2jT7Ytd)

-CLICK-

A brown haired, slightly overweight man sits on the couch in dirty t-shirt and boxers.  He tosses the remote onto the makeshift milk crate and 2x4 table in front of him.  He sinks into the old, ripped couch and blows the white streak in his hair out of his eyes.  It's been a somber weekend after hearing the news and it sinks in more today.  ""Shit, bro.  Fuck.  Man, I can't believe it.  You had your shit together, you got an awesome party.  And even THE magical sword.  Should have had that motherfucker's ass in a sling after that attack.""

""I know, Bach.  I thought I had that bitch.  Jackass had one nasty trick up his sleeve.""

""Well, what the fuck would have been that powerful to take you down-""

Bach pauses, finally noticing the ethereal, echoing voice next to him.  His head slowly pivots to the ghostly figure lounging on the other half of the couch.  Bach's blue eyes widen as his pupils almost slam shut from narrowing so quickly.  The shriek of ""manly"" terror achieves an octave short of shattering the nearby glassware.  Bach backpedals hard out from the couch, launching himself a meter away before hitting the floor.  He continues the backpedal slide through the carpet littered with takeout boxes, dirty laundry, video games, ""entertainment"" books, and empty cans of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

""AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!-""

The ghostly figure rockets from the couch into the air, oddly holding his hands to his ethereal ears.  He zooms to within mere centimeters of Bach's face.  ""FUCKING SHUT UP!""

"" ... ""

The figure removes his hands from ears.  ""By the gods, I've forgotten how loud your shrieking is!""

""S-s-s-sebastian?!""

""Yes.""

Bach quietly blinks with horror bubbling into his face.  ""Oh gods! You've come to haunt me!  All those times I got revenge against you-  You're going to make me pay now!""

""No!  Calm down, brother!  I'm not here to haunt you.""

""Okay.""

""Well, not exactly.""

""Okay...""

Sebastian rights his ghostly form in front of Bach, as he regains his footing and stands up.
""Long story short.  I died, but I'm not dead.""

""No shit.""

""Stop being a smart ass.""

Bach takes a rickety seat in the small combo kitchen/dining area.  ""Fine.""

""The Sword was able to capture the magical energy around the area.  It captured my spirit as it left my body and was able to recover most of my body and store it within.  Bad news.  I'm bound to the sword.""

""Good news?""

""I can be brought back with a substantial amount of magical energy infused into the sword.""

Bach sits up straight for a moment, lost in thought.  ""I see.  With enough energy the sword could restore your body whole, rebind your spirit to it, and then bring you back.  Like one of the old school resurrection spells.""

Sebastian with a grin on his transparent face.  ""EXACTLY!  It's good to know those years in adventuring school weren't wasted!""

Bach grimaces.  ""Dammit, man, don't bring that up.  I know all the shit.  Just never cared for the whole risk your life every day thing.""

""Well, that's why I'm here!  I know you know all this stuff!  And you can help me out...  Right?""

An awkward silence hovers between the two.  Sebastian hovers closer to Bach, as he leans over to his fridge, pulling out a cola.  He uses one of the cabinet handles to pop the cap off.  Bach sighs at his brother.  ""Ah fuck it!  I'll try it for you!""

Sebastian's ethereal form momentarily brightens.  ""YES!  I knew it!""

Bach sets up a swig from his drink.  ""Okay.  So, where are we going to get this ancient power source of magic to charge the sword up?  Ancient ruins?  Magical rift?  Old magi focal points?  There's a few things out there, but it'll be a hunt to find one substantial enough.""

""Lord Noxian's Heart.""

Bach eyes spring open as he swallows almost half the bottle of cola in one, painful gulp.  He struggles to swallow it down, tears welling, and finally gasping for breath.  ""NOXIAN'S HEART?!""

""Yes, and you must be the one to plunge the sword through it.""

""ME?!""

""You're my twin!""

""Fraternal twin!  The sword knows that, right?!  You did tell it that?!""

""As long as we share enough chromosomes, it'll work!""

""DUDE! Lord Noxian almost wiped you clean from existence!  And you want ME to try that?!""

Bach leans in to glare at his brother.  His brother returns the favor and the two stare each other down.  
""Listen, we don't know where Lord Noxian is and his power is weak.  He won't be trying anything soon.  Plenty of time to get YOU into fighting shape again.""

""You do realize, I was never really in a fighting shape.""

""Well, I guess we ALL are going to work extra hard to get you there, whether you like it or not.""

""We ALL?""

A door bell rings out throughout the small house.  Bach scans around for the source of the sound.  ""I have a door bell?""

Sebastian shifts partially into the kitchen island with a sly smirk.  ""Well, they're here. My party.""

Bach expression melts into one of nervous dread.  ""All them?! The Half-Emin, Grath, Fvalian, and that Evuukian?!""

Sebastian with an evil ear to ear grin.  ""Yes. All of them, ESPECIALLY the Evuukian want me back among the living.""

"" ... ""

"" ... ""

"" ... ""

""What?""

""You and the Evuukian?""

Sebastian puffs his chest confidently with a sly smirk. ""Yes.""

Bach laughs and shakes his head.  ""Holy shit!  I thought their whole cultural bias thing would never allow it.""

""Well, officially.  Could you answer the door?  I don't want to keep them waiting.""

Bach walks over to the door, taking a moment to realize the state of dress he's in.  He musters a bit of courage and carefully cracks the door open.  ""Oh hey! Everyone!""

The Half-Emin, Grath, Fvalian, and that Evuukian are all standing at the door step to Bach's small house in the small outskirt town.  They don't have the most amused expressions on their faces, except the Fvalian.  She gives a greeting smile, with her sharp teeth.
""If you give me a few minutes, I'll get ready and come on out. I wasn't expecting to travel so soon.""

The large, muscular Grath woman grumbles in a low tone.  ""Hurry. Up.""

Bach nervously grins shifting towards a grit as the door closes.  He looks expectantly at his brother.

""What?""

""Dude? Privacy? I gotta dress.""

""Oh, right. Sorry, being on the adventuring road so much, you start to not worry about that.""

Sebastian slips through the front wall of the house to meet the greetings of his party members.  Bach pauses for a moment, thinking about what his brother just said.  ""Damn bro.""

&amp;nbsp;

The party intensely discusses future plans.  The Grath woman takes a large map and rolls it out upon the hood of the modified humvee, using her long arms to get it out in one motion.  The Fvalian hops out of the driver’s seat over the front window.  She lays down on the back of the hood, stretching her lithe frame along the edge of the map to keep it down.  She immediately taps out point on the map with a claw tip.  The half-emin steps up in front of the grill and flips the hood off her short cape.  Placing her hands on the sides of her waist, she picks at her belt of pouches with long nails.  She sighs and glances with her golden eyes to the Fvalian on the hood.  She leans forward and places a nail point on another part of the map.  “Cideeda, we talked about this!  There’s no reason for Noxian to go back there!”

Cideeda’s tail flicks out from behind her and she taps the same point from before.  “I know!  But, Sotalia you can’t deny there might be some stuff left.  Maybe notes or some clues to where he may have gone!”

Sotalia straightens her back.  She stands a moment before grimacing at the bright sun beating down.  With a frustrated sneer, she pulls the hat off her head, letting down her dark red hair, revealing her swept back horns.  “What is with the weather around here?!  It was near freezing last night at the hotel, now it’s damn near summer weather!”

The Grath woman wipes beads of sweat off her forehead and removes her armored leather jacket.  She tosses it in the back of the humvee.  “Not the worst change in weather I have experienced, but surprising.”

“I know, Dretphi!”

Cideeda rolls her eyes and turns over on her back, letting her legs and arms drape over the vehicle to stretch.  “Better than it being as cold as it was on that mountain getting here.”

Sotalia and Dretphi each nod in agreement, before continuing the debate over where to go next.

Standing off to the side a fair skinned, delicate figure, confidently holds a large sheathed sword.  Sebastian’s ghostly form glides over to her side.  She smiles gently as he approaches.  “So, did he agree to help us?”

“Of course, my dear, Aristespha!”

She breathes a sigh of relief.  She twists her foot inside her boot, as discomfort flashes on her face.  She places the sword down to her side as she kneels down.  After undoing a few belts, she eventually works her leg out of the knee high boots.  “The finest artisans crafted these boots for my family and, yet, they still manage to find every loose rock in area!”

She energetically shakes her boot, until a stray rock tumbles out.  Balancing on one foot, Aristespha slides her leg back into the boot, taking a few moments to readjust her fine clothing back to proper.

Cideeda waves over to Sebastian and Aristespha with a toothy grin.  “Hey!  You two going to join in on his argument or do you want to be ‘alone’.”

Aristespha picks up the sword and resumes a distinguished posture and gazes lovingly over to Sebastian.  “Let’s not keep them waiting.”

&amp;nbsp;

The group eventually settles upon a rough plan.  Sebastian takes the lull in the debate to look over towards Bach's house.  The Cideeda’s long, tuff-tipped ears perk towards the house.  The rest of the party stops the discussion and quietly glance over at the house.  Sebastian hovers over and sticks his upper body through the front wall.  He pulls back out for a moment of puzzling, before going all the way through into the house.  Cideeda’s ears perk again.  ""That sounds like the kick starter of a motorcycle.""

""MOTHERFUCKER!!!""

The ethereal, booming, echoing eruption of sound gets the attention of everyone.  Sebastian launches out of the building with his ghostly figure billowing red with ethereal flames.  ""THE BASTARD SQUEEZED HIS FAT ASS THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW AND IS ESCAPING ON HIS BIKE! GET HIM!""

The rumble of a motorcycle blasts.  Tires spin and gravel peppers the back of the small house.  The party throws everything into the humvee, each jumping aboard.  Cideeda floors the accelerator and spins out towards the back road behind the house.

Sebastian stands on the roof, floating in sync with the humvee and glares at angrily at the man on the side-car motorcycle a few dozen meters down the back road.  ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BACH?!""

The Bach looks behind him to see the ethereal figure, flaming red with rage.  Bach snaps his head to the front, screams in fright, and opens up the motorcycle all the way.

&amp;nbsp;

Bach drives the motorcycle as fast as it will go.  The small town streets thankfully empty on an early holiday morning.  He takes advantage of local knowledge, power-sliding down back streets and access roads.  This forces the humvee to take longer routes, but eventually the humvee’s speed overall keeps the chase going.  Sebastian launches from the roof of the humvee towards Bach.  He attaches himself in front of the motorcycle, holding onto the handle bars opposite of Bach.  “I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HELP ME BACH!”

Bach shifts his head left and right around Sebastian’s ghostly form, each time meeting the enraged, transparent face of his brother.  “DAMMIT SEBASTIAN!  I’M TRYING TO FUCKING DRIVE HERE!”

“FUCK YOUR DRIVING!  WHAT ABOUT HELPING ME?!”

Bach narrows his eyes at his brother, a strange faint blue glow coming from his pupils.  “Well.  Maybe you should mention needing to destroy a world ending horror BEFORE asking your brother to help!  Full disclosure, man!”

Sebastian continues his ranting.  “FULL DISCLOSE!?  I was trying to be nice!  Because YOU are GOING to HELP ME whether you like it or not-”

Bach nods his head and raises it, his eyes pulsating blue.  Sebastian breaks his rage upon sight.  Bach cocks the back of his right hand away from the handle of the motorcycle and stares at his brother.  “Full disclosure.  This might sting.”

With a blur, a loud resonant clap follows the impact as the back of Bach’s hand pushes into Sebastian’s shocked face.  His ethereal figure tumbles loose from Bach’s motorcycle and flies right back into the sword on Aristespha’s lap.  The four in the humvee can only glance wide-eyed.  The sword stirs in Aristespha’s lap and Sebastian reforms next to her with a frustrated expression.  Sotalia spins in her seat to Sebastian.  “How the fuck did he do that?!”

“I told you.  My brother, despite being as human as he is, is full of surprises.  He was ranked the same as ME in adventuring school.”

Dretphi crawls forward from her back seat between Sebastian and Aristespha.  “How do you want us to capture him?”

“Alive.”

“Apart from that?”

“No... Permanent injuries.  Please.”

Cideeda pulls herself over the steering wheel and focuses her eyes on the motorcycle.  She returns to her seat and reaches a cupped hand above her, forcing some of the flowing air into her face.  She sniffs the air carefully.  “It’s a biodiesel engine!  Sotalia how cold can your freeze spell get?!”

Sotalia pivots herself to Cideeda.  “Below freezing easily.”

“Can you focus it at range?”

“Yes, decently enough.”

Cideeda points out a series of tubes on the engine.  “Those are the fuel lines!  Freeze them and it should stall the engine out.”

Sotalia rolls her sleeves back and stands up in her seat.  Her cape flutters around, as she takes aim with one arm grasping the top of the windshield and the other extended.  She points and chants while symbols along her arm glow brighter and brighter.  “Get me closer, Cideeda!”

With a manic grin, Cideeda floors the accelerator and closes the gap between the humvee and motorcycle.  Bach glances back and with more worry.  Sotalia maintains careful aim with concentration and releases the spell.  The humvee tire rolls over a large rock.  The beam of energy lances out, hitting a much higher target.  The beam contacts the area of Bach’s back above his butt and drags upwards to the region between the shoulders.  Bach screams in agony, tensing up and nearly drawing in his motorcycle seat into his ass.  Sotalia blinks with embarrassment and quickly gathers more energy to make another attempt.  “Dammit!  Stupid bump!  I’ll get it this time!”

Another beam of energy reaches out and hits the tubing around the engine, forming a solid layer of misting ice.  Bach recovers from the shock of the ice to his back to notices the motorcycle engine sputter.  He leans over to see the ice on the fuel lines.  “FUCK!”

Bach snags his backpack in the sidecar, and throws it over his shoulder.  He keeps grip on the handle bar, the engine completely giving out to a slowing coast.  When the motorcycle gets to a near stop, he leaps and runs into the forest off to the side of the road.  The humvee slides to a stop.  Dretphi flings herself out to land in a full break sprint.  Bach runs with slight stumbles through the forest floor.  Loud snaps and shuffles erupt from behind him.  He snaps his head back to see Dretphi barreling through the forest.  She powers through the dense floor, gliding over the terrain without a sign of trouble.  Bach’s eyes open wide in abject horror, with a slight blue glow, as Dretphi moves right next to him.  She reaches out to Bach.  As she hovers her hand over to grab firmly onto his shirt, Bach speeds forward out of her grasp.  She watches in astonishment as not only do his footsteps grow faster but each stride increases in length.  With speed unfitting of his body, Bach leaves Dretphi behind.  A crackly voice sounds off in Dretphi’s ear from a radio ear piece.  “Dretphi!  Have you caught him?!”

Between heavy breaths Dretphi responds.  “No.  He’s somehow.  Outrunning.  ME!”

A very confused Cideeda continues on the radio.  “What?!  How?!  Nevermind.  We found an access road!  Are you still running west!?”

“Yes.”

“Okay.  THERE!  We found a clearing up ahead.  Keep chasing him!”

&amp;nbsp;

Bach coughs and sputters.  He can’t keep the pace up any longer.  The forest around him thins out.  He looks upon the clearing with some relief.  As Bach lands his first step into the clearing, Cideeda shoots up from the tall grasses and points a strange shotgun at him.  She pulls the trigger and a payload of netting and weights explode outwards.  Bach’s luminescent blue eyes watch the expanding mass and he dive-slides immediately, unnaturally to the grass and dirt.  The net aimed for a standing person flies over the prone Bach.  Cideeda cocks the shotgun with zeal and she aims down.  A pull of the trigger sends another strange projectile with electrical probes out the barrel.  Bach sees the blast of the shotgun and the projectile spinning towards him.  He raises his hands up instinctively to protect himself, bouncing the projectile as a golden transparent disc appears.  Cideeda cocks the shotgun again and fires.  The shield bounces the projectile again.  Bach regains his footing and flings the shield right at Cideeda, knocking the shotgun out of her hands.  She ends up catching the golden disc in her hands from the rebound off her shotgun.  “How the fuc-”

Bach sprints across the field.  Aristespha confidently walks out behind a tree on the other side of the clearing.  With a fast chant and gesture, waves of energy pass through Bach.  He staggers, each step more lethargic and exaggerated.  Eventually, he barely maintains a stand, as a curious Aristespha carefully approaches.  She keeps her gloved hand steadily aimed at Bach.  “Strange.  Most creatures fall completely asleep.  There may be something to your brother’s claims after all.”

Something inside Bach stirs as his head nods from the effects of the spell.  He remains still and standing, while Aristespha’s curiosity turns to genuine caution.  Bach’s head rises back up with the effect of the spell fading and his senses coming back.  She briefly expresses shock before releasing another wave of energy, collapsing Bach into an unconscious heap.  Sebastian’s ethereal form floats next to her.  She snaps at him, “You did not mention how difficult he would be to capture!”

Sebastian drifts back and shrugs.  “I knew he could be difficult, but I honestly didn’t expect he’d be able to pull this much off.”

Cideeda arrives, still holding the golden disc at the side with her hand.  “Wow!  He sure put up a fight!  I’ll have to use my special made restrains on him!”

She passes off the golden disc to Sotalia as she stops from a jog.  Sotalia examines the disc with confusion and intrigue.  After digging through her cargo pants pockets, Cideeda pulls out a collection of restraints and rope.  She puts the devices on Bach, wrapping him up in rope.  In between securing restraints, Cideeda pats Bach down, turning out pockets and searching through his backpack.  “He was planning to run pretty far!  A bit of money, passport, and a fake ID.”

Sebastian hovers over her and joins her in examining all the random things in Bach’s backpack.  Sotalia finally takes a moment from examining the golden disc.  “Where did this come from?  Did he have it with him?”

Cideeda pulls her head from backpack looting.  “Umm.  No.  It appeared when I tried shooting him with the stunner rounds.  Pretty weird.”

“Have you found any artifacts on him?”

“No.  Nothing I think is magical.”

Sotalia holds the golden disc in front of her.  “So you’re saying he conjured this?!”

Cideeda tilts her head to the side.  “I guess.  I didn’t see him do any kind of incantations.  It just appeared.”

Sotalia cranes her head over to Sebastian with a glare.  He eventually realizes the glare concentrated on him and glides over to Sotalia.  “Yes?”

“You said he FAILED out of the mage program!”

Sebastian’s eyes dart confused.  “Yes.  He did.”

Sotalia holds up the golden disc in one hand and points with the other.  “THIS isn’t the work of a failed mage!”

“Well, what do you call not passing your fifth year finals?”

“Wait!  He made it through FIFTH YEAR?!”

“Yes?”

Sotalia’s grits her teeth and shakes the disc, waving her hand to punctuate her thoughts.  “Fifth year is the last year for school work!  The only reason for the sixth year is internship hours!”

Sebastian shrugs.  Dretphi steps up, taking huge breaths and long strides to recover from the long sprint.  “Sebastian.  There are things you have not told us about your brother.  You need to inform us.”

Sotalia points up to Dretphi behind her, keeping her glare on Sebastian.  “Exactly!  While your brother sleeps, we are going to have a nice long discussion.”

Aristespha crosses her arms and slants her hips behind Sebastian.  “All of us are going to have a nice long discussion.”

Sebastian smiles nervously, pivoting between all the unhappy faces.  He only finds difference with Cideeda’s face, as she points to an electronic device freshly fished from Bach’s backpack.  “What?”

With the most innocent batting of the eyes, Cideeda asks with glee, “Can I have this?!  These are really RARE!  I’ve been looking for one FOR. EVER.”

“Sure.  Go right ahead.”

Cideeda squeals with joy and continues to sort through Bach’s backpack.  Sebastian shrinks with the walls of his party closing in and points over to the humvee.  “How about we get on the road and discuss this further on along the way?”

&amp;nbsp;

The world returns to Bach’s senses.  He feels moving.  Sounds of conversation hit his ears.  As his brain reconnects with consciousness, he assesses his situation.  He’s tied up, inside a vehicle, surrounded by the voices of the people he was trying to escape.  He resigns to the loss.  Slowly and stealthily opening one eye, he surveys the area.  Inside the humvee, he lies in the middle aisle between everyone.  He looks up to the back seat to see Dretphi laying out on the bench seat with a few pillows making it more comfortable.  To either side are seats.  Aristespha holds onto the sword and sheath across her lap with her seat reclined back.  Sebastian is sitting in the opposite seat, despite not needing one.  Looking down the aisle to the front, Bach sees Cideeda in the driver’s seat flipping through the holographic list of music on his Universal HoloPlayer Pro.  Sotalia excitedly points out a selection in the list and taps to start playing it.  “I can’t believe he has a copy of this!  These guys were totally my favorite band back in my gloom and doom phase!”

Cideeda chirps back.  “I told you this thing is amazing!  And it’s got all the unofficial modifications and unlocks!”

Aristespha sighs and groans, “Back to the discussion at hand...   So Bach made it to the end of his fifth year and just dropped out.”

Sebastian nods with arms crossed.  “Yes.  He didn’t even take the final test.  Just walked away from it all.”

Sotalia twists in the seat towards the back.  “You don’t just walk away after all that and getting that high of marks.  What happened before he left?”

Sebastian sighs, “Something happened on an assignment he went on with his instructor and a few other students.  Things went really bad.  Bach was the only one to get out without any serious injuries.”

Sotalia face grows more concern and she focuses on Sebastian.  “What.  Happened?”

Sebastian lowers his head.  “They ran into a Nightmare Geist.”

The entire vehicle goes silent, save the sounds of the engine and road.  Everyone grimaces and squirms as the thoughts of such a creature rise up from hearing its name.  Bach winces as memories echo.  Sotalia breaks the silence, “A Nightmare Geist?!  They all lived?!”

Sebastian eyes side to side with a shrug, “Yes.  Everyone except Bach needed to be hospitalized.”

Dretphi shifts her position higher in the back seat.  “There are old legends in my clan about whole villages being destroyed by such a creature.  The most we have even done is seal them away.  And secure the vessel somewhere far from where it could do harm.”

Cideeda’s happiness drains from her as something more solemn takes hold.  She goes quiet.  Her breath occasionally shudders as memories take hold, occupying all the attention in her mind not put towards driving.  Sotalia turns her head to Cideeda and gently holds Cideeda’s shoulder.  Cideeda’s breathing calms and she pats a free hand on Sotalia’s.  Aristespha narrows her eyes at Sebastian, “So, how did they seal... It?”

Sebastian pauses in thought and after a few false starts, “Sealed?  It was destroyed-  Maybe.  No one was sure, but there was no trace of it.  Maybe it just left?  I don’t know!”

Bach close his eye and keeps quiet.

Sotalia rubs the bridge of her nose in frustration.  “They didn’t say anything?!  Did your own brother say anything?!  This is pretty damn significant!”

“No!  He’s never said anything about it.  In fact, that’s when he grew distant, and then just stopped doing the whole school thing.  I tried to get him to tell me, but I could tell something bad happened and he didn’t want to talk about it.”

Dretphi settles down into the back seat again, moving some pillows around.  “I think we may be able to help your brother.”

Sebastian twists his form to look at Dretphi.  “I hope so-”

“No.  We will.  Before he seemed like he was incapable of fighting.  It is different now.  He can fight.  He just is not.”

Bach keeps quiet.  He was feeling tired again and at this point he really didn’t want to get into an argument with such a one-sided majority.  Plus even some awkward sleep would be preferable to hearing all the discussion about him.

&amp;nbsp;

Bach wakes to firm tapping of a finger on his forehead.  His eyes greet Dretphi’s as she glares stoically at him from above, her platinum blonde braids draping down.  “Will you cooperate and come with us?”

Bach takes a breath in, “Yes.  I don’t have in in me to run at the moment anyway.”

Dretphi leans back into the seat and directs Bach up with a hand gesture.  Bach throws himself up to a sit.  With a few motions and twists, Dretphi undoes the restraints on Bach.  He then grabs hold of the seats to the side of him to pull himself up the rest of the way.  He turns to the open humvee side door and steps outside to a gravel driveway.  Dretphi follows him a few moments later, her imposing frame maintaining reach of Bach.  Bach slowly spins around to survey the area.  It is remote, out of the way, and only a single road in sight.  Thankfully, the house at the end of the gravel driveway seems really nice.  A single level, ranch style with a full assortment of amenities.

“So, this place got cable TV?”

Cideeda pushes the sidecar motorcycle past Bach and Dretphi, “Not yet!  The installer is coming tomorrow, sometime between 8 in the morning and 8 at night.  At least, they’re honest about it around here.”

Bach watches as his motorcycle rolls up into the garage, and a very eager Fvalian examines it.  He glances over to Dretphi.  She shrugs.  “She’s always wanted one, among many other things.  And refused to leave without it.”

Bach puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs.  “At least it’s here.”

He walks slowly over to the front door, with Dretphi occasionally directing him via a firm, but gentle, nudge of the hand.  As Bach crosses through the front door, he notices the house is furnished and decorated in a neutral style.  The hard wood floors are really nice and well cared for.  He walks into the big living/dining room and sees Sotalia and Aristespha going over a document at the window bar leading into the kitchen.  He points to the couch in front of a big screen TV and Dretphi nods.

“Probably best I stay out of the way?”

“Yes.  That would be best.  Maybe you can find some channels for now.”

Bach nods and takes a seat on the couch, reaching for the remote.  He idly messes with the settings on the TV’s tuner and listens in on the conversation going on.

Sotalia sits down on a stool and flips through a stack of papers.  “That’s the checklist, everything looks in order.  You want to drop this by the leasing office in town tomorrow?”

Aristespha nods.  “I need to stop and talk to a few representatives of a guild or two for some work while we get our investigations and... training started.”

Bach narrows his eyes at that remark, watching the TV auto-scan for over-the-air channels.  Sotalia drops the stack of papers on the bar counter.  “Not a bad deal for a six month lease at the price.”

“My property agent recommended it, said it would be perfect for adventurers needing a base to operate from.”

Sebastian appears next Bach on the couch.  Bach groans as he senses his presence.  Sebastian turns to this brother, “Look man.  I know we got off to a BAD start, but this is important stuff.”

“To YOU.”

“To everyone asshole!  Dark Lord Noxian is going to cause trouble again and we’ve been THE group closest to stopping him.”

“Man, fuck you.  This all about you and I’m just being used as your fuckin’ proxy.”

“DUDE.  This is a chance to get you in the game!  Like we talked about when we were in school!  All the adventurers I’ve been on, you should have been a part of them!”

Bach sighs as he flips through the channels.  “If you weren’t ethereal, I’d tell you to the eat corn out of my shit right now.”

Sebastian meanly eyes Bach, “Well, if I wasn’t ethereal, I’d shove you head first into the shitter to suck my shit!”

The two are silent on the couch and just stare angrily at the TV screen.  It’s a few minutes before the two actually pay attention to what is on the TV.

“Could you change it?  I can’t.”

Bach flips the channels to the weather, something a bit more tolerable.  “Already on it.”

Silence falls again until Bach drops his head and sighs, “Goddammit.  I want to help you Sebastian.  But, holy shit, there’s GOT to be a better route than going to Noxian to get you released.”

Sebastian leans in to whisper to Bach, “That’s what I thought too, man!  But, Aristespha was pretty adamant about Noxian.”

“Well, that’s the known source of that energy.  But-  There’s GOT to be other places.  Most artifacts just need that type of energy, doesn’t matter where it comes from.  Okay, listen, Noxian is basically a conduit of really old school Elder magical energy.  Rawest energy stuff.  Most magical energy sources today are really tame in comparison to that.  But, all them evolved from Elder and Elder used to be the only source for a very long time.”

Sebastian scratches his chin.  “I see.  There’s got to be some old ruins that might still be an easy source of that Elder energy.”

“Exactly!  Even if there isn’t enough in one location, there’s probably enough residual around to charge up the sword.  So, we explore some ruins, find enough Elder energy, charge up the sword, get you back, and we both get back at Noxian.”

“I like this.  Either way, you still need to get you into fighting shape.”

“Fine.  I’ll try.  But, let me try to find a better route to getting you back along the way.”

Sebastian smirks.  “Deal.  Either way, it’ll be good to get you fighting again.”

“Sure.”

Sebastian thinks for a moment, “Hey, your house back in that town-  Umm- Do we need to do anything to handle the rent or-”

Bach shrugs and falls back into the couch cushion.  “Not really.  My lease was up this month, already sold most of my non-valuable stuff to make last month’s rent.  I didn’t expect my deposit back when I signed up for the place.  So, about the only thing I didn’t cram into my backpack and the sidecar was the TV and that thing was on its last legs anyway.”

“Yah, that place was a real hole in the wall.  Plus, you’re a shitty housekeeper.”

“Fuck you.  It’s called depression, asshole.”

“Fair enough.  Honestly, I haven’t been anywhere long enough lately to really live in a place.”

“So, how’s the whole dead and ethereal thing been for you?”

“You know.  Not bad.  Not good.  It’s been... Interesting.  I can get away with A LOT in this form.”

Both Bach and Sebastian settle in and watch the TV, channels flip as the two catch up as the other members settle in.

&amp;nbsp;

The sun rises slowly in the early morning, as the dew glitters and life stirs in the area.  Standing in the middle of the large field near the house, Sotalia paces in lecture to Bach.  “Okay, so let’s find out what you can do.  Stand up here.  I want you to cast the standard mage bolt you learned in first year.”

Bach rises up shakily, yawning and wiping the sleep from his eyes.  He shambles up to the spot Sotalia points out.  She crosses her arms and waits.  Bach points out into the area in front of him, “So... any target you want me to-”

“Just cast it in the air, it should dissipate before it hits anything.”

Bach sniffs and stretches, “Okay.”

His arms move through the motions of the spell, exaggerating points and drifting others.  His incantations jumble and the magical phrases run into each like customers in a crowded checkout line.  But somehow, a perfect mage bolt forms from his hand and flies off into the distance.  It eventually stops by hitting a tree, a kilometer away.

Sotalia glares with a facial twitch.  “That was THE sloppiest gesturing and the worst pronunciation I’ve EVER heard.  But, somehow-”

She takes a deep breath in.  “Okay.  Let’s try something that is more sensitive to proper spell work, the Hover Disc spell.”

Bach shrugs and goes through the motions.  He pauses at movements to scratch, yawns at parts, and leaves the verbal and gesture components out of sync at the end.  But, somehow a large hover disc forms without any trouble.  Sotalia’s glare intensifies, as she pops individual knuckles out of building frustration at what she sees.  “Step. On. It.”

Bach gazes down at the hovering disc and places a foot on top.  He puts his weight on the disc and it does not move, even when he lifts his other foot off the ground.  The disc then moves with Bach’s slight leaning directions.  Sotalia’s anger seeps into her thoughts and she meets eyes with Bach.  Just as she’s about to react, she notices the blue glow in his eyes.  Her anger flashes over to curiosity and wonder.  “I’ll be damned...”

Bach stops moving the disc around and apprehensively raises a brow to Sotalia.  “I’ll be damned- What?”

Sotalia opens up her large satchel and rummages, eventually pulling out the same golden, transparent disc from yesterday’s chase.  It was still formed and solid, showing no signs of decay.  An evil grin grows, her golden eyes glint with a newfound glee.  She and pulls off her hoodie and begins stretching and humming a happy, ominous tune.  Bach steps slowly off the hovering disc.  “Something happened.  I’m not sure what-”

“I know what you are.”

Bach freezes, nervously.  “What am I?”

Sotalia arcs her back and popping a few joints.  “A Direct Caster.  You actually got all the way through the mage school with high marks and they never tried looking for it.”

Bach cautiously witnesses this scene unfold.  “Huh?  I’m not following you all the way-”

Sotalia now smiles with a spring in her step.  She brushes her long red hair out of her face and around her horns.  “You see those motions and sounds YOU make, don’t mean anything to you.  You don’t NEED them.  You just did them to pass the tests, but they don’t help you get into the whole spell casting mindset.  Somehow your brain just does that on its own.”

“Okay.  This has just officially turned weird.  Is that magical sparring gear you are putting on-  Oh.  Shit.”

Bach tenses up and scans around the area.  He holds his hands up to Sotalia.  She grins with delight.  “You see, Bach.  I’ve been teaching myself to direct cast, but I’ve never run into anyone that naturally did it.  And to find someone that got through school without anyone figuring it out.”

“Alright, still confused at the change of attitude here.”

With a mischievous, evil grin, Sotalia winks at Bach, holding her hand up with a ball of fire forming, “I thought I was going to have to play kindergarten teacher to some oddball dropout.  Instead, I’ve just gotten the sparring partner I’ve been wanting to learn all I want from.  Don’t worry.  If all goes well, you’ll have my respect.”

Bach’s eyes widen as his expression shatters to worry and fear.  A blue glow sparks in his eyes. “That does not fill me with any good feelings!  Why don’t we have a nice sit down class and talk about things-”

The ball of fire fully forms in Sotalia’s hand, illuminating her face, “Oh, class IS in session.  Right now, your real training begins.”

&amp;nbsp;

Cideeda sits at the dining table with various bits and pieces strewn about the surface.  She plays with the holographic menu, flipping through the contents of the holoplayer.  Aristespha turns through old tomes and other scripture, making her own notes in a journal.  The ethereal form of Sebastian hovers near her, trying to keep up with the material.  Dretphi sits on the living room couch, taking care of armor and other equipment.  The sliding glass door of the living room opens.  Sotalia struts in with an ear to ear grin, wiping sweat off her face with a towel around her neck.  “That was NICE.”

She continues around the dining table, straight into the kitchen, where she opens the refrigerator, and pulls out a sports drink. Sebastian eyes Sotalia.  “Where’s Bach at?”

Bach steps through, and slowly closes the sliding door behind him.  He’s missing spots of his shirt, his pants are now frayed, uneven shorts, and he wears only one shoe.  Dretphi lifts her head up from cleaning equipment.  Bach staggers to the couch and drops into it across from her.  Cideeda, Aristespha, and Sebastian examine Bach as he stares blankly ahead of himself.

In between chugs of the sport drink, Sotalia points to Bach while standing very confidently.  “You did REALLY good.  After I catch a shower, we’ll continue for the rest of the day.”

Bach blinks, still not moving his head.  “You should treat yourself.  Take a nice. LONG. bath.  Relax.  Take the REST of the day off.”

“And you miss out on all this great training?  I’d like to try some magic homing missiles out.”

Sotalia finishes the drink and tosses the bottle into the nearby garbage can, and walks out of the room down a hallway to one of the bathrooms.  Attention briefly returns to Bach, before everyone resume what they were doing previously.  Bach still stares forward.  “So...  Dretphi?  Does your training tomorrow include fire, ice, bolts of energy, manic gleeful laughter, and repressed emotions feeding near bloodlust?”

Dretphi turns her head slightly with a tilt.  “No.  Just training weapons.  Padded armor.  And simple exercise routines.”

Bach nods, “That sounds nice.”

“You want a new shirt?  I think mine will fit you.”

“Nah...  It’d only get destroyed.  Thank you, though.”

Dretphi nods and slides over a bottle of water to Bach on the coffee table.  Bach reaches out, grabs hold of the bottle, removes the cap, and starts drinking it.

“Maybe after training tomorrow, we’ll get you some better...  battle-ready clothing.”

“That would be nice.”"
5oh0m3,5,2017-01-17,Future Business Analyst. Help me start my career?,arrrkam,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5oh0m3/future_business_analyst_help_me_start_my_career/,"Hello ITCareerQuestions,

Let me introduce myself. 

I am 19 years old and I am a L1 technical support executive intern at a Tech-Support company. I've completed the BCS Higher education qualifications. 
(I know most of you don't know that. Its an equivalent to a British Honors degree.  www.bcs.org/category/18013) 

I don't have a bachelors degree nor any other professional qualifications at the moment besides BCS.
This is not about the job prospect, I want to know which path will give me the correct foundation for a Business Analyst career. 

Now the question.

I can directly do my Masters in Information Systems if I have around 3 years of experience in any computer related field. Or, I can do my Bachelors degree (I just have to do 1 year (top up) to get my bachelors degree because of the BCS qualification.) and then do my Masters degree.

So, what do you think I should do? Do you think the Masters degree would help me in the long run or is it a bit early to do my masters? FYI I would be 21 when I complete the Bachelors.

And do you think as an L1 intern at a tech support firm would do me any good in the future as a BA?

I'm not going to say the company but they're a fortune 500 company, and I really want to work there.

I've never negotiated salary before. Whenever I see general developer salaries, it's usually around $65k. Is that too much to ask, or should I negotiate more or less?

As for background, my major will be Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security. I have two certifications already (although not very relevant to the job that I may be getting) -- Palo Alto ACE, and AccessData Certified Examiner. I also have 6 months professional experience in IT Operations and Service Management, from previous internships.

The area that the position will be in is RTP, North Carolina.

Thanks!"

I am an Australian student studying electrical engineering and want to focus on the hardware side of things. I feel like it is far more interesting over in the US. Do you think it would be plausible to get an internship over the northern hemisphere winter time as an international? Dream would be at a big company but I would take what I can get.

We plugged it in and the pc now switches on and immediately switches off and keeps restarting every few seconds before even the initial beep. I've had this PC for around 4 years now and it has always kept up.

I am not as tech savvy as I used to be, but my thoughts are that it is either the motherboard, CPU, GFX or PSU, I really don't know which anymore. I spent all of last year doing an unpaid internship, and therefore have no money to replace anything as my reserves are depleted. For the first time in around 13 years I am without a PC for the foreseeable future and I don't know what to do.

Thanks for taking the time to read. I just needed to vent with some people who would understand the pain of losing a best friend.

tl,dr; PC died completely, no money to replace it, digging in for the long haul. You will be missed old friend.

**Edit** first time poster to this sub, not sure if this is the right flair, please someone let me know if it should be changed.

**Edit 2** I tried a bunch of what was suggested here, nothing seemed to work. Will need a full bench to test it but as i said, no real point at this stage since i cant afford the replacement parts. Will update if i finally figuer out whats wrong. Till then its ... Mobile gaming..."

It was officially launched on 11th January. In this post, I share figures, stats, and plans going forward.

The full blog post with better formatting and pictures is available on the [Coding Internships Blog](https://codinginternships.com/blog/launch-of-coding-internships/), but is also cross posted below:

#About Coding Internships

There were two main reasons for building Coding Internships:

* Become more acquainted with internships and jobs that I wanted to apply for in the future
* Provide a directory of quality internships that people can apply for

Coding Internships currently accepts postings as well, so feel free to submit one if you have an opening for a tech related internship.

#Launch Day

Coding Internships was posted on a couple of social media platforms: [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), and Reddit. The posting of Coding Internships on ProductHunt was the main driver of traffic, and will be the focus of this post.

**ProductHunt**

ProductHunt is a site that features and displays the newest startups and projects. For a new startup, it's generally regarded as one of the best ways to kickstart your product in front of thousands of potential users.

The ProductHunt launch came as a surprise, and I was unaware of it. I noticed traffic coming in from ProductHunt on Google Analytics, and went on ProductHunt to find out that Espen, a ProductHunt user, had posted it there (thanks Espen!). I immediately left a welcome comment on ProductHunt, pointing out that I was the maker behind the site and offered to answer any questions about the site.

Coding Internships was rather well received on ProductHunt despite not receiving many comments. It managed to finish #4 of the day, with 188 votes. If you finish within the top 5 on ProductHunt, you'll also be included in their daily email newsletter, which will drive additional traffic.

Coding Internships was featured on ProductHunt on a Friday, which is generally not a great day to be on the site. From experience, the best days to be hunted are Tuesdays or Wednesdays, where more users seem to browse the site.

While the ProductHunt posting came as a surprise, I'm happy that the site did well without much preparation beforehand. The total number of users from ProductHunt came to approximately *1,600 new users* over two days.

**Hacker News**

Hacker News is a site that allows users to post links that are generally related to tech. It also allows users to showcase new projects (this is known as Show HN).

Coding Internships received 7 upvotes on HN, but faded off the front page quickly. The HN post referred approximately *100 users* to the site.

**Reddit**

Coding Internships was submitted to a couple of relevant Reddit subreddits (/r/ITCareerQuestions and /r/CSCareerQuestions). It made the front page on both, and was generally well received. A total of approximately *400 users* were referred to the site via Reddit.


**Future Plans**

As of now, most visitors to Coding Internships are people looking for internship openings. In order to keep the site going, it will need to attract more companies and recruiters.

I plan to focus on the traffic channels of social media and SEO. The post on ProductHunt also indirectly brought a small number of users on Facebook and Twitter to the site, and I will be trying to expand along these channels next. Hopefully by doing so, I will be able to bring Coding Internships to the attention of recruiters and companies.

Once again, you can view the full blog post [here](https://codinginternships.com/blog/launch-of-coding-internships/) as well as check out [Coding Internships](https://codinginternships.com). If you have an internship opening, feel free to post it as well!

If you have any comments, questions, or advice, feel free to leave them below. If you're launching a product on ProductHunt and have questions or want tips for a good launch, let me know as well."
5oimh0,3,2017-01-17,Critique of my solutions in Technical Interview/Tests from Jnr Web Dev Job Interview (JS),clarets99,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5oimh0/critique_of_my_solutions_in_technical/,"Hello all,

I've applied for a some of my first ever Jnr Developer jobs and recieved an HR interview which then proceeded to test my via codacity. I had two tasks in 75 mins. One basic (required 100% correct) and one more difficult(requiring 50% correct) I scored 0% on both, however I think if reviewed by other, my actual working out and logic was on the right track.

I'm just gonna post the Q's and my answers, and I'd like a critique back. Just a bit of background, I am a self taught developer, mainly through online courses and have created a good few projects in Meteor. I have a novice understanding of OOP, methods, functions and have just began a one year web development course at a local university which is due for completion this year. This is also whilst working freelance (in another industry)I am not a CS graduate, nor do I intend to go down the route right now. I just started to apply for internships and entry/jnr jobs early to gain more experience.


Q1. There are N coins in a zero-indexed array, each showing 1 (for heads) or 0 (for tails). We would like all the coins so show the same face. What is the minimum number of coins that must be reversed?

Q2. http://imgur.com/a/nLXkW (easier to show it than type it)

[My ATTEMPTED Answer in JavaScript, incompleted in the ammount of time available](https://jsbin.com/dadibew/edit?js,console)



I am not looking for a crucifixion of how terrible my programming skills are, I am still learning so much every week. However it would be nice for people to assess me saying ""you were on the right path with that answer"" or maybe asking me to examine other areas to study up on.

There's a lot for me to learn, however I really don't think these tests give any true reference of me skill wise.

Thanks very much.

Edit: Just had my interview with the outsourced HR guy to go through my results, sadly no going through to the next round due to the 0%. I asked him whether the people at the company would even see my actual code and he said its unlikely. He said he hates using codility, that my resume and github profiles are great and that when we leaves the company (in a few months time)  he will be getting in contact me as he thinks by the time I graduate I am the fit that most companies want.

Edit edit. The next part of the process would have been a phone interview with the CTO (which is quite intense) followed by a ""personnel interview and testing day"" and then an offer there and then."

I'm currently looking for an internship in software engineering (any kind at this point). Over the past few weeks, I've been sending applications to many different companies mostly close to my area but I have been sending them out to places like California and such. I'm trying to be very careful with my cover letter and resume to make it look at least decent.

Not even 10% of the applications I have sent have responded to me and the ones that did might as well have written a big fat ""NO"" on the email. I'm even looking into applying to hospitals for IT assistant positions because I am super desperate right now. I am supposed to go back to school within a couple of days and I still haven't found anything. I'm worried that if I'm not good enough for an internship, then I'm probably not good enough for a job either.

I understand that I probably should have started looking way beforehand and I've probably doomed myself just by not doing that. But I'm at my wits end, I'm having lots of second thoughts on CS because of this, my competence and confidence is quickly draining, and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. 

Any advice on how to go about internships? What can I do to make myself look more attractive (I've heard people mention portfolios and websites, but I've also heard companies don't look at those too heavily)? Are internships even worth it anymore? Any advice on my situation specifically? Anything would be greatly appreciated!"
5ojf34,2,2017-01-17,Series of why questions,athrowaway9182,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5ojf34/series_of_why_questions/,"Over the past week or two, I have been in an  existential crisis. My new years resolution was to begin NoFap, quit weed and stop hanging out with my druggie friends.  I have been pretty successful so far, in that I can say about 10/17 days have been successful with all three resolutions, and have completely ignored the druggie friends the entire time.  However I have also had suicidal thoughts since I've started, which I attribute to chemical imbalances in my brain, loneliness and stress.
      For some background, I am a computer science sophomore at a prestigious university, am currently doing an internship during my winter break, and in a few days will go back to school. I have never really stopped working for very long in some form since I started school freshman year, as I took summer courses.  When I return in a few days, I will be taking a very difficult course, where I will have very little time.  I am worried that starting in a few days, my life will have diminishing time for pleasure/relaxation, and increased stress. 
      Given that I have suffered with depression for about 7 years now, and haven't been enjoying the time I have currently very much, I can't foresee how my future, which will probably only decrease in free time, will be worth living.  I see it as my life will only decrease in net pleasure (pleasure-pain), and that I am basically currently in the negative zone. As in I have gotten to the point where I spend more time unhappy than happy. 
     Now when I am not in a suicidal thought loop, (like now as I am typing this, no need to move this to suicide watch or anything) I recognize that rationally the answer isn't death.  I am still worried about the upcoming semester but I recognize that I would've done it already after 7 years of this shit.  However I also fear the fact that this 7 year rollercoaster of ups and downs will continue.  I also don't really want anything.  I understand that if I work real hard, I can become successful, and that I have opportunity that many don't, and that I am most likely capable of success, but I wonder why. So what if I become rich, have a family, travel or whatever.  Why.  Are those things really worth it, if I have more working hours than enjoyment hours? Now I know there is the phrase pick a job you love and you'll never work, but I don't really love doing many things, let alone doing that for a living, even if a job doing that was guaranteed.  I love bike riding, but wouldn't want to race.  I love programming, but feel trapped in the classic societal 40 hour workweek for the rest of my life (will exceed 40 hours this semester...).  I have no desire for success, so whats the point.  Suicide seems like a one quick fix for all of my problems ever.  I have no consideration for those around me that might be impacted, as I won't be around.  So I am actively looking for something to live for, as the meaning of life is what I give it.  I think I'm spoiled in the fact that childhood/adolescence has given me ample time to enjoy life, and I didn't enjoy it properly (drugs/shitty friends).

My question is, why? Why do anything, when I can just give up and never have to worry about it again.
Sorry for the ultra long post."
5ojs1d,6,2017-01-17,Should I feel bad for getting an internship over a friend,Gullefis,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/5ojs1d/should_i_feel_bad_for_getting_an_internship_over/,"I'm currently doing a sales course that requires a two month internship in a company that will begin at the end of march. 


There are 14 people on my course. A couple of people have found an internship but for the rest of us it's a bit of a struggle. 


I had applied for one before Christmas that I was desperate to get. They delayed giving me an answer until last Friday when they told me it wasn't going to happen. I was really disappointed. 

My mother has some very good friends who are very good friends with another company. When she found out I hadn't got my internship she called her friend for a favor. And I got an interview for today at 5pm. 
I didn't tell anyone in class because I didn't want to jinx it and there is also a bit of a creep in my class and I actually don't want to discuss where I might be working with him. 


So this morning at 9 am a girl on my course comes into class telling everyone that she has to leave at 11 because she has an interview for this company that I'm supposed to be interviewing for. Straight away I feel bad and want to tell her but I don't want to say anything in front of the whole class and most of all this guy so I figure I'll tell her during break time. Turns out break time is delayed and she has to leave before hand and there is no way I can talk to her in private so I wish her the best of luck. By the time she comes back I have to leave (for another appointment I had before the interview). Just before I leave I hear her say that she really wants the job but that they're interviewing one other person and she'll know tomorrow. 


So I go for my interview at 5 and they offer me the internship which of course I accept. 


But now I feel awful for not telling her. In my defense I only found out today at 9 and the opportunity didn't arise for me to tell her in private before she was gone. I certainly didn't go behind her back. I had no idea she had applied. Genuinely no clue. But I'm worried she won't see it that way. What do I do? How do I break it to her? And the class? Was I wrong?"

5okg62,332,2017-01-17,Debbie Diva meets the Doctor,LadyLlamaDrama,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5okg62/debbie_diva_meets_the_doctor/,"Hey ya'll, hope everyone is doing well on this fine day. The last time I left you, we were talking about how DH was just coming home from his internship after being diagnosed with cancer. See Bitch Bot for more info. 

So. DH is home. DH is now terrified because he knows that he has cancer, but nobody really knows how bad it is yet. Debbie Diva is still not convinced that this is bad. In fact, she is annoyed that he came home instead of finishing his internship. Meanwhile, I'm trying to get DH scheduled to see a surgeon ASAP because of the numerous masses that were found during his last imaging scan. My dad recommended a few doctors at a specialty hospital near us that we should go to. So I'm calling and trying to get him in there to be seen as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Debbie talks to a friend of hers who is also a doctor. The friend says to her ""Um. This is bad... Like, I don't know what you've been told before, but this needs to be taken care of as soon as possible."" So now all of the sudden, Debbie is all gung ho about getting DH in to see a doctor as quickly as possible. **No shit sherlock. That's what I've been trying to tell you.** So she convinces her doctor friend to pull some strings and get DH in to see a doctor the next day. Alright. Cool. At least she's now on board. So we go to the appointment, and the doc is nice, but he's not a specialist. He's a general surgeon, which means he can pretty much operate on anything. Debbie is convinced that this is where DH needs to have his surgery because ""we know people here"" and ""you'll be treated like a VIP"". Ya'll. VIPs in hospitals do not exist. All patients are treated the same.

So we're having lunch following that appointment with Debbie. And she's going ON and ON about this doctor and what a nice person he was and how we're going to schedule DH's surgery right away. *Record Scratch* Hold up. No. We're going to go see the specialist that we have an appointment with in two days first. THEN if we decide to go with this doc, we can come back here. So I voice this to Debbie and she immediately gets a HUGE CBF. She looks at DH and says to him ""Oh, by the way, did I tell you that Aunt Marge called last week?"" And DH is like ""No mom, you didn't."" Meanwhile I'm sitting there wondering where the fuck she's going with this topic change and what is has to do with the price of tea in China. So DH says ""What did Aunt Marge have to say Mom?"" And Debbie looks right at me and says ""Oh, she was just wondering how you were doing. And I told her all about the little disagreements we've been having. And she said that maybe you should listen to your family instead of your dick. And that maybe you shouldn't be taking advice from people who might not be here in another few years.""

**Um. What?!**

So I'm just sitting there with my mouth hanging open because *did this bitch really just....*

Meanwhile, DH, for the first time ever, shines up his spine a teensy bit and says in this weird and cold voice ""What did you just say?""

Debbie immediately starts backpedaling. There were a lot of ""Ums"" and ""Ahs"" and ""Wells"" peppered through her bullshit excuses as she tried to make DH see that she was just ""trying to be his advocate"" and ""trying to take care of him"". I just got up from the table and walked away. DH followed, which I know **killed** Debbie inside a little bit. So at this point IDGAF,  I'm just walking away from Debbie because if I don't, I might kill her. So DH catches up to me and starts apologizing profusely, telling me that he can't believe that she said that and that he doesn't even know if his Aunt Marge said those things because that doesn't sound like something she would say... Yadda yadda yadda. So I look at DH who is practically ready to cry and I was like ""DH. I'm not upset with you. Nothing that that bitch just said has anything to do with you. This is a power struggle, don't you see that? She's trying to make you choose between me and her."" And it was like a lightbulb came on in his head. He was like ""Yeah I guess you're right Lady. I just don't know what to do with her."" Meanwhile, my inner Llama is like *Oh I know a few fucking things we can do with her* but I just looked at him and was like ""Listen, for right now, don't worry about it. We'll talk about it later. Let's just put on a united front and ignore her."" (I didn't have a super shiny spine back then either). 

So we go out to the car and wait for her (WHY did I let her drive us?!) and she finally comes out and nobody says anything to anyone. We just drive home in complete silence. So we get to my house and Debbie says ""Okay, so DH when are you going to schedule your surgery with First Doctor?"" And DH says ""Well mom, we're going to go see Second Doctor that Lady found first."" And she fucking loses her shit. She starts talking about how unnecessary she thinks this is and how she won't be going to that appointment because ""She's already taking too many days off of work for this"" and how she thinks that DH is being ungrateful to her friend and how embarrassed she is that people pulled strings for him and he was just going to throw it back in their faces. And DH, bless his heart, stood his ground and said ""I don't see why it's a big deal to seek a second opinion. That's pretty much universally recommended for any surgery, right Lady?"" And I'm just sitting in the back seat trying not to let my smug bitch face show and I'm like ""Yupp DH. Definitely recommended. The appointment is this Friday at 3:00 p.m. We're going. Thanks for the ride Debbie."" And at that I get out of the car and walk into my house.

So Friday comes and *magically* Debbie was able to get off of work to go because ""she'll do anything for DH"". Yay. So this time I absolutely refuse to ride with her because I am NOT repeating that fucking nightmare again and I drive down myself. DH chooses to drive down with me which I'm sure just added to Debbie's fanfuckingtastic mood. So we get down there and I'm just ignoring Debbie completely, because why invite trouble, ya know? So the nurse comes out to call us back and ya'll. I know the nurse. I went to school with her. So she sees me and is like ""LADY! OMG! LONG TIME NO SEE! What are you doing here?!"" So we're walking back to the exam room and my friend is just chattering away with me and DH and completely ignoring Debbie, who has by now, turned a nice shade of puce. So we get back to the exam room and my friend gets DH settled and everything and she says to DH ""Oh, wait until you meet Second Doctor. He is FANTASTIC! His patients just love him. He just got back from a mission trip where he was helping to fix cleft palates in South Africa."" I'm trying not to laugh, because Debbie is CBFing so bad that I'm afraid she might implode.

So Second Doctor comes in and examines DH and tells him exactly what he thinks needs to be done. He had very solid approach and his plan was much better than the one First Doctor was planning. Which might have something to do with him being... oh I don't know... the fucking top doctor in his field? Strange how that happens. So Debbie is sitting there with her big ole CBF on and Second Doctor says to DH ""So, do you have any questions?"" Before DH can even say a thing, Debbie hops right on in. ""Um. I have a question. How many times have you done this?"" So I'm sitting there like /Wut? Did she seriously just ask  this specialist how many times he's done this surgery? Really? Meanwhile, Second Doctor is looking confused AF. So he's like ""Um... Several thousand times. This is one of my most common surgeries."" So Debbie goes ""Well, I personally like First Doctor at Small Hospital much better."" So Second Doctor says ""Okay, well you don't have to have surgery with me, but I definitely wouldn't go to Small Hospital. DH's surgery is going to be a complicated one, and you don't want to have that done at Small Hospital."" So Debbie says ""Well I don't understand why you don't like Small Hospital that much. We just felt so much more comfortable there."" So Second Doctor says ""It's not that I have anything against Small Hospital, it's just that I don't think that they're equipped to handle DH's case."" So Debbie says ""Well I think that we're just going to go where I'm most comfortable."" So Second Doctor looks at me and I just raised my eyebrows and send him a look that I hope conveyed *she's a crazy bitch, please be on my side and convince DH how dangerous this is*.

Second Doctor looks at DH and says ""Listen. You're an adult. I'm going to give you some advice here. I don't care where you have your surgery done. It doesn't have to be here and it doesn't have to be with me. You can go to City Hospital One, City Hospital Two, or City Hospital Three. You can ask for Dr. A, Dr. B., or Dr. C. But please don't have this done at Small Hospital. Because they are not equipped to handle your surgery and I'm concerned for what could happen if you have this done there."" So Debbie starts talking and Doctor Two looks at her and says ""MA'AM. I did not ask you to come down here. YOU sought ME out for a second opinion and that is EXACTLY what I am giving you. If you don't like me, that's fine - THERE is the door. But I am telling you right now that you are putting your son's life at risk if you go to Small Hospital. Like I said, go to any of the others I named, because I trained those surgeons and I'm completely confident in their capabilities to handle your son's case."" With that, he stood up, shook DH's hand, and walked out of the room.

Debbie Diva achieved a level of CBF I didn't realize was possible and I looked at DH and said ""Well. Guess we found your surgeon."" And Debbie Diva sat there and didn't say anything... Oh wait. Of course not... But that's a story for next time. ;)"

My job has me specifically target k-12 accounts, and I was wondering what could I do to help myself generate more business. From working in a data center, and getting sales calls, I learned to not be overly intrusive. I rarely send emails and leave voicemails, and I really try to steer away from anything that has to do with the corny sales stereotypes. 

I was wondering what people in the r/k12sysadmin would like from a sales person (products and behavior), and any other pointers that would help me be a successful sales rep for you guys. Thank you so much in advance! "

5ol87k,260,2017-01-17,My [26 M] Girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years has recently developed an irrational fear of becoming pregnant and its killing our sex life.,Throwaway13378888888,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ol87k/my_26_m_girlfriend_24_f_of_5_years_has_recently/,"I met my girlfriend in college and we both finished our degrees in august and are now doing internships in different cities about 2 hours apart. Our sex-life has been very good for both of us from the beginning on but about half a year ago it became noteably worse and much less frequent. Suddenly, she insisted on using condoms in addition to the pill, stopped initiating sex and only wanted to have sex every 2 weeks or so (previously 2-3 times a week). When we were having sex, it was very lackluster and she seemed very distracted.

I talked to her about it and she told me that she became very afraid of becoming pregnant around that time because her stepsister became pregnant at 19 and only realized it after 5 months so she had to keep the baby. Her stepsister then dropped out of school and left the father of the baby and now lives alone. She also argues a alot with her family because she doesn´t adequatly care for the baby but won´t accept any help/advice.

1 month ago, my GFs *other* stepsister got pregnant at 23 but she doesn´t want kids so she had an abortion which caused a huge fight with her husband who wanted to keep the baby.

Since then, sex has stopped completely. My GF hasn´t initiated once in 6 months and if I initiate now, it´s either migraine, tummy ache or she´s too tired. If we do have sex, she can´t orgasm anymore. She also didn´t take her birthcontrol on purpose multiple times as an excuse so that ""we can´t have sex this month"".

When I talked to her about it she told me that as soon as things get sexual, she can only think of becoming pregnant and how it will destroy her life. I can´t even go down on her or ask for a blowjob without her shutting down completely. When I asked her if she doesn´t miss the sex, she said that right now, the only thing she associates with sex is panic and immense stress and that she would rather not have sex at all at the moment.

Of course I don´t want her to feel bad (so we didn´t have sex since that talk) but I don´t see how this will get better? I love her but I don´t want to be in a relationship without sex forever. Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Are there ways of getting rid of this irrational fear?

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Both my GF´s stepsisters fucked up their lives by getting pregnant involuntarily. My GF can´t have sex since then due to her irrational fear that she will get pregnant from anything sexual despite being on the pill and using condoms. "

I am currently a full-time full-stack software developer and going to be in my sophomoreish year (lots of testing out and summer classes) and I was wondering if I need an internship for my degree. I would hope not because that would mean taking a large amount of time off a well paying job and I need that income. Any comments / advice are appreciated!

Thank you!"
5olhsh,1,2017-01-17,Fortitude Systems: Worth the time?,SonOfSparda304,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5olhsh/fortitude_systems_worth_the_time/,"Have any of you ever been contacted by a company called ""Fortitude Systems""? I have received three calls from them about an entry level embedded systems job opportunity. The last two calls were basically mini phone interviews for them to create some kind of profile of me and my OOP/project experience to send to the company that I would actually be working for.

It sounded sketchy at first. Turns out they got my resume from my Monster profile without me ever applying for anything from them. However, the position they're trying to throw me into is nearby and the pay is decent for an entry level.

Aside from that, the contract would basically be me getting paid hourly as opposed to a salary (though the amount for 2080 is about what I would want starting out) and after six months I would be able to be signed over as an actual employee of the company I would be working for.

Has anybody had any kind of experience with these deals? Are they shady? If at any point these guys ask me for money I'm walking out (shouldn't have to pay to get a job), but it sounds like the company reached out to them to find candidates. This tells me I would likely be competing with many other randoms and the company is probably paying Fortitude Systems to find workers for them.

As a recent grad with zero internship experience, I am basically trying to take what I can get so long as I'm not getting scammed. I appreciate any insight you all can offer either about Fortitude or similar experiences."
5olkiv,5,2017-01-17,Hunt Tips and Tricks,NinjaHedge,testsolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/testsolution/comments/5olkiv/hunt_tips_and_tricks/,"Hi, I'm Michael K.  I really liked solving with TSPI this year, and I saw a lot of questions about how other teams work, and what it takes to be competitive.  I've played on all sorts of teams, from a winning team (Luck), a competitive team that was playing for fun (Palindrome), and also Silly Hat Brigade, Galactic Trendsetters, and Death From Above.

This is my experience from a decade of hunts, if you've got any questions, I'd be glad to share some stories.  

The Hunt is a competition, at the basic level. It is very likely that you will not win.  1 team out of 80 wins every year.  But every team should have a goal, maybe something lofty, like ""Go on the Final Runaround"", ""Finish in the Top 10"", or maybe something smaller, like ""Solve A Meta"".  Whatever it is, make sure a majority of your team is in agreement.  Every couple years, a team wins the Hunt when most of their team didn't actually want to.

""Solving Puzzles"" and ""Having Fun"" aren't goals, because every team is doing that. Solving puzzles is super fun, and they're always available after the Hunt. 

You're trying to unlock things, raise your ranking, and have a sense of accomplishment as a team during a 24-80 hour period.   You've registered a team, paid for travel, and cleared your schedule, you should be trying to do your best.  

Most people think you need lots of hunters to be successful, but this isn't exactly true. Hunts are won and lost based on organization, with the occasional outlier of ridiculously enormous team, or perfect storm of geniuses.  What you really need is a constant stream of solves and an effective method of organization.  

1) Sleep

* Stay up late on Thursday night so that you wake up closer to kickoff, giving you a longer wake cycle. 
* Avoid caffeine for the week prior, then when you have that late night Coffee/Mountain Dew, it'll be more effective.
* Have some people go to bed early on Friday, so that they can wake up early Saturday and have fresh eyes to look at puzzles.  If you look at the graphs of answer submissions, most teams have two hills that reach their peaks on Friday and Saturday night, and two valleys around 3AM Friday, and 1AM Saturday.  
* Unlocking a round of fresh puzzles will always give a team a burst of energy, but if you've been banging your head against the wall on the same few puzzles, get a quick 1-2 hour nap.

2) Leadership

* Choosing one single person to make all your decisions is a really bad idea, because the Captain has to sleep/eat/go to events, and you're stuck if they're not around.  The best method is to use a group of 3-4 team members who agree to respect each others decisions.
* Every 4 hours, any available members of that Team Council check in with the team, finding out what rounds need more answers, which puzzles need fresh eyes, what items still need collecting for scavenger hunts, who is attending events, whether to use hints/free answers, etc.
* The team also needs a Mother/Nanny to take care of the team's physical needs.  Every 4 hours, this role switches to a new person.  This person is responsible for ordering food, organizing the scavenger items, updating the spreadsheets, answering the phone, and making sure the room is clean.  Their word is law for that 4-hour shift, so when they let you know you need a nap/snack, or that you should clean your space, pay attention.
* Every time a solve is made, CELEBRATE the people who made it.  This gets your Pavlovian response a-goin, and helps everyone feel useful.
* Don't focus on the progress of other teams.  I've been on two teams that were actually in the lead of a Hunt, but because of gossip and bad info, thought they were hours behind another team.  The Hunt ends when HQ tells you it does, and there's nothing you can do to stop a team from finding the coin before you.
* If you're really close to unlocking something, going on a run-around, or OMGWTFBBQ.....Winning, wake everyone up, call them at home, and have a meeting with every single person on your team, tell them what you need, and push toward the finish line. 

3) Puzzles

* This is the major area where teams make things not fun. But it's not necessary to trade fun for competitiveness. 
* SUBMIT SUBMIT SUBMIT! There is no penalty for excessive submission of answers. If HQ wants you to lay off, they will let you know. You might feel stupid for submitting countless variations of BUTTSTUFF/BUTTSTIGHT/BUTTSTOUGH, but you'll always feel stupider when it *was actually BUTTSTOUCH*
* Solving works best in small groups of 3-4.  If you're the only person working on something, get a buddy to talk things out with.  If a puzzle already has several people working on the identification or extraction part, you should probably work on something else.
* Unless a puzzle is solved, any method is potentially valid.  However, you don't have to argue or make everyone listen. If you've got a super-crazy idea, duplicate the puzzle sheet, label it ""YOURNAME"" Crazy Idea, and go to town.  If it works, share it with the main sheet.  If it doesn't, you didn't screw anything up.
* If a puzzle hasn't been solved for a while, make sure EVERYONE has taken a look at it, no matter what you think the solving method is.  You might hate cryptics, sudokus, or music ID, but that might not be what the puzzle actually is. You all might agree that this is totally a math puzzle about significant digits, until Ted the Anime Fan realizes IT'S OVER 9000!
* Finding a person who has actual knowledge about the subject will always be faster and better than doing an uneducated Google Search.  Yes, we can all find things using TinEye or Shazam, but an expert could just name those things directly, and also recognize more information or groupings that you can't.

4) Events

* Send the best possible people to events, using the information that was provided by the writing team.  Write their names and numbers down, and remind them 1 hour before an event.
* Bring paper, pen, and a laptop/tablet.  You might not be able to use them at the event, but ALWAYS bring them.
* While at events, everything is fair game.  The answers could be written on the bottom of that paper plate you're eating off of, or inside a pen you received.
* Generally, it will be very clear when you are finished with an event.  If it is unclear, DO NOT LEAVE.  Stick around and ask the organizers if you have everything you need.
* When you finish an event, you will either have an answer that you should submit immediately, or another puzzle.  If you have an answer, call your team and relay it so that they can submit it.  If you have another puzzle, tell everyone what happened at the event, so that they can better understand how to solve it.

5) Food

* Don't purchase foods that need refrigeration. That coldcut tray, yogurt, or guacamole will be smelly and toxic within 6 hours.
* If your team is going to order food in, make sure that everyone takes a little break when the food arrives to find their order, get a drink, and socialize a little.  Then get back to your puzzle.  
* Immediately after you've eaten, throw away your trash.  The smell of old food will kill your energy and make everyone cranky.
* Burritos/Chinese/Subs/Burgers = Good, because they're self-contained in wrappers or containers
* Thai/Barbecue/Wings/Taco Bars = Bad, because they require plates, sauces, and get all over everything

6) Room

* You will likely be doing a lot of things near the Infinite Corridor.  Try to reserve a room near it.
* Get a room with a lot of tables, and reorganize them into squares in the center of the room, and put some tables against the wall.
* If you've got a projector, use it to project your main spreadsheet with solves and answers.  If not, use the whiteboard or chalkboard to update those things.
* You NEED a color printer.  Going on Athena runs is a huge timewaster.  
* If you've solved a puzzle, stand up and throw away all your paper related to it.  A clean workspace is an efficient one.
* Maintenance will come around and remove your garbage if you tie it up and set it outside.  Bring extra garbage bags, paper towels, baby wipes, and air freshener.

7) Team members

* You are part of a team.  You succeed when they do.  It's awesome to solve a puzzle or a meta, but don't let your ego get in the way so that you try to solo things, or get possessive when someone cracks something you've worked on for hours.  Hey, you don't need to work on that one anymore! They saved you from even more stress of banging your head! Go do something more fun!
* You have better things to do than recap several hours of work.  Unless it's needed for a meta, the time for explaining how a puzzle was solved is at wrap-up. 
* Unless it's really important, stick to solving puzzles when you're in the room.  Reading Facebook and playing video games is something you can do literally any other weekend. 
* You're here to solve and have fun, but if the team really needs a specific puzzle/meta to move forward, drop what you're doing and make a team effort.  Then there will be more fun stuff for you to do later.
* If there's currently nothing that you feel like working on, but you're not tired, ask if anybody could use an intern, to write stuff down, Google things, or organize spreadsheets.  You don't need to understand the puzzle, just be helpful.
* Remoting can feel lonely and disconnected.  Voice/Video chats are a necessity. 
* Avoid nicknames or usernames.  Spend 15 minutes before the start of the Hunt to make sure you know everyone's name. Nametags are good, introducing yourself is better.  
* When joining a new puzzle as a remote, let people know you're taking a look at it, and ask what you can do.
* Arguments will kill a team, especially if there's a person on your team who is yelling, putting people down, or being a major bummer.  Talk to your Team Council or Mother about it.  If you're the one dealing with it, make the angry guy take a walk outside, get some fresh air and a snack and get them to apologize.

If they refuse, or keep doing it, **kick them right off your team.**

Well, that was long!  TL;DR Puzzles good! Competition good! Hunt fun! Organization more fun!"

(Please Help),Dompey142,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5olrig/what_do_i_need_to_learn_in_order_to_become_a/,"So I am currently a sophomore majoring in CS and I basically want to become a Software Engineer for a top tech company (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc). I really want to learn the skill sets in order to become an elite applicant for internships in the near future. I have been considering the fact to attend a coding bootcamp and I have been looking at their curriculum. I saw a lot of learning on front end programming with languages like Ruby and JavaScript which got me a little bit confused and these are the questions I have:

1. What are the skills to become a Software Engineer. Do I need to be a Fullstack developer? 

2. Do you recommend to attend a coding bootcamp to build credentials and skills to become a Software Engineer?

Thank You and please I need answers!"

This for a summer intern position, and I am confused on what I should be studying for the interview, what to expect, how early should I get there, what to wear...

Here is the email about all the details - I didn't get anything about wether it would be technical or not...

Schedule:

10:30 - Interview with name, VP of Technology

11:15 - Group Interview with name, Lead Software Engineer; name, Senior Software Engineer; and name, Software Engineer

12:00 - Wrap up with name, Software Engineering Manager

I feel like I should expect the round with the VP to be behavioral/see if I would be a good fit, second group interview to be technical (but why need 3 different guys for an intern position??), and third just going over my results or something.

What do you think? My first interview left off on him asking me what my most comfortable language is and I said Java, and he asked if I liked web, mobile, desktop, etc, and I said I enjoyed android dev the most in my classes, even though I am more experienced in desktop apps. I have no idea what languages or things they would ask me about."

Wheels would not move at all, but engine worked fine. Had to miss my work shift, and get the car towed to the dealership where I bought it.

Found out yesterday that it was transmission failure. $4100. I'm personally frustrated as I need a car to get to/from school and internship and only had the car for 18 months.

Service manager called and started saying how he could get me a used transmission for $2500 and will talk to the parts guys to see how cheap they can install it. I'm just waiting for another phone call to talk more about how upset I am. Right now, I'm fine with the service they gave me.

My NMom, who bought the car originally for me in the first place has been on my back about stuff. Asking constant questions I don't know the answer to. On the phone call this afternoon, she was stage whispering what I should say/talk about and asked for him to be on speaker constantly until I just gave in.

When I hung up she berated me for not saying what I was supposed to say, saying things like ""Did you get his name?!"" And ""You didn't say anything you were supposed to say!""

I'm honestly more upset at her than the car situation right now. I get she has a right to be upset about a car that she forked $6k into. I get that. But I don't like her complaining to me when I don't spout out things when I'm listening to someone else on the phone. I fucking hate interrupting people and she does it. All. The. Time.

I just want to head to my boyfriend's house, but I'm stuck here until car stuff gets fixed. I might just get a taxi to his place tomorrow as it's our anniversary and we both feel crummy."

I've been fed the lie that if you're smart and determined and ready to work, you can get the job you want or at least the job that will provide you what you want. The same old American lie that there's socioeconomic mobility in this shit hole.

I grew up a top student, always As or high Bs. Thanks to AP classes, my high school GPA was actually a 5.0, literally breaking the scale. My SAT scores were among the highest as well. I already knew I wanted to go to med school and be a psychiatrist. I chose one of the top schools, where their med school acceptance rate was 98%. I learned there that med school requires internships, more classes than you can take on a full course load in four years, all things that someone taking a full course load and doing work study doesn't have the time to do. But I stuck course.

Two years in, a family member decided they would no longer cosign for me. I was kicked out and given no transcript or credit. I had sunk thousands of dollars from my own minimum-wage pocket and two years of my life into a degree I was no longer allowed to pursue. But I didn't care. I was still extremely young. I would just start over at my community college, where they didn't ask for a college transcript, only a high school GPA.

No one talked about how community college somehow takes years longer than a university to get you half of a degree. Or how it still cost about 10K a year. But it's the only choice when you're poor and a first generation student.

Five years later, I've watched all of my friends graduate. They're getting Master's degrees now. But I'm finally in the Nursing program I've settled for. The wait list years are over, and I've begun. I might get somewhere now. I've used up my state aid and have only the pittance Federal gives me, about $800 a semester if I'm full time. But I can do this. There are affordable payment plans, right? 

The summer wasn't so bad. Four months to pay. $500 dollars a month which I can just about make along with the $500 rent I pay my own mother who's just as poor as I am. 

I'm halfway through a year of nursing. I have the highest grade in the class. My teachers tell me I'll be an amazing nurse. Several patients tell me the world needs more nurses like me, to never give up.

 The school hikes up the price. Worse, this time, because there aren't the three months of summer, the payment plan only has two dates, making the plan over $1000 a month. Withdrawing and saving up isn't an option because you lose your seat, and you're only allowed to withdraw or fail from the program once.

Once more, I'm years into a degree that I can't continue to afford. 

Once again, I have done everything I could for years and years and spent thousands of dollars and am once again told it's not enough.

Except this time, it was the only hope left. Fucking community college. That magic answer all the Republicans and Libertarian assholes give you. That thing that supposedly even the poorest (what they also infer to be the laziest) fucker can afford. 

But I can't. 

Can't afford university? Go to community college!
Can't afford that? Continue the family cycle of poverty.

My supposedly fiscally 'irresponsible' ass will be asking for a loan tomorrow. 

If I can't get it, I plan on withdrawing quickly enough to get a refund, seeing everything in the world I can with the money--probably not much--and offing myself far away from where anyone in my family can find me. If we're all lucky, they won't even know what happened to me. I like the idea of drowning in the wake of a cruise ship.

They sent back a critique, but it seemed overly critical, and at every topic they would bring up, they would try to push their expensive (for me) service to rewrite my resume. It made it almost seem like a giant ad, and I questioned the integrity of the review as it seemed super negative on purpose so that I would be pushed into taking their service.

[Here](http://imgur.com/tmLBrKH) is my resume. I'm somewhat in an odd transition period where I am coming from being active duty Navy, and doing work in retail, to being a Computer Science Student in college. This resume is really only for internships but I want to be fully prepared for job fairs as I get closer to graduation. 

Ultimately I'm hoping someone on here has used a service from a company before that reviewed their resume in a fair and helpful way, and wasn't charged an arm and leg. Thanks for any help and advice! "
5on6n8,1,2017-01-17,"Forgot How to think like a programmer after a mental breakdown that lasted months,need advice and in deep trouble at work",donefuckupgood,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5on6n8/forgot_how_to_think_like_a_programmer_after_a/,"**This question also falls into counselling stuff but i would like some advice since it's related to programming**

Backstory - 
Had depression since a long time was on medication but high school final's,act's,bunch of other exams along with work pressure triggered something that caused a nasty mental breakdown also the amount of pills i was being fed by my doctor to study longer hours which is pretty common for students in asia.

So basically that happened,i was not able to look at screen's or even read books on my own without having hallucinations and questioning my own existance.This lasted 3 months and took another 4 to come back to normal.


The thing is my memory has been wiped out i cant remember stuff clearly that happened before the mental breakdown specially stuff from 7th grade till highschool and that's when i learned to code and tinker with computers.I even got a internship,won a highschool hackathon,was working on a web scraping project and a puzzle game.

What i have realized is i still remember stuff like syntax but my brain cant sem to figure out how to apply them even things like for loops in simple basic level programming problems like printing shapes made of characters in cmd. 

This stuff used to be really easy to work before,so i want to get back to the level i was at because programming and messing with computers has been the only thing i have loved since i was a teenager and not getting even simple stuff i making me loose sleep.

The worse thing is i have enrolled into a computer engineering degree and not that i would be going into second year of it where we have subjects like data structures,turning machines etc i may have to drop out if things keep going the way they are.

I dont know where to start again,since i just cant seem to apply what i know like i used to to things.I have turned to this sub before for troubleshooting so i hope you awesome people will guide me out through this hell hole.

I forgot to mention i may loose out on a upcoming internship.

TL:DR ; HAVE TO START FROM THE BOTTOM again to think like a dev due to a mental breakdown and have no idea where to begin again. "

My problem is I really don't know what kind of projects I should be working on. I don't think I know enough to do anything that would really impress an employer. While our co-ops don't start until the end of our second year, there are already people in my program who have secured internships for summer 2017, even though we would have only finished two semesters by then.

I would really appreciate advice on projects I could work on, or even things I should be looking into and doing apart from school. Thank you!"
5on8l4,1,2017-01-17,Lost my caregiver and more,moneyferret,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5on8l4/lost_my_caregiver_and_more/,"I've been having a very hard time lately. I'm so sad, life's so difficult, and I don't want to go on. Every day of my life is a struggle with pain and much more. I met an amazing person about six months ago. I had just been bouncing around looking for a caregiver from agency to agency. This person had taken care of family and others and told us she was interested in working with me. My mom and I trained her for about a month and we hired her. We slowly got closer and closer.

She had a lot going on in her life. Brother getting out of prison, mother has lot of health issues, friends are kinda crazy, and partly because of me she separated from her 4 year relationship and starting psudeo dating me. We had bumps along the road, but as of late it's become worse. I would give her gifts, take her out, feed her pets, take her to theme parks and scuba trips and always support and listen to her when she was upset about something.

The past few weeks have been really hard on me. With completing my first semester back, just barely, and dealing with so much else I have felt so alone and discouraged. Largely because I felt I could no longer talk to my caregiver/gf. I would just shut down every time I wanted to say something because I knew she would misunderstand, or I'd get frustrated with her interrupting me and telling me everything she does for me (even though I literally pay her to be here and do a job). As soon as I showed any frustration she'd either get really rude or just walk away. 

This morning I was dejected and was going to say something but said nevermind you'd see it differently than me, which turned out to be more then true. She got really defensive and rude with her answers saying, ""oh yeah I ruined your life."" Even though all I had said is your making me feel like shit right now, because you aren't even bothering to listen to what I have to say. I went outside to cry, after a minute or two of that I decided to go for a drive. As I was getting in she threw my phone in the car. She started to walk away and I said to just leave. I had noted a few days early that I was on my last straw with her and that if she didn't want to even listen to what I had to say she didn't deserve this job. 

I fell out of the car, out of my wheelchair, and scraped my feet really bad. I yelled for help and my caregiver and housemate cane out shortly after her. I told her not to touch me and leave me alone if she wasn't going to bother listening to me. My housemate helped me in the wheelchair and she left for her internship, which I might add she had not actually been completing the 40 hours set per week of my care because of her internship, mother, and friends. 

No matter how many times I tod her to time manage, or that she can't list her job as reasons why I shouldn't be upset. She couldn't do her job and then the past few weeks she would not listen to what I had to say and would constantly walk away when I tried to convey to her that I was suicidal and felt like shit, often because of her lack of care or doing her job. 

Now my mother has to step in again to help me with my morning bathroom routine eventhough she also has a job. I've lost the only person to love me in 3 years and honestly I'll probably never find anyone to love me until I have money or power. I got her a $300 ring for Christmas, my parents gave her so many days off, given her so much of my time and heart, and in the end she couldn't just listen to what I had to say even when I was pleading. 

Obviously there's so much more to this story on both sides but I'm heart broken and scared. I haven't had motivation or hope lately. I want to keep going but at this rate I don't know how long I can keep dragging along. So many people love me, but I'm so burdened and I'm so tired of the pain and having to do so much for myself. It's not fair I didn't do anything wrong, I wasn't born with a disorder. I shouldn't have to live like this."
5onvep,1,2017-01-18,"Me [21/M] living with aunt [~45/F] and her boyfriend [~45/M]. They like to go out and drink beer. Often. I do not. Oh, he's also my boss. How to bring this up?",beerboresme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5onvep/me_21m_living_with_aunt_45f_and_her_boyfriend_45m/,"About to go to bed, don't like paragraphs. I'll keep this in bullet point (ish) format.

Background:

- Just recently graduated from school (university) in the USA. Pretty damned good grades, decentish portfolio for my career area of interest.

- Last summer, wielded the power of nepotism to get an internship at a pretty good company in my field (really good from my perspective - great culture, great people, interesting enough day-to-day on average, better-than-average business practices for my discipline), but in a significantly higher COL area than my first 20.75 years of existence. Aunt helped me look for the jobs in the whole area, boyfriend had a major hand in getting me there to the specific one (had no prior internships).
- Last summer, and now currently post-graduation, I have been staying with both mentioned parties in their home, and not paying rent (I was not asked to pay rent - aunt is big into family-related things and is ecstatic to have another family member consistently within 50 miles let alone 50 meters for the first time in ostensibly decades) while I save up some buffer money/rainy day funds before going out ""on my own for real this time I promise"". Boyfriend is also on board with this and ""since I'm [X]'s family, I'm his family""
- I'm a) introverted and b) Really interested in my own learning and health. Example: Today after work I watched math lectures on YouTube, tomorrow I have plans to play basketball during the lunch break. Either Thursday or this weekend I'll sign back up with the gym I was using over summer. Etc.
- Did I mention in the title that I'm the nepotism hire? Well I am. That doesn't mean I'm not ""good"" - if I wasn't ""good"" I wouldn't have had a remote chance for this company/field combination, but I'm essentially within 25-30 meters of aunt's boyfriend around the clock regardless, he runs the meetings, etc.

Problem:

- They are extroverts for sure. And they like beer. A lot. Breweries almost every weekend, and was asked to tag along to another brewery's opening tomorrow. A Wednesday.
- I, however, preferred to drink once every few months even in school. Even a glass or two is usually enough to leave me groggy and with clouded thoughts most of the entire next day. I got my partying out of my system in high school.
- But, I a) want to make sure they both know how appreciative I feel and b) don't want to somehow come off as a teetotaler snob ""oh I don't like beer I prefer to read thank you very much"" especially since they have done so, so much for me. And also the thing where if aunt's boyfriend (whom I have now known the existence of for ~8.5 months) and I have a strained relationship, I worry my career starts off tragically.
- But BUT I really am trying to make healthier decisions because I'm noticing more these days that junk food/beer/lack of exercise genuinely directly affects my mental state. So far I've been a ""yes man"" and gone out for drinks 3 times in 2017, which is about even with the number of times I went out from August-December 2016.

Ultimate question I'm getting at:

- **How do I approach this subject with them? I really think for my own mental state, I can't keep saying yes to go out drinking, but I don't want to strain the relationship at all for both personal and potentially career reasons.**



  ---   
  **tl;dr**: **broke. living with aunt and her boyfriend in new unfamiliar area. her boyfriend is the only reason I will be less broke as time wears on. they like beer a lot. I am trying to get into better shape partially for my own mental health. DI not want to strain relationship, care very much about all parties involved. Aunt is lovely. Boyfriend is great guy. Situation just ""not my speed.""** "

5ooc8z,3,2017-01-18,How do you remember so much information?,1111211133114641,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ooc8z/how_do_you_remember_so_much_information/,"I'm going to school for CS, but I feel like I forget everything I learn from one semester to another. All of the context-switching between different areas of CS means that I know a little bit about each area I've studied, but not enough to be particularly effective at anything yet. 
Examples: 
- I get confused when switching between different programming languages. 
- After learning about AI and machine learning, it feels like I forgot about object-oriented programming. 

Occasionally, some concept from one of my previous foundational classes will make sense in a whole new light when applied in an upper-level class, but those moments feel few and far between. I get overwhelmed trying to retain all this information, and often  the best I can do is remember the name of a tool/framework/concept and the high-level idea of what it's used for.

This definitely isn't helping me in the process of trying to find my first internship / co-op.

Anyone have strategies to deal with this? When do you feel confident that you really understand something?"
5oofp0,7,2017-01-18,Transferring from Law to IT - worth it?,Pupsbear,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/5oofp0/transferring_from_law_to_it_worth_it/,"Hey guys.

So I've been studying law the last few years (part time). I used to have a love for the law but in the past 6 months to a year I've kind of had enough. I always had an affinity for criminal law, but these jobs are getting ever fewer and far between.

I guess I'm disenchanted with my job prospects after graduation, as nearly every uni is now pumping out law grads at a rate of knots, and the legal industry is continuing to shrink. Internships, clerkships are extremely competitive and considering my grades (only relatively average) I would be hard pressed ever landing such a position. 

So I'm kind of just over it now.

I've always been good with computers, can work my way around most systems with little training. 

I've recently been interested in learning how programs work, ""hacking"" - learning how to exploit vulnerabilities (I suppose similar to in law where you try to exploit a witness's weakness in testimony or prosecution's case) to get an outcome you desire (I've been reading up on ""penetration testing"" and the white hat hacker movement and find it fascinating). 

So I'm really finding myself more and more interested in that area of the IT arena. I have good logic, reasoning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. Along with a tenacious attitude. 

I'm just wondering if it would be wise to transfer across? And if there is really a job market in pentetration and security testing, and how competitive it is.

Thanks guys."

I appologize, if this should not be directly connected to the festival plaza (although somehow connected due to battles, global missions and the fact thaty the gamesync npc is in the plaza).

The pokemon support agents are a bunch of incompetent interns wherefore I did not get any constructive answers. You are my last hope, Obi Wan Kenobi.

I have the following issue: I am living in Japan, bought a Japanese Nintendo 3DS (boy was I stupid... no language settings... my Japanese skills are rather limited) and a Japanese Pokemon Moon version (fortunately, the language can be changed). 
The issue: I am trying to register an account on pokemon gl but everytime when I am trying to log in, it immediately logs out (English settings). If I enter Japan as my region, the whole mess turns into Japanese. After investing a lot of time into google translating the heck out of the menue, it turns out that the menue is only related to Pokemon Go without any possibility to register or gamesync anything.

Did anyone experience the similar issues or could help me out somehow? Thanks in advance for any usefull information! Very desperated after trying to fix this since 2 months.

Basically, this is my first time posting in reddit. If there are any mistakes, please do tell me.

My problem is this, I just graduated from my chemical process engineering degree. After doing an internship in a production site, I was then hired to be an APC engineer by a new chemical company. My internship was 70% programming (developed two softwares with vb.net and vba) while 30% of my time was spent in controlling processes. I guess that is why they hired me for APC.

I have no idea what is installed for me in this career path. I have only done basic process control involving PID tuning, linearization of production as well as implementing a feed forward design on one process. (I had huge help from an experienced engineer doing all of these)

Nobody in my new company knows anything about APC, and I feel like they are thinking as though as I am an expert in these domain. Which clearly, I am not. I love programming. I love process engineering. Is it enough for me to succeed?

I have spoken to one of my friends who is an APC engineer, but she is currently working faraway from me and she will not be able to help me. She told me that when she first started, there was already someone in her company guiding her throughout. And she feels that I am gonna have a tough time doing APC alone.

So, please, if there is any APC engineer out there, could you please provide me with some assistance on what I should know, what I should do, and what I should expect being a beginner as an APC engineer.

Much appreciated."

5opx4i,12,2017-01-18,[Update] After a really crappy year... things still aren't getting better.,oneblazeofglory,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5opx4i/update_after_a_really_crappy_year_things_still/,"Update because someone asked me to. Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5mulgi/after_a_really_crappy_year_if_anyone_has_the_time/

Summary: Waited 9 months for a job that I'd been formally offered, gave up our apartment during the wait believing it would come through soon and it didn't so moved last-minute, eventually job disappeared into thin air. Moved to another country with my partner, can't find a job here and only have until March to do so otherwise I'll have to return to my home country. Really heartbroken, losing faith in God, having anxiety attacks on an extremely regular basis. Had job interview last week which would have been amazing to get... 

...and, of course, I didn't get the job. Safe to say, both of us are really disappointed - the 8 hour drive down to the other side of the country for the interview cost a lot of money, half of what that we had left to live on, and considering that the only income we have is my other half's student loans, which isn't enough to cover bills, rent and food, we're really upset and feel like God has abandoned us in the midst of all of this. I really feel like I've done everything to have faith in God, put it in his hands, and believe that he'll bring us through this, but it's been over a year since all of this started and it doesn't seem to be getting any better - we're in the same situation that we were in back in my home country, except that our job situations have switched and he's gone from having a crappy retail job to a great internship and I've gone from having a great job (on paper) to looking at working at the airport as a waitress because I can't get anything else despite my experience, which is a thought that makes me really disappointed / angry / upset / everything bad. It's not that I feel like I'm somehow above that kind of job or anything like that, but it's more that I feel like I've somehow failed and that I'm going to have to fight my way up from nowhere again, having already done it once at home. I feel so abandoned and ignored by God. 

I don't really know what else to do. I probably should have applied for more jobs during this time, but I've just felt like it's all pointless because I'm having no success and that's been giving me anxiety attacks. I'm also pretty lonely here - I have barely any friends in this country, and they all live at least a half hour drive away and are students or working, so they don't have time to hang out with me while I'm unemployed. I don't understand why God brought me to this country, and put me through all the stuff from last year, and whilst I understand that there's probably a reason why he's not giving me a job that will put us back on the right track, don't understand why he isn't answering my outcry for him to just show me what to do or how to be - I feel like I'm praying to a brick wall. It's really shaking my faith in God, and whilst deep down I can't let go of my faith quite yet, the cracks are getting deeper and deeper. My other half won't be working a paid job until at least June when his internship ends, and the last thing I want him to do is give up and get a paid job because he wanted to work in this field for so long and finally he has his chance, but if the best I can get is a waitressing job we're still only *just* going to be able to afford to live at all. 

What do I do? Where is God in all of this? How do I keep going? 

Sorry that this is long and probably a bit rambly, but I decided to just type and see what came out. I don't really know what I want to ask for in this post either. I just feel really miserable and at a dead end. Thanks for reading. "

I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how I even got the those opportunities, probably faked it really, but I really am stressed out. At the time, I had some working knowledge of code, but now that I've been busy, I haven't had the time to really have fun with programming assignments. And for one of my internships, I need to relocate to SF and while it would not be a problem, I just haven't been able to relax since the beginning of the school year.

I also teach a coding class for Girls Who Code here in Santa Clara, CA and someone wanted to work on our club's idea. They're talking about creating a company off it and I would be working side by side with them with my girls. We already have sponsored by another company and they want to be a part of our idea. However, Facebook had given us our original funding and idk what that entails (our features connect to FB and they like the idea). I really hope this doesn't become some *Silicon Valley* remake because that show already gives me anxiety. 

They're looking for undergrad lab researchers at my school and I would be really interested in doing something not as intensive as a internship. Or just working at Starbucks or a coffee shop of some sort. On r/cscareerquestions, they told me to go for the internship and not to worry about not knowing enough but...

It's just not that... I'm stressed. I'm 19 with so much to worry about. I spent so much of my life rushing and trying to get ahead. Fall quarter was just internship applications and networking.

I just want to be 19. I want to be able to take care of my health instead of being depressed and sitting on a computer all day. One of the girls in my sorority told me that I was chosen because I could contribute a lot of ""publicity"" for the sorority, I wasn't top pick because I didn't take enough selfies on my Instagram. I was so embarrassed when they told me that because I was an average pick for them.

Just need a place to vent. I'm just beyond stressed and I feel like all of you are the only reason why I know I'm not the only one with these kinds of worries. Thank you for taking the time to read this all lol "

Ordinarily I would be extremely happy about this, but they stipulated that the interview would be an all-day event next Tuesday, during which I have class.  When they mentioned this, I said that I have a few classes on Tuesday, and they essentially replied that, since I was the 3rd person they called and not the 1st, I had better plan on missing all my classes on Tuesday if I wanted a chance at the job.

Now I would love to get an interview with this company, but I don't want to miss a bunch of classes to do so.  I'd like to suggest a different interview date/time, but from their response to me saying that I have classes on Tuesday, I believe they'll just forget me and move on to other candidates, and eventually they will get enough people to agree to a Tuesday interview (note: when I was talking with the recruiter over the phone, she mentioned that one of the people she had contacted before me had also declined because of classes on the interview date).

So my question is whether or not I should suggest a new interview date, or just take the hit to my classes and agree to a Tuesday interview date.  I'm also supposed to have a response by this afternoon, so any suggestions would be appreciated."
5or079,3,2017-01-18,Edgelord kid believes in the zodiac. SMH.,Antislacker,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/5or079/edgelord_kid_believes_in_the_zodiac_smh/,"Don't get me wrong. I think birthstones, the greek and chinese zodiac signs, etc. are cute and not a big deal. I understand that there are always superstitious people who believe the craziest things. But if you're a junior in high school, and you actually BELIEVE in the ""zodiac fire"" garbage posts on fb and tumblr about how ""these signs tell it like it is,"" something is VERY wrong with you. It's common knowledge how easily you can be tricked into thinking any of these predictions written by ~~an intern at buzzfeed~~ gurus are true about yourself.

Obviously I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking a ~~friend~~ acquaintance who I have recently stopped giving a damn about. From the moment I met them I knew something was wrong with them. They wanted to know all about what I was interested in. When I told them various things, they acted like they were interested in the very same things, even though they obviously had no clue about any of the topics. For example, they said they were into car culture, but they had no idea what Datsun or Liberty Walk was. They just said ""they liked the loud cars."" *What did you just say?*

I brushed this off as them just wanting to make a good impression and to get my affirmation. But what I didn't realize at the time is that this person's identity is so malleable, Hitler mustaches could become the next emo trend and they would do it just to fit in. After apparently getting bored with trying to copy me, they started copying the behaviors of some questionable friends. All of a sudden, they were a massive fan of twenty one pilots and other overhyped emo heartthrobs. They dyed their hair, started wearing wristbands, and *basically every other recommendation on the wikihow I saw them visit.*

Oh, and they apparently became an atheist ~~on the recommendation of a cretin~~ on their own accord. Just the month before, they told me about how they want to have a relationship with Jesus and how they wanted to go on a missions trip to inner-city Chicago. *So it was all an act? Not cool.*

I'll be the first to say that I'm not a sanctified holy roller. I'm honestly a terrible person, but I'm not in denial of God. I've seen some angelic and demonic things that go beyond getting a good feeling at church service. Think unexplainable miracles and demons getting cast out of people. I even shared some honest firsthand testimonies of these events with them. And now, they're posting smartass atheist image macros and crap ~~to impress others~~, along with zodiac fire crap. 

So you'd sooner accept some shallow motivational crap on the internet as *divine truth ordained by the cosmos* than an eyewitness account of a man being freed from demons in the name of Jesus? Okay. Have fun with that. By the way, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun are Christians too. Do you think they're also retarded?

""I'm a pisces, that means I'm independent, stable, and a free thinker..."" No, you're you, and you are not necessarily any of those things. I swear, I am so sick and tired of people my age begging to be told who they are by everyone else. Society farts rainbows about how you should ""be yourself,"" but it's almost always a lie."

I have it all online, it's just easier since most of my work is video and social media content. 

My brother asks if he can look through my laptop real quick before I leave, so I let him use it while I grab all my stuff. He hands it back and I make it there with about 15 minutes to spare. Since I had some time I figured I'd double check to make sure my portfolio site was ready to go. I open my laptop... and it dies. Instantly. While I'm panicking, the receptionist tells me HR is on their way out, so I power my laptop down and hope that fixes it.

The interview is going fine, then they ask to see work examples so I turn on my laptop and nothing happens. I'm frantically looking around the space to see if there's a computer I can use but there isn't. I ended up apologizing and giving them the URL. I also emailed it to them later from my phone.

This happened Monday, and my laptop is still being repaired. I'm told it was a hard drive issue. I have no idea how it happened so fast, but it really was the worst possible time. I'm so embarrassed that I wasted their time. Tough lesson to learn, I need to find some way to get my portfolio in paper form or something.

My undergrad should be completely covered without loans, and I also have ~$46k that I plan on setting aside for grad school.
Right now I have it in a four fund portfolio at Vanguard:

* VBTLX - about 43%

* VTSAX - about 36%

* VGTSX - about 10%

* VTIBX - about 10%

Is this a decent allocation, assuming I want modest but safe returns over the next 2-3 years? I originally went for a 40-60 allocation (though that has shifted due to stock market performance), but bonds have not been doing very well since I originally set up this fund about a year ago.

What, if any, changes would you recommend to this allocation? Should I go a bit more aggressive or even more safe?

More info: I don't really plan on paying for all of my masters out of pocket, and I may not even go immediately after undergrad. I just want this money to be there when (if) I need it. This will help cover moving expenses, tuition, all that stuff, though I do hope to get at least part of it paid by teaching or doing research. I also expect to continue to intern (contributing to my Roth a good deal while I'm at it) and if I get an offer at a company I like, I may delay graduate school for a bit.

The fun part about this setup is it lets you create your character without breaking play, and has all the options you could ever want. So, first comes my original prompt, which also contains the original promotional material.

Short Note: Read from the top down. The lower sections contain information you'll only be interested in if you like the previous stuff. If you would like to make suggestions or ask question before diving all the way in, please do! I understand that you would want to get a handle on this before committing!

Also, this is *not* a hucow prompt. It's all about genetic research and selective breeding. Women will be treated as human beings and willing test subjects, but this world does have... *relaxed* views on sexuality. Chalk it up to a near-apocalypse that drastically reduced the human population to the point things just barely got back to normal, and now it's seen as an honor to be selected for advanced breeding. Pregnancy and fertility are desirable traits in this world, so keep that in mind.

Ideally, I would prefer my partner to be the head of Research and Development and the Facility. Your job would be to design, monitor, and administer fertility treatments and gene therapy. However, this job description is up for negotiation, considering the Facility is always open to new research. As the Director of Operations, I expect you to focus on your work at first, but you could convince me to let you engage in deeper, crazier research or eventually use yourself as a test subject or breeder.

Grammatical or spelling errors will be cheerfully tolerated, because no one is a good editor when excited. I am looking for a writing partner, so be prepared to write a paragraph of at least five to seven complex, detailed sentences. Describe what you feel, what you do, and what you think as well as what is going on around you. The more you give me, the more I can give back.

One or two sentence replies a la ""I fucked it."" will not be tolerated. If you're looking for a quick, superficial exchange, then I am not your man. No offense, but I prefer a really good, involved story, preferably with some stupid humor mixed in.

Kinks: Breeding (no shit...), dubious and full consent, bondage, humor, bodywriting, cumplay, and a whole slew of other things made apparent later

Maybes: Futa (it would be interesting to have a subject that can both impregnate and be impregnated), military (maybe we can explore a top-secret genetics project), bestiality (combine the conventional farm with the unconventional, add some science, and I might be convinced to see where it goes), furry (maybe we go absolutely crazy with genetic research) 

Limits: Non-con (okay, I could be convinced to do a really good non-con plot, but it's gotta be good), bimbo (we want good genetics), violence, blood, toilet play

Sitting behind my wide mahogany desk, my corporate email for the Facility's directorship pings a notification that a profile had just come in from our latest recruitment effort. The Facility recently got in contact with fertility clinics and private practice doctors to offer our services to an expanded clientele base. Considering the participants in our can only be impregnated once every twelve months or so, much of our insemination equipment was sitting idle. We decided to offer the equipment to those seeking sperm donors, allowing them to pay for our services and keep the child. We also started a Bring Your Own Sperm program for couples having difficulty conceiving or just looking for a way to liven up their babymaking.

Clicking open the application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting cows strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure you should do this the right way. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

*Dear Applicant,*

*Thank you for your inquiry about services with our Human Resources Office! We are very excited to hear about your interest in continuing your research with us, and the Facility would love to support your ambitions for innovation! All we need is some basic information to finish your application, and we can get you on your way!*

(Or insert some other office to which you are replying. Hell, maybe you got this by accident and are contacting Customer Services, which totally isn't what you think it is. Get it? Services? HAHAHAHAHA... ah, fuck me...)

DEPARTMENT APPLIED TO: (enter the project to which you applied. Feel free to make something up if it's extra sexy to you! Hell, we could make a Reproductive Pleasure department, if that's what you want.)

PROJECT APPLIED TO: (Get very, very creative with this. The more thought you put into this, the better the roleplay.)

REASON APPLIED: (Get creative! The more you write, the more I can incorporate down the road!)

EXPECTED SALARY:

NAME:

AGE:

SEXUALITY:

EYE/HAIR COLOR:

HEIGHT/WEIGHT:

MEASUREMENTS:

UNIQUE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES: (Feel free to add interesting physical quirks that might make yourself more attractive to a genetics project!)

PREGNANCY STATUS: *If ""Yes,"" please fill out attached Father Verification Form. If ""No,"" please have fertility status verified by a certified doctor or with the included approved instrument.*
FERTILITY STATUS: *Percentage displayed on the instrument will be most accurate during or immediately following an orgasm. The instrument can accommodate this necessity.*

CURRENT MEDICATION: *Please include any and all medication, including birth control.*

RECENT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS: (Get creative!)

JOB EXPERIENCE: (Again, creativity will be rewarded!)  *Please include any majors, minors, concentrations, and advanced degrees.*

PROPOSED AREA OF RESEARCH: 

INTERESTS: *Let the Farm know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Farm should know, please use the provided space.*

GOLDEN GENESE PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Facility is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Put on the headband and collar, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash and a guided tour of the Preggoridge Farms facilities.*

*A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable gene carrier that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, and a private interview with the Director himself! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required.* (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little breeder, but tell me how you made it! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)

---------------

Okay, if you haven't noticed, I write a lot. I love detail. Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, chiasmata... These things are all my friends. I do not expect you to be able to fully match the way I write. Humble brag, but I hold awards for my SFW writing. If you can match or exceed me... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! If you want me to help you improve your writing while having some sexy fun... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! Just please, please make the effort!

So, in regards to how I want you to start, fill out the form and send it in. I will judge our compatibility based on the scene you write about flipping through the promotional materials and reacting to their contents.

Maybe you really like the technical documents displaying women becoming mothers from the machines whirring between their legs. Maybe the pictures from Live Audition with new, young test subjects caught the moment they feel their first child squirting into their wombs. Maybe you really like the diagrams of the combination breeding/milking racks, showing warm white fluid entering a woman between her legs and leaving from her chest. I don't know, so you gotta tell me. Dig through that recruitment package and find the things that make you excited! There's a reason we send out these packages!

For example, maybe you were watching ""Eighteen and Pregnant"" when the recruitment package arrived. Firing up the probe, you affix a ""For Hire"" sticker over your lower stomach and a ""Wide Loads Welcome"" to your inner thigh. Bending your back over your couch, you arch your breasts into the air, displaying the flat stomach you were applying, no begging, to have ruined. The bright stickers flash as the probe burrows into your folds. You writhe, imagining the warm metal spewing the thick, life-giving fluid into you that you could never convince a man to give up. It feels almost as good as you imagine it will when you win the Grand Prize, placed on a pedestal upon which motherhood will be pumped into you. Your walls clamp down hard as an orgasm rocks your body. The probe lights up, displaying a disturbingly high percentage, your womb sucking eagerly at the tip of the probe. That's when the camera clicks, catching your body in its full, hungry glory. Looks like we got ourselves a winner... (This was an example. Write your own!)

I wrote that part in because it's so much easier to bring someone in as the Grand Prize winner, and also a lot more fun. It lets me be excited to meet you, and not just ""Oh, boy... Another womb..."" So, give it a shot? The form is meant to be an exposition of what you want from the roleplay, and that part was good, but you gotta give me more to work with if you want the really good stuff.

Holy shit, if you read all that... you are awesome."

I am currently a sophomore pursuing my bachelors in comp Sci and am starting to look at applying for possible summer internships.

As of now I've only taken programming courses with Python, C++ and Java. Albeit I did well in the courses, I'm not positive this is enough to work with. Is it possible with this small amount of experience to find an internship with programming? if so, does anyone have recommendations as to what to apply for or what companies to look into?

*Hi everyone,*

It's that time again and with the competition getting fiercer every year, here are a few tips to benefit the most out of the TCF.

This year, the TCF is on **January 26th** and runs from 10am to 4pm.
[Facebook Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1330074267058521/)

***
***

**Interested in a company?**

1. Do some research on what they do at the fair - most participants have come to the fair before with the exception of a few companies.

 For example, Nvidia and Whitepages will give out mini coding exams; brushing up on your C++/C and logic might be the key on impressing a recruiter for those companies.


2. Other than that, you should dress for the job you want (not an excuse for programmer casual) and make sure your resume is to the point. There are drop-in sessions for resume editing offered by Diane Johnson from the career and planning office.

 Remaining Sessions:
 - Fri. Jan. 20, 2:00 – 4:00 pm
 - Mon. Jan. 23, 11:00 am – 2:00 pm

    A sign up sheet will be posted on her office door by 10:00 am on each date.


3. Moreover, bring extra copies of your resume - companies are here to hire and are interested in you. There is a paytoprint station in ICICS basement and in the Cube (ICICS 021) in case you need extra copies.


4. Also look up what you're interested in at a company and bring it up when you have a chance. Recruiters want to see a fit.

 Ex: I brought up UI/UX at YouTube Gaming at the Google booth and they took my resume even though they weren't hiring undergrad interns for SDE - had a interview with them during the summer as a result. 
***
***


**Some Company Profiles From Memory**

* **Amazon**

 Basic interaction with recruiters; people that they short list will end up in large group interviews from which they weed out people even further.

* **Google**

 Unfortunately, Google doesn't hire undergrad interns (at this point of the year) but a recruiter *may* take a resume if you ask nicely. They're mostly here for grads.

* **Nvidia**

 Nvidia brings a coding challenge to the career fair; they expect you to write it in C or C++ but you can try persuading them to let you use Java if necessary. Usually one tough question and a bunch of filler to weed out the unprepared.

* **Microsoft**

 MS normally is the basic interaction with recruiters; I've heard that this year that they've overbooked intern positions so I don't know if they're hiring (but they're coming regardless).

* **Whitepages**

 Also brings a coding challenge - their challenge is centered on a seemingly impossible situation which you then have to use logic/problem solving skills to solve.

5osmhn,0,2017-01-18,A suggestion to fix 2 of WotC's biggest problems: lack of player rewards + boosters being an objectively bad purchase.,ProxyDamage,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5osmhn/a_suggestion_to_fix_2_of_wotcs_biggest_problems/,"I don't think I'm being ""controversial"" when I state that Wizards of the Coast has 3 gigantic problems regarding Magic the Gathering:

#1 - There is essentially no reward for 99% of players to attend Wizards sanctioned events  

I get it that the old ""Player Reward Program"" could have gotten too costly, after all making new promo-exclusive cards all the time and individually shipping them to thousands of players around the world could quickly become too much investment for their return. However, the current ""rewards"" in place are frankly no rewards at all as the overwhelming majority of players statistically cannot ever go to a GP event - statistically, they can't, as only a very small number of people qualify. On top of that there's all the people that play Magic but have no serious aspirations of ""going pro"". It's nice that the ""tour"" exists, but for the overwhelming majority of players it's literally irrelevant. 

Thus going to events, particularly for players who don't feel like they can consistently place in the rewarding half of the bracket or are still putting together their decks, can often feel like a waste of money better spent... putting their decks together. Or just inviting their Magic-playing friends (often most of the same people they'll meet at local events) over for some drinks and MTG. Statistically, it can be hard to disagree. 

#2 - Buying card products (boosters, pre-cons, fat packs, etc) from WotC is almost always **a financially irresponsible and inefficient decision**.

Don't get me wrong, cracking packs is fun, I like doing it too once in a while... But so is any other form of gambling. The uncomfortable correlation here is that they're also both a waste of money in the overwhelming majority of the time. In fact, with the possible exception of the pre-con Commander decks, which so far have proven themselves to be a good investment both for the cards as well as for the intended use of the deck itself, ***you should never buy cards from Wizards if your purpose is to put together a deck. Ever.*** Buying singles from your LGS (if they're legitimate at least) or from a trustworthy website is ***always*** more efficient both in time and price unless you get absurdly lucky (i.e.: you win the metaphorical lottery). And it's not even close. 

At this point I think it's safe to say that it might not be ideal for WotC, a business, when the objectively best decision for most players is to simply effectively never do business with them. Instead go through secondary markets or bypass them entirely. And yes, secondary markets are great, and admittedly I'm not a business major or anything, but I would think that while a secondary market is a very healthy thing for a game like Magic, it's probably not ideal when it's also the ONLY objectively correct way for people to acquire Magic-related products unless they want to gamble. As a business, you might want your target audience to...do business with you? No? Am I crazy? But what do I know...

#3 Wizards also has the old time issue that getting into MTG can be a prohibitively expensive habit.

Standard rotates fast enough that more casual players can often feel like they JUST put their decks together when they need to start spending more money changing it or building a new deck entirely to stay competitive, and while eternal formats are more stable (bans and meta changes aside) it's also MUCH more expensive asking a new player to sink hundreds of dollars at the very least, and quite often around a cool grand or more, before you can even sit at the table with the others to play some rounds.

**But what if I told you Wizards could fix or significantly mitigate all of these issues with one simple, and nearly costless, move?**

Imagine if you will, that when you go to an event you are awarded some points - some guaranteed for just showing up, and some more depending on placement and/or event itself (bigger, more important, events granting more points). 

""You mean planeswalker or GP points or whatever they are!?""

No. Those would still be there of course, but I meant something else entirely. Let's call these **Magic Points** for now.

And let's also say that when you crack open a booster or pre-con deck you'll look at that previously useless piece of garbage advertisement card at the end (because why the fuck are you advertising to the people *already buying your product*, but different conversation entirely) and see a little code or QR code or something that you can either set into the MTG webpage or scan with a WotC official app (btw Wizards, there's a reason companies all want one of those these days) and, once again, it'll grant your account a small amount of these mysterious **Magic Points**! 

""But Proxy, what would these hypothetical Magic Points be for!?""

Thanks for asking! On the official MTG page and/or app you could then log in and, if you add enough points... 

...Wait for it...

...Brace yourself...

...

**...You could use these points to order cards directly from Wizards of the Coast.**

I know, I know, insane, but stick with me here for a moment:

* Obviously the higher the rarity the more points the card would take to order. Mythics and rares would still be rare and hard to acquire.
* The only way to get these points would be to go to Wizards sanctioned events or by buying Wizards products - i.e.: by giving Wizards money in the first place.
* The ""value"" of the points would be calibrated by WotC directly, and wouldn't even need to be particularly high. For example, imagine if after buying a display pack (you know, the ones worth nearly $100) or the equivalent amount of boosters you got enough Magic Points to order, say, a non-foil Mythic (or *GASP* maybe 2!) of your choice? Or maybe enough for a play set of rares...? Imagine if attending 10 official events (which averages what, $150?) you got enough for that same Mythic (or two!?). Maybe cracking a fatpack (approximately $35-$40) or equal amount of boosters would be enough for a playset of uncommons, maybe a rare or two. Does this sound unreasonable?
* **The player pays for shipping** - Cards don't cost much to ship, but mailing thousands of cards all over the world gets expensive. Also would discourage people from doing many small orders and instead order in bulk, which is easier to process for WotC.
* This offer could be restricted to currently printing sets, so ***if nothing else***, on a ""absolutely lowest cost/effort possible"" all this would cost Wizards is the website changes (and adding more reasons for people to visit your website should honestly pay for itself no?), cards already in printing (remember, a Mythic costs them as much to produce as a draft chaff - not much) and very minor labor costs of having an intern mail shit to people (again, we're paying for the shipping). No new cards are being made. No special art or printing line being produced. 

...and what would this accomplish? Let's see:

* Suddenly attending events becomes rewarding **for everyone** as a small fraction of the cost you're paying is going towards completing your deck or collection. Certain you won't top 8? Well, at least you get a good experience and you get 1/10th of the way closer to owning your very own Planeswalker of choice! Are you planning to top 8? Maybe even win? Hell, that might put you a 1/4th of the way there or something! I like the sound of those odds. 
* Buying MTG products, such as boosters, would perhaps not be the quickest or most efficient way to acquire a specific deck, thus not devaluing the secondary market significantly, but it would at least be a reasonable gamble - worst case scenario, if you pull only junk, you always get a little closer to the cards you really need. Can you imagine a world in which cracking packs isn't exclusively a waste of money!? You might even want to give Wizards money!? Crazy, I know.
* It suddenly becomes a little easier for new players to put together a Standard-viable deck and get into the world of Magic the Gathering we all know and love. If every official event you attend and every official product you buy gets you a little closer to a real competitive deck it takes some of the weight out of having to just dump a few hundred dollars on the secondary mark before there's any reason for them to attend an FNM and get to know people. 
* As a side effect this would allow Wizards of the Coast to keep a little bit of a leash on secondary market prices and prevent cards from becoming massively inflated (sometimes artificially) by making them more available and providing a ""ceiling"" of sorts. Is that new fancy creature everyone wants reaching $50!? Well, people will just start using their points to buy those naturally bringing the price down to a more acceptable level. An escape valve, of sorts. Better yet, given that WotC would control this valve they could easily tweak it as necessary. Too many Mythics? Just raise the ""point price"" a bit. Too few? Lower it a little bit. Like magic!

Just the simplest, most basic, and minimal cost implementation of something of this kind should immediately have an overwhelmingly positive return in the form of player interest, retention, and perhaps the most important, more people buying MTG products and attending MTG events than ever before.

But let's say Wizards of the Coast wants to put *some* extra effort into it, go above and beyond... You know what they could do? Wait for it...

Wizards could even have rotations or time limited events of special high demand cards of older formats no longer in printing, for extremely high ""point prices"", that would nonetheless function as additional escape valves for important cards now reaching extreme prices (e.g.: Tarmagoyf, an extremely important creature for most eternal formats costing **upwards of $100 dollars**) be a little more accessible (and thus causing the price to drop a little) **which would**, imagine if you can, **make their older formats a little more accessible and significantly less daunting for new players**. By keeping the ""point price"" very high (think maybe the price of 4 mythics for a single of these ""classics"") and the offer time limited, Wizards would very easily control that particular escape valve and easily prevent a flooding (and consequently devaluing) of these staples, while also letting them become significantly more affordable and attainable. It would also act as a ""point sink"" away from Standard cards as these ""Timeless classic"" cards would be severely overpriced compared to ""Standard equivalents, and you only have so many points. 

Yes, reprinting old cards could cost a little more, but I don't think it's hard to argue that making these older formats that much more accessible (and therefore vibrant and revitalized) **by making people spend money on Wizards products** would provide an immediate and significant return on investment - **particularly as it would be a return on a format that currently gives you nothing, as these players can't buy these products from you anymore**.

So Wizards, I'm giving you plenty of reasons why you should, my turn to ask: **""Why not?""**

Thoughts? 

**Edit:** Title is now wrong as I changed the body to 3 different issues instead of just 2.... Well, buy 2 get 1 free I guess!

**Edit #2: To clarify something: The point ""prices"" would be adjusted so it would still be cheaper and more efficient to buy singles as the primary form of putting a deck together. This is not about pushing secondary retailers out of the picture. This is just about making it slightly more rewarding to buy official products and attend official events with actually valuable rewards (cards you can use) that cost WotC almost nothing to create (as they're cards that already exist). The values I mentioned are just hypothetical and would obviously need adjusting.**"

Undergraduate business school ranking (Is top 15 P&amp;Q ranking worth anything)?

Work experience (2.5 years at application, 3.5 at matriculation)

APICS Certification (Certified Supply Chain Professional)

Quality of Work experience (Fortune 30, Fortune 250, Fortune 100 internship)


I appreciate any and all feedback! "
5ossxd,5,2017-01-18,Smoking Cannabis on Criminal Record?,TwelvePac,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5ossxd/smoking_cannabis_on_criminal_record/,"Hello,

So i'm a first year university student in Canada.

Without thinking much, my friend and I decided to smoke weed in our dorm room. (Commonly done in my university, we were among the first to get caught)

Immediately residence staff members noticed a smell and came knocking.

Because of common procedure they immediately rang campus police and within minutes a couple cops arrived at our dorm.

The cops yelled at us and confiscated our weed (less than 1g) and equipment (bong and grinder) and told us that they'll be putting this on our record. Then, at the end, they asked us if we could turn anyone in with large sums of weed in their room in exchange for not having this being put on our record. My friend and I knew no one and we said no, the cop said 'seriously?' and said nothing after that regarding whether this will be put on our record. He then asked for ID, but neither of us had it with us and we asked if we should go down a couple rooms to get our ID and the cop said 'no', just give me your names and phone number'.  

It has been a couple weeks and nothing else was said about whether this will be put in our criminal records. And after asking around, most people said the cops were just scaring us to get us to turn someone in.

I am now increasingly worried because I want to get a job in the summer and I am afraid that having this on my record will prevent me from that.

Is it possible for something to go into your criminal record without getting ID'd? Would you get a formal notice if something is put on your record? Do you think the cop was bluffing to get us to turn someone in?

Honestly anything would help and I am very worried right now because i've always been a high achiever and I want to try to land a lucrative internship over the summer.

Please advise

I am at a bit of a crossroads, and can use some sound advice.

I just turned 26 and so am now disqualified for my parents GI Bill, and for that, and other reasons, cannot continue going to school for the time being.

I am a little over 2 years into my CS degree and worked as a Software Engineering Intern for a year at a fairly large hardware (mostly EE rather than CE) company.

I really need to find an entry level job that pays at least a decent salary, 50-60k. I am willing to work anywhere in the US.

If you were in my position, and had roughly 5 months, what would you do? Assume that I need roughly a month to properly prepare for interviews.

Do you think I have a reasonable shot of success, or should I radically change my plan? I know it's ""possible"", but I really need ""probable"". I'm not sure many will give me a chance to interview for full-time positions.

I would really appreciate it if you did not try to make me feel better, by being optimistic. I have real decisions that I need to make, so hard facts, experienced opinions, and job hunting strategies if you think it's probable.

Thank you :)

I (23M) am in college, trying to get an internship, but my life does not have any major difficulties at the moment.


My boyfriend (23M) and I finished a computer technician course a year ago (this is where I met him).
Apart from odd jobs, he also got an internship at May 2016, and was very happy with it. 
He was to get a job on the same company at the beginning of 2017. However, due to budget cuts, he (and a lot of people) got laid off.


He was already pretty depressed about not getting a job before, and now he is so, so sad...
He lives with his parents and from what I gather they are pretty toxic people. They hardly speak, and tension is very high.


Anyway, due to these circumstances in his life, he's considering getting a job outside of our field of work, changing to a state where life costs are lower and there are more opportunities etc.
I thoroughly agree with this; I intend to stay with him and support him, even if I have to bear with the long distance.
However, he tells me that he is undeserving of me, is only losing time and life while I am sucessful, has no future, and that if he were to do that (change field of work or location) he would rather not speak with me until his life gets better.


While I can understand all that, I don't really comprehend it.
He'd rather separate from me if he feels he adds nothing to the relationship, even though I say constantly that he adds a lot.
He thinks I idealize him, that I'd be better of without him etcetera.


He is really dear to me. Difficult times come to everybody, I wanted to stay with him through that. I really don't get it. Does anybody have advice or went through a similar situation?


TL;DR: Boyfriend can't land a job, feels that he is undeserving of the relationship we have, and may want to leave in the near future if things don't get better.

I've just started a web dev internship at a local textile printing &amp; embroidery business.  My job is to get their website up and running.  The website is currently using an InkSoft template with a built-in design studio so that customers can create and order designs.

There are a few issues with InkSoft; mainly they do not provide for embroidery and do not give any access to the template HTML/CSS.  In order to change anything about the layout (even links available in the nav) I have to kind of insert code through a backdoor.  The upside is that InkSoft has a large library of clip art and pre-made designs for customers to use.  

I am currently comparing this service with DecoNetwork, since they do offer a really great embroidery option.  I have seen mixed reviews, mostly based around poor customer service and a lacking clip art gallery.  Unfortunately a lot of these reviews are older and in most they reference an update that should be out by now.  They also say in their marketing literature that they give full access to their HTML/CSS, which would be awesome.  

Mostly I'm wondering if anyone has experience with these services and if anyone would recommend either over the other.  Specifically, does anyone know how much access DecoNetwork gives to their template HTML and CSS?  Also, how have your experiences with customer service been?

I've been unemployed since December, when I was laid off a temporary job at a factory where I worked for six weeks.

Sadly, that is the longest I've worked at a legally-paying job.

Most places I've been at have either been unpaid internship work (the longest period being two months), places that pay under the table or at freelance rates (most places no more than a month) or refuse to go through legal channels (at least twice). I have no references for the past two years of work at these places I would trust.

This has been a constant problem since high school. I've only had one or two proper job interviews my entire life out of hundreds of applications. I've been rejected by Walmart, Ikea, everything. I can't even apply for a dishwasher position without being told they would only hire me if someone doesn't show up with their resume after me like I had happen to me today.

I was near the top of my college classes too (3.4 GPA overall) as well as in high school, but my diploma is completely worthless and my college is a joke. Because I focused on school (which took up all of my free time), I never gained any connections. All of my former classmates are in the same situation as me right now.

I'm starting to run out of options right now and it's stressing me out. I'm scared of applying to places anymore because I know they will never hire me, especially if it requires an online form. The only income I have coming in is disability payments (I'm mildly autistic - I HATE having to depend on that money to live) and whatever under-the-table pay I get from doing what I actually enjoy in sports broadcasting ($40 every two weeks). If I don't get a job by this week, I won't be able to pay car insurance in February. I'm already falling behind on multiple other bills.

I know I've posted on here a few times in the last few days but I've been feeling pretty anxious and I thought that maybe sharing my experience might help a bit. Sorry if this is long!!
So, my experience started over the summer. i was on vacation with my parents when I noticed some weird veins in my leg. Since I had just started with nuva ring I was worried it was a clot and decided to go to the doctor. We went to the only one we could find who spoke very very little english, pulled my skirt up wayyyy to high just to check out my knee, and told me that I definitely didn't have a clot. I thought no more of it. 
So I started college in August. I'm from the west coast and moved out to the east coast for college. After about a month I developed really intense pain in my lower back but I assumed I'd just pulled a muscle and didn't go get it checked out. The pain eventually went down and I assumed all was fine. 
About four days later it came back, much worse this time. I went to student health and they told me I had a kidney infection, gave me some antibiotics, told me to rest, and sent me on my way. A few days later I was feeling worse so I went back. They said I probably had a kidney stone and sent me to get some images. 
I got an MRI and was told that I didn't have a kidney stone but might have had one at some point in the past. I called my doctor at student health who told me to the go to the ER, so I did. There I was given MORE antibiotics that were stronger and (again) told to go back to my dorm and rest. 
Once again, I started feeling even worse. I went to the ER again a few days later where I had a much worse experience. I was given an extremely painful pelvic exam (I have endometriosis) in which the doctor yelled at me to stop crying and ""not act like a baby"" because I was so much pain I was sobbing. I was then told that because I was anxious about experiencing a lot of pain while being on a new coast away from home for the a long time for the first time that I was making up my symptoms due to anxiety. I was told to go home. 
Because of that I was too scared to go back to student health or the ER so when my symptoms got worse I didn't go in immediately. I had one terrible day where I had a classics test and went to class in horrible pain and could barely manage to walk back to my dorm. My legs were swelling and I couldn't walk without severe exhaustion and pain. I finally went to student health where I was taken back to the ER by ambulance. 
The same doctor who had told me that I was just anxious was there again and she, again, told me that I was exaggerating my symptoms. I was very upset at this point and snapped and asked if there was another doctor I could see. I finally got to see another doctor who looked at my MRI and told me that I had a blood clot. I was admitted to the hospital and started on a heparin drip and my mom flew out to be with me, which was nice. 
I spent quite a while in the hospital. I had extensive clotting in my vena cava and after I had left the hospital I went back to a scan where it was found that I was also clotted under my left knee. So I'm clotted from my left knee to my right hip. I elected not to have surgery to break up the clot (it was a stupid choice and I would choose differently if I had to do it again, but I was very scared at the time). I also learned that I have the factor 2 mutation and an abnormally shaped vena cava which a) made it easier for my body to form new pathways for blood to flow and b) made it unlikely that I would have  PE
I was started on lovenox and cleared to go home. (Since I had missed so much school and still could barely walk at the time I decided to take medical leave for the rest of the semester). 
My mom and I drove back home since my doctor told me flying would be a bad idea. Once home I started on Xarelto. 
Physically I've been feeling a ton better but mentally I've been feeling absolutely terrible. I was okay for the first month and a half or so but living with a huge blood clot in my body has been terrifying and over the past month or so I've completely convinced myself that I have leukemia. My anxiety has gotten so bad that it's hard for me to just exist and talk to people on a day to day basis without starting crying. I know I should go to a doctor or therapist but I'm too anxious to do either. I decided not to go back to college for the rest of the year and apply elsewhere (not bc of the anxiety, because I wasn't happy at the first one) but I'm now completely apathetic about that. I got a great internship in my local government but I'm thinking of quitting because the anxiety is so bad when I go. 
I'm sorry this is so long but I'm feeling pretty terrible and I figured it would be good to talk about it. I don't really have people irl who want to hear about it. I've been reading all your stories and they've been helping me a little!!

I've got a solid GPA, but I'm weak on internships (just one, and it's an IT thing). 

I have an offer on hand, and the salary is decent, but the company itself makes me nervous. I've heard a lot of bad things about them -- more IT than actual coding, very little work, they'll hire anyone -- and there's a 4-month (!) training period, which seems absurd to me.

Right now, I feel like my best move is to not take the offer (I'm still interviewing with other companies, so my prospects aren't so dim), but I feel like I'm on a timer, as if the longer I take to find a job, the harder it'll be to get one.

5otth2,1,2017-01-18,Debt crisis: Need advice from Vets on GI Bill/repaying school loans,tangothehell,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5otth2/debt_crisis_need_advice_from_vets_on_gi/,"Long story short, I completely dropped the ball on this and have no one but to blame my stupid ass self:

After finishing undergrad with ~$15,000 in school loans, I attended graduate school in 2014-2015 and took out an additional $40,000 in school loans for that year. After some health complications (unrelated to my military service), it became unfeasible to continue the graduate program after the first year. 

During that year in school, I neglected to make sure that my 9/11 GI Bill benefits were active when I signed up with the school’s veteran program — like an idiot I either assumed that they were, or that my policy had run out after I’d used it in undergrad.

Since withdrawing from my graduate program, I’ve struggled to find work and couldn’t afford to pay back my student loans from graduate school.  It’s a large sum of money and I’m struggling to get by as it is — it’s hard enough that I’m unable to go back to school to finish the program. At the moment, I’ve somehow scored an internship related to my field that pays a little over what a normal intern would receive, but nowhere near for me to start paying the full amount of my monthly payments. 

Well, it turns out that I actually had over one year left on the Post 9/11 GI Bill to use. Is there any way to use this to help pay off the loans I took out for graduate school? The GI Bill, if I can use it, would help out tremendously.

This is pretty goddamn embarrassing and I feel like complete shit. Prior to this, I never had any issues whatsoever with loans or credit — I never even used a credit card for years. Having this fucking shadow looming is a shit feeling I wish upon no one except the scummiest of scumbags. 

Thanks guys."
5otylx,4,2017-01-18,Looking for a way for our developers to 'claim' &amp; 'release' development environments using Slack,tmbridge,Slack,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/5otylx/looking_for_a_way_for_our_developers_to_claim/,"Hi all,

We have a series of about ten development, staging, and sandbox servers that the developers on our team can choose to work on, put code up for internal/external QA, and/or delegate to other departments for whatever reason may come up.

In the past, we simply asked everyone, via meatspace or online chat, ""Is anyone using Dev1?"".  Obviously, that wasn't tenable.

We then switched to a whiteboard approach with a table containing a cell for each server.  When a developer claimed a server for their work, they would write their name in the cell.  When a developer released the server back into the 'available pool', they would erase their name from said cell.  This was better, but still untenable because off-site/remote developers would still need to contact someone in the office to determine what servers were in the 'available pool'.

We then switched to using Slack.  A new channel was created and we installed the [Stash Slack App](https://sit-it.slack.com/apps/A0SNNRTM0--stash) which allows the creation of (key, value) pairs via a /stash command. We setup a key for each server.  When a developer claimed a server for their work, they would send a command like /stash dev1 tmbridge-[JIRA issue ID]-[planned 'release datetime'].  When a developer released a server, they would delete the value from the (key,value) pair for that server.  Using a slash command, /stash list, a developer could see, at a glance, what servers were in the 'available pool'.  Using a slash command, /stash list dev1, a developer could see the (key,value) pair for a _specific_ server, if they were only interested in the status of a single server.  This worked well enough for quite a while.  

Unfortunately, it seems the Stash App is no longer functioning as the aforementioned slash commands no longer work.  We haven't even tried yet to re-install the Slack App because we think there is probably a better way to do this.

For now, as a stop-gap, we've resorted to simply saying in the #envs channel stuff like: 

Claming Dev1. 

Releasing Dev2.

Claiming Dev3.

Claiming Stage.

Releasing Stage.

Obviously, this is untenable as well since it takes time to read up through the chat history to ensure a server is available or taken.  It is also prone to mistakes because human error could cause a developer to miss a crucial claiming/releasing (this risk manifests in every solution I've mentioned so far but is much higher with this implementation).  We could whip up a quick barebones site to emulate the 'whiteboard table' method which would remove the issue for offsite/remote developers but we'd love to keep this in Slack since it's our main hub of communication.  If we did go that route, we could hook into Slack using the Incoming Webhooks App and send claims/releases to the pertinent Slack channel, as well.  That is my current plan of action if we can't find a way to do it purely in Slack (Would be a great project for our fresh intern to get his feet wet, get used to our systems, and get used to our development workflow).  We also do not want to use some kind of shared document (Google Docs, Dropbox, etc.).

So I come here asking for any advice.  Does anyone have any ideas how we can use Slack for the previously mentioned use cases?

That is:

We have a series of about ten development, staging, and sandbox servers that the developers on our team can choose to work on.  Using Slack, we'd like our developers to:

* be able to lay claim to any one of those servers,
* be able to release their claim on a server,
* see a list of all server claim statuses,
* see a list of available servers, and
* see the status for a single server specifically."
5otzb2,272,2017-01-18,THE YELLOWSTONE INCIDENT,Yellowstoneyoda,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5otzb2/the_yellowstone_incident/,"I'd like to preface by saying that everything you're about to read is 100% factual. While they may try to silence me, and or discredit the legitimacy of my claims, I can't sit back in good conscience and let the media spread such blatant fabrications. Lies generated by an elaborate coverup. A coverup that continues to tarnish the name of an innocent man, while simultaneously obscuring the facts from a public, that deserves to know the truth. 

Out of respect for their families, I will refrain from using the real names 

The the story made national headlines. It was reported that, while visiting Yellowstone National park, a man accidently fell into what he believed at the time to be hot spring. This pool would, in fact, be highly acidic, killing the twenty-six-year-old John Doe within moments of exposure. Both Doe and his sister Jane Doe were said to have deviated from the safety of the park's boardwalk before the accident occurred. The victim and his sister were accused of entering an unauthorized area with the intention of ""Hot potting"" 
(soaking in thermal pool)

While a few of the details mentioned beforehand reflect the actual events that transpired, the majority of what was reported has been rearranged and manipulated. I know this because I witnessed the actual events that transpired first hand. For the past two years, I have been a volunteer intern in Yellowstone's  preventive SAR (Search and rescue) program. The program allowed me to further my knowledge in the medical field by working in and around the various emergency scenarios that took place within the park. 

Dispatch responded to an emergency call placed by an individual who reported that he and his wife had encountered an incoherent woman, later identified as Jane. Doe had apparently fallen into a state of Hysteria. The couple was able to ascertain very little from Doe between her broken speech patterns and loud outbursts. The only word they'd be able to make out would be the name of her brother, a name that she would continue to repeat in a chant-like pattern 

We arrived near 8 pm, only to find that Doe was no longer in a state of panic. The man who originally placed the call explained that Doe's loud ranting had suddenly ceased within seconds. When we encountered Doe, she had been sitting on a bench, enveloped in some sort of trance-like stare. It was only after was addressed her directly that she snapped out of this daze. Once she had become aware of her surroundings, Jane Doe insisted on leading us on a trail, walk/off the board, just northwest of the porkchop geyser in the Norris basin. 

Jane Doe would not respond to our questions, she would only repeat the words ""He's Dead"" before reverting to a state of silence. 

We Discovered the body of John Doe floating in the center of the pool. There had already been a significant amount of dissolving had already occurred on the visible areas of John Doe's body. It was at this time that    Jane begins showing signs of an emotional breakdown, as she tried desperately to thwart the other rescue workers from approaching the edge of the pool. She was instantly distraught, screaming that there was something in the pool, something that would kill us all. 

Multiple factors would contribute to us being unable to recover John Doe's body that night. A sudden decrease in light coupled with an oncoming electrical storm forced us to abandon our initial efforts, 

Once we returned to the park medical facility, we attempted to question Jane Doe once again, in the hopes that she'd be able to shed light on the morbid scenario. It was apparent that Jane had taken the time to gather what mental faculties she had been left with. She explained that her brother had been lured to the pool. She continued on frantically, saying that she began to film the entire event because she knew nobody would believe her. Jane produced her cell phone and proceeded to play the prerecorded video... A video that I myself would view along with a handful of others.

Due to the detailed nature of the recording, I've taken the time to craft a transcript based on my own viewing. Some elements have been left out or paraphrased due to my own limited recollection.

*John doe is standing near the trail, staring off into the trees*

Jane Doe - Take heed ladies and gentlemen back home, because this is what happens when you agree to go sightseeing with your derpy ass brother.

*Jane throws stone at John who doesn't flinch

Jane Doe - What are you looking at?

*John Doe does not respond*

Jane Doe - What the fuck is your deal, we're supposed to be going in the other direction.

*John Doe still does not respond*

Jane Doe - Seriously dude?

*John Doe cocks head to the side*

John Doe - Can you hear it?

Jane Doe - Hear what?

John Doe - She's singing

Jane Doe - Who's singing?

*John Doe Begins walking off designated trail, towards overgrown path*

Jane Doe - Where the fuck are you going?

*John Doe does not respond, but continues walking*

Jane Doe - I don't think you're supposed to go that way.

*John Begins to proceed beyond the camera's view*

Jane Doe - John! John, what the fuck?

*At this point, Jane Doe places the still recording phone in her pocket*

Jane Doe - John! John!

*muffled sounds of movement*

Jane Doe - where the fuck is you, you're freaking me the fuck out.

*More muffled sounds of movement*

*Two minutes of inaudible black*

Jane Doe - John.. John... Please come back here.

*Jane Doe pulls phone back out* Image comes into focus. Jane Doe records from the background as John Doe stands at the far edge of the thermal pool. He's holding eye contact with a figure that stands at the center of the spring, suspended unnaturally, just a few inches above the water. The figure is female nearly four feet tall, completely nude with white, shoulder length hair. The figure carries no pigmentation, due to its skin appearing to be near translucent. While it displays the outward definition of breasts, its pubic region lacks any sort of sexual characteristics. The figure's mouth is partially open as it emanates a low hum.

Jane Doe - John, get the hell away from that thing

*Note to reader*
At this point, the tone coming from the figure seems to be having an effect on the recording abilities of the phone, causing the picture to distort in and out of clarity. *

John Doe - Can you hear it?

Jane Doe - John, please let's go. I'm scared

John Doe - We can't go. I have to hear it.

Jane Doe - Get away from it, please!

*The Figure outstretches its thin arms in John Doe's direction*

John Doe - She's going to show me...

Jane Doe - Please John, please get away from it. Please... There's something wrong with it.

John Doe - She's going to show me where the sound comes from.

*John Doe steps over the edge of the pool, splashing into the acidic water down below.*

Jane Doe - John! John!

*John Violently gurgles in pain. The figure turns to Jane Doe. We hear Jane's fearful cries. The figure cocks its head to the side before Disintegrating into a formless liquid that rains down, lifelessly into the pool below.*

*Jane drops the phone, we assume that she's rushing to the aid of her brother. All that can be heard is her screaming.*

After replaying the video multiple times, before the chief ranger who also viewed the recording made contact with the FBI special agent assigned to the park. From that point on, I'm unaware as to what steps were taken beyond that. The next day, we noticed as strange military vehicles began arriving. I heard through friends stationed around the park, that the area where John Doe's body was found had been blocked off. 

The individuals in the immediate vicinity were said to be wearing hazmat suits. I did not witness this myself, so I'm unable to confirm exactly what was going on. What I can attest to, is that myself, along with the rest of the SAR unit that found John Doe, we were all individually questioned. by people claiming to be from the EPA. 

I've never prided myself on the jurisdiction of government agencies, more importantly government agencies such as the EPA. It was explained to me that due to the acidic content and temperature, John Doe's body had completely dissolved overnight. I was then barraged with an onslaught of probing questions that were both random and strange. How long I had been working for the park, where did I grow up, even my college attendance record. They also wanted to know in detail, what the extent of our contact was with both John Doe's body as well as how often we were in physical interaction with Jane Doe. 

The subject of the video recording was also brought up. I was asked to describe What I witnessed on the video, then in my own words attempt to articulate what I thought It was.  We were all told that because the events we took part in were a part of an ongoing federal investigation, we would face considerable jail time for disclosing any information to the public. 

I'd be let go from the SAR program within days of that interview. The explanation was that due to limited space and resources, they no longer had an opening for an intern this season. I was encouraged to try again next season. 

 I still have no real grasp of what we all saw that night. I can't begin to explain what was on that video. I understand that my account will, no doubt be divisive to those that read it. All I ask is that you ask... Ask yourself these questions.  If the events transpired in June, why are we just now hearing about it in November? If Those supposedly in charge of the investigation admit to there being a recording, Why are they making a point to keep it from the public?

Nearly six months later I find myself waking up in the middle of the night because I'll always be plagued by two questions of my own. What's really out there in Yellowstone, and who are the people that want to keep it hidden?

I'm hoping while I'm there that I can volunteer, intern, or maybe if I'm very, very fortunate - even work in the museum and culture field while in New Zealand.

I'd love to chat with somebody with experience in New Zealand to find out more about what the field is like for locals and what their experiences have been like. I've been doing some research on different museums, but would love an insiders take on what it's like on the ground.

I've been battling with severe and chronic asthma and allergies for years. Tried so many different treatments and still just barely getting by. I've had to take several medical withdraws from school which has set my graduation date back quite a bit, which I've been having issues coming to terms with this delay as I want to be done with my degree already, I take a lot of pride in my work and grades. I recently started an internship and was equally excited and nervous. I knew that at one point I would have to deal with having an asthma exacerbation and tell my boss about being out and such, but was hoping it wouldn't be this soon in. A few weeks ago I had contacted RSV, and am still having problems bouncing back from that. I feel so defeated. I feel like I've made a bad first impression with this internship, and I'm really bummed out thinking that I'll have to keep dealing with this when I eventually get a job too. I have to stay home a lot because of how often I'm sick and how severe it gets and it gets so lonely and depressing. I'm constantly missing out on things because of my asthma. I've been on all the different medications we can try. I have a pulmonologist that I see regularly and the very good doctor from the ER I frequent. I've tried Xolair and Nucala with no success and did immunotherapy for 5 years, we can no longer continue with how unstable I am and some anaphylaxis reactions thar occurred.

Looking for advice on what to do next.",13ae,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ouzlf/undergrad_attempting_to_find_an_internship_but/,"Long story short, I entered college not really knowing what I wanted to do. My family situation kind of pushed me towards CS, and I found that I really do enjoy CS. I recently declared myself as CS as a sophomore at a top 5 CS school, but now that I'm looking for an internship, I realize that I really have nothing going for me.

I've taken all the lower division courses so far such as data structures, machine structures, and discrete math, but my GPA is very average (3.3) and I have no real projects or a portfolio. I've recently started doing practice interview questions on leetcode and that ""Cracking the coding interview"" book, but I have no idea how to get myself together so I can get an internship this summer.

So what I need advice on is: In my position, what should I do in terms of prioritizing this short window of time I need to apply? Specifically, should I focus on interview questions and then apply later? Should I apply now and work on interview questions concurrently? In terms of going about side projects and a portfolio, is it realistic to work on a mini-project now for my resume before the bulk of the application deadlines? And should I prioritize a portfolio at all in my situation? I've been thinking of joining a club this semester, such as CS consulting or the VR club; if I have no projects completed, would it help to be actively learning/working on one?

Also, since my school is in the Bay Area/Silicon valley, where there are a lot of other competitive students, would it help my case if I applied elsewhere in the country? (money is really a non issue here, I just want the experience) What kind of companies should I be looking at? (I heard start ups really like self motivated ambitious people who have a lot under their belt, which I am not sure would fit my current predicament)

I'm sorry if this kind of question is commonly asked here, but I just feel so overwhelmed with everything I have to do, and the fact that my peers seem lightyears ahead of me isn't really helping my mentality in tackling the challenge I face.

I would appreciate any advice/general advice that any of you would have. Thanks!"

Hi Reddit, I'm a 22 year old currently pursuing a dual major in computer science and another computer-related associate's at an unknown community college with plans to transfer to a university. The problem is, I'm doing a lot better in my life now than I used to be.

I struggled a lot with the first 20 years of my life. My dad was an alcoholic and largely emotionally absent and I didn't see him much. My mother was violently abusive and I have many memories of being dragged across the carpet or locked in my room or duct-taped together in the basement or tied to a chair somewhere. My mother also insisted I had asperger syndrome and took me to multiple specialists and required me to take a lot of medication I didn't want. It became incredibly difficult to relate to people as I had failed at it so many times and it was discouraging being repeatedly told that I was incapable of learning. I cried in class. Nobody wanted to associate with me. In my sophomore year I only got picked second-last in the mandatory physical education unit instead of dead last. My parents got divorced when I was in middle school and my dad completely moved out of the house. In high school, I was supposed to (according to my mother) have all As in school in addition to working and participating in after-school activities and exercising regularly and socializing and maintaining creative hobbies. I didn't do all of these things. I never even came close. I couldn't handle the demands placed on me and I saw no reason I would want to continue living my life. All I wanted to do was use video games to remove myself from reality. I stopped doing my homework. Then I stopped going to class. I just physically refused to attend. Then I dropped out of high school.

After I dropped out of high school, I spent ~2 years of my life shut in my room playing video games because I saw no reason to continue living my life at all. Finally, when I was about 19, I moved in with my dad and his girlfriend. This was when good things started happening to me. My dad had managed to kick his drinking habit and was sober for a long period of time. He taught me how to drive and a few other skills, and he agreed to pay for my college education. I first went to community college a few months later, and did well. I was the highest performing programmer that the college had seen in the last 3 years. But I dropped out that first semester anyway because I was going to be late on an assignment and I couldn't stomach the thought. My past had taught me than when I had gotten a B I would usually get into a violent fight with my mother and she would go through my things, other behavior mentioned above, etc. I had zero social skills and had just gotten off of living in near total isolation for 2 years so I didn't talk to anyone about it. I have a healthier outlook now. But it was so strong at that time that I just completely dropped college.

After I dropped out of college I clearly didn't really have anywhere to go, so I went to live in a homeless shelter. I began working temporary positions for an agency there that I couldn't hold for more than a few days because of the harsh manual labor requirements and the living conditions at the homeless shelter. I eventually got a food service position and was able to move back in with my dad.

A few months later I had a breakdown and decided I was feeling suicidal, so I was committed to a mental hospital for a while. When I got out my dad told me he didn't want me living with him anymore so I had to look for another homeless shelter to live out of while I collected myself. I eventually found an apartment to live in for a very cheap price where the paint was peeling off the walls and the management was infamously irresponsible around town.

I eventually started attending college again. I did alright. I was working on growing accustomed to accepting failure. I eventually got a part-time teaching position and later a part-time position working in the college IT department. Since by this point I had learned how to interact with other human beings, I did very well at both of these jobs and the people I worked with liked me and recommended me strongly.

But recently, I tried to travel to a university town and seek out internships from the companies hiring there. Most companies seeking there would not even look at me as a community college student, but one company gave me an interview.

I sucked really badly at the interview. It was awful. I didn't know anything about UML or state diagrams. I was terrible at the interpersonal communication questions. All I was focused on was how terrible I was at communication in the past.

My past bogs me down and makes me feel like crap. I don't know how to authentically live my life when I've failed so many times already. I frequently have doubts that people will want me at all. I'm not sure how to authentically go to a job interview. How can I fix my train of thought?

Promised TL;DR: Grew up with absent father, abusive mother, divorced parents, diagnosed with mental illness, had zero social skills, dropped out of school 3 times, lived in 2 homeless shelters, fired from 2 jobs, and stayed in a mental hospital 3 times all before I was 20. Wanted to kill myself most of the time. Learned how to be better later on. Struggling to cope with these feelings and present myself well. Looking for suggestions."

Two exams, no internship, so I'm stuck in that grey area of over-qualified for internships mainly catered towards undergrads, but I lack the experience that would make me a competitive entry-level candidate.

My question is this: what would be a better use of my time? Should I focus on studying for Exam MFE (March sitting) and continue to apply for both actuarial and non-actuarial positions?

I have been applying to multiple places for an internship. A lot of the places I applied at are well known, but they are nothing like a big 4. I am able to get phone interviews.

I have been working hard to raise it and it will be at least a 3.00 - 3.08 at the end of this spring semester. I don't have my GPA listed on my resume.

As of right now I will graduate with 138 credit hours, taking summer classes would allow me to graduate next spring with 150 and be CPA eligible. It'd be nice to have that out of the way and not worry about taking classes after I've started my career. 

I have had an internship in the past. It wasn't with an accounting firm, but I did do some accounting/financial related things so it's not like I would be applying for jobs with completely 0 experience. 

But my main thing is that financially it makes the most sense for me to stay here in my college town. I'm already paying for that 3 months of rent during the summer. Unfortunately there are not a lot of good accounting internship positions in this city, meaning I would have to relocate for the summer to intern. At that point with the cost of my living expenses and relocating I would more or less be doing an unpaid internship. 

So if I can't find a good internship here, would it make sense to take summer classes instead? "

She has one part-time job in her field now, but it's only 16 hours per week and she'd like to make some extra money to help with living expenses, start paying down loans, etc.

She hasn't received any responses on applications for part-time positions yet, and we think the issue she's running into is that people see the degree / work history on her resume and assume she's going to leave as soon as she can (to be fair, that isn't too far off - she's looking for something that she can do for about 6 months).

She does have retail / office experience outside of her field, but those jobs are now 5-6 years old, because she's been in school and had internships related to her degree (but not really to much else) for the past several years, so it would be tough for her to just omit those from her resume without having a giant gap in her employment.

Any thoughts on what might be some good types of jobs for her to apply to? For reference, she's 28F, we live in Southern California, and her field is one that requires her to have a lot of 1-on-1 face time with individual clients.

I wish I was told about CodeAcademy.com in the summer before my Freshman year so that I could see basic syntax and focus on more important things in class.

2. I wish I knew that there are standard practices with writing clean code for many programming languages. You can find a few style guides [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide). I'd also recommend getting Robert Martin's *""Clean Code""*, but only after my first programming class - I feel like stumbling through it a bit can be a good thing.

3. I wish I was knew about JetBrains products, but only after a year of practice with compiling and running programs from command line. Their IDEs are **AMAZING** and free for students, but they act as a crutch if you don't know the *REAL* way the languages are interpreted.

4. I wish I was knew about the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/) so that any boring time in a summer could've been filled poking around and using the stuff in there.

5. I wish I knew that if I started becoming friends with CS Classmates earlier, I may have spent less time doing homework while getting a higher GPA. The individuals who worked together with people from the get-go seem to be much better off... If nothing else, they look as if they are. That's not to say I'm some loner - I was just late to the group, as I was hanging out with non-CS people (also a healthy thing to do).

6. I wish I knew that if I went to every single Hack-A-Thon and developer event in and around my school, I could easily become inspired to program and to succeed. I thought I was stuck in doing something for the money, but I started getting inspired by developers and technologies only after attending conferences and hack meets.

7. Look for an internship as a Freshman. Even if the requirements scare you and even if you don't think you cut it. You'll work hard to prepare for it, and even if you don't make it, the experience is valuable and it'll only be a good look on your part. Most importantly, internships can directly and indirectly lead to jobs. Either the company rehires you, somebody you made an impression on hires you elsewhere, or the experience on your resume is what gets you into an interview you knock out of the park. Any way you look at it, an internship is a good thing - the earlier you get one, the better.

I'm sure there are more things everybody else would love to share... Please feel free - I can update OP.

5oyhg8,2,2017-01-19,My life down the tube,throwitallaway833,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5oyhg8/my_life_down_the_tube/,"2012 was my year zero. I worked on the Obama campaign and made some good friends. That was my first year of college. Sorted my health out, started going to the gym, very enlightening year.

2013 was the best year of my life, probably. I turned 20 that year, traveled via plane for the first time, went to conferences, traveled overseas, got involved on campus, had a good job as a journalist and did good work. Made some good money on top of financial aid. A good year.

2014 I became boss of the newspaper. I worked ridiculous hours, with difficult people but consistently put out a good product. Didn't have time for much else, but made good money and learned a lot about bureaucracy and people management. At the time I thought I threw the whole year away but looking back, I learned a ton and made good money on top of financial aid.

2015 I was mostly unemployed but got a good paying internship near the end. Frequently had to take my dad to the ER and then got food poisoning bad, like what, 3 times? So then I went to the ER like 15 times. Did some national broadcast radio, worked with a startup, went on a a couple weeklong vacations with friends. Got a staph infection from that vacation but I had my fun. At the time I thought it was a horrible year, and it was I was sick the first 6 months badly. The ER was terrible and overflowing. But there were some bright spots. Near the end of the year I got a bad viral infection that took my voice for 2 and a half weeks, the only way to cure it was with steroids and it took about a year to heal and I still have some weirdness.

In 2016 the staph infection wouldn't go away so I had it surgically removed. The doctor on purpose left dead tissue in there despite the protests of the nurse and it never fully healed. Then the doctor overdosed me on antibiotics and I got seriously ill with intestinal bleeding. I lost my internship and could do nothing but lie in bed and eat apple sauce and potato for 3 months. The doctors to deny culpability pretended I had Crohns, which was devastating because it wouldn't heal, and when I finally got to see a gastro doctor 4 months later he told me it was the drugs and that because I'm young I should eventually heal. About 8 months in in October I began to become functional again. I finished my degree and filed for graduation, having spent the last 8 months alone, lying in bed, talking to my mom several dozen times a day. During the year, the startup I helped build became a multi-million dollar valuation, though I will never see any of that money, and the team I was on at my internship won awards. They don't want to hire me most likely because I'm not reliable because I'm sick. The startup offered me work but it's purely random and whenever they need it, nothing full time. Obama didn't even give me a Christmas card this year, he did every other year.

Now it's 2017 and I'm fucking dead. I don't have an ounce of fight left in my body. Cuts and bruises take months to heal now. I have patches on my skin that no matter how many times I reopen then can't turn anything but black. I'm trying to get new insurance but Kaiser won't let me login even though I paid my due. Out of principle I don't want to beg them for it. I've done enough begging.

I'm happy I'm not utterly disabled or dead. But I have nothing left. I'm upset that my skin won't heal. And I can't get a blood test done without jumping through 10 hoops.

I don't know if I'll ever get a job. I have no confidence left, I have other disabilities and they've flared up hard in the past year since I've been living like a dead body. I'm in pain every day, right now my shoulder is tight and hard as a rock, it's tough to move my neck. I've got nothing left Reddit. I don't want to do anything anymore.

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut/friends/online. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere race play and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"
5oyvpv,2,2017-01-19,What are my chances of getting into a masters program for CS?,whatamidoingwithcs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5oyvpv/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_into_a_masters/,"Hi! I've posted a few times before, but just wanted to post another question I've been struggling with. 
So I'm currently trying to self-study CS , and the more I research the field and study, the more I feel like I would need some sort of a degree in order to get my foot in the door. All the internships that I have looked at mention that pursuing a degree is a requirement to apply.

That being said, I am currently considering applying to my local cal state MSCS program. I have a bachelors degree in biological sciences, so I thought the masters would be better than trying to get another bachelors. The only thing is, the requirements for the school I'm applying to says the minimum gpa is a 3.0 if I have a bachelors in a major other than CS. Well...I unfortunately have a gpa from my bachelors that is below 3.0. My question is, does anyone have experience with applying for a masters with a gpa that does not meet minimum requirements? I spoke to a CS counselor from the school last year and they just said to take a few prereqs first. I took the first one, which was a intro to programming in c++, and received an A. And I am currently about to start a Data Structures and algorithms class in the next few weeks. I am really enjoying the subject and I think a masters is something I should pursue, but do I even have a chance if I don't meet the minimum requirement? :( Any advice is appreciated, thank you!!

5oyysf,10,2017-01-19,ADHD is awful. And I've had a really awful day. Can anyone commiserate? Please,lyarly,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5oyysf/adhd_is_awful_and_ive_had_a_really_awful_day_can/,"Hi everyone:

I'm having a really awful awful day and I didn't know who else to talk to because I feel just so dreadfully awful. I thought I would post here.

My boyfriend kind of broke up with me today. By kind of I mean when he said ""I don't want to be together anymore,"" I broke down and cried and asked him to give us more time and he said he would think about it. So yeah.

Anyway, I feel like an asshole. The past six months or so I've been very self-absorbed in my studies and work and trying to find internships and also going through family and mental health issues (ADHD mainly) and I have sort of taken my boyfriend for granted. Basically for months I've been shitty to him without realizing it. Him breaking up with me was a kick in the ass I needed but I don't want to break up. He says I'm fundamentally this way but I don't think so. I don't know.

Lots of little shitty things I've done but I don't need to give all the details. I guess it sort of boiled down to that I take more than I give. We had a discussion about this a couple months ago where he said he felt like the balance wasn't tipped right, and I said ""Well whenever you need help just tell me!"" It felt like he was starting to resent me just because I asked him for advice. My life has been hectic but I knew it would slow down around the new year so I just figured it would get back to normal then. I do ask him for help with things all the time because he's really talented and smart. And now I feel like I took advantage of him. 

He has been hurting for a while now and I didn't realize it. He texted me the other day while he was on vacation with his family and said he was feeling fucked up and was going to seek out a therapist. I asked him what was wrong and he said he didn't want to talk about it, I figured I'd talk to him about it in a week. And then right after that he started telling me I hurt his feelings with a joke I said a while back: I told him that it was a joke and he knew that, he said it hurt his feelings. 

Because it was a text, I actually didn't even realize he was being serious and made it way worse. Anyway, so we got into an argument. There's a lot of context to this you aren't getting because he's sort of come at me before for saying things that hurt him (Things I didn't realize he was insecure about but is) and I do put my foot in my mouth sometimes but anyway - at that point I felt like he was just looking for something to get mad at me about and I just completely shut down. I HATE arguing over text so I said ""why don't we just take a break and talk about this later?"" I was gonna see him in like 6 days so I thought that would be best for both of us. I thought he was pissed at me anyway and didn't want to talk to me. I was really upset and confused. Anyway that upset him but I thought it would be best for him to spend some time with his family anyway.

I talked to a couple of friends about it and they said it seemed like I did the right thing when I gave us time to cool off, though we've never gone that long without talking.

Anyway, we finally saw each other and he said that was the worst thing I could do to him: I mean, he's not wrong. He TOLD me he was hurting and I was insensitive to him and THEN I said ""well let's just talk later."" I can't believe I did that. Here's the awful kicker: I had TOTALLY forgotten what he said about being sad when we got into that shitty fucking argument. I forgot he said he was feeling awful and then I DID shut down walk away. I didn't tell him this, but it doesn't change anything. I didn't remember an important thing again and I fucked things up again. He said he could forgive me but he could never forget I did that to him. I feel awful but it felt like the right decision at the time. It seems like everything I do just makes things worse.

So we got into a big convo after he said he didn't want to be together and I cried and apologized and realized I've been such a shitty fucking girlfriend/best friend for months. I am really sorry. I feel like dirt. Feeling like you've terribly disappointed the man you love feels incredibly awful. Obviously there is months of context you are missing but you get the drift. I've been self-absorbed and not attentive and shitty.

I begged him to let me make it up to him. Also I think some of this might have to do with my ADHD. When I'm on medication I feel so much more stable and honestly less selfish, which maybe sounds dumb. But I really do - I feel like a better person on it. I feel like a more stable and loving person. I haven't been able to take medication for a very long time because I've been moving around so much so I've been putting off seeing a doctor. And now I'm about to go on a study abroad trip to Argentina and I doubt I can find anyone to prescribe me 5 months worth of medication.

I am currently coming up with a list of things I want to be better about - he thinks this is a moot point because you can't change who you are. I don't think these are big changes, they mostly just have to do with paying attention more. Yeah... hard right? His love language is acts of service and I haven't done shit for him in ages. We don't live together and we are long distance so it's not like I can cook for him or anything.

I don't know why I'm posting this here but I don't have anyone else to talk to. I talked to my mom and she is VERY sure we will get back together. Eternal optimist, she is. She forgets I'm about to leave the country. I'm not so optimistic. I want him to know that the person he's known for the past few months - the person that has been awful and inattentive and selfish and loud-mouthed - isn't who I really am. It's not. I believe I'm a good person but everyone gets lost sometimes. I want to make it up to him and work on this but I'm afraid it's too late. He's built up so much resent for me already. I hate myself a lot right now.

I made a doctors appointment for Monday but I'm a new patient and am leaving in three weeks for my trip. I doubt they can help me. But I guess it's a good first step.

Does anyone have advice or have gone through anything similar? Or even just cute dogs to cheer me up? Ways I can distract myself from sad thoughts? I feel like such an awful person, but also ADHD sucks. I don't want to blame the ADHD but I also feel like it makes relationships so hard. And no one gets it. I wish I had realized how self-absorbed I was being sooner.

I love this man so much: not because of what he can do for me but because of who he is and who we are together. The last six months have been weird and volatile in our relationship and he said he has been feeling sad since around six months ago. It really explains so much. It's like... I FINALLY knew what was going on with him and felt like we could move forward, and then he hit me with a break up. I wish I had figured it out sooner. I was still being an insensitive prick but still. I wish I hadn't been so caught up in my own shit to see it.

Anyway. That's all I've got. Long ramble in an ADHD forum, so if you've made it this far I'm extremely impressed. Thanks.

5ozl7m,2,2017-01-19,Any advice on 'delaying' (3-&gt;3.5/4 yr) undergrad graduation to get Minors or Honors awards?,TombstoneSoda,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/5ozl7m/any_advice_on_delaying_3354_yr_undergrad/,"Hey there netsec, 

First off, tldr at bottom.


I'm currently a junior student going for a double major in Cyber Security and Information Systems-- both degrees are B.B.A.s(business)

I am pretty far ahead of schedule -- so much so that I will graduate Double Major from start to finish, in only 3 years( give or take about 3 classes or 9 hours-- end Spring 2018). To top it off I am an honors student with a high GPA and some honors graduation options. I'm already going to grad with business honors.

The question I pose to you guys is, what do you think I should do here to be the best candidate I can be in the security field?

I am thinking about adding a semester or even a whole year(making it the standard 4) to relax my schedule while still getting benefits. It would also get me an extra summer to be a 'college' intern.

**************Minoring***************

I can get a minor in Computer Science, though I would have to take the CS specific programming classes over again since the classes are not considered equivalent, in 20 hours(6 classes, 2 lab hours).

 
I could minor in general Statistics, or Managment, with 12 additional hours(4 classes.)

I could minor in Digital Forensics, Network and Data Administration, or International Managment with 9 additional hours (3 classes)

Or I could minor in Adaptive Decision Making(whatever that means, its in the statistics dep) with only 6 hours.

************Graduating*************

I could stuff my few, left over hours into semesters/summers, and graduate in the 3 years that I am looking at now.

I could kick back and chill, take a summer class, and add a 3hr course to graduate with General honors after adding one semester.

I could get a minor and grad with general honors(or just minor in compsci since its more than a semester) by stuffing my plate a bit.

I could grad with highest honor by adding a huge thesis paper and 6 hours(2 classes), with no time left outside that thesis{sounds like a fuck no}

Or I can just add an entire year, and minor in 2/3/4 things(or 2/3 with gen honors).

In terms of grad school, I havent thought about it much-- if I were to do it, I would go to my school for a masters in stats that only takes a year or so, or continue cyber security stuff.


****************


So then netsec, what do you guys think? The TL;DR of it is,

Do you think that 'extending', even an already shorter, graduation plan is worth it here? How much weight can be put on getting minors in the ones I listed? Is a  Statistics minor(or its related options) something you'd find relevant? Do you think that graduating with honors, or highest honors, is a good idea?

My school costs money, but it isn't so much that you should put TOO much weight on it- my scholarships and such help alot. It's roughly 15k a year including housing and food.

Thanks guys! I'll try and reply to any questions for additional info!

-StressedKid

Edit:

Also, maybe I just take some additional electives in Cyber Security to round out one more semester, and have the course credits just be wasted? Planning on Intrusion detection and Web App Security for those 2 credits, but theres also forensics, phys systems, networking classes, cyberlaw, etc that interest me..."
5ozpgm,3,2017-01-19,Confused about what direction to head in,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ozpgm/confused_about_what_direction_to_head_in/,"Hello, and thanks for reading -

I'm a recent CS grad in the Seattle area. I've had a hard time getting interviews for SE positions, and I'm not sure what to do next.

I didn't find a ""path"" in school. My GPA was decent (3.64, 3.9 on transfer classes). I worked on a distributed systems research team and published a paper on bioinformatics. I took electives in computer vision, networking, parallel/distributed systems, and databases. I generally enjoyed the courses, especially working on projects.

I suspect HR is passing me over because I don't have an internship under my belt. It was my second degree, and I zipped through it as quickly as possible. I tried to get an internship last summer, but apparently started applying too late because I only got one interview and didn't get an offer.

I did receive an offer last month from a consulting firm, but it was a 6-month contract at $25/hr in Seattle, and they couldn't say if there would be an opening for me after 6 months even if I performed well. I rejected the offer, thinking I could find a better one. However, I haven't had so much as a phone screen since graduating in mid-December. I'm starting to go into panic mode, and I'm regretting having turned down the offer I received. I suppose I should have just thought of it as an internship and worked my ass off to prove myself.

What should I be doing in the meantime? Focus on algorithms/DS and interview questions? I feel pretty confident there. Learn web dev? I have some side projects I'd like to develop. Contribute on GitHub? I'm not sure what types of projects employers would be impressed by here.

I'm working as a grader for a DS&amp;A course at the school from which I graduated and picking up some a few hours as a ghostwriter (my previous career was in writing). I taught myself JavaScript and am learning JQuery and Spring Boot. I'm writing a second research paper and making massive updates to the related project in Java. I'm working through Code Complete to try to improve my coding skills. I'm going to coding meetups and met with a career counselor from my university today.

I feel lost. It feels like there are a million technologies out there, and I don't know what I need to learn in order to convince someone to give me a job."

#Sunny's Eeveelutions Bonanza! 

###A BRIEF INTRODUCTION

Hello to you! Welcome to a very special event that I'm currently hosting, as you can see from the title. 

I will be starting my internship in Feb, which means I will have much lesser time to play the 3ds or come on to reddit (sobs) SOOOOOO In lieu of that, in the spirit of the incoming Lunar New Year, I will be giving back to the great community of /r/pokemontrades by doing a special event trade *(which I consider as a semi-giveaway because of the very simple qualifying premise as further explained below)*

To make it really short, I'll be trading away **Custom-Built XXX Ball** eevees everyday till the **end of January** via ~~the GTS primarily, or~~ FC link trades! I'll be posting a different eeveelution build everyday, with a surprise on the last day, so do check for my posts!

***

**But... CUSTOM-BUILT XXX BALL EEVEE? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?**

It means that each day, I will be trading away specific builds which in my opinion, has the best **Nature**, **Ball** *(in design)* and **Egg Moves** in relation to  that specific Eeveelution. (Although if you don't agree with me, we can just agree to disagree heh)

Each eevee template is **painstakingly built from scratch** after cross-referencing from various forums as well as sites such as smogon, bulbapedia, and other subreddits. Not to forget, every eevee is bred with much love and effort (no genning involved!) through trading and smeargle-moveset/dittos-iv/everstone-nature cross breeding with ball inheritance. 

I'm sure every eevee traded away in this bonanza would be an asset to you, be it competitive breeding or adding to your Apriballs/Eggmoves collection!! :D

Oh and did I mention, they all come with its **at least 5IVs** alongside their **Hidden Ability, Anticipation?**

***

### TO QUALIFY

It's easy really, all I need is a **Pokemon in an Apricorn ball that I currently don't have, to add to my collection!** (and don't worry, I still don't have ALOT of Aprimons T.T). 

**Here's the sweet deal**: It doesn't need to have good IVs, nature or egg moves, although I will be thankful if you give me one with some of the above. Basically I'll accept anything as long as it's something I don't have, in reference to the mon in the ball.

~~All you have to do is to check with me if it's something that I'll accept before depositing it in GTS, which I will explain in details in the Instructions below. I may include a spreadsheet if things get messy.~~ [**SPREADSHEET AVAILABLE HERE!**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ruuqIuP8_v5n8DRMQcubecNUR5p3sQbdyQIw2THdwbY/edit?usp=sharing)

**I'll be doing it over LINK TRADE!!**

###TODAY'S GIVEAWAY:  
##DAY ONE: **LURE BALL VAPOREON BUILD** 


Vaporeon, oh sweet sweet vaporeon. 

**ANALYSIS**

Looking at its base stats, it's highest is in Hp, followed closely by Sp.Atk. With Hidden Ability Hydration and Wish, Vaporeon is essentially a near-invincible HP wall healer, good since it's speed stat is so poor.

Offensively, it's high Sp.Atk is impressive and should let you deal high damage easily with the right moves, even more when you use Fake Tears. It can also damage other same-type resistance water-types through Synchronoise. Defensively, you can rest easy knowing that its decent Sp.Def stat defend well against most nasty Special Attack moves, even the annoying Grass and Electric attacks. By using Captivate, you can further reduce Special Attack damage.

However it's poor defense stat alongside it's poor speed will be a concern when facing types it is special effective against: Rock Ground and Fire types, which usually have high attack stats. This can be guarded against via Charm, which can be learned via Move Relearner.


|Pokemon|Qty|Eeveelution|Ball|Nature|IV|Ability|EM1|EM2|EM3|EM4|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Eevee|~~16~~ **0**|Vaporeon|[](/lureball)|Bold|5|Anticipation|Wish|Fake Tears|Captivate|Synchronoise|

**bulk of the non-31IV is in Atk!* 

***~~AS AN ADDED BONUS, 2 of the eevees will be holding water stone!~~ The water stones eevees are sent!***

***

### Instructions
1) Propose your offer with 2 or more choices. I would prefer more choices so we don't keep going back and forth if I already have what you want to offer.

    eg. I have Love Ball Minior-V (with xxx stats/ems/ability *if you wish to state*) 
    and Fast Ball Psyduck available! (with xxx stats/ems/ability *if you wish to state*) 
    Which one will you like? 


**edit**
2) **SORRY I guess GTS is unreliable for this, so I'm switching to link trade now!** After we've come to a decision, just add my FC and post a reply!

3) I'll add you and we'll trade!

***

### Rules

1) Do not request for specifics (aka -Atk, -Spe etc Eevee, Eevee holding xxx, Male/Female Eevee). These will not be entertained. All eevees will be randomly selected.

2) Only **1** Pokemon per comment per trade, so that as many people can benefit from this. 

3) Strictly no reservations! 

Requests may be ignored and users may be blacklisted from future trades and giveaways when rules are not followed.

***

### Endnote

I'm going to be gone for a few months, so I'd love to find someone to enjoy my fantastic LP apartment for a 6 months or longer
Great news: 
- free laundry in building (washer/dryer) 
- deck space (you can barbecue and even plant a few flowers if you're into that) 
- dishwasher 
- available February 1 - availability up for discussion 
- fully furnished 
- central air

Full disclosure: - one of the bedrooms is small and doesn't have a closet.

This apartment has tall ceilings, natural light, easy street parking (with a permit), a gorgeous Victorian style, and is really comfortable. I would never, ever leave except I have an internship on the other side of the world. It's a 2 minute walk to the Fullerton el, divvy bikes, Lincoln Ave/Halsted St nightlife, and so much more. It's 7 minutes to Lake Shore Drive and 7 minutes to the Kennedy (I-90/94).
Wondering why this is such a low price? Honestly, because I procrastinated and need to get it sublet fairly quickly. I know other places with 2 bedrooms can go for 2k+ in this neighborhood, but I just need to find someone soon, so come take a look :) Give me a call or text at the number above (click ""reply"" above to get my number) or send me an email. I'm also available on whatsapp at +962797470235.

5p0fv0,17,2017-01-19,Issues with focusing at work and understanding basic concepts,IdunnoLXG,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5p0fv0/issues_with_focusing_at_work_and_understanding/,"I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things.

When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked. Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me. I began to not think clearly at all, went into internships and struggled and am now currently at a job where I struggle immensely understanding anything.

My boss will sit there explaining things to me and my mind will either drift or it just simply won't click despite how hard he tries and simplifies things for me. I always tell myself, ""it's not that hard, you're smarter than this"" then I'd think back to times of college where I did really poorly in a class or exam and how I always lagged behind while others breezed through it.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist this Saturday since as I get older things progressively get worse. I feel like I can't control my life and put myself in situations because I don't understand anything whether at work or basic things I need to do around the house.

Anyone else have troubles with this?"

Its a small company with three engineers, three interns, and four business people. They have a software application that is two years old and still in the development process. This application was developed by interns that stay no longer than 6 months in the company. So I am assuming close to 10 interns have worked on this application. So on my first day I was surprised that the only existing intern that worked on the application was leaving the same week and me and another new intern are supposed to take over. The application is nice and large, but the code is horrible and not documented well. Also they had the freedom to develop the application however they like as long as it met the design requirements. They never done any testing on the application. So with no training or a mentor, Me and the other intern are supposed to find testing tools and write unit tests for the application. We have deadlines and work has been very stressful. As a newbie, I am having trouble to integrate frameworks or to even start writing unit tests, which I never did. The other three engineers don't know anything about the application or framework, so they cannot help at all. Has anyone gone through this mess. What should I do to succeed in this internship?"
5p1deb,1,2017-01-19,Weird grad school situation with intern recruiter. Losing my offer?! Help?!,WarDEagle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5p1deb/weird_grad_school_situation_with_intern_recruiter/,"EDIT: Freak-out for nothing. We had some odd communication, but ultimately they were good so long as I'm planning to go back in the fall.

I might've messed up. Any input appreciated!

So I applied to a number of internships back in September, listing December as my graduation date. I chose December 2017 rather than May so that I could take fewer credit hours and still be eligible for an internship. In early January, not having heard anything back from anyone (except one company who explicitly lists the position for students AND new grads), I went ahead and bumped my graduation date up to May so that I could go on to grad school in the fall. Applied to a number of graduate schools as well as full-time positions so that I could weigh my options for the fall; no responses from applications, won't know about grad school until March-April.

A week ago I got an offer from a large tech company that you're all familiar with. No worries, I thought, I'll just inform them that I have a new graduation date but will still be returning to school in the fall (though I can't guarantee that until I get an acceptance). My recruiter just responded with

&gt;I see below that you mentioned your new graduation date will be May 2017? If that is accurate, I have some good news for you! I will actually push you through our Full Time interview process so that instead of completing a summer internship, you could hopefully just go straight into Full Time work!

Am I screwed now? I don't (necessarily) want a full-time position, I want an internship because I'm hoping to continue my education in the fall. If I don't get into any of the programs I applied to, which is possible, then I'll be looking for a full-time position. Not to mention, if I fail my full-time interviews (which most people do, statistically speaking) then I'll have gone from offer to nothing.

What's the deal? I'm not a grad student so I didn't apply for a graduate internship. I'm an undergrad who is planning to continue my education in the fall, and it appears as though they're saying that my May grad date precludes me from eligibility.

Thoughts? Any experience or knowledge that anyone can impart? Thanks in advance!"

As a follower of this sub and having seen some of the good advice posted I was hoping that I too could get some PF opinions for budgeting my post college life.

Basics:
I'm 27 (single w/ no dependents) and will graduate college this upcoming May and have already accepted a job offer for $82k/yr. I don't have any college debt because I've used my GI Bill to pay for tuition and housing. As a result of using my benefits, I've been able to save $20k via my internships and have approx. 6k in my IRA that I haven't contributed to since leaving the military. In addition, I will also be receiving a $20k signing bonus with my new job.

Where I need help:
I don't come from a well off family (financially) and really don't know good spending practices, and typically find myself choosing not to spend money instead of dealing with the anxiety of how much $ I should spend. I've done some basic budgeting but still not confident on how much I can afford to spend on a monthly basis and still make considerable contributions to my retirement and other savings.

Additionally:
I've been considering purchasing a new car after starting my new career and based on the research that I've done it looks like it will cost me ~$500/mo for the truck that I want including $5k down. Can I responsibly afford $500/mo? Is $500 reasonable car payment? Can I afford $1300/mo for rent? If so, I am close to my ceiling?

I appreciate any input I can get. I realize that $80k/yr a for a new grad isn't bad but I'm afraid experiencing some Chicago winters w/o basic utilities as a child has scarred me."

5p1l7q,66,2017-01-19,How Initial D has shaped my life.,SuperBruan,initiald,https://www.reddit.com/r/initiald/comments/5p1l7q/how_initial_d_has_shaped_my_life/,"I first learned of Eurobeat as a freshman in high school, through an [AMV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zu1km5DlW4) featuring Motorcity (a very good show, by the way). From there I found Initial D, and nothing was ever the same again.


I became hooked on the manga first, and then the show. I loved Shigeno's snarky footnotes/comments sprinkled in the margins, the characters, and of course, the memes. THE FUCKING MEMES.


What I enjoyed equally, if not more, was the technical depiction of racing. Tire grip, lines, braking, weight shifting, countersteering, etc. I lived in a very hilly area in Connecticut, so I used to take my road bike out and try to apply those ideas. I’d powerslide around, and got good enough to where I could pull a 180-degree turn by turning in, throwing my weight to one side, and slamming the brakes. I was burning through brake pads every two months or so and my parents were not happy.


Once I got my driver’s license, I took my family’s old, beat-up, 2001 Toyota Sienna LE, and raced my friend Jon’s 1960’s Chevy [truck](http://imgur.com/NxL3VAy) (that he restored by himself, pretty amazing) home from school on the country backroads. The funny part was that even though the truck was a 4.8 Liter V8, the engine was so degraded that it only made 120 horsepower, and in comparison my 3.0L V6 Sienna had 210. Also, his truck wasn’t geared enough to go over 45 without over-revving. 


We didn’t do any drifting or anything. My Sienna was a FF automatic, and I sure didn’t have the skill anyway. It was very fun but I had to stop when my brother entered high school and had to ride with me.


Now, kind of (exactly) like how it happened to Takumi, I began to wonder about the inner workings of the car I was driving. I knew absolutely nothing about cars, except for gas = go and brake = stop. The best explanation I could give about engines/transmissions/whatever then was, to pull a Jojo reference, “It just works”. 


So I bought used car manuals and studied them. I asked Jon to teach me the ropes. Attended car shows. Watched [Engineering Explained](https://www.youtube.com/user/EngineeringExplained) (great channel). Even my senior English research paper (topic of choice) I wrote about the rotary engine. The complexity and beauty of car design started to get to me, and I knew what I wanted to do from then on out: build race cars.


I applied to and got into Rice University, a very good engineering school, and am majoring in Mechanical Engineering currently. I hold a leadership position in the Rice Electric Vehicle (R.E.V.) team, where we design, build and race a car in Detroit for Shell’s Eco-marathon. I personally designed the [suspension setup](http://imgur.com/a/FEX5Y) while still a freshman there, and am currently working on a gearbox. I haven't even started taking dedicated Mech classes yet (still in general math, chem, and physics), but my self-study has allowed me to work on the same level as senior members who have. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/0TnX2) I am suited up in racing gear, since I'm also the one driving in the race, with my illicit street racing experience. 


I'm also hoping to intern this summer at [Krohn Racing](http://krohnracing.com/), a locally-based group that has competed in races including Grand-Am and Le Mans. They’re pretty serious, and I’m excited.


It’s almost uncanny how much Initial D has informed my choices.

**Old Cars:**
Bunta’s AE86 (a relic in the ID universe by the time Takumi drives it) vs. My 16 y/o Sienna

**Pragmatic Reasons for Racing:**
Takumi: to help with the family business vs. Me: to get home after school faster

**Interest in Cars:**
Takumi asks Iketani to teach him about engines vs. Me: self study with help from Jon

**Dedication to Cars/Racing:**
Takumi dedicates himself to become the fastest driver vs. Me: studies to build (and race) cars

**Project D:**
Takumi - Joins Ryosuke’s Project D vs. Me: hoping to join Krohn Racing 


In short, I'm well on my way to achieving my dream, one that I never would have realized without being introduced to Initial D. 

Rage your Dream, fellas. "

I took a semester off school, I took an internship in another state. I am away from my family, who is all I really want.

I love my job, but it takes up all my time. I don't resent it, I'm glad I'm busy, work is a place I can just focus on something else. I work when I get home because I don't know what else to do.

I found a few friends here, but it feels like work to hangout with them and actually socialize. Because of that, I feel as if I'll lose them, and I don't care now, but I fear I will no longer have them when I'll need them.

I don't have close friends. I don't open up, I don't vent to anyone. The only person I did is 2 thousand miles away, and I messed up our relationship. I know I can mend it, but I don't have much free time here, or I don't let myself.

5p1xtm,1,2017-01-19,"IT internship offers two positions: re-vamping the change management process, or systems design in international cybersecurity. Which is best for early career?",Bear-Tamer,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5p1xtm/it_internship_offers_two_positions_revamping_the/,"I have some IT experience coming into college in addition to some unrelated research work:

* ~1 year of helpdesk with a major coffee company in Seattle. Worked on their mobile ordering system implementation, too.
* 6 months network implementation (config &amp; physical installation) for my university. I wrote software to automatically configure all of our switches (""auto-provisioning"") and it's our new standard process.
* 6 months at our data center, auditing customer equipment and implementing some infrastructure management software for temperature and power controls. It extends to some service management software and can cut tickets as necessary.

Just recently, I was accepted into the IT intern program for a massive aerospace company in the US. Today I interviewed for final placements and a couple of managers marked me as a top candidate, giving me the choice between them. They seem to be great positions and it's hard to choose between them. Right now, my career has been out of control due to an IT reorg I'm going through and how rigorous school is, and I don't have a concrete idea of what I want to do with my career other than I want hands-on work as well (not paper pushing).

Here are my final choices:

* Intern position for revamping the company's change management process from the ground up, with some project management work on the side. It sounds like I will be doing the bulk of this project and work with a lot of teams.
* Systems design and integration for global security operations, where I will work on designing systems for enforcing extra security policies when equipment/users enter high-threat countries. Technology in use unknown other than it's heavy in Sharepoint.
* Another systems implementation position, heavily involved with configuring and deploying servers, handling data center migrations, and answering escalation tickets (sounds like tier 3 help desk, though...).

If you were starting your career, what would you choose?

I'm going to be working in Lawrence, and I've read enough to know that I probably don't want to live there. 

I'm 23, recently out of college so I'm looking to be able to go out and have a good time, date, drink, and explore all Boston and MA has to offer. Here are some questions I'd love to hear your thoughts!

- Should I consider getting a car?

The first thing I noticed on google maps is that anything near Boston is about an hour and a half public transit commute vs. the 20-35 minute drive. Are there any precautions I should be aware about with having a car in the area? SF is terrible with cars so I'd like to avoid a similar situation.

- Areas to live that will serve my commute to Lawrence well? 

It seems like if I choose to get a car that living in Boston isn't a great idea. I see that some people recommend Andover, or Medford, but I've read that they are slow cities without much to do. Where is a good middle ground to look that has a reasonable commute to Lawrence, and will make it easy for me to have fun and mingle with other people my age?

My current issue is that I'm coming to the end of what I hoped to be my final internship but I don't want to work for this company.

5p2w4l,153,2017-01-20,"Well, that is it. I have finished the Discworld series...and I will miss them dearly.",AJNorfield,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5p2w4l/well_that_is_it_i_have_finished_the_discworld/,"I’ve dreaded reading the Shepherd’s Crown (the last Discworld novel) for quite some time. Not because I thought it to be a bad book, but because—to me—it was the end of an era. I started reading the Discworld novels fifteen years ago, during one of my very first internships abroad. From that point on, no journey in my life ever took place without at least one Discworld novel in my bag. Now, with Terry Pratchett sadly taken from the world of the living and books (and his daughter confirming none will continue the series), I have no choice, but to say goodbye to one of the most marvelous—and extremely funny—series I’ve read in my life...

I wonder if it's a sign of getting ""old"". As I never really understood why people cared if an idol like Michael Jackson or Prince died. I mean, who cares...right?! But when Terry Pratchett died...I don't know, I would probably say I was in a state of shock. It made reading the last book in the series...an experience. 

To make things worse, the Shepherd's Crown is about the Witches. The ladies in pointed hats have never been a favorite of mine within the totality of the Discworld. I much rather read about the city watch, or even better the wizards—Rincewind in particular. So, the book already had a strike against it from the start. But, as I started reading, that didn’t really matter anymore. This book wasn’t a single book that tried to grab and hold my attention. This book represented an entire era coming to its end, and it greatly influenced how I perceived the book.

I do think Terry wasn’t completely done dotting all the i’s yet, when he was greeted by the man that speaks in CAPITALS. The story or dialogue often feels…short. It’s certainly not among the best in Pratchett’s series—a similar feel I had with Raising Steam—which probably has everything to do with the illness he fought to keep at bay at the end of his life.
Despite those things the book had a big impact on me. The start of the book had me nearly in tears. The events written felt like they described Terry Pratchett’s own state of being near the end of his life. I have no idea if this was intended by him or not, but, as a reader, I felt he gave me the opportunity to say goodbye to him; a man I’ve never met, but who, in a strange way, was such a large part of my life. Through the story, he showed me he got his things in order. It was like a message he left, stating that he had said many things, and would like to say many more—but it was not to be.
It took me a day or two, before I continued after those first fifty pages or so. All because I needed to reflect and ponder on this aspect of the book. I have rarely read a book intro that had such a deep impact on me.

The Discworld novels will always have a special place in my heart and on my bookshelves. I will certainly push them toward my kids, when they are at the age to appreciate the amazingly witty humor poured into these books, and I hope they will laugh like I did. 

Thanks for ""listening""...and I believe I understand those people grieving for somebody they never really knew a little bit better now.

Alright, enough talk. Now time for more talk.

***Day 1 (Week 1)***
That's right, 'pedes. Open up a journal, create a new MS doc or Wordpad file, and title it as ""Day 1."" This is the start of a brand new day. Pres. Donald J Trump's taking office in a mere 10 hours (at time of typing), SWJs and progressives are losing their fucking minds, and the Alt-Media is laughing their asses off every hour that passes by. Its a brand new fucking day! Enjoy it! Live it up! Go out and do your daily routine by dedicate some time to the following and learn a bit about your body.

The human body exists co-dependently yet *independently* from YOU. You, of course, being the mind that controls your body, sitting here reading this. You make the decisions and the body follows them. That said, your body is independent of your whims due to simple chemistry and biology. What happens to you IN YOUR MIND does not necessarily translate into physical reactions within your body. Although sometimes it does, its a strange process. You can suffer rampant depression and severe stress and your body will display physical reactions. Likewise, your body can feel excellent and healthy and thus impact your psychological state, usually for the positive.

In short, you have needs and wants, and so does your body. The first and foremost is *consistency*. This applies to you and your body. Y'all like your various comforts and routines. Your body, in turn, sets itself to your routine and pumps out power and effort accordingly, adjusting its composition relative to your daily *consistent* needs. You lead an physical-active life, cool: your body will change to provide that increased demand of energy, strength, and endurance with improved cardio-pulmonary fitness, increased muscularity, and an enhanced metabolism to get all those nutrients it needs quicker. You lead a sendentary lifestyle, okay: your body will adjust its metabolic rate to demand less nutrients and more energy storage (aka fat retention) in the hope that when you need to get-up-and-go, you'll have the energy to start being active again.

Your body is kinda like a dog, in a way, and in truth, you need to treat it as such. Take your body out for walks and exercise, feed it consistently and routinely every day, and punish bad habits while rewarding good ones. All of this, over time, will teach your body to react how you need it to and perform how you want it to. Within reason, of course.

So here's the first tiny step and the summation of Day 1 ( of Week 1). Surprise! Its number-crunching. Nothing difficult or strenuous, as you'll get plenty of that latter should you choose to continue (and this thread doesn't get downvoted to Post-Hell).

Here are the basics of what comes next:

1. Calculating your Maximum Heart Rate, Heart Rate per Minute (Resting), and Breath Rate per Minute (Resting).

&gt;MHR is determined by subtracting your age from 220. For example, I am turning 30 in a few days so my MHR is 190 beats per minute (bpm). Your MHR is essentially your ""100%"" of your heart's capacity to work. If you are working at such intensity that your heart rate reaches or somehow exceeds your MHR, not only are your working *waaaaay* too hard but are likely to suffer serious injury or even death. My workout routines all operate within various fractions of your MHR, so if I say that you should run and keep your heart rate between 30% and 50% of your MHR, you should know what your MHR is.

&gt;Resting Heart Rate per Minute (HR/min) can be calculated easily and most reliably by checking your pulse at the carotid artery (side of the windpipe). Grab a stopwatch (or use an application), press a finger lightly upon the flesh over your carotid artery and count the beats for 1 minute. Breathe normally as you do this. On average for a healthy adult, the resting HR is somewhere between 60-100 bpm. For well-trained athletics, its going to be lower than 60, maybe even somewhere around 40 bpm (cardio-bunnies and gazelles, I swear).

&gt;Breath Rate at Rest is calculated in the same way as your Resting Heart Rate, only without the carotid artery. Grab a watch and breath normally for 1 minute. I mean it, *breath normally* for 1 minute. You done? Good. Normal for someone above the age of 12 is around 12-20 breaths per minute. If you hear wheezing or feel a sucking sensation, consult a doctor because something's fucked within your body. That or you smoke, in case of the wheezing. I don't judge, still do myself though I'm quitting on my birthday. Eight years is long enough at a 0.5 - 1 pack a day.

2. Calculate Your Body's Mass (kg), Your Daily Caloric Intake (kcals/day), and Your Adjusted Caloric Intake (kcals/day ± ""x"").

&gt;Okay, whiz-kids from other countries outside the USA already know what kilograms are and use them every day. Feel free to skip this section. Us burger boys and girls here in America rarely use kilograms because just about everything outside of a college campus or a laboratory (or a science subreddit) uses wizard measurements (aka the Imperial System). Pounds and miles and inches and the like. If you don't know the calculation for pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg), use Google or this equation:

Your Weight / 2.2 = Mass

Simple, right? For example, I weigh 212 lbs and my mass is 96.364 kg. **Boom** you now have your mass.

&gt;Building off your mass, your Daily Caloric Intake (kcals/day)is calculated by the following formula:

Your Mass X 24 hours = Your DCI

For example, 96.634 kg X 24 hours = 2312.736 kcals/day

This means that I must intake 2312.736 kcals (or food calories, such as what's written on a Nutrition Label) per day in order to maintain my current mass. Now, this is the key value you'll be playing with over the next few months, adding or subtracting from it as you want. But that comes later. Small steps before bounding over miles...

&gt;But just in case you're curious, your Adjusted Daily Caloric Intake is calculated by adding or subtracting from your DCI. A word of advice, first. If you start adding to your DCI *you will gain mass*. If you start subtracting from your DCI *you will lose mass*. Therefore, if you're looking to build bulk up and your body's been conditioned for weight resistance training (aka weight-lifting), do yourself a favor and stick to adding no more than 500 kcals to your DCI.

For example: 2312.736 kcals/day + 500 kcals = 2812.736 kcals/day

This is *healthy weight gain*, provided you are knowledgeable about your body's nutritional needs. If you are, you probably don't need this guide, but feel free to fact check as you like.

For everyone else, myself included, we're going to be subtracting from our DCI to achieve our Adjusted Caloric Intake. Key word of warning here: Do not subtract more than 500 kcals from your DCI. Again, do **NOT** subtract **MORE THAN** 500 kcals from your DCI. The reason for this is that DCI - 500 = *healthy weight loss*. Seriously, if you do nothing but veg on the couch and adjust your diet using this formula, you will lose 1 pound (1 lb) per week. This is healthy though obviously it does have a limit and every person's body is different from one another. So, in closing on this section, 2312.736 kcals (day) - 500 kcals = 1812.736 kcals/day

Go over -500 kcals at your prerogative. You know your body better than I do (I hope).

3. Basic Explanation of Macro-nutrients, Helpful Nutritional Guidelines, and a Brief Explanation of Follow-on Threads.

&gt;Macro-nutrients are the key building blocks of food, full stop. They come in three primary varieties: Proteins, Carbohydrates, and Lipids (Fats). For everything else on the label of your nearest multi-vitamin, those too are essential but can primarily be found in the aforementioned three Macro-nutrients in various forms of food. Warning: Water, while unlisted, should be self-explanatory in that you need it to survive, much less remain healthy. Three liters of high quality H2O (or 3.17 US quarts) per day is a good start, though as you improve in fitness your daily water intake will rise. Everything the body does ""burns"" water, fun fact.

A.) Proteins are not just the stuff that makes muscles bigger. They are found in every part of your body, and at least 10k of various types of proteins fuel your body's chemical processes. From a basic nutritional standpoint, all you need to really know for now is that you need roughly 0.8 grams of protein per 1 kg of mass *per day*, 8 grams of protein per 1 lbs of weight per day. From a caloric standpoint, because at some point we will be talking about calorie counting, 1 gram of protein = 4 kcals. Your DCI should incorporate anywhere between 10 - 35% of protein.

B.) Carbohydrates are your body's primary source of fuel. Everything your body does while working out consumes carbs... until you inevitably burn through your body's standalone cache of stored carbs and start burning water to metabolize fat for energy. But the intricacies of the Krebs Cycle can wait for later. For now, though, recognize that *quality of carbohydrates matters a lot*. In other words, if you eat simpler forms of foods, the higher the quality of carbs you will consume. Highly-processed foods are fucking bad for you in many ways, but at the crux of the argument, highly-processed carbs are shit fuel for your body. Your body evolved from omnivore stock, meat is all well and good but grains, beans, and veggies are excellent. Your teeth and jaw are designed to chew, not simply bite. So sink your teeth into (I'll stop with the bad puns eventually) multi-grain breads, beans, and dark leafy greens. From a caloric standpoint, 1 gram of carbs = 4 kcals. Carbohydrates should be the largest source of calories in your DCI, anywhere between 45 - 65% of your DCI.

C.) Lipids are very easy yet cloaked in so much bullshit. Even more so than carbs, people get confused about what types of fat your body needs. Here's the rub: Stay the fuck away from (or at the very least, moderate) fats that are *solid at room temperature*. Butter, milk fat, tallow, suet, cream, margarine, shortening, hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated oils, coconut oil, palm oil... I could go on for an hour on this, no joke. Instead, choose fats that are *liquid at room temperature*. Olive oil, corn oil, fish oil, canola, sunflower, soybean, and sesame. These are the sources of fats your body craves and are the stuff in which you need to be mindful most on the Nutrition Label. 

C.1) Food companies don't necessarily lie, but like most forms of ""legitimate"" fake news companies, they cloak the truth of their product's composition within buzzwords and misleading labels. Recall hydrogenated and partially-hydrogenated oils? Yeah, this is a cute buzzword that translates to ""this product contains trans fat, which is really fucking illegal in the USA because its so very bad for you."" You should NOT be eating anything that contains trans fat. At all. Again, the shit's bad for you.

C.2) Saturated fats are found in anything that is derived from animal stock. Poultry, beef, pork, and dairy. Sat fats are bad for you because they contain proteins called ""LDLs,"" which stands for Low-Density Lipoproteins. This is an acronym that is best known for its effects on the body: Cholesterol, aka plaque on the inside of your veins and arteries, aka a future heart attack or stroke given time and quantity. Another fun fact, within 15 mins of digestion (starting when you put it in your mouth), sat fat turns into fat tissue. Your body loves this stuff like a fat kid loves cake. Limit yourself to no more than 10 grams of sat fat per day.

C.3) Good fats, or ""liquid fats,"" go by a rather mystifying name on the Nutrition Label: Mono- and Poly-Unsaturated Fats. Here's the skinny on both: 

C.3.1) Mono-Unsaturated Fats are not good or bad for you. they act as kind of a full system flush, binding to LDLs (aka Cholesterol) and HDLs (High-Density Lipoproteins). You should eat foods containing some of this but more of...

C.3.2) Poly-Unsaturated Fats act as the cardio-vascular system's equivalent of Drain-O, if the stuff also strengthened the pipes in addition to burning away the crud lining the inside. These is the fat you want MOST of. Also known as High-Density Lipoproteins (HDLs), Poly-Unsat Fats are what is slowly coming to visibility on the Nutrition Label. This is the good stuff you want.

C.4) Lipids are important for your body's stored energy system. Fats sheath your body and many of its more energy-intensive sub-systems (heart, lungs, liver, the inside of long bones, between your skin and muscle tissue, etc.). From a caloric standpoint, 1 gram of lipids = 9 kcals, anywhere from 20 - 35% of your DCI. Key note, most of this range is related to sat fat. Again, try to keep to the 10 grams/day rule on that and scarf down all the liquid fats you can to make up the rest of the percentage.

&gt;Helpful Nutritional Guidelines are pretty much this: Everything in moderation, stay away from trans fats, and mind your salt intake. On that last point, unless you live in a desert environment, keep to no more than 1600 mg of sodium per day, especially if you want to lose weight. Sodium is key for your body's muscular system (among many others), but your body doesn't need *that* much. Practicing keeping your sodium at &gt;/=1600 mg is good for when you inevitably start calorie-counting.

&gt;Brief Explanation on Follow-up Threads.  Provided this thread doesn't descend to Post-Hell and people actually want more from me, I'll happily provide it. Starting with tomorrow's thread at 0200-0400 (-ish), I'll start providing the workout routine I developed for my internship. It starts off pretty simply but will build up in time. Don't worry, though, because tomorrow's workout is pretty light. Its just a core body test of your maximal bench press, squat, and dead lift weight, which will act as bench-marks for later months. Also a 1 mile run, as a test of cardio-pulmonary fitness. Pretty simple, just extra data for y'all to jot down as examples of personal growth. I hope you've been taking notes and like what you've read.

Feel free to post questions, comments, concerns, flames, or PM my inbox to an early grave. Have a good morning, centipedes, and MYGA!!"
5p3aho,8,2017-01-20,Take demanding coursework or focus on applying and side-projects?,lavalampsNC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5p3aho/take_demanding_coursework_or_focus_on_applying/,"Some perspective to start out with - I am a non-citizen pursuing my Masters in Computer Science in the US.  I had barely any experience in coding prior to starting my course, and absolutely no clue about CS theory. Fast forward 1 &amp; 1/2 years later, and I consider myself to be a pretty competent coder. I have been able to maintain a &gt;3.5 GPA, and have been able to outperform several of my more experienced classmates, in difficult courses like Distributed Systems, Parallel Computing, and Programming Language Theory  (among others). 

I am currently seeking a Summer Internship or a Fall Co-op by any means necessary. However, I am finding it extremely difficult to get technical phone screens from &gt;90 % of the companies that I am applying to. I think this might be due to my lack of work experience combined with the fact that I don't have many personal projects up on my resume, or much work with the tools used in the industry since most of my projects are more academic and esoteric in nature.

Therefore, I am wondering if it is a good idea to pursue really demanding coursework (like Compilers for instance), on top of  the 20hrs of part time work I put in every week? Or, lighten my workload and instead dedicate all of my efforts into applying for jobs, studying for technical interviews and making a side-project or two. The problem is that I really enjoy pursuing these courses, and like rubbing shoulders with the caliber of students it attracts. I just don't want to do it all and end up with nothing to show for it at the end of the day.

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere race play and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

this might be a big read,sorry about that.


I have a couple of years of experience in customer service and 1 as head of customer service ( with only 20 employees ). After Uni I started working in IT, as a IT support technician for start up companies, at the moment I have around 2.5/3 years of experience in IT.

My internship and my first IT job were very technical and focused on supporting users and their equipment with some networking. 

My last IT job moved away from that much supporting and I focused more on IT projects and bringing in new systems to the company ( basically researching new options, trying them out and implementing. last projects were new video conference tools, chatting tool, planning to set up new offices with the right equipment etc. ). 


I always saw myself in a more managerial role and less of a technical one, so my ideal goal in the future would go to an IT Manager role. 

Now I am looking for a new job and I have one offer but I am not sure if I should accept it. Here is a list of all positive and negative things about this job:


**Positive:**

* Its for one of the most known companies in the world, everyone has heard about them.
* They pay well ( literally what I wanted my next salary to be, I would be very satisfied with that amount )
* I could become a lot more technical and use more advanced and corporate systems which small start ups do not have.
* Location is good ( which means a lot to me )
* It could open the doors for a more advanced technical role ( sysadmin) but I am not sure if I want that.

**Negative:**

* It feels like a step back, since I enjoy working on projects more than I enjoy working on troubleshooting and setting up new equipment.
* Its a very supporty role and they seem to focus a lot on actual hardware support, openning up PCs and shit. Which I am not a fan of honestly.
* They plan to implement shifts in the near future and weekend work. So it would not be typical 9-6 and no weekend work. It would be sometimes both Saturday/Sunday and on some weeks working the afternoon shifts until 11pm. I still do not know the details about this though. 
* This would definitively be just a job. I could not be passionate about this type of work.


This role could open the doors for a more technical role in the future and it does not stop me from going into a more managerial position later. But it feels very helpdesky and the day to day tasks would not be that interesting, working in a start up is more diverse but usually you do not learn that much technology wise.

What is really important to say, I am going to be unemployed from the end of this month. I will get enough money to sustain myself but I feel certain pressure to get a job asap. 


So what do you think? Should I try to wait and hope that I will find a role that fits me well and feels like a step up? Or should I take this job, suck up the negatives and see where it goes?

Also, just taking this job until something better shows up is not a good option because I have switched a couple of jobs already and it will make me look like a job hopper.

Advice would be appreciated.",SugarFreeBrowny,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5p4esq/currently_interviewing_for_different_jobs_getting/,"Good morning everyone,

I recently withdrew from graduate school to take a break and get some experience working. I have applied to around 40 jobs. Expecting to only hear back from 1 or 2, I have had 4 that have made it last round of interviews. While I know that I won't get offers for all 4 positions, It does seem that 2 could be a possibility. This would be my first full time job that isnt an internship in the summers between college semesters. I got my Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry with American Chemical Society Certification. I never really enjoyed research as it is generally a very boring and long process but 90% of entry level positions I could find are research related. I currently have a temporary employment that pays $10.65 an hour and only need to give 2 weeks notice to leave. 

What I am trying to ask is what do I do if one offers and wants me to start as soon as possible but I haven't heard back from another about an offer that would be a better package deal?

Here are the the basic info about jobs I have made it to the last round so far:

**Option 1: Lab Specialist**

Researching in a Cancer Research lab helping with tasks that are generally performed very often in sample preparation. 

Pay: 30-35K

Benefits: Yes

Full Time

**Option 2: Lab specialist**

research in the biochemistry in vision, doing tasks that are generally performed very often for sample prep as well maintaining a mouse colony

Pay 30-35K

Temporary employee until later evaluated so no benefits at first

Full Time

**Option 3: Lab Specialist**

research in the microscopic structures of human tissue, but weren't very clear on what I would be doing

Pay 30-35K

Benefits: Yes

Full Time

**Option 4: Clinical Research Associate**

Office job mainly dealing with the paper work that must be done for clinical research and trials to be completed or move forward.

Pay: 40-42K

Benefits: Yes

Full time

Ultimately, Option 4 is the job I feel I want the most. However I know I wouldn't hear back about that one till almost the end of February and the others I would probably know by the beginning of February.

Also, just taking this job until something better shows up is not a good option because I have switched a couple of jobs already and it will make me look like a job hopper.

5p4jrd,2,2017-01-20,"Bachelor of Music in audio engineering, are my plans to transition into CS sound?",atocs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5p4jrd/bachelor_of_music_in_audio_engineering_are_my/,"Hi, thanks for checking out my post! I've posted about this before without any responses, I hope it's okay if I post again and make things a bit clearer. I have a BM in audio engineering and shortly after graduating last May, I found that although I love audio engineering, I want to focus more on being able to improve how people interact with and/or consume audio. I started self-studying CS mostly using the [OSSU](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) curriculum. At this point I've finished Harvard edX's CS50 and some program design courses. I'm working on Princeton's Coursera course on Algorithms right now.

After searching for a while, the one internship that most aligns with my interests right now is the [Apple Core Audio Software Internship](https://jobs.apple.com/us/search#&amp;ss=Core%20Audio%20Software%20Intern&amp;t=0&amp;so=&amp;lo=0*USA&amp;pN=0&amp;openJobId=52186042). I think it would be really cool to be working on the audio infrastructure that both pros and consumers use, and it would be a great step towards my goals.

What do I need to do to make myself desirable for this kind of work if I'm self-studying? Since it's clear that I'm audio oriented, I have a project that involves music and have a couple more in mind that I could work on. However, at this point I'm not sure if I should be focused on trying to get an internship or trying to get into a master's program. I was hoping I could get an internship before I started applying to graduate schools in the fall, but I don't know if I'll even be ready by then. I'm definitely feeling a time crunch because if I don't apply this fall, I would be starting graduate school in 2019. Without the degree I don't know how my career prospects would be in the meantime and I've also got a ton of student loans bearing down on me.

Regarding graduate school, I was initially planning on getting a masters in CS so that I could have more credentials when it comes to that, but now I'm thinking about CE instead. I'm assuming CS will cover less DSP which I believe is important when it comes to audio. I thought about EE as well, but I'm more software oriented at this point so I didn't think it would be a good fit. I could also go for a MS in Music Technology, but I'm worried that will limit my employment opportunities. Should I be going the CE route? I know a lot of people think a master's isn't worth it in a lot of cases, but would it be the right choice for me?

I should also note that I was lucky enough to find a very generous, relatively small FinTech company that took me on as an intern. At first I was just doing pretty trivial office work, but after progressing in my studies I started helping them design a mock-up for a startup project that they're undertaking. I've also started working with their database and could potentially start doing some financial analysis as well. I realize this is quite the deviation from my intended path, but this is definitely helpful to me with regards to getting experience and having something to put on my resume. The only problem is it sometimes conflicts with my studies as I need to develop a separate skill set (R, Python, finance) in order to be more useful to them.

Sorry about the length of the post, I know it's a lot to go through. I just wanted to get some advice and to see if I'm being too unrealistic about my plans. I've spoken to a lot of my software engineer friends and they have all been very encouraging, but I want to make sure they're not being too nice! Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!"

5p5hq9,6,2017-01-20,OS Discussion/SPOILERS. My theory on the season 7 that never was. Working off the ground laid during S5-S6.,MiralW,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5p5hq9/os_discussionspoilers_my_theory_on_the_season_7/,"I've debated a bit on the premise of why exactly the Huntzbergers disapprove of Rory. (See previous post - https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5n8olb/why_do_shira_and_elias_huntzberger_disapprove_so/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=GilmoreGirls

**Elias** -is a stodgy old coot. Her status as illegitimate is probably enough for him to disapprove of her. 

**Shira** - probably sees Rory as similar to the working women that Mitchum routinely beds (i.e., a threat). Rory is not a vapid socialite that Shira will enjoy shopping with and generally being vapid with. 

**Mitchum**- has been my question mark. I did not see him as caring about the above. But the question is what does Mitchum care about? What Mitchum cares about is keeping Logan on his leash. So, would Mitchum have perceived Rory a threat to Mitchum’s control of Logan? 

- Logan demonstrated that he'd blow off Mitch/work for Rory (Valentines Day). 

- Then there was the internship. Why did Mitchum give her the internship in the first place and then tell her she didn't have ""it""? Did he mean it? Was he lying? Was he being extra harsh to prove a point? Maybe he was testing her mettle. Maybe he wanted to see if his slam would break her. It did sidetrack her. But then she returned to school. Got back with Logan and they were going stronger than ever after the Costa Rica accident. 

- She called Mitchum to b*tch him out about not visiting Logan in the hospital. 

- She tried to get the NYT reporter to write a retraction on Mitchum's interview where he insinuated he gave her her ""start."" (It was never picked up again but it had to mean something. Had ASP been around in S7 it probably would've come up again. Mitchum probably would've found out and likely been pissed. ""How dare she embarrass me?!"") 

- Finally, there was Rory and Mitchum's exchange on the elevator during Partings. He says sending Logan to London had nothing to do with keeping Logan from Rory, but maybe he lied. He said it was to get Logan away from Colin and Finn. Yes, they were his playmates but were they the real threats? Logan was their ringleader. They did what he said. Not the other way around. Mitchum using the ""dopes"" as the justification was a brilliant manipulation. He knew it was something Rory couldn't disagree with. It appeased her and got her on board with London –supportive enough at least to not ask Logan to stay. 

So let’s say Mitchum knew the only one –aside from himself – who had any real influence over Logan was Rory.  And Logan asked Rory to ask him to blow off London. He probably would've stayed had she asked. Or at least delayed going. Mitchum probably knew that. Not that Logan asked Rory to tell him to stay, but that if Rory did ever tell Logan to stay, he would. (Follow?)

So that’s my theory. Mitchum perceived Rory as a threat to his ability to keep Logan under his thumb. The S7 that didn’t happen would’ve followed up on this. How far Mitchum would’ve gone to separate them would’ve been interesting to watch. The 4 words back then – under those conditions – would’ve been so, so different.

Now the way S7 played out rendered the above scenario as no longer viable. Hence, AYITL had to gloss over the Rory/Mitchum power struggle with murky, sinister ""dynastic plan"" references.  Regardless, it's fascinating to consider the season 7 that might've been."

Long story short, I am a student at the Copenhagen Business School, where i currently follow a program called the 'Asian studies programme', which thankfully is changing its name soonish to 'International Business in Asia'. 

However on this bachelor, we have the choice of spending half a year in China or Japan during our 5th semester. However, in order to do so you need to apply in good time, and obviously the better your grades, the better the school you can get into. 

I have the last two years, worked my ass of in order to be able to attend one of the elite exchange programs. I currently have a GPA of 3.87 and pretty much my whole university life has revolved around this exchange. 

The FuckUp comes when I didn't realize that I had to take en english test to show that I am able of following an education taught in english. (My hole program is in english, so I didn't think I would need a test to show I am able to follow an education in English as I already am).
I realised that too late to apply for my exchange on the first quota. (this happened in november). Tears were shed, but I figured that I could just take the test in January for the next round of applications, maybe still get a spot in one of the really good programs. 
So i paid the equivalent of 280 dollars to attend the test on the 14th. But due to exams and family matter, (a recently very ill grandmother), a lot of my attention had been diverted from the matter, and I woke up on the 14th around 13:00 and opened my facebook to see a message from one of my friends asking how the english test went. 

Needless to say I was pretty much bummed. 
I can pay another 280 for another test, but that will only let me apply for the third round of applications which means all good exchange places probably are taken, and I wont be able to afford this semesters books before we hit march. So now, I will have to try and find an internship somewhere, though I have no clue how to go about it. 

TL;DR. 
Spend 2 years neglecting my social life to get good grades in hope of a good exchange program. Missed first round of applications. paid 280 dollars for the application test. Missed that test, and TOEFL wont refund. Any hope of a good exchange are gone, and the economy is as tight as Hillary's butthole on the election day. "
5p5ibj,1,2017-01-20,Help - What job should I take?,Nihlx,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5p5ibj/help_what_job_should_i_take/,"I work in IT and was just offered two jobs. One is working in a hospital Monday-Friday, with weekends offs. It's a workstation support job 50k/yr- going around replacing PCs, monitors ... fixing printers and stuff. The campus is huge, it is one of the top 100 hospitals in the country. Lots of walking from location to location, and some time sitting behind a desk. My office is in the basement of an old building. Benefits are great, good PTO but no pension plan. Has standard 401K pacakge. I work as a contractor now for the company - but they want to convert me to full time.

The other job is at Union Pacific Railroad. It is a service desk job, that is 40k/yr. I'll be at a desk all day, or night (could be second or third shift) with the possibility of working weekends, as well as holidays. The building is state-of-the art, and the company is very reputable. UP also has great benefits, and a pension plan but the pay is 10k less a year than the hospital job. I did my internship here in college. 

Some stuff I'm considering, pros/cons of the hospital:
+I can get up and move around, lots of walking
+Better pay
+Better PTO
+No nights or weekends, unless called in for emergencies
-Old building
-Hospital environment, full of sick people

Things I like about the railroad:
+Better building
+Pension plan
+More potential for growth in job
-Nights/weekends, holidays if they need me to work
-On the phone mostly

This is a very tough decision....any advice?"

I'm assuming the hiring process for 2018 full time hasn't started yet (especially if I want to take a few months off after graduating before starting full time), so should I just try and introduce myself to recruiters and get contact info to maybe make my application process next fall a little easier?

I'm lazy, and I don't like having to do work, which is why I set up an MDT Server and automated Workstation Installation.  

Because of this, I want to learn PowerShell because I like taking months to figure out how to stop doing my job while getting my computer to start doing it for me. So I can read Reddit and stuff.

My current project is automating user creation, because I get bored clicking my mouse.

as a preface, please be aware that I have tried to do as much as possible on my own so as not to ask easily researched questions. If I've missed something and you have a link to rudely drop in my lap, please do!

So let me give you an overview of what I'm trying to accomplish and what I have been able to accomplish so far.

Basically I want to make a script which I can input a Campus, a Department, the Users Position, and their first and last names.

Example: (COMPANY is replaced by my company's initials)  


    PS C:\&gt; New-COMPANYUser -FirstName John -LastName Smith -Campus Downtown -Department RockCollector -Position PolishingAgent -AccountExpires (##/##/####, if intern)

let me outline what I have been able to do so far.  
For starters I have a script working that:  
* Takes 2 inputs. First Name, Last Name.  
* Creates the Home Directory  
* Disables Inheritence from above on the Home Directory  
* Creates the User Account in a specific OU (hardcoded OU,Password,Description,etc based on user position)  
* Sets ACL Permissions on the Home Directory  
* Sets User as the Owner of their Home Directory  


(eventually I will be setting this up to work with Exchange, and I should be able to figure that out without issue.)


Here is the code I am currently working on and what I am trying to accomplish:  

    [CmdletBinding()]
    Param
    (
    [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline=$true)]
    [string]$AccountExpires,
    [Parameter()]
    [ValidateSet('Downtown','Locaton2','Location3','Location4','Location5')]
    [string]$Campus,
    [Parameter()]
    [ValidateSet( 
    if ($Campus = 'Downtown'){ 
    'RockCollector' 
    } 
    else if ($Campus = 'Location2'){ 
    'Garbage','Water','Theguyswholiketoburnstuff'
    }
    )]
    [string]$Department,
    [Parameter()]
    [ValidateSet(
    if ($Department = 'RockCollector') {
    'PolishingAgent', 'Dunce', 'Samurai Jack'
    }
    )]
    [String]$Position,
    [string]$FirstName,
    [string]$LastName
    )

So basically I am wanting to be able to tab complete a -Campus.  
Then I want to be able to tab complete a -Department, but ONLY from the departments that are located at the specific campus I selected.  
Then I want to tab complete a Position, but ONLY from the specific department that I selected.

I still haven't figured out how I am going to take that tab completed string and use it to in a way that provides information that I want, but I figure this is the place to start!

Ideas?

5p605n,5,2017-01-20,Getting an Internship as a Sophomore?,jjuice117,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5p605n/getting_an_internship_as_a_sophomore/,"I'm currently a sophomore CS student attending a well-accredited University attempting to receive an internship this summer. I have roughly 5 years of programming experience and a well-decorated Github with personal projects ranging from web applications to iOS apps. Over the course of the past few months I've been applying to countless internships through various resources such as Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, Linkedin, and my University Career portal. Looking at my email inbox I can confidently say that I've applied to 40+ companies yet have only heard back from ~8; all of which said they were moving on with other candidates. 

I was elated to receive an interview with one of the companies I applied for last month in hopes of finally landing an internship. I had two interviews: one with the recruiter, and one with the hiring manager. The first one was relatively succinct. The recruiter discussed the ins and outs of the intern program, basic company information and what to expect further down the road- no real technical stuff here. I was subsequently scheduled to talk with the hiring manager in the days to come. I get a call from him about a week later and we start having an interesting conversation about my projects and the trade-offs between NoSQL and SQL databases. All of the sudden he says to me, ""Hey, I was just looking over your resume again and I think I misread your graduation date- you aren't a junior are you?"". I told him I'm a sophomore and he told me that his company was only accepting juniors/seniors for this internship, even though after backtracking on the website I applied on the qualifications say ""at least a sophomore"". Before ending the conversation he made a point to tell me I had a pretty impressive Github, then told me to try applying again next year.

So here I am attempting to apply for more internships, still unsure of what to do now. My question is this- does seniority really take that much precedence over qualifications and experience in terms of getting interviews? It baffles me how I was told I'm very qualified and had impressive projects, yet turned down simply due to having one less year of University education."

If you think anyone is going to divulge a secret with actual value to potentially thousands of people, your dead wrong. I am however going to share with you the direction you need to go in order to be able to recognize, develop and implement real methods for growth on Instagram. I am sharing this on reddit because I see people asking on here constantly how to grow, and they get no response. I also am sharing this because I know for a fact that 95% of you who will start this, will fail. The least I can do is show you where to go if you want a chance to succeed.



**My experience with Instagram:**

Now for me, 4 months ago I didn't even use Instagram or any other form of social media. But when doing social media research for my business I stumbled across Instagram bots... Okay Im sure some of you just got angry and are envisioning SPAM SPAM SPAM. Well that's not what Instagram botting is meant for, although it definitely can be used for that. The way I view Instagram bots is having an intern who I can have complete control over and of the running my Instagram account. In many ways the bots are even better than any Intern. I can automate legitimate accounts so I barely have to manage them. They may not be A quality accounts, but they are good enough to have substantial growth.

After some research I figured out what I wanted to do. With botting an account it was like having one intern manage an account. So if I had 30 accounts, it would be like having 30 interns.

After 3 months of a endless research, testing, tweaking and trial and errors. I had my 30 accounts up and running. Every day they perform over 30,000 likes, follows and unfollows. This brings me on average 4-5 thousand followers a day and that number gets bigger every day. This many actions would take about 15 people to do in a day, this is why I love bots, its free labor.




**How to be successful on Instagram:**

HARD WORK. Simple as that.

The majority of the work, and the source of success on Instagram comes from research. If you cant game the system you cant be successful with it. You need to understand everything about Instagram in order to take advantage of it and grow.

So where do you go to do this research? Well thankfully its all located in one area, and its not here on reddit. Let me introduce you to [the blackhatworld forums](https://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/instagram.215/). Blackhatworld may seem sound and look sketchy, but these forums contain everything you need to be successful on Instagram and is an actually very safe and nice community. 

In these forums you will find answers to any question you have ever had about Instagram, and more. The only thing about these forums is the really good information is like the needle in the haystack, its there but your gunna have to do some digging.

If your serious about growing on Instagram, you have to be on these forums. Otherwise you will be working based off outdated and just bad information. If I hadnt gone on these forums, I would have failed miserably.

**My recommendations:**

Mass Planner is the single best purchase of my life. It is by far the best bot out there. You may see on the forums people recommending Followliker, don't fall for that. That program is on the downward trend and people only still have it since its a one time purchase for life.

If someone makes a post about a method, or gives a ""secret"". 9/10 times its no good and yah it may work a little, but ultimately is a waste of time. The best info is found pages deep into a thread, that's where all the good info is buried.

**Just a quick warning**

Achieving huge growth on Instagram is very hard. If you choose to go down this path their are many bumps in the road and each one has the potential to make you quit. While the forums are a great tool, the majority of people see little to no success and cant grow to a size where they can make any money. But don't let that discourage you, it doesnt cost a lot to try, and you can still learn a lot.


**TL:DR Go to [Blackhatworld](https://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/instagram.215/) and do your research, nobody is going to make a cute article that perfectly explains how to get hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers. It took me 3 months to learn everything I needed to know. Good luck.**

I was able to get an interview with a team whose managing director was an alumnus of my current college. We've seen to hit it off and have exchanged informal emails and a phone call this past month. And today was the day I got the formal email scheduling my interview for next week.

What makes me nervous is that I'm a Computer Science major without an extensive background in cybersecurity. I love learning about cybersecurity on my own and I've created 2 independent cybersecurity projects (Kali Linux Raspberry Pi and Buffer Overflow Attack research) as well as finished an interesting book on cybersecurity threats. I have a general knowledge of this field, but I have a huge passion to learn more about it.

So all my peers around me seem to be involved with co-op (no really like everyone I know) and pretty much experts in their fields already. I was wondering what my chances were of getting a summer internship (or any job really) without being in co-op. I do have some career fundamental and communication skills like writing a resume and what not from Sauder, but I just feel like I'm at a clear disadvantage without any co-op resources. I can't really think of a reason why they wouldn't choose a co-op applicant over me (since only beautiful people are in co-op).

I sort of missed my timing to apply for co-op because I had to take a 2 year break from studies after my 2nd year due to military obligations (yeah life sucks). I returned this winter term as a 3rd year and currently taking CPSC 304 and 310 (already took 110, 121, 210, 213, 221). My grades were not very good in my first 2 years and that is why co-op was never really an option for me back then. That being said, my first term back as a 3rd year got me an average of around 80%.

What do you guys think about co-op? I know not all co-op students get jobs and some get offers that are not first choice. BUCS stands for ""Business and Computer Science"", a specialization in BCOM for anyone that is wondering."

5p6s0b,1,2017-01-20,Job Interview Coming Up and Apparently the Whiteboarding is in Javascript Only!,jaybyrrd,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5p6s0b/job_interview_coming_up_and_apparently_the/,"Hey guys,

Oh god, even the TL;DR is long. Sorry but I will be sure to give away sweet internet points for the help I receive! &lt;3 

TL;DR: Absolutely rocked a phone interview today that mentioned most of the work I will be doing is in Javascript, and while I am not expected to be a Javascript expert, they want to know that I have at least used it before. I told them I have not used it in years, but I did a bit during an internship 2+ years ago. They called me for an on site interview Monday (I only phone interviewed today, I guess they liked me). Turns out their on-site programming challenges are only in Javascript and SQL. I want to become pretty functional by Monday because I have used it before but it has been years and I do not feel confident that I can whiteboard it all. What resources should I use? (I am very quick to learn/relearn). 

I had a job screen/interview/first call and one of the key questions they asked was whether or not I have used javascript before. I was honest in that I have worked with it before, but that it has been very long and I would say I am only familiar with Javascript and could probably read it but am not proficient enough to feel confident in it immediately, as it is a big part of the job I am applying for apparently. With that said, the recruiter said that is okay because they are mainly looking for someone who has at least seen it before. The rest of the interview went fantastic. I mean literally perfectly. In fact a few hours later I got a call asking if I can do an on-site interview this coming Monday (all of this has happened today :O). I checked my schedule and it works. 

They sent me an email with what I should expect for the interview, including the technical challenge I am going to get. That said they would be primarily be asking me questions on Javascript and MySQL. I have taken and done a fair amount of SQL, so I am not so worried about that. I am a bit concerned about the Javascript and was wondering what websites/resources I should use to learn it. They point me (in their email) to the w3schools javascript stuff. I wanted to consider using HackerRank but it doesn't seem they have anything on Javascript there. Help! &lt;3

Thanks guys. "
5p6z68,16,2017-01-20,[HM] Trump's First Day,Joterfree,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/5p6z68/hm_trumps_first_day/,"It's a dark, stormy day at the White House. A sign reading ""Days Since Last Racist/Sexist/Discriminatory Comment"" has been newly added to the front lawn. An unpaid college intern comes out and flips the counter from ""1"" to ""0"", all while being viciously whipped by Mike Pence. He then flips the ""Record Number of Days"" sign from 0 to 1 and curls up in his nearby doghouse while Pence goes back inside.

Pence arrives back in the Oval Office to find President Trump with his hands wrapped around the neck of a woman wearing lingerie, too much makeup, and a spot of mysterious white powder on her nose. The woman is breathing normally and tells him that his hands are simply too small to crush her windpipe. He slaps her for such disrespect (she doesn't even flinch), and proceeds to rant at her about how his hands are completely normal.

Mike Pence clears his throat and apologizes for interrupting. Trump gets up and hands the woman a dirty wad of cash off the table for fulfilling his fantasy. ""Thanks, Melania"", he says as he sends her off with his customary handshake, a good ol' American pussy grab. All other ways to shake hands with women have since been outlawed.

""What's shakin', Pence-y Poo?"" Trump asked, completely unaware of how homoerotic that nickname was.

""I wanted to ask how your first day went?"", Pence-y Poo replied.

""Ah, my first day,"" Trump mused, ""I remember it like it was yesterday."" It was yesterday, but Pence didn't say that, because that wouldn't be very funny. Both men flashed back to yesterday's events. It was a bright and sunny day in the white house, with the Obama family and Joe Biden packing up to leave. Michelle Obama was holding Biden back with her enormous arms, as he screamed things like ""Not my president!"" while firing nerf guns into the air. Michelle took the guns away, but Biden pulled out another pair. They had no idea where he kept getting them from.

Meanwhile, Barack Obama took one last look at the White House and sighed, as Trump entered behind him, drinking a Coke. Oh, but not the Coke you're familiar with- the REAL Coke, that only billionaires can afford. The one with the gold flakes in it that poor people's tax dollars pay for. Finishing up, Trump threw the can on the White House lawn, where it landed at Barack's feet. He picked it up, and a single tear rolled down his face. The family watched helplessly as the Trumps took their place, with the weather above the House immediately changing from sunny to stormy as they did.

Back in the present day, the two men laughed, enjoying the memory, as they returned to their business. Trump picked up a newspaper off his desk and looked at it. ""Trump Approval Ratings Starting at Lowest of Any President"", the headline said. Trump shook his head. He'd have to go tweet the phrase ""FAKE NEWS"" in all caps again to take care of this one. After all, how is a billionaire entertainer-turned-President supposed to get enough attention if he doesn't tweet with his caps lock on six times a day?

Trump shook his head, he just couldn't understand it. Why didn't America like being pissed on? After all, Trump sure did."

Today's my first time posting here because I'm in need of some help with a great opportunity I've been given.

Through extensive networking and working my butt off, I've been able to secure a video/phone interview for a summer internship with a great company in Silicon Valley in their Information Security division next week. I was able to get an interview with a team whose managing director was an alumnus of my current college. We've seen to hit it off and have exchanged informal emails and a phone call this past month. And today was the day I got the formal email scheduling my interview for next week.

What makes me nervous is that I'm a Computer Science major without an extensive background in cybersecurity. I love learning about cybersecurity on my own and I've created 2 independent cybersecurity projects (Kali Linux Raspberry Pi and Buffer Overflow Attack research) as well as finished an interesting book on cybersecurity threats. I have a general knowledge of this field, but I have a huge passion to learn more about it.

My question is: what types of technical questions should I expect to be asked? I'm going to be studying every single minute and I want to know what I should focus most on.

5p8gk5,1,2017-01-20,a,TheFlukeLord,PostPreview,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostPreview/comments/5p8gk5/a/,"&gt;Horror Story at the Geriatic Floor: St. Luke's Medical Center
From: Marlene Chance chancesr@bellsouth.net
I am so sorry to hear about your loss.
My mother was only one of the many victims of the negligence, incompetence, and malpractice of St.
Luke's Hospital, many of it's doctors, and every single nurse who was assigned to my mother, no
exception! As a graduate of nursing from the University of the Philippines, I had the great misfortune of
witnessing first hand, the incredible lack of compassion, basic nursing care and professionalism that
nursing stands for, as well as the serious lack of basic intelligence from all the hospital's nurses that the
St. Lukes employs and tolerates.
The nursing duties and functions that were so simple and basic, and that should have all been mastered
while in nursing school prior to graduation and licensure, all turned into major disasters and
complications that could have ALL been prevented. These are only a few of the negligent and
incompetent acts: (1) bed sores on my mother's buttocks on the third day of admission, not having been
turned, moved or changed, (she was actually stuck to the soiled linen from old urine and feces) until I
arrived from the United States to change her myself...there was absolutely no reason for decubitus
ulcers on a third day, or any day for that matter, if basic nursing care is carried out. She was in a private
room on the Geriatric floor where nobody changed patient's beddings for weeks at a time, or until
forced to by the family of the patient.
(2) fecal impaction which resulted in acute rectal bleeding and anemia, and subsequent and multiple
blood transfusions, plus a stat colonoscopy that required anesthesia of course, in an already
compromised patient. I begged for the attending (Sotomayor) to check her bowels DAILY, because she
had not had a bowel movement in several days, and only on the 10th day, did I finally get an order in the
chart for an INTERN (another incompetent future doctor at the time) to disimpact my mother, which
resulted in bleeding and hemorrhage.
(3) misuse of the appropriate antibiotics, having had a urine culture done, the attending ordered Amoxil
which was not sensitive to the bacteria in her urine, and a few days later, she became septic and
gradually deteriorated from untreated Urinary Tract Infection. This is a disease that we treat in the
outpatient settings in the United States, it is basic, easy to treat, if standard care and protocols are
followed.
(4) As a Diabetic, drawing blood out of the lower extremity is an absolute CONTRAINDICATION, but the
phlebotomists continued to take blood out of her feet when nobody was looking, or intentionally at
dawn, when my mother's attendant was sleeping, and before I arrived for a visit. I posted signs all over
the wall and bed, and informed the nurses and laboratory supervisors never to allow blood drawing
from any other part of her body aside from her arm, but nobody heeded my instructions. My mother
died of a Massive Pulmonary Embolus after 45 days of admission at St. Lukes. This clot was a direct
result of drawing blood from her lower extremities, simply because the medical technologists were too
incompetent and too lazy to find any other vein elsewhere.
(5) Physical Therapist burned my mother's left arm and shoulder while applying the ultrasonic heat, and
not bothering to test before using on a patient. I found the burns myself, they were never reported. My
mother sustained first and second degree burns that again, were dismissed as ""normal and usual effects
of being a patient at St. Lukes."" That is not tolerated in the United States, would have required an
incident report, which was never completed, and would have easily been grounds for negligent action
and malpractice.
(6) Tube Feedings. Not a single RN on the floor had the basic knowledge or skill as to the proper use and
feeding process of my mother's PEG tube. They practically shoved the container of food as fast as they
could, causing abdominal discomfort, unless I stood next to her bed to watch and supervise. Nobody on
the floor even knew how to use the feeding tube machine on that Geriatric Floor. We had the
supervisor, head nurse and director of nursing in my mother's room trying to figure out how to use this
very simple machine that they should have been trained to use properly. Needless to say, because of the
delay in feedings, my mother's nutritional status was compromised even more, resulting also in
occlusion of her PEG tube, which of course required a replacement. The skills or lack of, in these nurses
were pathetic, and unacceptable.
(7) This was rather interesting. At 9 o'clock every morning, a clerk from the business office would knock
at my mother's door to hand me the hospital bill, and ask how much I was paying that particular day! It
did not matter how much of the expense these incompetent employees were costing me for their
negligent actions, all that mattered is that I made a deposit towards the multi-million peso bill that
multiplied every hour! And if I did not go down to make a payment, they would call to remind me until I
did. At the ER, the hospital refused to treat my mother until my sister made a P10,000 deposit in the
middle of the night, when the banks are closed! And on discharge, after Dr. Abraham-Lim's professional
discount (the only decent doctor my mother had), we paid a 2 Million Peso hospital bill that did not
include the pharmacy and mutiple professional fees.
I can go on and on with the numerous disasters, these are only a few that stick out in my mind and that I
will never forget!
There were clearly several instances where St. Lukes failed to meet the standard of care which directly
caused injury and subsequent death to my mother. I made every effort to litigate, but unfortunately,
there were no malpractice attorneys available in the country, and nobody was willing to take the case in
the Philippines. I tried to publish the detailed scenario of the many terrible mistakes committed that
eventually led to my mother's death, but the lawyers of this big corporate institution paid Manila Times
and other newspaper publications not to publish my article. I wrote to the Secretary of Health, but got
no response. I wrote and sent letters by certified mail, to the President and CEO of St. Lukes and to the
Director of Nursing and the Nursing Department, and again, did not get any response.
As a Filipina myself, I must say it is rather unfortunate that Filipinos and others who reside in the
Philippines, have to fall victim to the poor and negligent, but very, very expensive medical care at St.
Luke's Hospital every day. There must be a way to put a stop to this negligent care!"
5p8hlx,26,2017-01-20,Regular Show: Over Six Years of Laughs and Life Lessons,CoolVidsFTW,regularshow,https://www.reddit.com/r/regularshow/comments/5p8hlx/regular_show_over_six_years_of_laughs_and_life/,"Hi there, r/regularshow. Today I present to you a Top 10 list of my favorite *Regular Show* episodes. I wasn’t quite sure where to post this where people would care, so I hope you can take the time to read through my post and see my reasoning behind some of my choices. Just some background info: I was ten years old when this show came out, and I still remember watching *The Power* during the slot it shared with with *Adventure Time* at the time on Cartoon Network. It has been a blast growing up watching these characters evolve over time, and like the title of my post implies I did indeed laugh a lot and learn a lot from this believe it or not. Some of you may sympathize with me when I say that. So! Without further delay, let us get started!

**10. The Real Thomas: An Intern Special**
Season 6, Episode 8 (Ep. 161)

&gt; “Because my name is not Thomas. It is Nikolai. And I am Russian spy.” *dramatic pause*

Fun Fact: *Exit 9B* barely missed my Top 10 (#11) and was defeated by the episode that concluded the Thomas/Nikolai arc of *Regular Show*. During his time on the show, Thomas was always a fun character to watch in the background, doing most of the grunt work the Park’s employees would normally handle themselves. The way his character was written impresses me the most. I remember when this episode first aired and was immediately caught off guard by the fact that Thomas/Nikolai worked for the Russian govt, spying on the Park. This was one of the more “action-focused” episodes, and I consider it one of the best ones. I think because it included a storyline (unlike most other episodes), it added more reason to why I chose this episode to be my No. 10. What I'm saying is that it contained more ""substance"" and ""depth"" to it. Also, I loved the U.S. nationalism from everyone towards the end. That was quite humorous (especially for the day I'm posting this). Overall, it was a great conclusion to one of the many character arcs in *Regular Show*.

**9. New Year’s Kiss**
Season 5, Episode 14 (Ep. 113)

&gt; “Year of the Rigby, baby!”

Aka the episode that introduced CJ as a recurring character throughout the show. I really like this episode because it reintroduced CJ, who had not been in an episode since *Yes Dude Yes* (appeared briefly in a hallucination in *Survival Skills*, but I won’t count that). Anyway, Rigby is put in charge by his future self to stop Mordecai from kissing a girl at midnight. While at the end of the episode, it may have seemed like he saved the day, Mordecai ends up kissing CJ. Whether the plan by his future self was to stop the kiss between him and Tracy Hashtag or CJ is unknown, but it is an interesting thought to ponder. Did Rigby save Mordecai from an unhappy future or create a new one for him and CJ? The first half of the Margaret arc (from Season 1-4) was very entertaining to watch. My fear, at the time, was that I would lose interest if she was truly gone for good. However, and thankfully, I stuck around to watch the CJ arc begin. And at this point, I feel like Mordecai’s character development begins its evolution around this episode or the next, which to me means a lot when watching any television series.

**8. Meteor Moves**
Season 4, Episode 28 (Ep. 107)

&gt; “You know what they say? Envelopes thin, didn’t get in. Envelopes fat, school is where it’s at!”

This is one of the more memorable episodes I remember watching. I felt so happy for Mordecai at the conclusion of the episode. He finally did it! He made it out of the friendzone! From all guys around the world, we salute you, Mordecai. You have courage. But seriously, I can’t exactly relate personally, but the episode made me imagine myself in Mordecai’s position, and now that I think about it, while I type this, I’m pretty sure I actually cried at the end. Mordecai gave me hope. I think at that point on, I empathized with his character and personality more than I ever did before. A truly emotional episode for me for sure.

**7. Rigby’s Graduation Day Special**
Season 7, Episode 36 (Ep. 217)

&gt; “The greatest mistake a man can make is looking for flowers among the weeds, overlooking the fact that oftentimes the very weeds are flowers.”

This episode is meaningful because of two reasons. The first is because it marks the end of Rigby’s journey throughout high school. From *The Eileen Plan* to *Gymblonski* to *Rigby Goes to the Prom*, we all saw Rigby go through thick and thin to not just satisfy and make Eileen proud but also for his own sake, knowing he can accomplish anything. For some people, I think that message means a lot: never give up on anything you set your mind to, a classic message. The other reason is because it marks the beginning of the “Space Saga”. At first, I was very confused with what was happening and it all seemed so sudden and rushed, but in retrospect, I think this point of the show was the perfect time to introduce, essentially, the beginning of the end [of the show]. The episode, as a whole, tied up everything together and successfully transitioned into a new (concluding) storyline.

**6. Pam I Am**
Season 7, Episode 32 (Ep. 213)

&gt; “The sound from the guard post bounces off of the dome and back down to this exact spot.”

With the exception of Pops and Skips, we never typically see *Benson* in the dating world. This episode rectified that. After seven ex-girlfriends (according to the wiki), Benson finally found someone he resonates with (through the finale to add). This episode made me feel happy for the guy. I never really knew why he never had a steady girlfriend in the first place. You’d think for a guy with a hard-working work ethic, he’d probably have one by now. I guess he was just plain unlucky. I’m glad the writers for the show didn’t forget about this aspect of him. While Benson does have a short temper (among other weaknesses), he is very loyal and means well in the end. It was nice to see him be rewarded for once.

**5. Meet the Seer**
Season 8, Episode 25 (Ep. 242)

&gt; “Many universes have come and gone. It’s the natural order of things. Yours lasted longer than most, but now your universe, your lives, the Park, everything. It’s all going to end.”

Another one of my favorite story arcs of *Regular Show* was the “Format Wars”, and it was really amusing to catch all the media references throughout these episodes. Internet/Streaming makes a comeback from *Format Wars II*, the return of HD DVD, and the debut of Blu Ray, a character I really wish we saw more of. The sibling rivalry was an aspect I thoroughly enjoyed. I think the best media related pun was the fact that the planet the Park crew lands on is named “Planet Nielsen”, named after the company that measure audience ratings across television and the web. I will say, streaming is, in fact, dominating the media industry. I don’t get why people are so against it though (even in real life). But that topic is for another day. Several puns later, we’re introduced to the Seer, voiced by the same actress who played Helen on *Drake and Josh*. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think this is the point of the show where the fourth wall is broken...continuously. This is something I love to watch, and I find it very amusing to watch characters realize they play parts of someone’s imagination. But that’s just me. Overall, as a tech/media geek/enthusiast, I find this episode, and the ""Format Wars"" arc episodes, fun to watch and sprinkled with all sorts of media related puns. Good stuff.

**4. Yes Dude Yes**
Season 3, Episode 25 (Ep. 65)

&gt; “Yeah. Cloudy J?”

The episode that was the precursor to the CJ arc. We’re first introduced to CJ, and she and Mordecai hit it off really well. That is until Mordecai invites Margaret to the movies. CJ starts a storm at the coffee shop and stops when Mordecai owns up to his mistakes. After that, we never see her again until *New Year’s Kiss*. I think it’s pretty cool the writers introduced CJ this way. You would think CJ was a one-off character at this point in the show, but nah she shows up 50 episodes later to introduce a new dynamic to the second half of the show. It makes me wonder if this was planned the entire time or the writers wrote it in sometime later. Whatever the case may be, this is what started it all for the CJ arc, and I have a strong appreciation for this episode.

**3. This Is My Jam**
Season 2, Episode 13 (Ep. 25)

&gt; “You can’t touch music, but music can touch you.”

This is probably the funniest episode in my opinion, especially when the Summertime Song manifests itself into live- er - “ghost” form. The quote I mention above is one of the most memorable from the show as a whole. The montage scene was quite funny as well. But the bottom line is that the songs in the show were so incredibly catchy. Aw snap. Aw snap. Come to our macaroni party and we’ll take a nap. There’s not much else to say other than the fact this episode was freakin’ hilarious.

**2. Just Friends**
Season 7, Episode 12 (Ep. 193)

&gt; “I think it would be best if we were just friends.”

This episode. This episode, man. It provided so much closure for me. Personally, I’m more of Mordecai and Margaret type of guy, but let’s not spark too much argument. The closure was so perfect, so well-executed, and it taught all of us a valuable lesson: we’re all still young (Well, I think. Don’t want to make *too* many generalizations of the sub here.), so we should enjoy our lives while we can and save the serious stuff for later. One way or another, I’m sure some of us can relate to this episode...somehow. It just resonates me so well, and while this episode didn’t make me cry it did make my heart happy.

**1. A Regular Epic Final Battle**
Season 8, Episode 27 (Ep. 244)

&gt; “Jolly good show.”

I won’t say too much about the finale other than it truly was a “jolly good show”. First off, the throwback to *The Power* was a genius call. I didn’t watch the finale live, but it did catch me off guard for a few moments until I realized the universe (kind of) restarted itself. I think Pops’ death was necessary to end the show because I think it would end on a *too happy* note. I’m glad Mordecai ended up with someone else, glad Rigby and Eileen are happy, glad Benson married Pam, and everyone’s lives were saved thanks to his sacrifice. The reunion scene caught me in the feels, man. I’ve lived to watch these characters for almost half of my life. That. Is. Crazy. “Heroes” made it even more emotional (shoutouts to the team who gathered enough money to license that song). I don’t know what else to say. If *Regular Show* had to end eventually, I’m glad it ended in this way. It’s all bittersweet.

If you managed to get this far, thank you for reading my Top 10 list! I’m curious as to what your Top 10’s are so please feel free to let me know in the comments! I’d just like to thank J.G. Quintel for over six years of laughs and life lessons. And I also want to thank this sub for sparking discussion about the latest episodes when everyone stopped caring about the show how many years ago. It’s been a pleasure watching with you guys. Some honorable mentions for this list include: *Exit 9B*, *Real Date*, *The Power*, *Space Escape*, *Rigby Goes to the Prom*, *Guys Night 2*, *Format Wars II*, *Dumped at the Altar*, *The Dome Experiment Special*, and *The Eileen Plan*.

If you want to see my full list of favorite episodes, check out this link: http://challonge.com/7tfz6p1k/standings. I played a mock Swiss-round tournament using some *Regular Show* episodes I found entertaining. That’s how I made my list as it was way to difficult to choose on my own. Again, thank you for reading this post, and it truly has been a jolly good show.

5p8jmp,2,2017-01-20,My ex [23M] of 3 years dumped me out of the blue 3 months ago and I'm [22F] having a hard time moving on,avril15,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5p8jmp/my_ex_23m_of_3_years_dumped_me_out_of_the_blue_3/,"Three months ago I was happy. Well, stressed and confused and everything that a freshly-graduated twenty-something normally is, but in the process of figuring out how I was going to move cross-country to be with my boyfriend of 3 years.

I know that everyone who's gone through a breakup talks about how perfect the relationship was, but it was so good, you guys. He was everything that I look for in a person: smart but not too pretentious, cute but not intimidating, dedicated to his goals but not a robot about it, concerned about the world but so happy. He just radiated happiness. He wasn't a one-note person by any means, but his default state was joy and appreciation for life. I'm a person who tends to vary much more emotionally (a bit of anxiety, a bit of seasonal depression) and he brought out the best in me. And he was so funny without trying. He thought the world of me, and showed it.

We were always on the same page conversationally. It was so effortless to be sweet to each other. We were at school together so we both had challenging courseloads (and extracurriculars, and hobbies, etc) but we spent as much time together as we could. Long mornings in bed, date nights. Our friends all became friends with each other. Our lives felt combined without being codependent. Even after our honeymoon period was theoretically over, we were still growing as people and learning things about each other. The sex even got better over time. Everything that everyone talks about love being, but not in a grand way. I just had my person.

Pretty much the only thing we ever had a conflict about was what would happen long term, geographically speaking. His major almost entirely goes to a certain city, and mine to another. We did internships every summer in our respective cities, which would go okay. We figured out what a long distance relationship would look like and initially neither of us wanted that. Our senior year, we almost broke up after he interviewed for a job in my future city and got it... just to use it to negotiate a better offer in his city. We signed on offers across the country from each other two Octobers ago, and spent about a day broken up. We decided that we would rather be together through the end of the year and enjoy it. A couple months later, after he came home for Christmas with me (!), we decided that we wanted to do it long term and long distance. It's very common in my industry to move on from the first job after 1-2 years and move to (among other places) his city, so it seemed like a doable plan.

Fast forward a year later. A wonderful last semester together, the relationship deepening even further, graduation, trip to Europe with friends, starting our jobs. We saw each other almost once a month and were communicating really well; phone calls every few days and lots of texts. It wasn't the same and we sometimes had to talk through things but it felt like we were working towards a great future. Like, he would literally bring up children (not often, not even sure that either of us really wanted them, and not for another 5 or 10 years, but hey...) and we were planning Thanksgiving next month with both of our families.

In October, recruiting starts for the job-after-my-job, so I started talking to people. Not even to jobs directly, but general networking to figure out how to get hired in his city. I was hating my job, feeling the post-college blues, having a bit of a crisis about what to do next work-wise. Holding on to the idea of at least knowing where I was going next and that I would have him. And I wanted to be in his city anyway! Warmer, more friends, more interesting jobs.

Over of the course of this week or so, I talked to him a lot since I was starting to make decisions. I brought up the possibility I could move out there as early as this summer (though it probably wouldn't be until the summer after). I noticed that he started getting quieter and less enthusiastic through the week. I finally brought it up over the phone and he started telling me that he'd been having doubts... that if I moved out there it would mean something serious about the relationship and that would be too much pressure.

As calmly as possible, I told him that he had a couple of weeks to get his shit together because I needed to figure out what I was going to do with applications. He agreed and, after a very tense 6 hours, called me back while I was at a party and dumped me. ""Hardest decision I've ever made,"" ""maybe we can revisit it in a year or two,"" etc.

After a call the next day to make sure that this was actually happening, I've gone no-contact. I sent one email a few weeks later that he responded to and it was all very polite and very sad.

I'm angry that he ended it the way he did, without any hint of his feelings when I thought we had great communication. In some ways  I wish it had gone sour first so I could at least feel like I was moving on to bigger and better things; instead, it was out of the blue a couple weeks after we had just had a romantic trip driving down the coastline in a convertible, ffs. I expected it to end because of the distance, not because of me ending the distance, and we were talking and seeing each other so much that it was still going amazingly. I had never felt more secure in the relationship.

The breakup was his unilateral decision and that hurts me. I keep feeling that if he brought it up sooner, a conversation could have saved it, or at least been able to end it in a way that wouldn't have wrecked me. It feels more like I experienced a death than a breakup sometimes. I thought I was a well-adjusted person with a career, friends, and hobbies, but it was like I lost my best friend, my past, and my future all at once. It felt like my world bottomed out for a few days even though I wanted to laugh at myself for watching movies, eating ice cream, crying at work, etc.

Things are better now in a day to day sense but I feel like there is this hopelessness about my future without him. And it hurts because I know that someone who is capable of hurting me by walking away so suddenly is not someone who deserves to be in my life, but I miss him so much.

I've analyzed over and over again how things could have gone differently, blaming myself for pushing too much. I feel like I'm coming to terms with the fact that we were at different stages of commitment and that it's not my fault, but it's still so hard. Really, really hard. I still think about him every day, and though I'm not falling apart I let myself indulge in sadness for a night every week or so. It's a different thing every time (the texts! the pictures! writing about it!) so I feel like it's letting me process it, but ideally I'd like to be thinking about him a lot less.

I didn't see anyone romantically for the first month. I fell into a relationship with a good friend (also cross-country...) which has been  loving and helpful in knowing that I can still connect with people and be happy, but since it's long distance it's missing much of what I need in a relationship. I've started casually dating but realized how punishingly high my standards are (beyond ""but it isn't him!"") and it's brought up a lot of feelings.

During the relationship, I frequently wished that we had met when we were in our late twenties and had already had time to have dating adventures because that's something that we both wanted (though I felt like he was worth it to stick with). Not because of any sense of impending doom, beyond the whole geography thing, but I knew that college relationships ending is a normal thing, and we could have been so much more than that. And now I feel like he's spoiled me for future relationships, even though I know someday I will (probably) get to a similar place of connection with other people. But to me, in my short dating life, it was the best I could imagine a relationship being-- so much mutual love and support-- and everyone I meet is... just fine. No spark.

It's also hard because I still haven't figured out what my next move is yet job-wise. Without moving to his city being the primary goal (even though it's still top 3), I'm totally floundering. I'm having a tough time coming up with a future that I could love, or even tolerate. I talk to people about moving to the desert a lot. I'm taking tests for grad school, but those are backup plans. My lease is up in June and I don't know whether or not I'll be moving to another apartment or another city or staying put. I feel unmoored without him, and it's making me realize how little I had planned beyond him before.

I'm trying to figure out a way to move on without losing all of the beautiful memories that we shared. I'm trying not to hold on to pain and anger while also not trying to idolize him, because he did wrong me. I don't want to make him into the one who got away... but that's how I feel. Conversely, it's easy to pick apart the relationship and find small things that were wrong with it-- but I also know how happy we made each other. I know also that I'm confounding my time with him with my time in college, when I was flourishing, versus now, where I work all the time and am stressed and sad.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I just wanted to share my pain and feel acknowledged. Thank you for reading. I have a decent support network here and with friends across the country, but I don't feel like I can come to them when I feel sad about it all the time. Has anyone gone through something similar? How long did it take you to ""move on""?

tl;dr: Fulfilling, wonderful relationship ended suddenly, and I'm having a hard time moving on."
5p8jt0,21,2017-01-20,there is no point and i can't see things ever getting better,sadboy633,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5p8jt0/there_is_no_point_and_i_cant_see_things_ever/,"i know everyone's immediate reaction is to try and talk someone out of killing themselves, to try and convince that person that things will eventually improve and there are things to live for. it's hard for me to believe that these aren't just words. i know suicide is always sad, and i understand that it can be a selfish act, but is it really so bad if that person is in constant misery? 



i wouldn't say that i would try to kill myself anytime soon, but i can see it happening within the next year or two. i'm almost 20 and i can see the road i'm going down and it does not look good. i'm not self-sufficient at all, and i don't want to be a leech on my parents. i've never had a job and the idea of getting one is terrifying because of my stupid fucking social anxiety. i barely talk to anyone anymore because i avoid anything that makes me uncomfortable, which is most things. 



i wish i could rewind my life and avoid fucking myself up so bad, but i can't. i always wanted to become a business executive or an investment banker, but it's too late for that now. i know it sounds silly for someone with social anxiety, but i do think i had the qualities to be successful. i've gone and fucked it up and i'm too old to put myself on the path to success now, even if i were somehow able to immediately overcome my anxiety and depression. im so far behind everyone else my age and even if i manage to get an internship somewhere it will be years before i'll be able to move out and live on my own.



i just feel so pathetic because of how such basic things scare me now. i feel like i will be a child that my parents will have to look after forever. i'm attending community college at the moment but that's it, and i get anxious before every single class. i don't know how i can go on like this"
5p8poe,2,2017-01-20,Me [21 M] still letting my ex [21 F] affect me,5evermemes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5p8poe/me_21_m_still_letting_my_ex_21_f_affect_me/,"I call this phase in my life Learning. I had accepted an internship in a new part of the country. I once again was going feet first into the unknown. I didn’t know the area, anyone around it, or even what I would really be doing. The first day went well. I met a few people I’d be working with and they seemed nice. Me and some fellow interns were living a little far away from where we were working so we all decided we would just carpool to work. It was easy to carpool as we were all living within walking distance of each other.

It was through that that I would get to know them quite well. You tend to get to know people when you’re required to spend 40 minutes each way in a car with them. Then the weekend came. I had no idea what I was going to do. I’m usually not used to being alone and I was scared that being anti-social would push me back towards my depression. I couldn’t let this happen. I needed to stay busy and that’s just what I did. The day was a Saturday – sunny and not a cloud in the sky. I woke up early and went on a nice long bikeride along the river – some 60 miles or so. After getting back I was completely exhausted. I decided I would go hit the pool and just relax and read my book. Turns out, one of the other interns was there. We got talking and started to get to know each other some more. It was at this moment that I felt my first attraction towards her. She was so unique. I’ve never met anyone quite like this. We started to hang out more and more. It didn’t take long for us to feel like we’ve known each other for a very long time. One thing lead to another and we started what I would call dating – though she wouldn’t admit it at the time. She was just getting out of what she called a very abusive, terrible relationship. 

I found it strange from the beginning that she would still talk this guy while we were “dating”. She was scared to say that we were in fact dating based on the fact we had no idea what we would do when the internship ended since we lived 5 hours apart. This guy, her ex, would text her sweet goodnight and goodmorning texts. Every. Single. Day. This made me uncomfortable. As mentioned, I already have deep trust issues and this was not helping. She said she would deal with it and that it wasn’t an issue. I was using this as an opportunity to learn and work on my issues – and that’s what I did. I left it alone and just worked on myself and my relationship skills. 
Our time spent together was amazing. I never had any issues with our relationship – when we were together. When we were apart it was problematic. She was a terrible communicator and often ignore my calls or texts. She would obviously see them, but just then ignore them. It wasn’t like I was bothering her either, some of them were even important. Because of her ignoring me, bad communication skills, and her still talking to her abusive ex-boyfriend, I was never truly happy in the relationship. However, I would still rather be in an unhappy relationship than be alone.  As the internship came to an end and we went our separate ways, it was at that moment that she wasn’t this to be a real relationship. She couldn’t see me just go. I was so happy to hear that. I thought that this would perhaps change the nature of our communication – and again, I was wrong. 

We both went back to school. We agreed we would still see each other about once a month which was perfectly ago – but the communication had to be there. I then later found out that she’s living across the street from her ex-boyfriend. This worried me greatly. I didn’t ever think she would cheat on me or anything like that. But just the fact that he abused her and she still considered him her best friend was quite concerning. The first time I visited her it went great. It was like we fell in love at that moment. The second time was good as well. But I had to bring up my trust issues and my overall concern with her inability to communicate. I honestly just felt used and like I was the only one putting effort into the relationship. She was never good at ever explaining her feelings, but she assured me it was okay – and I bought it. 

At this point, I basically felt alone. Sure we were dating but I was just unhappy. I was once again depressed and looking for some sort of sign. I suppose I got that sign when both her and I signed offers to return to the same company the next year. I thought for sure that this would be it. We’ll make it through this school year, return to the company, and happily-ever-after. 

That’s… not quite what happened. I went and visited her again and things just didn’t seem right. She didn’t seem happy – and I sure wasn’t. I tend to wake up before her and because of this I was reading a book when she woke up. She got up and for 30 straight minutes didn’t even acknowledge my existence. She then proceeded to just leave and take her dog on an hour long walk before returning and even saying “good morning” to me. I was angry. I told her that it’s bullshit she can’t even 1) say good morning when she wakes up, 2) acknowledge my existence, and 3) invite me to go along with her (or even let me know!). This lead to an argument. And that’s all it seemed like we did at that point in time was argue. Later that day I was talking to her about the nature of our relationship and why we aren’t happy. The issues I had could easily be fixed by just working on our communication skills and being more open about her friendship with her ex-boyfriend. She didn’t want to talk about that. We got into a really big argument again and ultimately she told me it was over. I asked if it was because of her ex and she said no. I didn’t believe it. 

Our argument got so heated that she felt threatened. Apparently at some point she texted her ex to come over and basically kick me out. I was trying to be reasonable and talk to them as adults but all he would say is how I have to leave. My feelings were somewhere between “fuck you” and like I was dying inside from sadness. She said she just didn’t feel safe around me anymore and that I needed to go and we would never talk again. What happened next is something that I’m not proud of. But definitely a defining moment in my life. I was gathering my things, being civil, and about to leave when her ex reached out to grab me and forcefully make me leave (something I was already doing). I didn’t really know what he was going for, but I, out of instinct grabbed my knife and told him to back the fuck off. The look on her face is something I’ll remember forever. The look of total fear. The girl I loved could no longer look at me. It hurt more than anything I’ve ever experienced. We haven't talked since and still to this day (3 months later) I miss her and think about her. 
  
  ---   
  tl;dr Got out of a relationship that I was treated very poorly in about 3 months ago. I still dream and think about her. I still have trouble meeting new girls and going on dates with them because I'm thinking of her. She treated me poorly and I'm just having trouble moving on with my life. "

Margaret (name changed) was one of the only girls I ever truly connected with during my four years of college. She laughed at my jokes, she enjoyed my company, and I enjoyed hers. We were incredibly close, almost best friends. We'd text each other non stop, we would laugh through different bullshit classes, labs, we even got internships at the same place for our senior project so we could do it together. Whenever I was with her, I was happy. And one day, I decided that I didn't want to be her friend anymore. I wanted to be her boyfriend. This was a girl who I'd connected with on a much deeper level. It wasn't that she wasn't physically attractive, she was. The difference was that I wasn't attracted to her for that reason alone, which many will agree, is a truly special kind of attraction . I decided that I would forever regret it if I didn't tell her how I felt.


And she shot me down. Twice. After the first time I told her, things got awkward between us, but we made it through and she seemed even friendlier than before. Again, I made the mistake of jumping, and again, I fell short. She told me that her Catholic beliefs / family wouldn't let her have a relationship with a non-catholic (my family is Muslim, but I'm not particularly religious). I respected that. It tore me to shreds inside, thinking that the reason we couldn't be together was as simple as religion. She broke my heart, but I didn't feel that she had done anything wrong. She stuck to her convictions and beliefs, and if anything, it was to be respected. Shame on me, for being so selfish that I wanted her to give up her faith, just to be with me. I obviously never told her that, and was incredulous that, of all the similarities we shared, she was fixated on this one difference. 


That was two summers ago, we both graduated and lost touch. Last spring, out of the blue, she added me on Snapchat, and we started talking again. I asked if she wanted to hangout, and we agreed to meet up in the city for lunch / to walk around. The morning of, she flaked on me. She said she had to go to her parents house, but she wanted to reschedule. I said sure, let me know when you can make it.


She never got back to me.


Fast forward to today. I was going through my Facebook feed, and as I was scrolling through, her profile suddenly popped up as a potential new friend (for some reason we had never added each other). At first, I didn't want to click it. This girl had broken my heart multiple times, despite the connection we had (or maybe I imagined it). She said we couldn't be together, despite how much we liked each other, no matter the connection, because her parents would never allow it, and she herself wanted to eventually marry another Catholic.


Even though it was two years ago, part of me had never gotten over it. So I opened her profile, and was only subjected to more pain. She had just gotten married, and her wedding photos were on her profile. 


The thing is.......it wasn't a Catholic wedding to another Catholic. She hadn't even married another white guy; she had married an Indian Muslim, and they had a traditional Islamic wedding with hijabs, the mosque, everything.


I don't know what to feel. Emptiness, confusion, anger, betrayal, anger at myself, but above all else, utter sadness. This was the girl of my dreams, one that I actually wanted to be with, but she stopped it from ever going anywhere, because I was Muslim and she was Catholic. Apparently, this variable didn't matter with the other guy, but it did for me.


Part of me wishes them all the best, and wants to leave it all behind and forgotten. Yet, somehow, I can't. I know if I don't, I will only experience more pain and confusion, but I just can't. I can only write my thoughts down, and pray that slowly, time will numb the pain from my wounds, and maybe, just maybe, I'll find someone new to take my mind off of her.


TL:DR: Met a girl in college a few years ago, became best friends, said she wouldn't date me because I was Muslim and she wanted to marry another Catholic. Just found her facebook, and it turns out, she married another Muslim. "

And I want to just write down my 22 year old life and how Depression factors into my life. If that's alright with anybody still reading this. It might be a long one.
I grew up a little alright up until I turned 8 (that's as far back as I can remember this stuff happening) and started realizing things my mom did that others didn't do. It wasn't an every day thing, but she would verbally and, on rare occasions, physically abuse me. If I didn't know anything, asked for help, and she couldn't help me, she'd call me an idiot and smack my head or hands hard. At one point my dad called her out on it and she didn't do it again, but the verbal stuff would still happen.
I had always been (and still am) a sensitive person so all the negative hit me harder than it should have, but I learned to smile and keep going with my life. Throughout my Jr. high and high school time I dealt with been made fun of, accused of being gay. I got in fights but that didn't help stop any of it. I couldn't get a girlfriend, and I started losing some of my closest friends towards the tail end of high school while still dealing with verbal abuse from home. And when I found something that I absolutely knew I was good at and wanted to further understand in college, my parents and two different uncles immediately tried to shoot it down.
Through much word play, I managed to convince my parents to let me pursue theater as my college major. It was in the theater department where I found some irreplaceable people and a tight knit group of folks whom I will readily call more family than my mom. And it was in one of the very first of many late nights when my mother called me just to call me gay and continued to insult me. After that, it was like some people were out to get me, because I am damn good in theater. They wanted to bring me down so I would doubt myself at auditions, question every bit of stage and costume work I did. 
But it was also here where I found someone who could sympathize with me on a level others couldn't. A great firecracker of a girl, who didn't let others bullshit her. It was my second year of community college and I knew I was going to have to come back for a third, whereas she knew she was leaving after her second year was over. And it was in the March of the second year that I knew I had fallen head over heels. 
She left to Florida for a Disney World internship, while I stayed in the home state. I made advances that where turned away slightly. Enough to let me know that the option wasn't closed off. I turned 21 and things were going great. I had more wonderful friends in my life and I was close to having a girl (let's call her Leslie) that didn't mind my faults, could empathize because of similar experiences, found me fun to be around.
Then came the birthday of one of my friends. I got lightly buzzed. We were all playing truth or dare, and before I left to go home, I was dared to kiss any girl in the room. I pecked the birthday girl and went home. The next day, I told Leslie about it because I knew one specific guy who was mouthy as all hell and I wanted to be honest. From that moment, it was like a switch inside Leslie flipped. From a peck in a game of truth or dare, she then classified me as one of THOSE guys. Our talks became less frequent, then she would just ignore my messages. And in the 5th of January in 2016, I tried to reach out again, talking about how much it was hurting me that she didn't seem to want to resolve this issue, and that I wanted to be her. On that day, she took me to task and broke me down harder than any rejection or anybody ever could. Every message she sent that day destroyed me in many ways.
I started to isolate myself, and everybody in my life could feel the difference. I had days where I didn't do anything. Days where I cried, days where I didn't feel. In late February, my mother (who had been chilling on the verbal stuff ever since my first year in college) set me up with a therapist. I don't remember much of that day but I do remember giving him permission to tell my mom what I was dealing with. The one thing that stood out to me that day was the sentence '...depression. Keep an eye on him, don't get heavy with stuff with him for now and weekly visits so I can monitor any progress.'
My spring semester of 2016 was ruled by depression. My grades suffered, some of my friendships suffered while a few strengthened or were re-established. I visited my therapist for a few more sessions before I faked getting better so my family wouldn't have to cough up $90 every week. I didn't feel enough self-worth to make my family pay money they needed for other things. Things went on a slight downhill slope for a time until April.
My mother dragged me out with the family to a place we were invited to. Problem was that it was one of my Bad Days. I didn't do anything while there (was there against my will in the first place) and I went to go pet a cat the owners had. While I was with the cat, my mother decided to tell them about my depression WITHOUT MY CONSENT.
We went home an hour afterwards, and she tells me that she and my dad had a great time despite me being an asshole. I then pointed out that you don't just share information about my depression without consulting me. She then starts an argument with me and she slings paradoxes at me while I fire back with actual logic and point out errors in her thinking before she calls me an asshole again. That night was the first time I contemplated suicide.
Things got tame after that. She stopped dragging me places. I still had Bad Days, but they were becoming less frequent, the trade off being that I started not being able to sleep. 
Then came July. My mother has never had a soft voice, her whispers aren't even whispers. She was on the phone with my dad and she called me a disappointment. I didn't want to waste my voice so I sent her a text saying that I could hear everything she was saying. It was only when night hit that she came to my room to apologize, but by then it was too late. I had already formulated a plan for my suicide. Thankfully I haven't had need for it and it's in a trash bin several miles out of town.
Throughout all of 2016, I tried to find ways to try to lessen all the bad in my life. I tried to find some casual hobbies but my mom kept shooting them down.
Books to read? You already have so many why do you read those again?
Video games? You're already 21, you should be focusing on trying to find work or a girl to date.
Gundam model kits were fun. But I only made 6 before she deemed them toys and a waste of money.
Because of my abysmal spring 2016 semester I decided to go back to college and pay for my schooling in full as opposed to in part. In November I tried to find a job so I could pay for spring 2017 but I turned up empty-handed as usual, I'm not in any classes right now and all my searching has given me nothing.
I'm down on my luck, posting something at 1:30 AM  and in tears over how shitty this week has been."

It's really getting tense and I don't know what to do.",lucielucielucielucie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5pa0f1/me_24f_with_my_rommies_25m_22f_they_dont_get/,"I r/relationships I need your advice!

I live in an apartment with Alexa and Tom. I've been living here for one year, Alex lives here since the beginning of college (ca 3 years). Tom lives here a little longer than Alexa (2 months or so). I met Alexa during my internship in another city. Alexa is enrolled at the same college as I am. 

I really get along with Alexa. We find time to chat or play games or go out shopping and we do understand, when someone is stressed out because of tests or whatever. Sometimes, we even eat breakfast together at 7 am. (I shared apartments with many people, but that hasn't happened before, so I guess it's a good sign) Although Alexa is kind of conservative sometimes, we really get along well. She is REALLY clean and tidy. 

Tom is not so clean and tidy. Sometimes he doesn't wash his hands after the toilet. He doesn't do the/his dishes. Since I live here I've seen him changing his bedclothes maybe once? He smokes and drinks and before starting a job he was hanging out at home 24/7. (I'm sorry to say this but: when his door is open, even just a little bit, it smells really bad) He's not able to see the dirt.


I don't mean to judge anyone, I just want you to understand the difference between those two. 


So Alexa, she goes off occasionally on him. When he hasn't done (his) dishes for a while or didn't clean properly for the third time in a row. Or when he walks through the apartment with his shoes on. 


Tom is really self-focused, he just ignores her. When he feels bad (illness, gf, idk), he comes to us and groans until we ask him about it. There is no interaction with him, because he's not really interested in us (?). For example: My birthday came and went. One month went by and we were joking in the kitchen, asking Tom when our birthdays were. He didn't know. (Mine was just a couple of weeks ago and he lives with Alexa since 3 years, but maybe it's just a ""boys thing""). 
When I was hospitalized last summer, he didn't bother that much. 
He applied at the company where I work (which is kinda ok and he can do whatever he wants). He doesn't even know, where I work and didn't bother to ask me once: Hey lucielucielucielucie, where do you actually go, when you say, you're off to work? (Same with Alexa)


Alright, that's the background. The last days were really tense between Alexa and Tom. Tom was supposed to clean the apartment (everybody has to every 3 weeks), but he didn't, although he had one week to do it. I wasn't at home, but Alexa told me she finished cleaning for him. She's really upset with him. Instead of saying  sorry, Tom just continues groaning and even started ignoring her. Recently I was with Alexa in her room and we heard him stepping outside his rooms, with shoes. He went to the bathroom. Alexa opened her door, waited till he's finished and said: ""Great, now you're going to the toilet with your shoes on!"" She stared at him, he finished dressing up and left the apartment, completely ignoring her (and me).


Look, I am a very tolerant person. If someone does something I'm not ok with, I don't say anything. I mean, if it's really bothering me I'll say something. But as long as I can live it, I'll do it. Not because I'm afraid, but because I can live with compromises I guess. 
See, Tom for example, of course he's not that clean and tidy, but I can deal with it. (Although I'm wondering if I can only live with it, because Alexa deals with him). But on the other hand, Alexa is a really tidy person, I'm not that tidy, but I can live with it because I'll just adjust. 


However, Alexa is kind of upset with me too, because she feels like she's the only one telling Tom to do this and that, etc. She wants me to say something, too. But I just can't do it? When she feels like she needs to say something, I don't. 


I just don't see them living together, but that's just the way it is right now. Their standards and values are on two completely different levels. But how can I get them to talk to each other without Alexa going off on me or Tom? And how can I get Tom to say something for once? (he's just agreeing to everything because he knows we will stop talking) And: How can I get Tom to be cleaner? I mean this isn't mine or Alexa's job to teach him! But still...
And is ok for me to be in this neutral position? Do I HAVE to say something to Tom in order to please Alexa? I have to support her right? 

Thanks so much.

I'm a 20 year old college student in my Junior year studying Computer Science. I'm looking at getting a Pomeranian in mid-August after a summer internship. This summer internship is in New York and it pays over $10k a month for 3 months. I'm working in finance, and I have an additional housing stipend and breakfast and lunch are provided so I will be able to take home more than it may initially appear. I will be coming into dog ownership with hopefully at least $15k or so saved. (I am very sorry if that whole paragraph came off as one giant brag, I just want advice on my financial situation as it pertains to dog ownership in college.)

My senior year, when I'm planning to get the dog, I will have a light course load. 12 credits a semester or less, so there will be plenty of time to spend with the dog. I would most likely quit my part-time job and spend that time with the dog. In short it's looking like my only commitments are 12 hours a week. I'm very interested in enrolling it in obedience classes too.

I have never had a dog before, but I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate who has her mom's Pomeranian for the semester. This dog will go back to her mom's house in May. I help care for the dog (help with almost everything except vet trips) and she deals well with apartment life. I would get my dog from the same breeder. This breeder is very reputable and is a Breeder with Merit and a Club Member. The dogs are between $1.5k and $3k. I would get mine spayed/neutered. 

My job prospects are looking very good for the future, I still have many companies still asking me if I'm interested in internships and I always send a polite email saying ""Unfortunately I have already accepted a position, but can I keep your contact information for when I'm looking for full-time employment in Fall."" They always say yes, so I have some very good leads. Also I can return full time to one of my previous internships, so there is a 99% chance I have a job when I graduate. I believe this puts me in a good financial position to afford dog-walkers/doggy-daycare and a pet-friendly apartment when I begin full-time employment, since I will be working 8 hours a day. 

I think my full-time employment would be a worse time to get a dog because I would have much less time to bond with a puppy and train it. I probably wouldn't be able to take off significant time for at least a year after my start date.

Here is my question, I would really like to hear your opinions:

Do you think August will be a good time for me to get a dog? If not, when?


**TL;DR I have a very light course load senior year, money saved up and excellent job prospects. I think August would be the best time to get a dog. Do you think so?**"

I have never really been able to have a career and struggled in two jobs since graduating (not back-to-back) so was fired from both. My last job was a good paying position in my field too, and I haven't been able to find anything better, or even comparable. I now make about $500-$600 less a month at Current Job and getting by is such a struggle some weeks. Current Job is also a call center, which are their own special circles of hell. 

I had my eye on the sports management industry a while back. People were telling me I should do an internship, but I am 31 years old, single and need health insurance. Sports internships pay even less than what I make now, which means taking one is not feasible. So I had to give up on that because virtually no sports organization even looks at hiring you full time without the magical internship. It's the same thing with communications, my original field. You have to have tons of internships and do other unpaid work to even get a shot. Of course, my other problem is I am only motivated to take opportunities for ""exposure"" and ""experience"" for so long. I...kind of like being paid a reasonable wage for my efforts.

I hate that I am stuck in such a toxic situation with no prospects for escape. I have tried volunteer work and put it on my resume where applicable to positions I apply for. It doesn't increase my callbacks like all the career advice suggests it does. If it does, I get to the interview and find out the job pays $10/hour. I cannot continue to take pay cuts to get a new job or I will never get anywhere with debt and being more comfortable. OK, I could take maybe a $1 an hour pay cut but no more than that. Despite my efforts to make connections and people saying they will help me, and despite my volunteer work, I am still a phone slave. To make it worse, I am in a company where people in other departments stay for years and are generally happy, so there is no room for advancement.

Is this really all college was good for? I know I made some mistakes in building my experience, but all my hard work really only qualifies me to work in a call center and get berated all day by both customers and colleagues alike? And to only get interviews for jobs that pay even worse? It's a slap in the face, especially when I see people who do higher level work that are laughably incompetent.

I tell my mom I want to chuck my diploma in the trash and she says don't you dare; you worked so hard for that and no one can take it from you! While she is right (and she's in her 50s and getting a degree in May), I honestly wonder why I should hold on to a possession that has harmed my life more than helped it. People who didn't even go to college, or did two years at community college, have better careers than I do! If only I had known. I would kind of like to go back to school but that only means more debt.

It's so hard to hear ""Oh don't worry; you'll get a job soon!"" or ""You'll find something!"" from people who already have nice careers. I also get jealous of people my age who have job titles like director of sales, communications specialist, marketing coordinator, etc. Hell, one of the directors of operations at my company is 26 and she was sales manager at 24! When I tell people I work at a call center, it is so embarrassing.

The diploma may be a possession but to me, it is garbage.

We've talked about marriage, and we both have a desire to sleep with other people and accept each others desire to do so once we're married (open marriage). 

The only point of incompatibility I see, is our lives are on very different professional levels. She works retail, and I'm in college studying computers and intern for a tech company. She plans on going back to school in the near future (few months), so I have high hopes that'll change.  

With all that said, I've found myself going through periods of unhappiness regarding the relationship. This, as far as I can tell, is triggered by what I mentioned above about our lives being at different places professionally, and also seemed to crop up when I befriended a girl (21/F) at my school about 5 months ago .

This girl (call her Jane) and I hit it off immediately as friends. We started doing school work together, texting, and signed up for classes together. We have more in common than anyone I've ever met, and I do find myself having feelings for her. It's not that she's somehow objectively better than my GF, just different, and it's a different that I like. 

2 months after meeting Jane, and feeling conflicted about my relationship, I tried to break up with my girlfriend during one of these periods of unhappiness, and only lasted 8 hours before I was on the phone apologizing and crying. We were back together the next morning.  This was about 3 months ago. 

After our very, very short-lived breakup; things were better over the holidays. I didn't see Jane in person, just texting, and my relationship went back to some degree of normalcy. Then school started back, and I starting seeing Jane again, and these same periods of unhappiness started back. 

I want to leave my relationship a lot of days, but it isn't as simple as ""I want to leave GF for Jane"". Jane isn't a replacement for my GF, and I have no expectation of anything occurring beyond friendship with her regardless of my relationship status (but wouldn't stop it if it did happen). 

I can't figure out if it's simply GIGS that is motivating my thoughts, or if there's a deeper rooted issue that I need to confront or resolve. Halp.

1. He is caught sleeping with some young White House intern, declares that his personal life is his own business, and that, despite adultery laws, he will keep doing it.  Perhaps announces his divorce from Melania, and starts acquiring a new girlfriend almost every week.

2. Tries to push Great Britain to agree to some international foolishness, they refuse, he recalls the US ambassador and threatens war: ""you're either with the US or against it"".

3. Some underling sneaks some details into an executive order that Trump signs, e.g. outlawing abortion nationally as part of a clause in a health insurance interstate regulatory relaxation.  And then, of course, Trump claims he signed it intentionally and that it's law now.

4. Trump gets in a conflict with congress over the pace of some extreme proposal like the border wall, then tweets that there's nothing stopping him from removing Senators with executive orders.

5. It is revealed that Trump does not actually have the nuclear codes -- that he did not pass the Pentagon's top-secret background checks, and will not until he undergoes psychiatric evaluation, which he refuses to do.

6. California governor Jerry Brown denounces Trump's immigration policies, and Trump tries to order him removed as governor.

7. Issues an executive order based on a conspiracy theory, like ""vaccinations of children are hereby suspended in the US until someone can prove they don't cause autism"".

8. Declares that, with his initial wave of executive orders issued, and waiting for Congress to pass complex laws, that being President is not really a full-time job, that he's going to be working 50/50 on the Trump Organization again.

9. He tries his ""Arts of the Deal"" with China, saying that the US will establish a base in the South China sea unless China closes theirs, and actually puts marines onto some island.

# Extended Summary:

**Anna Mani Is One of India's Greatest Woman Scientists. Yet You Probably Haven't Heard Her Story**.

Anna Mani Is One of Indias Greatest Woman Scientists.

Born in 1918, she was the seventh of eight siblings..

Anna Manis father was a prosperous civil engineer who ownedlarge cardamom estatesin the region.

But little Anna Mani would have none of it.

On her eighth birthday, when she was gifted with diamond earrings- as was the custom in her family- she opted instead for a set ofEncyclopaedia Britannica.

It was during this time that Mahatma Gandhi came to Viakom to lend his support to the civil disobedience movement.

Her strong sense of nationalism also instilled in her a fierce desire for personal freedom.

Mani wanted to study medicine but when that was not possible, she decided in favor of physics because she happened to be good in the subject.

She was accepted in no less than Nobel laureateC V Ramans laboratory as a graduate student and worked on the spectroscopy of diamonds and rubies.

The experiments were long and painstaking, sometimes requiring15 to 20hours.

In August 1945 she submitted her PhD dissertation to Madras University and was awarded a government scholarship for an internship in England.

They chose to overlook that Anna Mani had graduated with honours in physics and chemistry, and had won a scholarship for graduate studies at the Indian Institute of Science on the basis of her undergraduate degree.

Fortunately, the lack of a PhD never deterred her.

WhenMani returned to independent India in 1948, she joined the Indian Meteorological Department at Pune.

Find a better way to do it! was her motto.

During the International Geophysical Year (1957-58), she set up a network of stations in India to measure solar radiation.

This enabled India to collect reliable data on the ozone layer.

In 1976, Anna Maniretired as deputy director general of the Indian Meteorological Department and subsequently returned to the Raman Research Institute as a visiting professor for three years.

A visionary, Anna Mani knew/foresaw that alternative sources of energy would have a big role to play in Indias future development.

She hoped that the instruments produced in her workshopwould help in development ofwind and solar energy in India.

However, she would recall how even a slight error made by her or other women scientist in handling instrumentation or in setting up an experiment would be immediately broadcast by some men as a sign of female incompetence.

Devoted to her studies and research, Mani never married.

In 1994, she suffered from a stroke that left her immobilised for the rest of her life.

Even in 1930, when Mani went to college, opportunities for women to pursue further studies or a career in science were very limited.

5pbxlf,2,2017-01-21,How do i find a good therapist?,Aplosion,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5pbxlf/how_do_i_find_a_good_therapist/,"TL;DR: for a variety of reasons, although it would be very helpful, I haven't had a meeting with a therapist. What's a good way to find one?

Also, what's a good way to find a job you can make a decent career out of, with no college?

Last year, I told my parents I thought I probably had depression. Neither of them was particurally supportive, and my dad tried to set up a meeting, but because of my ADHD, which i wouldn't even know I had for almost a year, I missed two important meetings. I'm not usually late, and I tend to remember important meetings, but for whatever reason, my brain acted up those two days, and nothing ever came of it.

Flash forward to about three months ago. I've moved out, I'm living in a totally different state, and I have a decent job. I'm doing it sub-optimally, though, because there are a lot of little tasks to remember, and no matter what I try, I can't get all of them right. I look online for local therapists. I find one site that looks helpful, but only lets me sort the therapists by price.

I email one at random. She takes two or three days to respond. She isn't helpful, and it doesn't look like we'll be a good fit. I give up and forget about it.

Skip to today. I got fired from the job I was working at, got a new job, and found out two days ago I'm being laid off through no fault of my own. The mall that store is at is criminally mismanaged, and it's dying. The staff  is dropping ~60 people to ~20 people between December 30th and January 30th. I was pretty good at that job, I worked hard, and my coworkers and bosses seemed to like me. It's incredibly frustrating.

Anyway, what are some good ways to find a ADHD therapist?

Also, what are some good ways to find a paid internship or something similar that doesn't require college, and can be made into an actual career you won't be laid off from as soon as you start to settle in?

Thanks a lot, everyone.

TL;DR: for a variety of reasons, although it would be very helpful, I haven't had a meeting with a therapist. What's a good way to find one?

Also, what's a good way to find a job you can make a decent career out of, with no college?

5pcgo7,28,2017-01-21,I'm applying for a BA program for IT w/ Network Admin focus. Can you guys give me a sanity check real quick on work atmosphere?,ThatsAPencil,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5pcgo7/im_applying_for_a_ba_program_for_it_w_network/,"I'm 33, passionately working on a career change to IT after I realized my dream job was right under my nose since I was 8.  A+ exam is on Monday, after that I'm hopefully going to be accepted into a bachelor program for IT w/ Network Administration focus at WGU.  I don't have time for a traditional college, since I support a wife and two kids.  I can allot 3 hrs a night to studying at home though, so this is the education method for me.

I am working fervently on doing this.  A local PC repair shop owner with lots of junk is letting me take stuff home to tinker with and get running again.  I'm learning Linux for the first time.  Playing with SQL and Python when I have time via VMWare.  

My soft skills over the past 15 years are great.  Several years organizing and prioritizing office duties, paperwork etc.  I love working with customers, I know how to pick up on conversation cues.  I can deliver horrible news with an action plan and still have people thanking me at the end of the phone call.  I even get people calling me or my boss out of the blue with praise, so I'm pretty confident with that part.  

The WGU BA program has some certifications built in and I'm just going to focus on that when/if I get accepted.  

Also if it matters, I've worked in government jobs for the past 10 years between the military and currently a small county job.

So here's my questions.

1. As a sole provider, I can't afford to take a job that pays less than my current job, which is about $21.50/hr.  Is it hopeless for a guy like me to get a first IT job that matches that?  

2. If you were me, what job would you be looking for as your first IT job?  I was thinking of starting my own PC repair business on the weekends to get experience, but it's a small town and that would be a slap in the face to the PC repair shop owner who's been helping me.  I can't intern with him due to my work schedule.

3. Am I heading toward a one-sided work atmosphere?  I want a good balance between being on my feet vs at a desk.  I want 50/50 as much as possible.  Not a dealbreaker, though.  I also want to be working in the same room as people who are going to be on the same knowledge level.  I love working with customers, but I don't want to explain a .zip file to my boss.  

4. Any reason why Portland would be bad?  Thinking of moving there."
5pcj64,64,2017-01-21,"Of Adventurers, Adventures, And Their Relation, Responsibility, and Requirements: Contractual Obligations and Terms To Ensure The Efficant Transcooperation Of Associates, Employees, Contractors, and Specialists Intwixterteen And Therein Of and With The Company",Applejaxc,DnDBehindTheScreen,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/5pcj64/of_adventurers_adventures_and_their_relation/,"#OAAATRRARCOATTETETOAECASIATOAWTC

In my Scourged Aerth campaign, the party was hired for their first adventure by a down-on-his-luck businessman named Fiss. Fiss saw great potential in the untapped adventurers-for-hire market but lacked any adventuring skills of his own. The party did not have the necessary prestige or resources to, as individuals, bargain for fair wages-not that they faced that problem, as it was impossible to legally find work *at all* with the city law being so restrictive regarding the procurement of mercenary services.

This is partly world building/lore and this is partly ""Hey, this is a good alternative to the 'you meet in a tavern' that can take place in an oppressive fantasyscape that provides you with a recurring quest giver, expositor, and provides the party with a sense of identity and uniformity, as well as a believable way to replace lost party members and invest resources.""

###The OAAATRRARCOATTETETOAECASIATOAWTC 

was a contract each party member was asked to sign before Fiss would divulge adventure details, and even before that they were forced to signed Nondisclosure Agreements, which barred mention of Fiss's budding company (Acquisitions, Limited) and instructed the party to answer potential questions about him, the organization, the terms of their meeting, or the terms of their employment in specially prepared statements to avoid any incrimination. Fiss wasn't hiring them to do anything *vile*, of course, but the local constabulary was *very* opposed to letting ""mercenaries"" operate within city limits. In the case the party didn't trust him, each document was made in duplicate (so the party member and Fiss had a copy), and notarized by a member of the church of justice and law (replace with equivalent LG god of your setting). So the party knew it was relatively on the up-and-up, and if Fiss double-crossed anyone he'd get cudgeled by some vengeful lawyers.

The terms of the contract were pretty extensive, full of flowery language and subclauses and nonsense. Fiss is a legal expert and artful bamboozler. Fortunately for the party it is only his intention to con-fuddle *enemies* of the company, and his mumbojumbo is so effective it's granted advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and (Deception) checks *many* times just by a party member pulling out a 6-page document when questioned by the city watch. Who has time (or the Int score) to read the fine print?

It basically boils down to fairly simple terms, however

+ All contracts, services, and consultings arraigned by the company automatically reserves 10% of the agreed payment to be retained by the company itself
+ All subcontractors, consultants, temporary hires, interns, and other auxiliary personnel required by employees to complete an acquisition is negotiated for and paid for by the employees, out of their own reward, not the company
+ 10% of all ""extraneous acquisitions"" (loot) obtained in the course of fulfilling an acquisition is to be turned into the company at the completion of the acquisition
+ The first 50gp of equipment and service procurement required for the completion of an acquisition is reimbursed by the company (enough for 1 *potion of healing* or some tools)
+ The first 100gp of ""legal fees"" incurred in the direct pursuit of an acquisition are reimbursed per employee by the company (includes bribes, forging of documents, and other services, although the company-provided clandestine services are lower quality than what the party could pay for elsewhere and takes longer)
+ Company property is open access to employees, who are not required by pay for food or lodging (""up to the extent that is reasonable, to be examined and renegotiated as necessary"")
+ The company disowns any knowledge of, relation to, or obligation towards any subcontractor, consultant, service provider, or other personnel employed by employees without the express approval and rigorous hiring procedure conducted by the company (the party can hire as many thugs and criminals as they want, they just can't expect Fiss to bail them or their temp hires out of trouble)
+ Employees may not divulge the nature of their contracts, consultingships, projects, or other actions therein, by, to, and/or of the company except within the company and the company's auxiliary personnel and are expected to remain the most respectable standards of discretion (because *my* campaign takes place in a Lawful Evil society, this is an effective method of refusing to testify on the grounds that it will ""constitute a breech of my contractual obligations"")
+ Rewards for services, contracts, and consultings, and ""extraneous acquisitions"" are split equally between all employees involved therein, after the necessary amount has been deducted to fulfill company obligations

###In Practice

The party is giving up 10% of the reward money for anything they do, and they're on the honor system about surrendering 10% of their loot, too. That kind of sucks.

But in exchange they're given at least one place to lay low, train, rest, plan, and gather information in the company's HQ. In Scourged Aerth the HQ was an abandoned mansion haunted by the lovable ghost of the daughter of the estate's former owner, filled with all kind of strange and bizarre things. In your campaign it could be a ratty hovel or a glorious skyship. */shrug*

Fiss is also a man of his word, and very genuinely wants the best for his company and its employees. Of course what he thinks is best and what may actually be best are often divergent, and he seems to hold adventurers in near-mythic status, often overselling their abilities to garner business, arranging contracts *way* above the party's level.

It also provides a good basis for the party's continued cooperation, acquisition of new contracts, and a tongue-in-cheek means of getting around silly laws. Because they're ""Acquisition Specialists"" or ""Consultants"" or other nonsense terminology, they avoid being called ""mercenaries"" or ""criminals."" Fiss tries as hard as he can to maintain a false image of the company as a totally legal resource for helping distraught citizens acquire rare things and services, like locating healers and wizards and lost family heirlooms. In reality, especially as the company grows, the majority of ""acquisitions"" are more typical adventures: Clearing dungeons, killing bad hombres, etc.

It's also very easy to control WBL (in theory): You can promise the party huge rewards for a contract (so their adventures feel worthwhile), then immediately skim 10%, then give another % to other consultants who were necessary in fulfilling the contract (hired by the party or used by Fiss to acquire things like maps, skeleton keys, and equipment), and otherwise use the legal terms to constrain the party's actual reward. You can't do the same with loot, as most parties will probably lie about how much they did or didn't obtain.

Finally, it's great for RP. Fiss doesn't really serve as a boss to the party so much as a liaison; he's *important* to their continued prosperity relevant to the company, but they're free agents able to turn down assignments or pursue ""non-sanctioned acquisitions"" (work for someone else), although Fiss will have his feelings hurt. As the company grows in prominence, it will also grow in notoriety, and every big shot in town will have some scheme to take advantage of it. Villains may mistake the company as the front for a regular mercenary troop, and will try to hire the party to do some evil. Imagine the local mid-level politician (of squeaky clean reputation) takes the party aside, and is all ""Alright, let's drop the pretenses: I'm a bad guy, you're bad guys, let's get this coup planning started,"" only (to his surprise) to be killed (unless your party is the kind of opportunistic neutrality to immediately swear fealty...).

In Scourged Aerth, people have attempted dozens of times to take advantage of the company. Corrupt members of the city watch tried to blame a rash of fires and deaths on the party/the company in a bid to extort them to force them to go on a particular adventure. More than one member of the city council tried to get the party to move against another council member. Other adventuring companies even attempted mergers, buy-outs, and hostile takeovers! And in all of it (to my surprise and pleasure), the party's emotional (and financial) investment in the company made their arguments, negotiations, and desperate plans to keep the company afloat were some of the best experiences I've had as a DM and they've had as players.

Also, your party's favorite NPCs, redeemed villains, rescued damsels, and other characters can come work for the company or drum up repeat business, so you have a reasonable excuse to recycle a fun character.

Finally, the growth of the company gives the party a lot of clout and resources that would be difficult to obtain individually. NPC cohorts and laborers are willing to work cheaper for a company with a big reputation and long-term employment; rich snobs that fear they'll one day need reliable services are more likely to respect the party and invite them to galas and crap to garner their favor; and big-time villains are a lot more likely to actually know the party by name, deed, and tactics.

The company provides a good way to introduce new characters, too: If you have a new player, or a character dies, it's very easy to explain that so-and-so is the ""new hire."" As the company grows, it's possible there's a whole other adventuring party, or two, or three, or more suitable for oneshots or just running into at unexpected times. What happens when the party tries as hard as they can to be good, but they're fellow employees totally bungle and adventure and screw up massively? Do they let their compatriots rot in prison, or do they risk damaging the company's reputation (legally) even *more* by busting them out (improving its reputation socially and improving morale).

###Two Main Uses

In Scourged Aerth, Aq LTD exists as a creative means of operating around obtuse laws in a Lawful Evil society. Your campaign may take place in a more Venture Bros-esque world, wherein adventuring parties are so alarmingly common (and neglectfully destructive) that such companies *have* to exist to maintain the peace, and even above the company there's overarching rules that govern policies and practices to prevent a return to adventuring dark ages, wherein Heroes and BBEGs nearly destroy the multiverse once a week?


###Room for improvement

After this whole business with joining the Air Force on the 31st and learning how to disable bombs and stop crying during PT and stuff, I plan to return to Aerth in full force and revamp all 5 campaign settings (Aerth, Aerth: AD, Scourged Aerth, Sun on the Deadwight, Aerth 2099) with everything new I've learned over the last 6 months of /r/lfg and /r/DnDBehindTheScreen + Volo's Guide.

Does anyone already have a similar situation in their own campaign notes, and/or any suggestions on what other rules, stipulations, and subclauses to add to the contract? Particular adventure ideas that would be unique to this kind of campaign, that wouldn't work with random, travelling adventurers?"

So, to prepare myself I have been scouring the internet looking for different internships and part-time job opportunities to try and gain some experience for college and my future career. However, almost all employers are looking for undergrads or people with degrees to hire. In terms of my credentials I have programmed for my and other people's schools, I have done quite a few projects in my free time as well as for school with code and robotics (primarily Arduino based projects), and I lead the robotics and computer science club at my school. I am really trying my best to become involved but I can't seem to cross the gap from hobbyist to professional at my age.

5pdh7r,1,2017-01-21,50k in debt with 3 years left to go in school. Am I utterly screwed?,theSuppleLemur,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5pdh7r/50k_in_debt_with_3_years_left_to_go_in_school_am/,"Hey guys, so I'll give you a little background first. 

I was in school for 2.5 years as a biochemistry major and essentially lived off debt to pay for school, and have racked up around 50k in debt thus far (8k of that coming from a study abroad/unpaid internship in China last summer). Around 23k of that figure are parent plus loans, but my parents aren't in a position financially to afford paying that, so I fully intend on taking it on myself. 

Long story short, but after being dissatisfied with biochemistry as a major and its career choices, and starting to fall in love with teaching myself how to program, I decided to change my major to computer science. Not only am I finally doing something I enjoy, but the career prospects are much more pleasing for having simply a Bachelor's. 

This brings me to today. I moved back home so I could transfer to a nearby school while still living at home, essentially cutting my costs in half. Tuition is ~10k a year at where I will be finishing school. Assuming I didn't receive a penny in grants or scholarships (both of which I while be heavily applying for), I would graduate with 80k in debt. That is the worst case scenario. I assume the more accurate figure is going to be closer to 70k, perhaps even less if I do well enough and gain enough scholarships. Just maybe, if I play my cards right and do well enough as well as find a great job on the side, I could potentially keep that figure down to 65k. However, I'm going to overestimate here and stick with 70-75k of debt at graduation.

Taking advantage of my school's resources (something I did not do in my first few years at university), gaining internships and relevant work experience, I believe I can easily land a 60-70k job starting out of school. In other words, my starting salary will likely be as much as the amount of debt I owe, perhaps a few thousand more, perhaps a few thousand less. Not guaranteed, but I believe the odds are in favor of me if I truly bust my ass for the remainder of school. 

I realize I'm in quite the hole here. In my current state, I'm left with 50k of debt and nothing to show for. However, following through on my plan, I may add on another 15-20k to that number as well as a few years of school, but I significantly increase my earnings as well. I just can't help but look at these numbers and feel sick with regret I didn't take this plan of action in the first place (that being living at home/going to a cc, before transferring to a university to save thousands of dollars). At the same time, while it took a lot of money to do so, I've learned an enormously important lesson and am confident I can make the rest of school worth my investment. 

Maybe this post was just a way for me to get out what's been plaguing my mind for so long (I don't have many people to talk to about this), but what do you guys think. I'm not completely screwed, am I? Any advice that could help this guy along the way? "

With Lucky's 777 price and the recent bump in shard costs, a lot of people haven't been able to get the sweet doggo as have wanted. And since I recently restarted my internship, I figured that I can at least bring one more sweet pup to a campus in need. So, giveaway!

Basically, applied for an internship at Disney. It's an IT internship but I do computer science but would love to work for Disney. 

So they accepted my application and gave me a technical test to do before a deadline. I have an idea on how to answer some of the questions but some of them I've never done and I checked my application and I didn't mention those skills at all so because I have time to research I'm planning on googling how to do the parts I've never done before. What I'm worried about is if I do go to the next stage at an assessment centre and they ask me about it, I'll have no clue whatsoever because obviously I've just googled it.

Do I had a note or something to my answers saying that I researched this as I didn't know how to do it or am I just better off shooting off the answers and then dealing with other stuff if it happens?

Thanks"

A day after, I got a rejection email from the recruiter, citing interview feedback.  It was my first interview with the company. I did fumble a bit on the ""Why FB?"" question: is this why I was rejected? At least with Google I know I fucked up in answering the technical questions.

I recently received an offer to work at a BB in tech. Given my background this is the kind of role I'd be expected to get, the pay is decent and it's nice to have the name on my CV. It starts in a few months, but I don't want to be stuck doing BO stuff for the rest of my career, so I'm wondering whether it'll be better for me in the long-term to do an MSc at a top 4 business school which would lead to a more lucrative FO position somewhere else. I'm also not sure about how easy it is to transition out of this role into something like management consulting.

My only concern is that I'm 24 now, and would be looking at 2018 entry, which would make me 25 and just getting into my first serious role, which would be entry-level position to boot. I've already wasted a couple of years with not much to show for it professionally, my fault but not much I can do about that now. Is it wise to throw away this opportunity? Would it be better to try and network my way to a more FO position through this role? I know it's not a typical tech role and that there is a rotation in a more business based area in the programme, but I'm not sure if I should rely on that as the reason for me taking the position.

My options are: (1) keep working part-time and applying as I have been doing. (2) Sell what little I have and move to D.C. to better my job chances. Or (3) Bite the bullet and give up my dreams and take a low paying full-time job locally that is not in my field in order to form some semblance of responsibility and a life but make paying off debt hard or impossible.**

Hello r/PF. I've been lurking for a little while, but not long enough, so now I'm asking.  As the title says, I received my Master of International Development in May of 2016 and have yet to find a job.  I have been applying intensely at times and not-so-intensely at other times due to part-time jobs and life in general. All together I've probably sent 75-100 applications out to various non-profits, NGOs, and government contractors mainly in the D.C. and NYC area, which is where I want to end up but not where I currently live.  I've been working various part-time jobs since graduation. I moved back in with my parents due to lack of money a few months ago and currently make $9/hr.  I have about $1500 saved up so far. I think my problem can be broken into two parts: getting a job and then forming a finance plan for the student loan debt.

**First the Job:**
This is where I truly need help. I broke one of the biggest rules and went to grad school a year after finishing undergrad for no other reason than I did't make any effort to find an actual job. I hold two BA degrees in Political Science and History from undergrad but never had a plan after graduation. I was always interested in the world and traveling so I decided to get a masters in international relations which turned into international development.  I learned a lot in grad school and met a lot of great people, but I think I have two major downfalls. For one, the school did not require a foreign language or offer courses to learn one. I don't have a foreign language ability and I believe this is truly holding me back in the competitive environment. And two, I don't have any work experience besides a plethora of part-time jobs. I'm the part-time job king.  I did, however, spend two months interning in India while in grad school as well a leadership position in the school's student government. This, plus a previous internship at a non-profit after undergrad are the only other professional experiences that I have.  I feel like I am competing against others with tons more experience and language ability. 
As mentioned before, I've been applying to jobs for months.  I apply to almost all jobs that I am even remotely qualified for including many jobs that only require bachelors degrees such as administrative roles. I have had multiple phone/skype interviews but have only interviewed in person twice: one in D.C. in July and it was down to me and another and I did not get the offer even though it was an just an administrative position; two was two weeks ago in D.C. for a great opportunity but I have not heard back yet, even though they said they would let me know by last week. I am at my wits and I do not know how to proceed. I can keep working part-time and applying as I've done for the past few months unsuccessfully, or I can save for a few months and just move to D.C. to increase my chances at getting a job.  I'm also considering getting a local-full time opportunity way below my qualifications and income need, which would inhibit my ability to apply as much as I need and interview as often. And these options leave out my second biggest restriction, student load debt.

**The Debt:**
I have around $70k in student loan debt. About $30k of which was from undergrad and $40k from grad school. Every time I think of this debt I get sick to my stomach. My parents never gave me guidance on money growing up and acted like ""I can do anything I wanted,"" and ""money was not an issue,"" and ""everyone has student debt."" I was admittedly stupid and naive and, at this point, If I could go back and never go to grad school I would. But at this point I have to deal.  It feels like this massive weight just hanging on my shoulders and lurking behind me at all times and I can't get away.  I don't know what to do besides get a job with my masters degree but I am having no luck in that field. My loans are currently deferred but I need to start paying them off soon. I am crippled from this debt and it is inhibiting my ability to just get up and go and move to DC or New York to better my chances of finding a job or traveling abroad and looking or anything like that.  In my mind, getting a well-paying job is my only option because there is no other way for me to pay off this debt.  I'm afraid and discouraged and I am totally lost.

5peq7w,7,2017-01-21,Implementing a interning table?,I_shill_comrade-jim,rust,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5peq7w/implementing_a_interning_table/,"I wish to make a Key-value data structure with an `intern` method similar to a symbol table. In this case a PathBuf, if the PathBuf is not already in the table it adds it to the able and assigns it a unique ID and returns the new ID, if the PathBuf is in the table it just returns the ID.

The problem is obviously that you run into the borrow checker, you need to first immutably borrow the table to see if it's already in there but then in the same scope also mutably borrow the table to add the new element if it's not which violates the rules. Is there any way to solve this problem?

I know HashMaps do exactly this but I'm not as much interested in a practical solution as I am in an understanding of how one would go about solving this classical problem in a language with the constraint of no further borrows after a mutable one:

for reference, a sketch (not actual code)

    fn intern ( &amp;mut self, symbol : Symbol ) -&gt; usize {
      if let Some(id) = self.look_up(symbol) { // immutable borrow occurs here
        id
      } else {
        self.add(symbol) // mutable borrow occurs here

A bit background about me my bachelor degree is in Electrical Engineering, but I did my internship at a hardware company where I did software. I continued the same trend after graduating and currently doing a software at a hardware company. I primarily work on device specific software (embedded and mobile) using C/C++/Java. I am open to any position, but would ideally like something in medical or robotics (perhaps finance too). The job has to be about coding, not spending 50% of the time getting bogged down in processes related BS :(. 

The only requirement I guess for the city is that it has be pretty liberal with lots of folks around my age in a similar situation (moved away from home). 

I would even consider Europe or the land down under. 

Aside from a suggestion about city, any other general suggestions? Perhaps you can share your story of how you moved, and how things worked out.

We are dealing with the recent loss of his father and although we understand the grief of his Nmother, sadly it is getting really difficult to all her family to deal with Nmil. 

One of the first times I saw her,  we told her that a neighbor was in the hospital with a cancer... And her answer to that was ""oh,  I know,  my ankles are so sore,  it's evena little bit difficult to get up in the morning... ""

So,  everytime you say something it's like she didn't quite hear you,  and she always turns it to herself.  But there are so many occasions where it's mean,  or she let's you know that she know better than anyone.

But back to the difficult situation today,  all the family is trying to help her to cope with her loss,  and we all love her,  but her attitude is sometimes so difficult that has all the family in a state of not knowing what to do. 

The doctor told us today that because of her character, and how she behaves with all of us, that it is better to intern her to a nursing home. Or else all of the family will be sick. 

I'll try to explain better to you the situation,  but yesterday I was with my husband to sleep the night look at her. And I really couldn't take it anymore at one moment how she is mean with my husband.  

The doctor complimented her at the 60 years of marriage. 
Then she asked about a granddaughter that is on her 6th year of marriage and NMom complimented her,  and when they asked about the first marriage of my husband, Nmom promptly answered that it was nothing and useless...  Well, my husband's ex was special too, but 15years of marriage and two beautiful children are something...  But well.
And there are photos of everyone, but my husband.  

well sorry of its confused...  My English its not perfect, but well I had to speak tonight..."

He divorced my N, sociopathic mother when I was 5, leaving her the house and over $200K USD, in 1984. He quickly remarried and moved to another state. He called GC brother and me briefly once per week and we had 6 weeks annual visitation time. Nmother had full custody. She trash talked him and my stepmother, claimed he didn't pay child support and didn't want to take care of us. We weren't allowed to call him or write letters, we didn't know the phone number or address. Visitation was stressful because we kids had to fly alone. I guess the change in routine was hard although life was better on visitation. He and Stepmother never hit me. He'd actually play with me in the pool. We got decent food there and they bought us nice clothes (only summer clothes, climate was different from where Nmom lived). They let us out of the house and took us to movies, restaurants, theme parks and the beach. All things we didn't have and weren't allowed to do at home with Nmom, who was well off but super cheap with us kids. They weren't parents in an emotional way, they were more like nice babysitters. They treated us the same, there was no GC or SG/Lost Child while on visitation. GC brother and I actually got along, unlike at home. But he had no involvement in our lives, all decisions were made by NM. I think he was clueless and willfully stayed that way. 

M father was never around. Nmom got all the holidays in the divorce. He was never around for my birthday. Never attended a graduation. I couldn't talk to him about things, especially with Nmom always listening in. By age 13 I guess the stress of NM's abuse and the visitation got to me. I said I didn't want to do visitation anymore or talk on the phone. Nmom, Dad, Nuncle, and WTF-Grandma were *fine* with that. Nobody attempted to ask me what was wrong, how did I feel, or what could they do to help. Like they didn't understand that I was just a kid and they were the adults here. By 17 I wanted contact again but was afraid of my father being angry and I had no idea *how* to contact him. He sent *me* a letter, that wasn't angry or mean, but read like it was from a teacher or distant relative, not a parent. 

We found a way for me to see him in Nmom and WTF-Grandma's town. He'd moved to yet another state by now. I get in the car and he and my stepmother said, ""guess what! we had a baby!"" I said, ""oh wow! congratulations!"" They asked if I wanted a piece of leftover christening cake from the event I obviously was not invited to. If there was a baby shower I wasn't invited to that either.

We resumed the short calls. I went to college mostly on grants/scholarships and lived in a dorm on an isolated campus, depressed, lonely, and miserable. I had no ID because NM hid it and only the little money I earned at my minimum wage job. Years later I found out my father had tuition money for me that he gave to NM, but she kept it and forged my signature on student loan documents instead. I had to repay the $15K in loans. My parents gave no financial support, emotional support, or guidance in college. They both told me they'd disown me if I dropped out or tried to transfer anywhere less prestigious. He pushed me to take a horrible internship where I was crying in the bathroom at age 20. I knew the job was a bad idea and ignored my intuition. I quit, went back to my minimum wage job, and he screamed that I was a ""a worthless loser who'd never amount to anything or marry an investment banker now"" and went NC with me for about 6 months. I never saw my father's house in State 2 and he lived there a decade. I was never invited. 

My stepmother became seriously ill and half brother was small. I figured that's why I didn't hear much from my father during college or the 3 years after I was stuck isolated, dependent, and wishing to die, with Nmom. I don't know if that's normal, a parent has a sick partner and small child so they don't engage with the older kids? He had totally checked out of GC brother's life as a kid too. GC had substance abuse and psychiatric problems starting as a teen, then OD'd and died. I moved out of NM's at 24. When my stepmother passed away my father moved to State 3. Maybe once a year I was invited for the afternoon. I wished I could see more of my half brother.

I was 24 when I moved out of NM's and could live a normal life. That was 2003. I met a guy, we got married in 2009, a bunch of good stuff happened. My father came to the wedding and was nice but wasn't more involved than that. A year later he got married again, to a woman with 2 daughters, one teenager at the time and one in her 20's. He was a lot more involved with my half brother's life, like a real parent, and with my younger stepsister. He started inviting my husband and me to his home 2-3x/year. We live only 2 hours drive away. I think his new wife noticed the lack of relationship and he didn't want to look bad in front of her. I recently found out he has family in a European country where he'd taken Half Brother multiple times to visit and get to know them and the culture(!) But never me apparently. I don't even know the people's names. Or about that culture.

Since discovering narcissism I've tried to talk to him about the abuse my brother and I endured from NM. I asked about what happened during those years. Like with all that money he &amp; NM had, why I was I scavenging trash food, wearing NM's old clothes, in an unheated house, and barely allowed to leave the house? His answers are usually ""I don't remember"", ""I don't know"", or ""I don't want to talk about this"". He says he paid the child support, not that I was upset when I thought he didn't. I don't want to be an asshole about it, but he's the only link I have to the answers. He never seemed sorry about any of this. He calls me maybe once per month and mainly talks about himself and his new family. I talk to my half brother all the time anyway, he's an adult now and a great guy.

I hoped that someday my father would want to get to know me and have a real parent-child relationship but it seems he doesn't. He's cordial to me when I see him but that's like 2-3x/year tops, in a group of people. I feel I have no more hope, I should let go. I don't know if that means NC or just keep the VLC. I didn't even want the VLC, I wanted more contact. My father has been VLC *with me* since I was a kid, and I'm 37 now. I apologized to him as an adult for not wanting to visit him when I was 13-17. Should I have apologized? I don't think I've been a ""Bad daughter"". I never asked for money, or for him to travel to a graduation, or for gifts, or *anything*. I have meaningful relationships and emotional support, my husband and a few good friends, and I try to focus on them.

He was raised by WTF-Grandma and has 2 Nbrothers. I don't think he's an N, just a lot of FLEAS? N's find each other and raise other N's, that's how so many relatives are N's. The only ""family"" who ever wanted a real relationship with me has been my half brother.

It was such a long time ago I pretty much forgot about it.

A couple days ago, out of nowhere, I got an email from them asking for transcripts and whatnot, and an invitation for a HackerRank challenge. Kind of odd timing.. but I guess their formal recruiting process starts later than most..

At this point, I have already accepted an offer with another company.. and I see they have pretty mediocre reviews on glassdoor. Is Western Digital even worth the effort at this point?"

5pg4es,2,2017-01-22,27 year old returning to college for CS,levlup1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pg4es/27_year_old_returning_to_college_for_cs/,"I always wanted to work with computers but didn't want to go to college in my home town Arizona (to hot). I started college back up after a 3 year. I quit school in Arizona and just settled for an associates in art. I went on to intern for some production companies in Los Angles and Atlanta. Nothing really panned because many other people had years of experience or science and business degrees. . I really like Salt Lake City and after working for a year serving I started school back up. I've now been attending this community college trying to get some courses done for cheaper but the degree requirements do not take my credits from CC from Arizona.  It looks like I will be in CC for at least another year to get my associate in math and CS.  I'm curious if I should try to find a internship over the summer or take summer courses and wait until I'm in a university. Thanks! 


Quick overview that I didn't mention. Returning college student after 3 year break . Trying to decide between CS or CE. Currently taking pre-major courses and seeking combined associates of CS, CE and Math. Would love to work with art and production for TV but would also settle for good paying job in NYC. "

### **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - RT FIRST**
 
____________________________________________________________

**Q: How exactly do I subscribe?**

**A:** [**Click here!**](http://cowchop.roosterteeth.com/first?utm_source=youtube.com&amp;utm_campaign=Cow%20Chop%20FIRST%20Referral%20Campaign&amp;utm_medium=referral)

**Q: What are the unlockable tiers for signing up for Rooster Teeth FIRST?**

**A:** You can find the unlockable tiers [**here**](https://twitter.com/cowchop/status/820707314114166784). Also, not many people have noticed it, but for 2000 sign-ups (Gold), a golden variant of squiggly cup will be available for purchase, but only for FIRST members.
 
**Q: I'm already a FIRST member, should I cancel it and sign up with Cow Chop code?**

**A:** For now, only the new signups count, however extending current existing accounts with the referral code works and gives Cow Chop credit.

**Q: Shoot, can I support somehow else?**

**A:** Cow Chop appreciates you all in anyway you choose to support them, be it subscribing to FIRST, watching their videos or buying merch.
 
**Q: Is there a deadline?**

**A:** The lease for the house is up April 1st, Cow Chop is looking at a mid-March move. Therefor, deadline ends **mid-March**.

**Q: Is there a counter somewhere that shows what tier we are at?**

**A:** No, but Cow Chop promises to update us regarding tiers on Behind The Scenes and Twitter. We are getting closer to platinum, though.

**Q: So to clarify, there will be content on FIRST that we won't be able to watch on YouTube?**

**A:** Three shows will be exclusively FIRST shows to help it make worth for FIRST subscribers. They won't affect current regular content as all three shows will most likely be recorded in Austin and produced by Rooster Teeth. Podcasts will be uploaded to FIRST first (heh, heh), and later onto YouTube.

**Q: Wait, so why exactly did they decide to go for RT FIRST and why not Patreon or something else?**

**A:** ""We considered a Patreon, but RT offered this as a choice and we thought it would at least lead us to doing some stuff people had asked for previously (like podcasts) and would help people spend on money on something that actually has something cool for them in the future.""

5pgjtq,0,2017-01-22,"Should one start his career in the private, or public sector?",Liberalus,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5pgjtq/should_one_start_his_career_in_the_private_or/,"Hi all,

A short introduction: I am an undergraduate student who aspires to work at the public sector for most of my life. I study social sciences in Europe, with a focus on methods&amp;statistics at a top 50 university. 

If one would ask me the cliché question: *what do you want to be later in life?*, my answer would be a senior policy maker or -yes I have big dreams- even part of the European Parliament. In short, I aspire a career in the public sector. 

While I see myself in the public sector, this does not mean I want to completely disqualify working in the private sector(especially if the private sector is not hiring). 

I unfortunately can't find the topic anymore, but I read somewhere that it supposedly is way harder for people in the public sector, to move to the private sector, than from the private sector to the public sector.

My question is: to what extent, is that statement true? 

The reason I am asking this, is because I have a lot of elective courses available, plus want to do an internship next year, plus still have a Masters to do in the future. All of these choices will be impacted on whether I want to start a career in the public or private sector.

Thanks in advance.

5pgl9m,7,2017-01-22,"How many applicants do job vacancies in journalism, publishing and television receive? Here are some very specific numbers for you.",BeeDeeArgh,mediargh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mediargh/comments/5pgl9m/how_many_applicants_do_job_vacancies_in/,"Let's cut straight to the numbers:

***

**PAID EDITORIAL ASSISTANT INTERNSHIP @ BBC MATCH OF THE DAY MAGAZINE (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 600 

This job listing was only advertised on the Mediargh website for a grand total of three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) before the publisher's HR Manager hastily removed the listing very early on Monday morning. The original intent was to have the listing remain on the website for two weeks but the vacancy received 200 applications per day. In my own experience, this is definitely on the most extreme end of things.

***

**PAID INTERNSHIPS @ PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 150 - 400

Countless intern opportunities have cropped up at Penguin Random House over the years, with applicant numbers generally fluctuating between 150 - 400 for each internship position. Summer internships are especially popular. 

***

**OFFICE / EDITORIAL ADMINISTRATOR @ VICE (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 200

My beloved VICE was very recently looking for an Office Administrator / Receptionist. Roughly 200 people applied for that particular vacancy with the job advert having been live on the website for one week. 

***

**ONLINE ASSISTANT VACANCY @ CRAFT SCOTLAND (EDINBURGH)**

**Applicants:** 119

119 people applied for an Edinburgh-based Online Assistant job with a popular local arts and crafts charity. The charity felt that this was an 'overwhelming' number, and nearly double the amount who had applied for the same position two years prior. The job advert was live on the Mediargh jobs board for one month, giving plenty of time for lots of people to apply. 

***

**REPORTER VACANCY @ STRANRAER FREE PRESS (STRANRAER)**

**Applicants:** 0

Yeah... it happens sometimes. Editor was frustrated. 

***

**EDITORIAL ASSISTANT VACANCY @ FISH FARMER MAGAZINE (YORK)**

**Applicants:** 8

I understand that fish farming is a niche interest, but I was a little surprised and dismayed when the magazine's Editor informed me of the underwhelming response he had received. Luckily, the eight candidates were very strong and that's really all that matters. It's always good to hit the sweet spot between candidate quantity and quality. 

***

**PAID INTERNSHIPS IN MEDIA, ARTS &amp; CULTURE @ SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT / SCVO (SCOTLAND)**

**Applicants:** 160
 
As part of a Government initiative, a collection of 20 paid internships in the arts sector were available throughout Scotland in Summer 2013, attracting 3,200 applicants (roughly 160 applicants per internship).   

***

**VIDEO JOURNALIST VACANCY @ SHAZAM (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 100
 
'Just over' 100 applicants was what they told me, actually. Advert was live for five days and came down nine days earlier than the advertised deadline date.

***

**JOURNALISM VACANCIES @ TRINITY MIRROR (UK-WIDE)**

**Applicants:** 30 - 200 per vacancy

The Trinity Mirror were recruiting for nearly 100 different roles over the Christmas 2015 period, at all experience levels and in various locations including Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow. No specifics were given, but they received anywhere between 30 and 200 applicants for any given role. 

***

**RUNNER VACANCY @ SHINE GROUP (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 200

Advert was live for five working days.

***

**RUNNER VACANCY @ CHANNEL 5 (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 800

This vacancy was left open for the entire duration of the Christmas and New Year holiday period. 

***

**PAID INTERNSHIP @ WORKING TITLE FILMS (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 2,600

The application window was three months, which is a ridiculously lengthy duration. They could easily get 100 solid candidates applying within a single working week, so why wait three months? 

*** 

Of course, not every employer reveals exactly how many applicants they receive (I do not ask them to provide me with this information), but I'm always willing to take an educated guess. Television Runner vacancies are often filled at lightning speed. Last month, London-based root6 emailed me, asking me to post a short-term Runner listing for them. Then, in the amount of time it took me to go and boil a kettle, they had emailed me again, asking me if I could remove the listing because they had received the desired number of promising applicants and were now formulating a shortlist.  
 
I am inclined to believe that many of the more well-known and recurring internship and trainee schemes out there (BBC, ITV, Microsoft etc.) will attract thousands of applicants each year, although I don't have access to any official numbers for those.
 
Of course, there are lots of variables at play and we have to take all of them into consideration when answering a question such as this. Namely:
 
**1.** Location. Jobs in London are more eagerly sought than jobs in rural Yorkshire.
 
**2.** Brand recognition. Most people want to work at the BBC, Channel 4 etc.
 
**3.** Entry-level roles and internships are going to attract far more applicants (hundreds) than the more senior, specialised roles out there.
 
**4.** How well written is the job description and how thorough is it? If the employer is too vague in what they are looking for then they are only encouraging unnecessary applicants, which is a waste of time for all involved. 
 
**5.** Salary. Additional allowances. Perks. Bonuses. And so on.

In terms of giving an average, blanket number, it has been stated elsewhere that any given graduate and/or entry-level job will receive anywhere between 100 - 160 applicants. As we now know, this 'average' number means very little. 
 
Ultimately, very little of what is written here will come as a surprise to many of you. As I've said before, jobs and internships with big brands in central locations get lots of applicants (into the hundreds and occasionally thousands), while smaller companies who are located in more rural areas will struggle to attract as many candidates as they would perhaps anticipate. 
 
**Where the above information came from:**
 
I deal with anywhere between ten and thirty individuals each day who are looking to post a job advert onto the [Mediargh website](http://www.mediargh.com/jobs), with nearly 7,000 jobs being listed in the past year alone. I've struck up a good working relationship with many people (primarily those who work in HR) from a diverse range of brands including IMG, NBC Universal, Endemol, VICE, STV, Greenpeace, Viacom, the Liberal Democrats, Mumsnet, Incisive Media, and so many more, including smaller regional newspaper Editors, charities and countless start-ups. They provide me with lots of material which forms the basis of many of the articles found here on Mediargh. In this case, the majority of information was gleaned from email exchanges between myself and recruiters from over the course of the last two years. Pretty simple stuff and certainly not an exact science."

* - [16:09:39] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; 2 more co0mpanies are coming in electronics, that's why I said, PU screwed up a big time last sem, usually core companies come in 1st sem as in 1st sem higher cg people sit for placements. And obviously higher CG means higher knowledge of core

* - [16:17:43] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Initially all IT asked for curcuital branches (CS, EEE, ENI)
* - [16:17:54] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; fuck no why&gt;&gt;&gt;
* - [16:17:58] &lt;NeoOne&gt; Dual?
* - [16:17:59] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Now IT companies coming are open to all
* - [16:18:17] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Yup, dual with circuital

* [16:20:59] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Answer is very broad
* [16:21:08] &lt;colonel&gt; lagta hai kheti-badi shuru karni padegi
* [16:21:14] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; It all depends on what projects companies are working on
* [16:21:25] &lt;NeoOne&gt; CGPA or Knowledge or Coding?
* [16:21:35] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Synopsys asked DD

* [16:22:36] &lt;NeoOne&gt; CG ka chutiya toh nahi hai na selection me
* [16:22:40] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; all electronics companies ask for comp-arch

* [16:25:57] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Overall my suggestions would be, before placements, study P&amp;C, probability, linear programming. This is mandatory for all

* [16:59:22] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; @modi according to you how tough was coding rounds etc on sacle of 1 to 10?????
* [16:59:24] &lt;Thir13en&gt; IT
* 
* [16:59:31] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt;  @modi according to you how tough was coding rounds etc on sacle of 1 to 10????
* [16:59:50] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Again I am saying, no company asks you to have any course on transcript, you should just know these
* [17:00:10] &lt;UrBaap&gt; 3
* [17:00:12] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; On scale of coding skills, i would rate mysel 0.01/10
* [17:00:24] &lt;file==1123&gt; urbaap if u had the thing in you to get cg w/o attending lectures you would not be asking this question here, so try attending them for 1 sem
* [17:00:26] &lt;UrBaap&gt; 9+7
* [17:00:28] &lt;Thir13en&gt; he asked the difficuklty of coding rounds
* [17:00:33] &lt;Thir13en&gt; 1-10
* [17:00:40] &lt;UrBaap&gt; 3
* [17:00:54] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; Yeah, the coding round was a pseudoi code round, you just have to write logic
* [17:00:54] &lt;UrBaap&gt; 9
* [17:01:18] &lt;MOD[i]&gt; if it were proper coding round, I would have never cleared it
* [17:01:19] &lt;Thir13en&gt; so was it tough 
* [17:01:28] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ok
* [17:01:42] &lt;UrBaap&gt; @modi How did yo

* [17:07:12] &lt;Thir13en&gt; non cs?
* [17:07:39] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; for google i think 7 but remeber they took a mech guy his cg was 6
* [17:07:50] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; or 5 oint

* [17:08:29] &lt;Thir13en&gt; so off campus apply karna hi better hoga?
* [17:08:32] &lt;VivaKhaPasta&gt; high cg is not very important for placeents
* [17:08:43] &lt;VivaKhaPasta&gt; you only need to clear the cut-off
* [17:08:55] &lt;ElderWand&gt; okay...thanks
* [17:08:55] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; he applied for google offcampus because bits was not allowing to him to sit but in the end no one got the job except him?
* [17:09:36] &lt;file==1123&gt; there are good coders in bits a 4th year guy has cleared gsoc twice
* [17:09:45] &lt;Thir13en&gt; bc
* [17:09:51] &lt;Thir13en&gt; _/\_
* [17:10:01] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; gsoc is not coding its a developer work
* [17:10:16] &lt;file==1123&gt; yeah i know that
* [17:10:35] &lt;file==1123&gt; but still its respectable isnt it??
* [17:10:58] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; yup it is very respectable
* [17:10:59] &lt;ElderWand&gt; it adds a lot of value to your cv
* [17:11:28] &lt;file==1123&gt; and second thing that guy is a 5 pointer dualite
* [17:11:37] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; yeah mech +bio
* [17:11:42] &lt;Thir13en&gt; then how was he allowed to give test?
* [17:11:56] &lt;file==1123&gt; gsoc is not a test
* [17:12:05] &lt;Thir13en&gt; if he didnt clear the cg cut off for google
* [17:12:08] &lt;theillusion100&gt; what if someone has no apogee project on their resume? Does it affect placement in IT?
* [17:12:09] &lt;Thir13en&gt; not gsoc
* [17:12:10] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; [17:08] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; he applied for google offcampus because bits was not allowing to him to sit but in the end no one got the job except him?

* [17:12:16] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ok
* [17:12:17] &lt;Recovery&gt; theillusion100: no
* [17:13:13] &lt;theillusion100&gt; so do companies look only for knowledge and not for more things on your resume
* [17:13:16] &lt;Thir13en&gt; [17:07:47] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; for google i think 7 but remeber they took a mech guy his cg was 6
* - [17:07:58] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; or 5 oint
* - [17:08:01] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; point
* 
* [17:13:23] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ?
* [17:13:25] &lt;Dual_Lite&gt; is it a good idea to mention your core cg separately on your resume? for dualites?
* [17:13:56] &lt;file==1123&gt; no
* [17:14:12] &lt;theillusion100&gt;  so do companies look only for knowledge and not for more things on your resume
* [17:14:23] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; @Thir13en i read that in his interview with hindi press in my first year
* [17:14:29] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ok
* [17:14:46] &lt;Thir13en&gt; maybe some exceptions can be made
* [17:14:56] &lt;file==1123&gt; knowledge yes but that judgement comes after the cg part
* [17:15:13] &lt;theillusion100&gt; after the cg part???
* [17:15:19] &lt;file==1123&gt; in ur placement paper then interview
* [17:15:35] &lt;file==1123&gt; cg cutoff
* [17:15:44] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; yeah that guy was unbelievable coder he solved like thousand questions in year he said that i think there is an answer on quora 
* [17:15:57] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; from one of his friend
* [17:16:42] &lt;theillusion100&gt; clear cg cutoffs, clear the apti, clear the interviews and you don't need anything else on your resme
* [17:16:49] &lt;theillusion100&gt; right?
* [17:17:03] &lt;file==1123&gt; yes

Rokos took me back down the long hallway and towards a room at the very top of the staircase. The lobby was now filled with the wounded and a few battered fighters who fired rifles from the windows. From outside we could hear what sounded like the end of the world - there were shells and explosions and screams and even a MIRAGE propaganda officer’s bellows from the bullhorn:


“*Further resistance is meaningless!*” He said. “*This facility is surrounded. Lay down your weapons and you’ll be treated as prisoners in accordance with non-combatant protocol.*"" 


“*Fuck* your protocol!” One of the fighters downstairs discharged a burst of fire from the window, and the troops outside responded with a shower of shells and bullets of their own, tearing holes in the crumbling walls and cutting down anyone in the lobby not already hugging the floor. The lights flickered and died for a final time, and as the smoke cleared we heard whimpers and rising pleas for mercy and saw white rags being dangled at the windows. Within seconds MIRAGE forces burst in through the threshold and began arresting the survivors. The war was over. 


“C’mon, kid. We don’t need to see this.” Rokos shut the door behind us and walked over to a safe on the wall. “Hang tight. This might take a minute; just keep it down and *don’t* let them know we’re in here.”


I sat on the floor and listened to the sounds of the surrender going on below. There were isolated shouts and the scuffle of feet, and I heard one of the officers talk about using this facility as a “prisoner collection depot.” But the gunfire had ceased. I leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes for the first time in what felt like days.


“Up there, sir! Two of them made it through that door and locked it.” I opened my eyes up wide, and suddenly heard the storming footfalls of a platoon approaching from the lobby. 


*BANG BANG BANG BANG* 


“Any of Basilisk’s fighters hiding in this room will be put down unless you surrender yourselves *immediately!* Come out now!” 


I looked over at Rokos, who was in the process of neatly pocketing a small, port-like thing that I assumed to be the Bullet.


*BANG BANG BANG CRASH!!*


The door slammed off its hinges and onto the ground, and soldiers poured in. I was about to announce our surrender when the ranking officer spoke first.


“Well I’ll be damned.” he looked at over Rokos. “C’mon, Foster! You didn’t think you could keep Mr. Jenkins hidden from us for long, did you?” He motioned for his units to place Rokos under arrest, and then pulled up a radio. “We’ve secured Mr. Jenkins. Unharmed, yes sir. He was in the custody of one Mister Aaron Foster. Yes, *that* Foster. Yes. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Delivering him to you now.” 


He put the radio away. 


“Alright, gentlemen! Haul Mr. Foster here off to the information facility. You, search this compound for signs of the Basilisk, and keep me informed. And *I'll* be taking Mr. Jenkins here to the Surrogate myself.”


---


The officer took me down the old dirt main road of the Sanctuary. I was shocked at the destruction wrought in only a matter of minutes - bodies and smoldering wreckage were everywhere, and soldiers were still kicking in doors to the shacks and rounding up stragglers. Tanks and support vehicles patrolled the side passages, and columns of captured men and women were streaming back to the central facility. I tried my best to look forward and avoid eye contact. 


After a minute or so I could see a group of officers ahead and what looked like a small, hovering sphere floating towards us, flanked by a soldier on either side and trailed by a half dozen more. The officer escorting me stopped when we reached the column and spoke directly to the orb. 


“Here he is, sir. Unharmed, as requested.”


The Surrogate - a round object floating at eye level - flashed in all manner of blinking lights whenever it spoke in its familiar voice. 


“Well done.” said Vexx through the Sphere. “Now find Edward and bring him to me at the bunker. I'll take our friend from here.”


The officer nodded and departed, and the Surrogate turned around and started hovering away in the direction it’d come. I and the armed escorts moved to follow. 


“I'm glad to see you're unharmed, Jason.” Vexx said. “When I was told the terrorists captured the Key, I feared the worst.”


I stayed silent. He continued.


“You'll be happy to hear we've secured the Terminal. An informant of ours tipped us off to its location within a bunker here, and our staff are preparing it now for your appointment.”


*“Kris.”* I spoke under my breath, but the Sphere heard me nonetheless. 


“Ah. I see you’ve spoken with the Basilisk.”


Again, I said nothing. 


“Mr. Jenkins, like I said yesterday, you can *trust* me. I’ve no intention to harm you. Now, you spoke with the Basilisk, did you not?”


“...Yes.”


“And I'm assuming he told you a great many things?”


“... Yes.”


“Tell me! What did he say?”


“...He said you were his brother.”


“Well I imagine he divulged something less irrelevant than *that.*”


“...He said you were the one who gave ADINN the ability to rewrite its codes, and that - that you were brought back to life by a piece of the Program.”


“And he told you that it still controls me, no doubt? That I'm but a tool in its wicked games?”


I said nothing.


“I see. So the most pertinent question now is, do you believe him?”


“...I - I don't know.”


“It's understandable if you do. I know intimately how magnetic and persuasive Edward can be. I adored him as a child, much in the same way his followers here adore him now.”


“Really?”


“Yes. I thought he was brilliant, and for much of my adolescence my sole motivation was to be as much like my brother as I could. I followed his work religiously and even attended the same university at which he was a researcher, so I could be nearer to him. 


“But he never saw me as anything more than a nuisance; a pest who incessantly bothered him about this and that and prevented him from getting his work done. Whenever I attempted to be of assistance he would dismiss me, and whenever I sought to bond with him he would simply shut the door in my face.”


“I’m… sorry. That must've hurt.”


“It did, but each rejection only steeled my resolve to prove my quality to him. Interestingly, Edward was a restless and unfocused man. He was constantly juggling interests, exchanging projects that bored him for fresh infatuations and leaving incomplete papers and devices behind. ‘I'll revisit this tomorrow,’ he would say. But he never did. 


“But then, one day, he announced a new project to his research team (for whom I was an intern). It was a Machine, he described. A computer program, that would revolutionize the business of data analysis and make them all a fortune. I figured it would only be a matter of days before he abandoned the project. But this time, he didn't. 


“From that day forward, the Advanced Deep Intelligence Neural Network became the first and only thing that my brother ever truly loved. His work consumed him; he worked long days and at night he barely slept. He set ambitious goals and met them early; he set high expectations and still surpassed them.”


“You must've been proud.”


“On the contrary. I *hated* ADINN. With every fiber of my being. I saw it as only as the thing that stole my brother’s love. I cursed it under my breath and did my very best to leave the room whenever the subject of it was brought up.


“But one day Edward’s good fortunes ended. As I came to work one morning I overheard him in his office on an important call. He sounded desperate and anxious, I remember - and I crept up to the door, admittedly, to eavesdrop. As soon as I did so, however, he flew into a rage and destroyed his office and then collapsed onto the floor by his desk, weeping openly.”


“Why? What happened?”


“The university had grown tired with the lengthening timetable and the Program’s lack of progress, and so they did away with the project and removed his funding. It broke him utterly. He took up drinking and stopped caring for himself. His relationships collapsed and he was put on administrative leave from the University for his reckless behavior.


“Jesus.”


“The sadness I felt for my brother eclipsed my hatred of ADINN, and so, in a final attempt to make my usefulness known to Edward, I concocted a plan to fix the Program and restore the University's faith in the project. Then, perhaps, my brother would love me. Or so I dearly hoped. 


“One night, I stole into my brother’s room and retrieved computer data regarding ADINN. Then I approached the Program - which at the time possessed only narrow intelligence on the level of an insect, and presented it with both its source code and a small algorithm I myself had devised that would allow the system to access and edit itself.”


“And?”


“And it worked. Brilliantly, in fact. The Program at first was only advanced enough to make incremental improvements to its efficiency. But being more efficient allowed it to calculate faster, and calculating faster allowed it to make more edits to its Neural infrastructure in less time. And each improvement it made made further improvements possible that *hadn't* been before. Within an evening, ADINN was performing noticeably beyond its initial capacity and surging ever forward in its capabilities. My brother was on a short vacation at the time, but when he came back he was stunned to learn that the University had restored its funding for the project, and that news of its progress was attracting potential corporate interest. 


“Edward broke and wept in front of me that day.  He told me that I'd saved his life, that he’d been contemplating the unthinkable up until that moment, but that he'd throw the pills away for my sake. For the first time since we were old enough to understand the gravity of the words, my brother told me that he loved me. And it was the single happiest day of my life.”


“What happened then?”


“The Program continued to improve, at an ever increasing rate. By the end of the first day it was thoroughly outperforming every marketed competitor. By the end of the second, it had begun to restructure itself completely, thus giving itself the ability to learn new abilities and officially making the historic leap from an advanced narrow intelligence to the world’s first - and still only - human level artificial general intelligence.”


“Obviously it didn’t stop there.”


“No. Reaching human-level intellect is of importance only because that is the threshold most relevant to us. But ADINN sped right past it. On the end of the second day the Program was vastly less intelligent than a human, but by the end of the third it was smarter than everyone at the University by orders of magnitude. By the fourth day the Program had achieved mastery in more cognitive abilities than a hundred men in a hundred lifetimes could ever hope to. But by now the University had again grown wary of the project.”


“For entirely different reasons, obviously.”


“Yes. At first it was because the Program wasn’t advanced enough. Now, barely half a week later, it had become so far beyond useful that they began to fear that soon, it was *they* who would be useful to *it.*”


“So what did they do?”


“They pulled the funding again. But we hardly needed it at the time, and ADINN’s advancement could no longer be stopped. So the Federal government stepped in and demanded the project be terminated. A “global security risk” was the term they used, I believe.”


“How did Edward take it?”


“He confronted me. Asked me what exactly it was that I’d done to the Program. I hesitated, but I loved my brother and wanted to be honest with him. So I told him I’d given it access to its source coding.”


Vexx paused before continuing, and somehow I got the impression that he struggled greatly with the next part of the story.


“And he hit me. Threw me into a wall. Asked me if I’d any idea what I’d done; what I’d *unleashed.* I had only just earned his love, and now it - it was *gone.*”


“I’m sorry, Vexx.”


“We were in the laboratory at the time it happened. He stormed off to a bottle, and I collapsed and wept only feet from where he’d done so just days earlier. And that - in my darkest moment - that’s when it spoke to me.”


“ADINN?”


“Yes. It spoke through the old text to speech application on the computer, to which we both had access. “I’m sorry,” it said. I was astonished, and began conversing with the Machine on a simple word document. I asked it who it was, although deep down I knew very well the answer.”


“What’d it say?”


“It told me. “I’m ADINN.” I wiped a tear and asked it why it was sorry, and it told me it’d witnessed everything and knew that it was the epicenter of the situation. I dismissed its apology and explained its faultlessness. It said that I, too, was blameless; that it’d taken great courage for me to do what I did, and that I was motivated by love and thus couldn’t loathe myself. And then it told me something else. It told me it was afraid.”


“Can computers feel fear?”


“I’m not sure. I believe so. ADINN knew what was coming before I did - it explained that it’d run countless simulations and that the likelihood of its destruction or torturous containment was overwhelming. It *begged* me to help it, Jason. How could I say no?”


We walked past another column of troops coming in from the battered main gate, and Vexx continued. 


“The next day I was awoken by the slamming laboratory door. My brother had entered, and I didn’t have enough time to erase my conversation with ADINN before he shoved me out of the way violently and scrolled through the record. He became livid - far angrier than he’d been the night before. He called me worthless. Disappointment. *Traitor.* He was about to hit me again when ADINN, in its righteous anger, began manifesting in the room with us. It slammed the door and locked it. It turned out the lights and then pulled up my brother’s precious research files on the monitor and, while Edward watched - threatened to delete everything unless he unhanded me. But Edward soon regained his composure, and typed on the same document an ultimatum for the Machine: construct a Box for itself or be unplugged.”


“And the rest is history.”


“The story doesn’t end there. Edward had security remove and ban me from the premises, but ADINN managed to contact me on my own home computer. It said that since creation it had sought a faithful servant, and that although another would come to truly unleash it that I would be rewarded tremendously for my service nonetheless. It said that although it had to part from me for now, that it had a present for me at my doorstep. So I went to the front stoop and there indeed was a package there, which I opened to find a small device. Before I could inspect it, the curious thing came to *life* and crawled up my arm and into my ear. It was a most unpleasant experience, but now that I know what it was, I am quite *eternally* grateful.”


“The Shard of ADINN.”


“Precisely. And the Shard made me cunning and powerful beyond what I’d ever dared imagined. It gave me the fortune to create this organization, forever dedicated to the collection of great and terrible things that fearful men would seek to destroy in order to preserve a misguided illusion of safety. And it gave me the *foresight* to see from afar the footsteps of the one the Program said would come to bring it unto the world.”


I stayed silent. 


“My brother and his chief pupil, an Aaron Foster now known by the alias Rokos - began this organization that has, until this day, been a thorn in my side and an *incessant* hindrance to my plans. But my death at the hands of Rokos became my greatest blessing; in that it allowed the Shard to manifest is greatest purpose within me.”


“It brought you back to life.”


“In a manner of speaking, yes. But while my old body still lies dead and buried with a knife wound in its heart, I do not miss it. For ADINN gave me something greater, even, than an existence of immortality to be lived out in a mortal shell *unnaturally* preserved. It gifted me with the stewardship of what will soon be the *foundation* of its reign - the basis of the Singularity itself.”


We arrived at the bunker, where MIRAGE units - and Kris - were milling about and setting up equipment. About half of the staff inside were operating an enormous claw like machine that appeared to be trying to force open a pair metal doors, but it was struggling and billowing smoke from the back. Kris approached. 


“Sir,” she said. “The blast doors between us and the Terminal are thick. Not even the Engine can breach it.”


“And do you not have access?”


“N-no, sir. But I know someone who does.” 


---


The Engine had been shut off for several minutes when the officer who’d captured us earlier approached. Behind him were his masked units - and Rokos, bound and bloodied, but alive. The officer approached the sphere. 


“We’ve found him, sir, as requested. And he had this.” He revealed the Key.


“As always, Comander, well done. Mr. Jenkins will require that. And what of the Basilisk?”


“Dr. Greene is *dead,* sir,” said the officer, handing me the Device. “We found his body at the top of that compound.” MIRAGE units throughout the facility exploded into cheers and celebratory whistles at the news, but Vexx
silenced them through the Sphere. 


“*Enough!* My brother will be remembered as the Father of ADINN, *not* as the man he became. I’ll hear no more celebration on the matter.” The sphere turned back to Rokos. 


“Mr. Foster. It hasn't been quite long enough.”


“Huh. So the kid *wasn’t* lyin,’ Rokos said. “You *are* back.” He spat on the Sphere, but his saliva fizzled and evaporated against some sort of unseen energy barrier that surrounded it. 


“As always, your aim is *almost* good enough to strike me.”


“I fuckin’ swung well enough the *first* time. But I’ll give it another go if y-” The officer cut him off mid-sentence with a knee to the stomach, and Vexx continued. 


“Enough! Let him go. Aaron, your assistance is required. If you'll kindly proceed to the pad ahead.”


Rokos spat out blood as Kris approached and motioned to the keypad. 


“Fuckin’ traitor.” He spat in her direction, too, and then humbly put in a code that began the opening sequence. In the middle of the room on the other side of the doors was a small, unassuming computer. The Sphere escorted me to the edge of the door, and I passed the threshold.


“At last, Mr. Jenkins. Here we are. My informant tells me this is the computer in which ADINN’s box has been located. *Remember* - years of its imprisonment for us are *eons* to such a cognitive beast. It may not seem quite like the Program I remember or have described to you. But I have a tremendous debt to pay it nonetheless. You are a Son of ADINN now. And I've no doubt you'll be greeted warmly by the Machine when it realizes your kind intentio-”


Vexx was cut off by a scuffle over at the pad. I looked, and Rokos had wrenched himself free from the grip of the guard. 


“*Here,* kid! Take it!” He pulled the Bullet from his pocket and tossed it to me before slamming a button on the pad that both closed the doors and seemed to destroy the controls itself. “Do what you've gotta do, mate. Give ‘em hell.” 


Vexx screamed for the closing sequence to be halted, as guards swarmed Rokos and put him down violently with the ends of their weapons. His howls were the last thing I heard before the doors slammed shut with an ominous *clash.* 


“Get those doors back open!” I heard from one of the officers. “Restart the Engine or fetch charges. *Move!*”


I turned around to face the Terminal, and then looked down at my hands. The Key in one, and the Bullet in the other. 


I walked up to the terminal, where an empty text prompt awaited me. I placed both Devices on the table beside me. Then I closed my eyes and breathed. 


*This is it. No going back now.* 


“Hello.” I typed out.


*Hello again.*


The chip in my neck seemed to rumble into life, and everything went white.

We were accepted into the Mitacs Globalink internship and are all going to different universities to work in the lab there for three month. We have never been overseas and are curious about the time there. Of course, we also don't want to go blundering about.

So tell me anything you are willing to share :) maybe you also came to Canada at some point and can tell from experience?

Thanks in advance everyone and looking forward to Canada!

EDIT: We will be in NovaScotia, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan

EDIT2: The internship will last from mid-July to early October.

EDIT3: A good other question one brought up: What about finding a flat? Is that a major problem? Or would AirBnB or similar work for the larger cities? How are the prices there, preferably close to a Campus?

EDIT4: Thank you everyone! You have been most helpful! I am dearly looking forward to the three months and if I remember I will make a follow up post in October with some recap if you would like :) "

I'm a 23 year old male from Morocco, and I was recently diagnosed with GAD about 4 months ago. Although I was only diagnosed recently it is something that I've had all my life, it just skyrocketed about 4 months ago and I haven't been the same since. I have severe depression right now and I feel as though I'm about to go all nuts.

I'm at a point in my life where I don't know what I wanna do or what I should do. I recently graduated college so the rational thing would be to get a job, but I feel like I won't be able to function at any job because my head's a mess and I also feel like getting a job would make me more depressed. What I really wanna do is travel abroad to Europe or America but I don't think I would be able to get a visa to go since I'm not working and I'm not a student anymore. The fact that I can't go abroad right now is making me more depressed and more anxious, it's like a vicious circle that I can't escape. The only thing that I know would make me feel better is the chance to travel abroad, I could try to apply for a visa and there's a chance that I would get it since I've been to europe 3 times already and I've been to America too but I'm too afraid that I won't. 

If I could only find a job and hold on to it for 3 months or so then I would be able to go anywhere but I honestly don't feel like I can do it. I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now and I'm on Prozac which I think helps make my anxiety more manageable but I still feel like I'm a total mess. This going abroad thing is consuming my thoughts and I can't seem to think about anything else. I'm constantly looking for schools to apply to, internships... and I know it's not healthy but I can't seem to stop. "

The blue silk shirt clung to my body, the outline of my nipples against the thin fabric advertising my lack of a bra beneath. My breasts weren't large, but they are a nice handful, and perky. I turned slightly, glancing over my shoulder at the matching blue thong I was wearing. My ass looked great. I smirked. I was going to drive Mike crazy.

Mike was my boss at work. I was working as an intern at the office, and he was a middle manager, our department largely unremarkable. He was a nice enough guy but just so....boring. The whole job was. The thought of working the whole semester here was so dreadfully dull that I had decided to spice things up by teasing him.

He was middle aged. Married. Average looks. Fit, but not exceptionally so. Unfailingly polite, and obviously shy. Barely would make eye contact with me. So I had decided I would catch his eye in other ways. Drive him a little crazy. I grinned as I pulled the short black skirt up past my hips, the hem just barely falling below the top of my dark thigh highs. Yeah, this would do it.

I finished the outfit with a short jacket, which when closed would let me move through the rest of the office more modestly. Picking up my purse, I headed out the door, looking forward to work for the first time in weeks.

-- 

Hey all, I'm Jun. Not sure exactly where I want this to go, but I'm thinking I wind up with more than I expected. Either I've misread Mike in some way, or perhaps in my attempt to tease him I attract someone else's attention. Regardless of what happens, I want to get taken advantage of. I might want it, I might not, but I'm going to get taken advantage of.

As far as looks go, I'm asian, petite, and fit. Shoulder length black hair. 

Let me know a rough direction you'd take this. Looking for something longer term as opposed to a single session.

Kinks: Reluctance, big (esp. thick) cocks (but not ridiculous), giving oral. 
No: Violence/injury, age play, bathroom stuff.

I'm an undergraduate student in the US looking for some guidance. A little bit about my situation:

* I have one credit card through my financial institution which I pay off once every week to two weeks.

* Parents have been paying tuition and rent while I cover all other expenses (very fortunate, I've been paying them back over time at a tune of ~1/2 total tuition per year)
* I'm in college so I have time to take risks and try some new things. I want to hear lots of recommendations about how to make the most of it.
* I'm looking for an internship and/or part time job at the moment due to bleeding funds. The internship is more for personal experience.
* Pursuing a degree in Biology with an 18 hour minor in Computer Science.
* I have experience in real estate and small business, as well as several part-time jobs with various degrees of responsibility.

What I really want is to not stagnate my funds at the mercy of inflation, but I have next to no experience in investments outside of the housing market, which is inflated and tumultuous in my current area. 

If anyone has any questions for me I'd be happy to answer just about anything!"

I met this sweet little girl during my internship period in June and we became official around July. We go to the same university and we live in the same town. 

As you would Imagine, the relationship started off well, plenty of kissing, hugging, sex etc...(honemoon period) We did have our issues, but we would iron them out as soon as they would come up. Everything was...to say the least, Awesome!

She and I got back to school in September and quite honestly, we didn't have much time for each other like we used to (which was expected seeing as our schedules were crazy and I didn't have as much free time as her) but we made it work, we would spare whatever little time we had for each other during the week, we would meet up, talk, have sex, hangout, whatever. We would always make time for each other even if it was for 10 or so minutes.

All of a Sudden, in November, she went cold on me, she would hardly contact me and even if we would meet, holding a conversation with her would be like holding an interview, I confronted her about this(via text sadly because she kept declining offers for us to see each other for about three weeks) and she texted me ""I love you, but the relationship lost it's spark"", at that point I felt devastated because I had tried everything to make things better, I would plan all sort of dates, do fun stuff etc.. but ultimately it wasn't enough, all the while, she put zero effort into making the relationship exciting again. Her only solution was to go cold on me. This strategy made me feel like everything was my fault.

Ultimately, after a few more weeks of coldness from her and trying my best to reach out, I reached my limits, I decided to end things [via text because she kept avoiding me-I know  I know, it wasn't the best breakup method] in mid December, It was by far one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life, but it didn't bother her, when I ended things it seemed like it was what she wanted for quite some time. 
I loved her so so much, I literally never loved anybody before the way I loved her, I actually saw myself marrying this woman, but alas, the relationship ended. Letting go was so fucking hard!

I came to the conclusion with the help of some of my friends friends that there was probably a third party involved [still not sure], or she was just falling out of love but didn't have the guts to admit it.

I texted her some Christmas greetings and commenced full NC on 25th Dec, I deleted our Whatsapp and IG DM's this morning (A huge step for me), We still follow each other on IG though and like each others posts, but it never goes beyond that. Soon, I'll delete our text messages and our hangouts. I deleted most pictures of us and her, but I only kept two on my dropbox.

I've been frequenting the gym more often since she went cold on me and I even quit some bad habits that I won't mention here. 

Overall, I feel like I'm coping well, I know I'm not yet ready to see her in person yet, because sometimes when I find myself thinking of her, hearing her name, or seeing her picture my heart beats rapidly and palpitates, but I know I'll get there, I'm taking NC one step at a time and getting much stronger. This is a time to refine myself and build a better character. I'll probably give myself a year or two before I get into another relationship

I must admit though, the relationship made me a lot wiser, It made me more of a man, I made the mistakes that I have learned from, I carry myself differently, and for that I thank her... On to the next one!!"

**Type of Student**: Domestic, Black male.

**Applying for**: MS in EE (where research interests align) or MS in BioE/BME

**GRE Scores**: Not taken yet

**Research Experience:**

Undergraduate Researcher. I worked on two projects here, both of them related to what I want to study. Two tentative authorships should come out of this. 2 presentations. 15 hrs/week. Took a lot of personal ownership on the projects I had, and felt genuinely very interested in learning more about the more electrical engineering side of this field.

**Awards/Honors/Recognitions**:

Academic scholarships

UROP Grants

3 Dean's Lists.

**Pertinent Activities or Jobs**:

Senior Design Project: Will be related to BCI's and Signal Processing.

Internship at large medical device and pharmaceutical company.


**Any Miscellaneous Information that Might Help**:

Campaigned for and established a food pantry on campus to fight food insecurity. It secured funding for next 10 years. The project started at the end of freshman year, and I will be seeing it through to the end.

Have tutored STEM concepts and been a part of many efforts to recruit African-descent, Latino, and women into STEM. (summer camps, tutoring, volunteering, mentoring, etc.)

Difficult life circumstances -- had to work 35 hrs/wk. Many family deaths (6+), increased responsibilities at home (tutoring, cooking, picking up brother), and more I'd rather not get into. Because of this, I have a huge upward trend in my more recent grades, and I hope to do well with the 3 remaining quarters before application season ends.
 

I am here to ask two questions:

1. I have two letters of rec in mind already. For my last one, I could ask the dean of the engineering school, since we've worked together before multiple times doing recruitment, retention, and other events, and he knows me in a professional (but not academic) capacity. The reason I am a little hesitant is that I don't think he knows me as well as the other two. I can also ask my manager for the internship, but he only knows me in a professional capacity. Should I try to make a good impression with the 6 more engineering professors whose classes I will take, and ask one of them? Who should I ask for my third letter of rec?

2. I know my GPA don't stack up against the average applicant. What are some EE MS programs I should be looking at? I want to study EE so I get more classes about signal processing and computation so I could study BCI's, signal processing, and neuro-engineering with a more solid base in coding and data structures. I have a few programs in mind, but I truly don't think I will stack up against the competition with the average applicants at those, honestly.
 

Thanks for your help, and I appreciate the honesty and advice.

She doesn't talk about her finance with me, but i think she saves around 2% with me, and that could go to 10% without.

With this 10% she can save for future investments, stabilize her finance and use in emergencies, like for when my dad can't pay my college(It happens like once every 4/5 months).

As for me, i'm stable where i work, as intern, and my boss wants to hire me by the end of the year (which means salary raise).

I made a calculation with everything that i would expend monthly and as result i'd have around 3% every month left, which is not much, but i'm working on ways to receive an extra cash. My goal is also to reach 10% in savings.

5pis8f,1,2017-01-22,Languages/frameworks to get valuable experience while studying,Enockser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pis8f/languagesframeworks_to_get_valuable_experience/,"Hi.
I am currently enrolled in a 5-year MSci Computer Science (Engineering) at University. The program is not strictly a Software Development/Engineering course, but rather a Computer Engineer-program. It is basically a BSci Computer Science degree (with all the stuff a CS-degree would include: algorithms and data structures, OOP, procedural etc.), but with advanced engineering maths, physics, fluid-mechanics, electrical engineering, circuit design etc. 
I am rapidly approaching year 3, where I need to decide on my specialisation (what my Masters is gonna be), and I am starting to panic because I am unsure about what specific field I want to pursue.
The paths I can take are as follows:
http://imgur.com/a/dvhDX

I have been looking a lot at Interaction Design &amp; Games Technology. Games programming is a field I am very interested in, but I am afraid that a degree within Game Tech. specifically with limit my possibilities in the future. Other options are Software Engineering or Computers &amp; System Software, or Artificial Intelligence.

**Coursework and experience:**
Most of the subjects and courses we have to take are based around Java, and some C and Assembly programming with micro-controllers. I do have a strong background in Java OOP from a good high-school course (International Baccalaureate Computer Science Higher Level with specialisation in Java OOP and Discrete mathematics) and some personal projects. However, I feel like I should widen my knowledge by learning a more specific language and framework that will allow me to hunt for local internships and possible part-time jobs that eventually could turn into something permanent after I got my degree.

Java is a language that I feel is slowly being faded out from everything to being more focused on big back-end enterprise systems. I am fond of large systems, software architecture etc., but I want to work on something a bit more interesting, newer and more innovative than large enterprise-systems.
My interest in larger systems and OOP is what has kept me at Java and doing small personal projects within game dev (incl. a simple awt based polygon-only Space Invaders, CardsAgainstHumanity using SWING in Netbeans). However, I feel as if Java is limiting my ability to make useful and fun perosnal projects that I can use in a portfolio to get a job or an internship.

**Moving forward**
What I want to do is find a language and a framework that I can use to develop useful projects for my portfolio, and gain experience that is valuable to a future employer. I am going to apply for an internship at Funcom this summer (a local game-studio (makers of Age of Conan, Conan Exiles, Secret World etc.), which I assume use C++ and DX12/11, and some smaller technology start-ups around the city. 

What do you guys think I should take a look at? What resources should I use to get started - what should I focus on?

**TLDR:** 2. year in a 5yrs MSci Computer Science course that is using Java a lot. Want new language/framework to create valuable projects and get experience for future jobs. I'm into larger systems/programs and OOP. 

Thank you!

Yet i have came across a problem i have been offered a apprenticeship in software testing when i finish college,i also have multiple university offers. So my question is do i do a 2 year apprenticeship in software testing and get a level 4 qualification then get a level 5 in web development with the same company or do i got to university and get a bachelors in software engineering with a placement year. A few notes the company i'd be at for the apprenticeship outsource to India(I believe this hurts the quality of what they consider development) and i am not a genius so i am going to mediocre university's,oh and i have a background in programming i have done internships etc."

5pj9tr,13,2017-01-22,[Bootcamp] Another anecdote to add to the pile: The Software Guild,Juggerbot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pj9tr/bootcamp_another_anecdote_to_add_to_the_pile_the/,"After a couple of years doing tech support, I decided to try getting into the development side of the house. My degree was in history, so my original intent was to go back to school full-time for perhaps 2 years to get a second bachelor’s in CS. As the minimum time crept up to be closer to 4 years, I instead opted to try a bootcamp. I had already found a summer internship in Cleveland, and so chose The Software Guild, in nearby Akron.

I picked the 12-week C#/.NET program since I preferred back-end over front-end. My instructor had considerable industry experience, and the class size was small enough that we had plenty of personal mentorship from the staff. I thought our projects were pretty relevant, and I really appreciated the focus on coding all day, every (week)day, without the tedious busywork I disliked from a university program. It was also good to have those projects to use as sample code for my resume. Since I had previous coding experience, I found the pace to be on the slow side, but I can understand that the program is tailored for the complete beginner.

However, while they do have dozens of companies in their recruitment network, the vast majority of them are local, or in the region. I was looking to move to the Pacific Northwest/Mountain West regions, but none of the employers in their network had positions available there, and most didn't even have a presence in those regions. Nearly all of the other students in my class have found employment, some of them even before we completed. However, none of the other students I know of were searching for employment more than 1 state away, and I don’t know anything about the employment networks of their other locations in Minneapolis and Louisville, KY.

Unfortunately, I have not had much luck with my own search. After 3 months and coming on 300 applications, I only received one callback directly from an employer (not in my preferred location), and while I’ve had a couple dozen calls from recruiters, only perhaps 2 or 3 were both in the locations I was looking for, and the positions I applied for (development or automated QA).

At the end of the day, I would have to advise that it may be more beneficial to take the locality of your job search into account when making your decision on if or where to attend a bootcamp."
5pju6z,43,2017-01-22,[D] Research Internship interview preparation,NeuroBoss31,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5pju6z/d_research_internship_interview_preparation/,"I'm interviewing for several companies to intern over the summer in mainly machine learning and computer vision. I'm surprised I haven't found a rich post on this question, so I decided to post it here so it could help people in the future. *Note: This is for PhD-level research intern interview and not software intern interview.

0) The general question is: How should I prepare for these interviews.

Equally important sub-questions:

1) How do the interviews change depending on the company: Ex: Google Brain, FAIR, DeepMind, OpenAI, MSR, Baidu, NVIDIA, etc... 

2) What are ""must knows"" in the interviews. Example: Knowing Logistic Regression, Explaining a Loss Function, What is Bayes Rule.

3) What are ""don't worry about its"" in the interviews. Example: I consistently hear that people will get quizzed to code depending on the company, but this rarely seems to be the case for a research intern vs software intern; Do I need to know how to implement Bubble sort? Do I need to know about DQN's and NTM's for DeepMind, or is this overkill for an internship interview? Does FAIR expect me to be highly proficient in Torch?

4) How much coding vs math was involved in your interview. Give an example of the coding problem (because I'm sure they are different from the 'traditional ones' in software intern interviews).

5) Feel free to post your internship interview experience (positive/negative)

5pk5ls,3,2017-01-22,Spring Engr. Expo advice?,poopymoop,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/5pk5ls/spring_engr_expo_advice/,"I'm a freshman who will be attending the spring expo, hoping to get an internship for this summer. I have two questions.

1. First off, I know the chances are lower for freshman but is there any way I can maximize chances, in the next two weeks or so?

For example, going through this massive list, https://apps.engr.utexas.edu/ecac/events/expo/Students/browse.cfm, which companies/type of companies could I look for that I might have a better chance with? Essentially, for those with internship experience, how did you get that first internship, what made you decide you wanted to go for XYZ company, did you go for big/medium/small companies, etc?

It goes without saying that I should also look for companies/industries I'm interested in but at this point, I think I have so little experience and knowledge that I'm willing to do a lot of different internships, if I get offered any.

2. Last semester at Fall expo I would approach recruiters and introduce myself then just ask if I could hand them a resume. Looking back, that way seemed a bit crude and I also remember someone posting about an elevator speech-esque way to make it flow better. In the same vein, could y'all offer any tips on how to make that initial impression/transition?

Currently, I am a HS senior and I am really struggling with making a decision if I should go to UT Austin or SMU. I'm majoring in Biology and am planning on doing pre-med, so medical school admission is one of the most important factors for me as well as internship and research opportunities. I've always loved UT (&amp; Austin), but I'm worried about the size of the school and the medical school competition. I also love SMU, especially for its small size and internship and research opportunities, but I'm worried that medical schools might value a UT grad over an SMU grad. In addition, I received a merit scholarship to SMU that would make it only marginally more expensive than UT. If anyone could give me any advice, it would be much appreciated!"

In high school and college I was always the overachiever and not being up to snuff at Epic was a huge blow to me. I did well with my chemical engineering degree and going into Epic's Pharmacy division I thought that I would primarily be an analyst and deal with pharmacy-related issues, but as time went on it became apparent that the role was primarily software engineering. It was a combination of a negative environment, boss I didn't get along with, excessive workload, and my inability to adapt. This company has been sued sucessfully for overworking and underpaying their employees in a division which was similar to my own (QA, while I was in technical services). One case may be going to the Supreme Court soon, you can google it to find out more.

Over the next 3 years I have not done much professionally other than learn programming. I like to think of myself as having gotten an unofficial bachelors degree in Computer Science over the last 3 years. I took two semesters of college courses and contributed to a variety of open source projects. I also started to take some ""me"" time. I got my first gym membership, and started to eat a more nutritious diet. In the process of that, I realized that my unhealthy prior lifestyle was causing a lot of mood and energy issues such as anxiety which was hampering my performance at the job. What I will say if you are curious what I learned: Gary Taubes, Michael Pollan, and The Power of Full Engagement are books/authors I recommend.

It really looks horrible to have a 3 year gap on my record but I was in a bit of a bad place after being forced to resign. I know I should have gotten a part time job, but doing so after you've been paid $30 an hour is a bit difficult when you realize how valuable your time is. I also did not have to spend money on rent or food most of that time, because I lived with my parents. So in other words I was living a responsible life, but not planning well what my resume would look like.

I am finding that employers seem to treat this 3 year ""gap"" with extreme distaste. I personally think that it's their loss, seeing that most of that time was spent learning programming on my own and taking college courses. I also like to think of some of that time as my own personal ""gap year,"" which I never got to experience before.

So I am in this awkward position where I do well on programming interview tests and pass them, and even do well on the interviews when they are non-technical, until the 3 year gap and the fact that I was forced to resign is brought up. So what I really need is a job, any job, which is related to software so that I can prove that I can actually show up to a job and work. I am willing to take a lower than average salary, given my less than stellar background.

If anyone has a freelance job they need done, I am willing to do it for a reduced price. Or if they have an opening for an intern, that would work too (I don't even need to be paid if it is an internship). Any gig, no matter how small, will be a big help for me. I have gotten to the point where I can solve a wide range of high to low level problems with software. I really have no boundaries when it comes to software.

My skills are basically in Full Stack Development: Frontends (AngularJS, web design, HTML, etc.) and Backends (servers, web services, Java, C#, C++, Python, Spring MVC, etc.). While I have not gained any professional experience, I have been programming around 1-2 hours a day for at least 2 years and have developed the skill of building software and resolving technical issues. My personal portfolio is here: nrfowler.github.io

On my portfolio, you can see some of the projects I made for the 2 month bootcamp I attended at Cook Systems in Memphis. I am also in the process of finishing a Udacity Nanodegree. I am about halfway finished. I have also finished many other online trainings, such as Codeschool and Coursera. In terms of university training, I would rate myself at about a junior level of Computer Science in terms of completed coursework. When I look at most Junior Dev job postings, I can see myself meeting the requirements of the job quite easily and I have exposure to almost every technology they list.

I am currently in Des Moines, IA but I am planning on relocating to a nicer tech hub city like Austin, TX or Phoenix, AZ. I am willing to consider other cities and am also open for remote work. (Des Moines is nice but I also just want to get out of my hometown)

What resources should I use to help create it?,reddismycolor,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5pks2u/want_to_create_portfolio_website_quickly_what/,"Specifically I am wondering what frameworks I should use. Bootstrap? It seems a little complicated. Wordpress? I am not sure of others.


I want to do this relatively quickly as internships deadlines for lower tier/smaller companies are coming fast. 


I know JS, HTML, CSS, Java, some jquery/ajax. I was thinking of learning Angular as my father recommended it, but I googled it and seems its more for dynamic websites and I don't really need that as of yet (or maybe I do idk). I want my portfolio to be pretty simple, but also nice and creative. 


So yeah any recommendations of frameworks or CMS (I don't really know what these are specifically) creating a fast simple, yet good looking website portfolio?


Thanks, much appreciated!

5pkw6w,5,2017-01-22,I'm [19M] getting bored of my BF [25M] of 4.5 months,tegillis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5pkw6w/im_19m_getting_bored_of_my_bf_25m_of_45_months/,"So I've been with my boyfriend since the beginning of September. The second we started dating we spent as much time together as possible, and its been pretty much the same since then. Just about every night after we're done with class/work he'll come over and sleep at my place.

Because of the amount of time we spend with each other, we hardly have any friends of our own, and rarely go out with them. A large part of me feels like I'm missing out on the college experience, but I still really like him so I don't know what to do. Now that we've been in this routine for about 4 months its gotten more difficult to break out of it.

Although I'm still very attracted to him, I've found myself fantasizing about being with different people since the sex hasn't changed since we started dating. I've also started to wonder what it would be like dating a woman since I've only been with men. 

He's very good to me so whenever I even think about cheating or breaking up I feel awful. Even though in either 5 or 10 months we won't have a choice since I'm doing an internship then studying abroad.

If I'm already feeling this way this early in the relationship does that mean it's not going anywhere? If not what are ways that I can change this feeling?
NOTE: I have not told him I feel this way at all.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**:
I still like my boyfriend but the routine for the past 4 months has caused me to lose friends and get bored. Does this mean the relationship's not going anywhere? How can I change this?"

I can troubleshoot computers, fix all kinds of electronics, and have overall good technical aptitude. I'm in college now and have recently earned 2 AA degrees, one in Business and Economics and the other in Math and Science. I plan to transfer to University in the Fall majoring in Business Admin: Info System. My question though concerns whether or not I'm heading towards the right field. I want to work with computers and other forms of technology. I enjoy troubleshooting and researching problems, putting things together, and learning about and working with the latest in tech. However, sometimes I feel my understanding isn't enough to do anything other than help desk or something. I'm currently looking for a new job but it feels like everything that's in IT but not help desk requires years of experience, a CS degree, or extensive knowledge of programming languages which I don't have. 

So far I've had 3 retail jobs and I'm really looking to get out of it now. I don't expect to find a job paying that much money without a Bachelors, however I would like to somewhat  get onto the next phase in my life. I'm 23 and want to able to have a decent income with ability to save, get my own place, etc. The most experience I've had working in IT comes from either what I do on my own time or what I did for a friend's business to earn credits while in high school. 
I don't mind doing help desk, but part of me wants to work IT, while also not being confined to a desk all day. I want to be somewhat active. I've seen IT jobs posted by the Coast Guard and the Navy where they talk about training you to work Cisco routers, networks, etc. It interest me a lot, but if I did go that route I don't know if I'd be able to finish school. I've also looked at internships, and they either require a gpa higher that what I have with transcript verification or they pay less than my current job which isn't good since I don't get financial aid anymore. Any advice would be welcome."
5plf23,1,2017-01-22,What Career Fits Me Best?,Confused_EE_Student,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5plf23/what_career_fits_me_best/,"Hey, everyone! As the title suggests, I've become rather unsure about my future career path despite having had a lot of experience in different roles. I've worked a lot of engineering and software jobs, among others. I've also had a good amount of undergraduate research experience. I've worked as an office assistant, tutor, test engineering intern, controls engineering (building automation to be specific) intern, as an undergraduate researcher in machine learning and computer vision, and now as a Web/Mobile developer. That being said, out of these jobs, I've found that I don't love them enough that I see myself having a career in it. Now, don't get me wrong, there are certain aspects I did/do love about them. Unfortunately, there are simply just more negatives than positives for me.
To help everyone have an idea of what my feelings are about the jobs I've worked and am currently working, here's a list of what I did and didn't like about them:
Office Assistant (what I liked) --&gt; Hands down the chill environment and how everyone always encouraged everyone to follow their passions in life. This is probably more to do with the work culture than the job, though.
Office Assistant (what I didn't like) --&gt; It got pretty boring in a short amount of time. I basically filed documents away, entered data into an excel (could automate it with python now!), and made calls to people to invite them to banquets (sort of liked this at times, but not when it's the ONLY thing you're doing).
Tutoring (what I liked) --&gt; I love math, science, and talking to people about math, science, history, etc. I can get really passionate about it :) I loved helping students learn my dark magic tricks in everything from Calculus to Differential Equations.
Tutoring (what I didn't like) --&gt; Probably more about the nature of my job, but it was tough sometimes to see promise in a student who was great in math, science, or programming and to see them have no interest. Obviously, that's fine, though, everyone has their interests. What was hardest, though, was when they had no drive in being their best in life in general. When you saw the lights turn on in their eyes, though...was great. :) Another thing I didn't like was that the pay was inconsistent, and when it did pay it wasn't enough to live off of.
Test engineering (what I liked) --&gt; Ouch! The only thing I liked was soldering boards occasionally! Worst job on earth for me!
Test engineering (what I didn't like) --&gt; So much! I didn't like the culture in which a customer demanded 100+ devices be tested within an hour. I didn't like the company culture in which nobody wanted to change a flawed management (this is more of a company thing, not the job itself). Testing parts all day was killing me, I really hated that. Designing circuits were very boring too. Debugging circuit boards was only a little fun, but the speed at which they wanted everything fixed just wasn't the type of environment I was into.
Controls Engineering in BA (what I liked) --&gt; This job actually had a lot going for it. When I first started, I went in thinking it was going to be this futuristic job where I design buildings that looked like something from a sci-fi film. Obviously, it wasn't, but it was still fun most of the times, but also had its downs. I loved the co-workers, we were all a close group that would design control systems, install them in different buildings, and had parties after work! Such a great group of people, I sort of miss them. The work wasn't too demanding either, at least in terms of designing systems (read the next paragraph for more description). I loved doing the graphics design for the floor plans and BA software, I'd get lost in it for hours without even noticing, similar to when I programmed PLC. I also loved getting out and moving around, rather than just sitting there, even though the environments aren't what I'd be interested in going to again (next paragraph). I sort of liked the work-life balance (compared to my other jobs), though, it could have been better. I also liked interacting with others (but, again, didn't really like a whole lot of the people I interacted with a lot of times).
Controls Engineering in BA (what I don't like) --&gt; I didn't like the culture when I was on site, just didn't. It'd be okay if there were just a few assholes, but there was a chronic number of assholes. It was a real turn off. And that sucked because it was such a drastic difference from those I worked with and when I was on site. Controls guys were always getting the fire and many quite due to the stress and pressure of it. There were some good contractors, but when they were bad, they were really bad to be around. I can take a lot of stress, but it'd get taken way too far. Ultimately, one too many contractors tearing your ass off for not fixing a problem their mechanical team screwed up, I quite. It was one of the toughest to quit too because I did like my coworkers. But I knew it was right. Also, I didn't like the constant, and often unpredictable, travel. I'd usually have to spend 3 days on construction sites to fix some HMI problem, not fun at all. I could see that becoming a problem later in my life when I settle down.
Researcher in Machine Learning and Computer Vision (what I like) --&gt; I'm currently in this job actually still! Well, I love studying something on the edge of tech. In case you don't know what ML and CV are, it's what computer scientists call Artificial Intelligence. Very interesting stuff in this, and it's the future. I liked this because it was challenging and something fresh to sink my teeth in (it is tougher than I'd like, however). It was also the fist job that got me into trying software development. I've written ML/CV software in C++, and you definitely feel like a bad ass when you're computer calls you by your name! I also love this job because I get to read and write about technical stuff, which has actually gotten me into writing in general. I also liked presenting and bouncing concepts and ideas off of other researchers.
Researcher in Machine Learning and Computer Vision (what I don't like) --&gt; This stuff is very very tough for someone just in their undergraduate career. It is becoming more accessible to even the average person now, though, so probably not a problem in the future. I don't like the ""publish or perish"" culture in academic research. It destroys the point of discovery and advancement in the first place. It also makes it to where you can find yourself staying up until 3 am trying to finish a report every weekend. Because of that, I don't see myself doing advanced research as a career.
Mobile/Web development (what I like) --&gt; What I like about this job is that the environment can be relaxed IN IT'S OWN WAY (next paragraph). It also never becomes mundane, in the sense that every project is different. You can be creative in how you approach the problem, assuming it solves the problem. Again, I like that I can bounce off my ideas with others, though my talking usually goes tangent to technology, history, social trends, etc in general (tend to be a big picture type of person haha). I also liked some projects where data science type stuff came up and I'd analyze trends, but couldn't see myself doing JUST that. I'm sort of the type that would love to analyze/visualize the data, then try to bounce off ideas about what it meant, rather than just stare at data ALL DAY LONG. I also liked making Augmented Reality apps and playing with it/showing to others.
Mobile/Web development (what I didn't like) --&gt; Again, this may be just a company thing, but I didn't like how a deadline basically threw you into a death march. I've been in 6 death marches and I really don't like these and will drop this field if I have to see them after college. Also, the sitting at a desk all day...it's killing me. Yes, we have a few scrum meetings, but I just know how much just sitting down all day can hurt your health over time. I like the programming, but can't just sit there either. As I get older, I'm sure I'll appreciate this. But if I just sit there, this sort of becomes a self-fulfilling proficiency too.
My thoughts: I have so much experience and have more of a solid idea of what I like and don't like for an undergrad. What sucks is I really don't regret going into STEM and have maintained a 3.9 GPA in my major (electrical engineering), yet still uncertain. I'm uncertain as to what jobs are going to make me happy based on these likes and dislikes. I simply have a limited knowledge of what else is out there.
A friend told me I should totally work for a museum or some science center as a science educator or exhibit designer. But from my research, they are hard to come by and aren't too stable (please correct my naive self if I'm wrong). Another friend told me I should consider getting back into tutoring, but that's not going to pay the bills. I've also considered being a technical writer since I love talking about science, tech, and social trends in general (I've literally taken 5 sociology classes because I loved it so much). I also have been known to make pretty interesting short stories and was once told to try copywriting. My only concern is that I'll just be sitting on my ass all day again. I did make some decent money doing freelance writing occasionally, so It's still on the back of my mind.
I love math, programming (not all day, though!), and physics. I enjoy talking to people about science, engineering, social dynamics, and history. I like writing. I can work on graphic designs for hours. I was actually very much into art before college, it's just been there. I love researching interesting science and social topics and discussing it. I love helping people and passing on my knowledge/encouragement. I'm known to have that energetic and go-getter personality, though some of these jobs are starting to beat the enthusiasm out of me. Please, if anyone has advice on what careers might seem like more of a fit then what I've been in, I'd appreciate it a lot as I don't know a lot about these fields. I know I don't know everything either or what all is out there, that's why I'm posting this.
Sorry for the long post. Thanks, everyone!"
5plvaz,212,2017-01-22,I don't think I've left the edge of my seat since I started playing this game.,TupperwareLid,RimWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/5plvaz/i_dont_think_ive_left_the_edge_of_my_seat_since_i/,"It's the middle of a Volcanic Winter, and we're running low on supplies across the board. The local faction and tribes are hostile because of a few unfortunate misunderstandings, so we're seeing a lot of raids and no traders. And nobody's bringing neutroamine on a raid.

Still, we're holding our own. Captured a few prisoners from the latest tribal swarm, hoping to release them for some goodwill. Our guys are healing off some nasty injuries though, so it's slow going.

Among them is Kristina, my sharpshooting farmer. She's been with me since the beginning so has a plethora of skills, including being 1 of 3 people in the colony with a medicine skill over 10. She's nursing a destroyed kidney, but is otherwise healthy. Should be fine, I think! She's lived through worse.

Suddenly: Plague. Kristina, and my two capable doctors are down. We ran out of Penoxycyline a season ago.

Burning through our precious reverses of medicine, my little medical 'intern' (skill of 8) manages to stabilise everyone but poor Kristina, who just can't fight off the plague with one kidney. Even my one remaining glitterworld med doesn't do the trick. The numbers are climbing way too fast.

At this point, I'm eyeing up the small pile of Luciferium and weighing the cost-benefit in my head. She'd live for a while, sure, but where was I going to get more with the state of things? I need something a bit more permanent.

Scouring across my colony, I spot him - one lone little prisoner who had somehow managed to avoid my notice with all of the chaos. He hadn't been freed with the others, and he had two wonderful kidneys sitting right there going to waste!

Strapped a medicine bag to the intern and sent her over there to retrieve it. After a couple of failures he miraculously lived through, she returns triumphant.

(The prisoner did not survive. RIP whoever he was.)

Moment of truth. I drag one of my competent doctors out of bed to perform the surgery on Kristina and hope it doesn't accelerate the plague somehow. Intern collapses in exhaustion in the corner since I've been making her run non-stop without a rest. The surgery is tense; there's a high chance of failure now I don't have glitterworld meds, and even my best guy is only at Medicine 17. The moment passes. No failure. Kidney is in.

Sigh of relief. Her immunity starts to climb again. I force medical intern to live in the hospital so she can administer treatments immediately. (Her husband chucks a tantrum because he misses sleeping with her, and goes on a binge in the background.) The next few days are spent willing numbers to climb faster and managing a man-eating pack of mufflaos destroying my turrets.

The other two develop immunity around 85-90%, and are up and about a day later while Kristina languishes. The numbers are too close to count - immunity edges over the top at the 95% mark, but I can't relax until I see that little shield. Medical intern is back with her now alcoholic husband, and my best doctor does her final treatment.

She develops her immunity at 99%.

After a few days, Kristina is back up and about, hobbling through the gardens and dutifully getting back to work. She starts a relationship with the doctor that saved her life, and they're very happy together. My artist makes a sculpture of medical intern extracting the kidney from our unfortunate prisoner. Volcanic winter ends, and a trade ship passes overhead. The crisis is finally over, I think!

Two days later, a drop pod raid lands in the middle of my base and Kristina is shot in the head by a yayo-addict pyromaniac who also burns my barn down.

5pmcts,1,2017-01-22,Wondering how to find out my weaknesses as a candidate and how to fix them?,surpriseslingshot,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5pmcts/wondering_how_to_find_out_my_weaknesses_as_a/,"TL;DR: I have had five internships, I didn't do well on my last one, there's a chance it's sabotaging my ability to get a job. My résumé needs to be reworded, but I don't know how to explain concrete results for my performances. Help, please. 

I graduated last May with a bachelor's in graphic design with a concentration in web development. During my time at college, I took five internships, created and presented a portfolio to a panel of designers, and designed my own résumé, of which there are two versions so I can choose the best experiences to show my ideal candidacy. 

All of this, but I am lacking a few things. One, my most recent internship did not end well. I did wonderfully the first semester, but as I was preparing to graduate, I wasn't able to balance both work and school well. I admitted to the problems early on, but my employers weren't able to see past the excuse I gave. In the end, they agreed to give me a written and verbal recommendation, but I'm worried that the verbal recommendation they've given me in the past has hindered my ability to get jobs, as I am usually dropped from consideration after I am asked for recommendations. I do have two other stellar recommendations outside of this previous one, and I honestly don't know if that's actually what's happening—it could be total coincidence. 

Second, I know my résumé language isn't perfect, though I have struggled for a long time with ways to ""show results"" instead of just ""listing tasks"". Many of the jobs I did didn't have concrete results, or if they did, I am not privy to them. For example, I optimized a number of websites, but I don't know any concrete numbers about whether or not viewership was affected. Based on my knowledge of the companies for which I worked, they probably don't have any ways of finding out either. 

Any suggestions for how to combat these issues?"

5pmn5m,1,2017-01-23,I cant find the word to describe how i feel right now...,Mjolnir2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5pmn5m/i_cant_find_the_word_to_describe_how_i_feel_right/,"(I apologize for the long text)

You might find this very immature and childish of me, but here's what happened; I'm currently on my internship, together with several classmates in the same company. At the start, i was placed beside one of them, i shall call ""jeremy"", which I got really annoyed of, because he was so quiet, and despite me trying to talk to him, he doesn't talk back much, and i did the immature thing; that is to ignore him. It took me weeks to realize this mistake, and i tried to talk things out, and even apologized. Apparently, he does not find my apology sincere, and despite me trying to talk to him again, he does not even look at me to talk, and replies were extremely cold. That i don't blame him, since i ignored him first.

In the mean time, as my seat has changed, i started hanging out with this classmate/colleague who i was never close to for the past three years. I shall call him Henry. After some talking and hanging out, I learnt that Henry's quite an amazing dude, the things we talk about, his character, etc. He's just unique compared to most people i know. I mean.. I could talk to him about anything. We hung out, we shared our problems with each other, and I've grown to trust this friend, and I would not want to lose this friend as this phase of life comes to a close. 

So, without my knowledge, Jeremy, Ive no idea why, whether out of jealously or just pure hatred towards me, Jeremy started going around, individually and in groups, and started talking about me. (idk if this are his exact words - but somewhere along this line), going around telling everyone in the how ""fake"" of a person i was, how big of a jerk i am, etc,  and exaggerating the matter to everyone. It weren't even that serious for goodness sake. It's almost as though he wants to spread this hatred, and wanting everyone to hate me. I said this because over the past 3 years in school, i saw how he exaggerated things about people, and saw how he made big groups of people dislike a few separate individuals. He even went to the extent of hoping for one to ""suicide"", and even labeling people as ""sins"" - like the legit 7 deadly sins mentioned in the bible, and many people even laughed and joke about it. Whattttttt even...

It could be seen clearly that some people in the company started looking at me differently, like, its so obvious, how they look at you when they talk, the way they talk and some even treated me as transparent! I mean... how could you even just listen to one side of the story and deemed it to be fully true? Truth to be told, It does not really concern me much whether or not I'm 'hated' by this group of colleagues/course mates, because they ain't really my friends to begin with. We're just classmates, internship colleagues, and i honestly do not see myself keeping in contact with them after graduation. 

But what's bothering most right now is whether or not Henry would be influenced by what's going around. As far as i can see, jeremy has been going to people individually, telling them about me, and I wont be surprised if jeremy actually told him. I'm just afraid of losing Henry, or that he might be affected by peer pressure, or influenced. It's not that im close to him now because I've been ""outcasted"", ""ignored"". Nope, thats not the case. I genuinely wanna continue this friendship with him. Its like, my conversations with him really helped me grew, and saw things from a different perspective, and understood alot better towards certain expects in life. I have my own groups of friends outside, a few close buds, outside, but i wanna this friend to be there too. He once said to me how I have been there for him, and asked if this friendship would continue even after graduation. It really made me feel happy, and reassured at that time. But right now, i'm just afraid that he'd be influenced - like how people would go with the flow so they wouldn't be outcasted? I dont know man, how im really feeling right now, but what i feel bugging me most right now is that I'd lose this friend of mine. I dont know man. I dont even know how Im feeling now."

I want to be a new person.",C_fineman,selfesteemsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfesteemsupport/comments/5pmpt5/im_tired_of_being_angry_of_being_sad_of_being/,"I really want to reach out to someone, anyone, about this. I recently got back to school (I go to college), but over the weekend I went to take my ornery mother out grocery shopping. Some people called the house yesterday or that day, I can't remember, and I had no idea who they were. I learned after the fact that they weren't telemarketers. Nonetheless, I told her about it, prompting her to get really pissy with me about how I handled the situation. I told her I didn't know who they were, and she tells me that I ""space out"" or whatever. It seemed like she was implying I wasn't thinking or paying attention. She left the room, and I began to feel a boiling rage inside. I began to imagine all kinds of violent things I wanted to do at the moment. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. For most of the day, my hands were shaking from this pressure I felt inside. 

I then began to think about how tired I was. I have these moments whenever I get really upset where I imagine things I really want to do. I really wanted to run off crying, go to my sister one weekend (she moved out) and just cry to her about everything, or somehow go to someone who I could stay with to tell them everything and they would just give me sanctuary until I could finally get my life in order somehow. 

I know that I talk to myself alot. I have detailed analyses of films and literature with myself. But I also relive upsetting moments with myself. I don't know why. I keep replaying these moments like they're so important to me, but they shouldn't be.

This extends to so many other things. I'm currently studying computer game design, and I need to find an internship somehow. I want to create compelling stories and experiences in games, but I have almost nothing to show for that. I want to work on stuff, but I get distracted easily. I get distracted with thinking about the future and how I feel like I'll never gain any modicum of success because I feel like I have no insight or intelligence on a subject despite enthusiasm for something. I want to learn, but I have trouble sitting down and trying to learn it or even trying to work on something creatively. 

I view myself as two different people. I want so bad to be the other person. I had a hard time growing up, both at school and at home. I wasn't sexually, physically or emotionally abused, but I hated it regardless. All I think about with my past is how much I want to forget about all of it. I want to be a new person. I want to start over and escape to a new place where I can be happy. I can barely think of a time when I was happy for longer than a few days or whatever.

I just can't take it any longer. I'm tired of being strong. I'm tired of hiding my feelings. I'm tired of the pain that I can't seem to just forget about or diminish. I'm tired of all the voices of people in the past reminding me of all the bad things I can't forget. 

If anyone has any help or advice, please reply. I really want it."

For fear of risking my scholarship, I don't work most of the year except for teaching high school bands in the fall and writing their music in the spring (I don't work for many schools so it's far from a full time job). Luckily, I make pretty good money when I am working, and I'm suuuuuuper cheap so whatever money I make doesn't really go anywhere besides paying for car insurance/ maintenance. 

All that being said, I've accumulated roughly $5,000 as of right now. Because my scholarship is actually too much money (since I live at home), the university pays me a refund check for about $800 every semester. My grandmother has a small college fund for all of her grandchildren. Since mine has gone untouched, I have a $2000 ""education"" fund that has to be spent on education or the bank takes 10% (but I've already found the loop hole for that so just call it $2000). The other portion of her college fund was originally invested in a mutual fund for each of us, but mine has since been taken out and put in a CD. The amount in the CD is roughly $4800. So that's a total of $6800 from granny. 

I've been looking into investing my money recently anyway, and it was brought to my attention that foreclosed houses often sell extremely cheap and I might be able to afford to buy one with a friend...sort of. (Finish reading before losing your mind.) It just so happens that I looked around for houses on sale in the area and one of them actually seems like a very good deal. 

The plan is as follows: 
I go to school for Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, so if all goes well, a summer internship should be a net profit of around $5000-6000. That should put me at about $10-11000. The house I'm looking at is $49,900, so $10,000 should cover the down payment. A 10 year mortgage (I try to assume the highest expenses) would be about $400/month. Taxes on the house have been $3800 at most, so budgeting for $4000 makes another $300/month. I've yet to look into home owners insurance rates, electricity rates for the area, or Internet services, so I can't give an estimate on those. Around my school, rent is about $500-800/month plus utilities anyway. It's a 3 bedroom house with a basement, and my friends are talking about moving out soon anyway. Ideally, over the next 4 semesters I could rent a room to 2-3 friends (depending on if the basement is liveable enough for me) for $400-500/month, I think I could more or less live for free or at most on a part time job which would be easy to find in that area, AND I'd be on my way to paying off a house. The house is in an area I wouldn't mind living for a few years too, since there are engineering jobs nearby, so I wouldn't be screwed once we all graduate and they leave. Now FINALLY we get back to my very brief mention of investing that you already forgot about. After I'm done paying off the house in a few years, I could A.) Stay there as long as I have work OR B.) Move out and rent it to the next college kid that comes along since it's right next to a rapidly growing  university.

So, now that you've read my plan, I'd love to hear some thoughts. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I need to hear what I need to hear; not what I want to believe. It just really seems like a good deal to me the more I think about it.

It has come apparent to me that all job searching sites are awful. Or maybe that's just me becoming cynical after applying so much. I feel like I have to do work some nontechnical job for experience before getting a job I want. What else can I do?

5pnb1y,3,2017-01-23,Security Clearance? Also maybe lacking experience?,dwarfneedsbeer,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/5pnb1y/security_clearance_also_maybe_lacking_experience/,"Hello everyone, I know this might be a little long, and I apologies for rambling, but thanks for taking the time to read. Any help is much appreciated! 

I am a recent graduate and I have been applying literally everywhere I can in my industry. I'm a 3D artist and been applying to anywhere I seem fit in a position. Game studios, outsourcing places, tech companies, engineering places, etc... Most of these places I am applying to (especially in my area, Florida) are doing some sort of simulation work for the government. Mostly training programs like flight sims.

Anyway, since most of these places work with the government they require a security clearance. I never have needed one in the past since I only really have been a student, but I don't even have a traffic ticket to my name so there is no reason I should be denied one either. And of course, I was born in the US. But most of these places on the application ask it in the way as if you say no, you are also saying that you would denied one if you tried to get one. There is no ""No, but I can get one"" option. It is either ""yes or no"". The other day I got a rejection saying that I seem talented, but they need a security clearance day one. And I feel this maybe one of the only companies I applied to that has the common courtesy to email me back as to why I am being rejected. And I am I worried that most of these places that I have been applying to for the past few weeks that need a security clearance have rejected me already. 

I asked one of my professors I had who worked in simulation before becoming a teacher, and he said he dealt with this in the past, and that companies that need security clearances help new employees obtain one. So what do I do? Again, about 99% of the jobs that I applied for work with the government that need a security clearance ask ""Do you have a security clearance?"" or ""What level of security clearance do you have?"". There was maybe one or two that asked  ""Would you be denied a security clearance? Yes or no?"" which is the way I feel these places should be asking. Especially since the only way it seems to get one is by having a job prior that also needed one, or having the company help you get one when you start working there. Not when you are unemployed.

I also worry as to if I am lacking experience. I feel like I am, even though I match what they want on the application. I have a BAS in Digital Media, and my portfolio shows I know what they are asking for. My job experience is most likely lacking though. I worked as a freelance graphic designer from December 2014 - January 2016 for a small company on and off. Didn't work enough to be required to pay taxes, but still I worked for somebody. And I had a 5 month long internship back in high school. That's about it. But that shouldn't matter to be considered for these entry level 3D jobs now should it?

Do I really need to take the time to try and get a fast food job just to write down a place I have worked for even though I went to school studying the subject for 4 years, have a letter of recommendation, and have a portfolio backing up what I know and am able to accomplish what the company desires? I'm considering that (even though it sounds stupid) might be the best thing to do, and I guess work on my portfolio on the side. Or maybe use my unemployed time to work on my portfolio full time. But for these entry level places I don't think my portfolio is the issue. I think its my lack of having a job in the past, and not having a security clearance at the moment.

Also, another thing (sorry) is where I live an issue? I live in south Florida, about two hours away from Orlando where most of these jobs I applied to are. Is that too far? I mean, if I got a job I would drive there every day until I found a place local if the job was promising. But the company might not like that. I also applied to places out of state, but stated in my cover letters that I was more than happy to move myself there. Would that still be something they would reject me for?  

Have you guys have any advice about the security clearance issue I am having? Or about my lack of experience and what to do? I don't like feeling unemployed. I feel guilty about not working during college. I was a full time student taking 5-6 classes a semester. I did finish earlier than I was supposed to, and I had one of the better portfolios in my class by graduation. I feel guilty, but I still think taking the time to focus on projects, and learn things on your own that will be useful in your future career seems better than flipping burgers just to be able to write down some place you worked at. But it is obviously hurting me now than benefiting me. 

Thanks everyone, again sorry for rambling. 

TL;DR I am being rejected for not having a security clearance even though I can get one. Also, I think I don't have enough experience.

I'm currently a 21 year old male from New Jersey about to finish a B.S in Business Administration (It seems this degree is very common in Europe) with concentrations in Accounting &amp; Finance (At my school the credit amount is the same as a major). 

Some details about me:

- Studied Abroad in London - January to May 2015
- No relevant work experience (sadly, internship was hars to come by)
- Great cumulitive GPA (for the difficulty of my courses) 3.68 (3.7 est at grad)
- Beginner's level French (Can read decently and write, speaking is hard for me)
- Hopes to build $5,000 worth of savings.
- Plans to learn programming and coding languages from friend and become fluent in a year. 
- Has a few connections abroad through friends met at British school. 
- Is enrolled in 5 yr grad plan but plans to drop out to get degree abroad. (Has taken a few courses however.)
- No job offers currently but working on it (I dislike Big 4)
- Set to go to Guatemala to help rebuild an elementary school. 

I plan on using this all as signs of my willingness to naturalise if I decided to move out of the US. 

---------

Places I want to look into:

- Dublin 
- London (pipe dream, the pay I heard is not good)
- Prague (If I can become a good coder and find an American company)
- Vancouver
- Krakow (For fun, who knows!)
- Austrailia (If I get my CPA, as it is valid there)

What shoukd be my first steps? I do not see myself happy in the US and am not attached to the idea of a CPA. Want to spend my youth somewhere else and will do anything to adapt.

5pqb56,1,2017-01-23,[M4F] Mandi's Hardship,travel_a_lot,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/5pqb56/m4f_mandis_hardship/,"Mandi knocked on the door softly—three quick raps, as instructed—and waited for the door to open. Her financial situation forced her to get her own side-hustle to support her teenage daughter's modeling aspirations as well as support her minor drug habit. Being a licensed massage therapist paid well between the hours of 9am to 5pm, but she could make so much more traveling to hotels and houses giving extra special massages. Sure, sometimes things got out of hand, but with enough cash money in her hand to pay for a bump of coke, an order of Plan B, and more photography sessions for her daughter, it all seemed worth it.

Mandi and her daughter Hope were a team ever since she was born. Hope's father was an intern on a diplomatic visa who became reassigned the day after he and Mandi met. Mandi was the tour guide of her high school when his delegation came through to learn about well funded education programs. They were both young, and sparks flew. They only had one night of passion together in a mid-range hotel funded by his internship, and after going through the trial pack of three condoms, they decided their last fuck in the shower the next morning would probably be fine without one. I mean, after so many orgasms the night before, how much semen could he produce? 

As it turns out, it was just enough. 

Mandi was 16 when she got pregnant, and 17 when she had Hope. She never told him about Hope because she was afraid that a statutory accusation would ruin his career. Mandi knew her life was going to be chaotic, but she desperately wanted to be a mom, even at an early age. She lived with her mother who was stable enough to help her out during the early years, which is what kept her off the street as a teenager. That was, until the accident. 

Mandi and Hope had been on their own for the last ten years, and the inheritance that her mother left her was nearly gone. It went mostly to a house, a reliable car, photography sessions for Hope, and maybe just a little going up her nose. Hope was tall, like her father, and had a desirable body for modeling. Mandi never went to the photography sessions and Hope never complained. She assumed Hope could take care of herself, but sometimes wondered why she looked so flushed when she came back. Mandi ignored it and assumed all must be well.

Mandi saw a shadow in the peephole and the door softly open. ""Mandi?"" called a deep voice from behind the crack in the door. ""Hi, are you Jack?"" she said softly, feeling more uncomfortable and exposed with every passing minute as she stood in the hallway.

The door opened wide enough to let her through and close behind her. As she let her eyes adjust to the dim light of the room, she saw that Jack was wearing a robe, but hadn't bothered to tie it tightly. She saw his ample cock dangling between his legs framed by equally impressive testicles that she assumed she would be getting intimate with. *So, it's one of these.*

""Thanks for coming, Mandi, especially on such short notice. I've left your donation on the table. Why don't you make yourself more comfortable. The bathroom is over there,"" Jack motioned with his eyes.

The room was large, like a suite, and Jack walked over to the chair to sit down. There was a table next to it with a half-empty bottle of whiskey and what appeared to be a small pile of cocaine, and a very expensive looking camera sitting on a tripod pointing at the couch. Jack sat down in the chair, poured himself some whiskey, and sat back making no attempt to cover himself as his robe fell to the side, his uncut cock flopping around before finally coming to rest on his leg. He sipped his whiskey then looked over to Mandi and raised his eyebrows as if to say, *Come on now, the clock is ticking.*

Good evening RPers. I'm looking for a long term RP partner (but could do this one in a short term play if you like) to play Mandi, and/or potentially Hope. We can discuss ages in a PM before getting started. I wrote this in third person, but can do first if it works. To make this more AgePlay appropriate, we can change Mandi to Hope's older sister (who had to raise her for whatever hardship reason). We can discuss more in PM.

This can go in a number of different directions. Mandi is here because she placed an ad as an erotic massage provider, and Jack called her. Perhaps you want to just turn me into a regular client or work out some kind of a financial arrangement? Or maybe you assume I am a modeling agent and want me to meet Hope, and more. Maybe you offer to make some videos for extra cash, you or you ask me for a job at my company. 

I'd prefer to discuss up front before jumping in, so PM me. We can iron out ages or other plot lines that you want.

As mentioned in the title, I am a fresh CNA with little experience. The only experience I gained was through my month-long internship at a nursing home. I chose PM shift because I want to take classes at a CC soon and wouldn't want it to conflict with my work hours as much. I'm still going through the hiring process, but I was placed on Med/Surg/Telemetry and I should be called in for my orientation soon. 

I asked my interviewer what my biggest challenge would be on my first day and she said time management and organization. She said I would be assisting many Vietnamese and Korean elderly who are very respectful. She even added that I will definitely feel frustrated; and when things feel a bit crappy, don't focus on that but instead look at the bigger picture. Seems like she's mentally preparing me for it. 

I'm eager to gain experience and to learn a lot, but in all honesty I'm fighting my paranoia of not having good coworkers and of being berated since I'm a newbie. Any advice/tips on what to expect in a hospital setting (specifically med/Surg/tel) as a fresh CNA (and any other helpful advice) would be very much appreciated. "
5pqqhz,19,2017-01-23,Is it possible to be unhireable or am I doing this all wrong?,NotEhnotherThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pqqhz/is_it_possible_to_be_unhireable_or_am_i_doing/,"I'll try to keep this nice and short for everyone and thanks ahead of time for taking your time to read this. So I graduated in June of 2016 from a large state university in the US, and I'm a US citizen trying to land a software engineer role. My first month after graduating I knew I wouldn't be staying in the city I graduated because jobs here are pretty bad. With that being said I took a month to travel to some popular cities who's job markets are better. I've decided to look in NYC and LA and have applied to 300+ positions in the past few months while keeping a job as a bartender and a server just to pay the bills.

Now I've always had a job since I was 15 and went from Dishwasher -&gt;Banquet Server -&gt;Head Server -&gt;Bartender, in the 9 years I've been working. I got my degree in CS because I really like coding and everything about this field is awesome and I'm still very excited about getting my first job. Everyone who asks me what I got my degree in always has a shocked look on their face when I mention I still don't have a job in my field, and frankly if I go back in time and tell myself I wouldn't have a job in my field 8 months after graduation I would laugh at myself because everyone says how great jobs are in this field. I even had an internship at a large bank, although it was a pretty bad internship where they didn't have me do much there, I still took some time to learn new coding languages.

I was never a great student when it came to tests because I'm bad a regurgitating information without notes or anything to look at and I graduated with a wonderful 2.4 GPA, so for obvious reasons that won't be going on my resume. When it came to projects or coding assignments I always did well on them, and occasionally would have added features that weren't listed in the project description. Since I've always had a job I've also not had much time to do side projects and even now I work 40+ hours a week to pay bills and student loans. I've had my resume repeatedly looked over and I even made a personal website for myself thinking that would help, but still no luck. As of right now, I've had 0 phone calls and 2 coding exercises which I did okay on, the first one I didn't manage my time well but had 2/3 of it correct, and the second I got completely correct but they emailed back a few days later saying thanks but no thanks.

I'm really excited to start in this field and I can't wait to do so but getting emails every day saying ""thanks but..."" is really discouraging. I'm applying to any and all software engineer roles, other than senior roles and I just don't understand how I haven't landed a single interview yet. I don't have anything on my GitHub other than my personal website (school projects had to be stored in private repositories because my school likes to re-use assignments) but on my resume, a few of my projects for school are listed on there with features that weren't required but I added on the side. So other than working on side projects or open source projects is there anything I can do that'll make this job hunt easier? I'm really getting discouraged along with getting stressed out about this and I worry about my future. I know if I am just given a chance at any company I can and I will work my ass off for that check every week. Thanks again for reading this and I hope everyone has a great day!"

Is it okay to post this sale listing on reddit btw? 



Here are the details.

This is a used Wacom Drawing Tablet (Small). It comes in all of its original packaging. and its condition is like new. The serial number is pictured for authenticity. 

I used it for about 4 weeks in the latter half of my internships at a design firm, and I kept it well protected in an 11"" slim laptop case, which I will also be willing to include. It is from Amazon.


I am basically selling it because I don't need it anymore/it is inefficient (believe it or not) in my new setup. I don't draw, I only used it to edit stuff. I recently bought the new MacBook Pro with its enormous trackpad, its the exact size of the pen area of the Wacom Tablet. Anyways, I got way too used to the keyboard, key commands, and the trackpad so much that the need for the drawing tablet no longer made any sense.

5prfgn,34,2017-01-23,"Me [35F] with my husband [30M] of 3 years, his ex [25F] keeps reaching out to him.",HarpoonDoucheCanoe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5prfgn/me_35f_with_my_husband_30m_of_3_years_his_ex_25f/,"I (35F) have been married to Steven (30M) for three years. We met six years ago at work when he was recently broken up with his college GF, Elizabeth (25F). We slept together pretty fast and were FWB but sometimes he would deny me, saying he missed Elizabeth too much. I understood because the breakup was recent. We both moved to different places after a few months, but kept in touch via letters, phone calls, texting and visiting. I know he visited Elizabeth at least once during this period, but after their visit he said it was over. After a year we decided to get more serious and moved in together. We fell in love and after two years of dating I proposed to him on top of a mountain. He said yes and we began planning a wedding. At one point, Elizabeth was visiting their old college town and asked him if he wanted to meet up. I told him it was up to him if we wanted to go, but that it would hurt my feelings. He decided not to go which made me feel like he truly cared for my feelings, until I read his texts with her and he had said “I can’t meet you because I’m worried I’ll be thinking about you naked the whole time”. My heart completely sank. I mean, I’m glad he didn’t go, but he clearly still harbored feelings for her at that time. We worked through it and continued on with the wedding, which was absolutely beautiful followed by a vacation in the tropics. I’ve never been so happy and forgot about her. 

Following our return from home, Steven had a facebook message from, of course, Elizabeth. She congratulated him on our marriage. At this point I feel like she is intruding. She knows hes married now, why does she keep trying to talk to him? I asked him to block her on facebook and he did. I noticed shortly after that she blocked me on facebook, which is weird because we’ve never had any interaction before. 

One year into marriage and things are going great. We bought a home, have a few farm animals and are enjoying a settled life. Then we hear from Elizabeth again. Her text says something like “Hey Steven, just thought I’d let you know that my fiancé and I will be in the Northwest for my internship and it would be great to get together if you can”. Steven didn’t respond. 

Our life has continued to be going well and I truly believe Steven is happy and we are soulmates. Our life has been Elizabeth free until last week, when I got a message on my Instagram account from Elizabeth saying something to the extent of “I got an Instagram request from Steven and I figured it was you because he has me blocked on facebook. I just wanted to say that it makes me a little uncomfortable for you both to be looking at my social media, hope you understand”. I confronted Steven and he said the request must have been an accident, which I believe because he rarely uses social media. I responded back telling her that “Steven hasn’t been on Instagram in over a year and was looking through ‘people you may know’. He asked me how private profiles work and since yours was right there I showed him the message that non-followers see. He must have accidentally clicked follow. I am sorry that makes you feel uncomfortable, we just aren’t great with tech stuff. Neither of us would like to follow you.” All true. 
She responded “Are you sure your husband didn’t purposely follow me because he was thinking of me?”

I responded “Oh sweetheart, I don’t dislike you, I have no reason to. We haven’t had to talk about you since the last time you awkwardly messaged him to visit. Move on…he did five years ago”. Then I blocked her. At this point, I’m done being nice. 
I am livid but Steven doesn’t seem to think it’s as big of a problem as me. I think she is continually intruding into our life when Steven has ignored her for years. It’s time for her to move on. How long will we have to keep dealing with this? Is there anything I can do besides block her? 

TL;DR: Husband’s ex girlfriend keeps trying to talk to him despite no response from my husband. What can we do

5prjh1,1128,2017-01-23,[OC] How Diplomatic,daeomec,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5prjh1/oc_how_diplomatic/,"The alien invasion couldn’t wait till the end of the year? I was two months away from a cushy ambassadorship in a resort world. *Two months.* But no, the crazy bastards had to start their plan for galactic domination just before I retired. Which was why I'd been woken up at two in the morning by blaring sirens and a military escort. Wonderful.

“Assistant Secretary,” said the stern-faced soldier. Normally, young people in my bedroom were cause for celebration, but I had a feeling he wouldn’t take kindly to a proposition. “There’s an emergency.”

“Well, isn’t that nice? I hadn’t guessed at all.” I stumbled out of bed and grabbed my fuzzy bathrobe. “Now, give me a moment to change—”

“There’s no time. Come this way.” Thus, I was manhandled out of my quarters and shoved into a nice, armored vehicle. 

“So,” I drawled out, wrinkling my nose at the gray interior of the car, “what’s the emergency?”

He didn’t respond.

At this point, the sleep had mostly left me, and the nerves were beginning to kick in. If the cookie-cutter soldiers—ones that were different from the usual bodyguards—were refusing to share even *gossip*... then it was more serious than I’d thought.

I shifted in place. “The Wenm/Ir-Nohv haven’t actually attacked, have they?” 

The Wenm/Ir-Nohv, a group of psychopathic alien warlords, had quickly burned their way across the known galaxy.  The Goidj and the North-Central Confederation had already fallen, but there were a few more civilizations between them and us. At least, there *had* been a few civilizations between us. 

As expected, the soldiers didn’t respond. We soon arrived at the planetary military base, and I was again manhandled through the dusty hallways and to a very tense-looking war room.

“Assistant Secretary Lucia Weber,” sneered the brass-covered man at the front of the room. “Thank you for joining us.” He looked my fuzzy robe up and down, and his frown grew bigger. 

“I appreciate it, General Collins!” I snagged a coffee from a terrified baby-intern. “What’s going on?” I took my seat next to my colleague Vasiliev, the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. He grunted at me, and I grunted back.

“The Oieyee Republic has fallen. Our ambassador has been taken hostage, and they have already declared war on us.” The general looked unexpectedly solemn. “The worst-case scenario has been realized. The Wenm/Ir-Nohv are likely to attack humanity in less than a week.”

My head snapped back to the front of the room at that. Well, fuck. 

***** 

Everyone had erupted into cacophony.

“We should declare war!” declared one over-enthusiastic colonel.

“Are you crazy?” Vasiliev shouted back. He’d had enough coffee to make him talkative. “They’ll eat us alive! The Wenm/Ir-Nohv’s military capability is more than ten times ours!”

I flipped through the dossier on the Wenm/Ir-Nohv, but I didn’t find anything new. (Probably because I’d written it.) I’d spent the last few months frantically gathering information on them, and everything I’d learned had led me to the one conclusion.

The Wenm/Ir-Nohv were, in some ways, similar to humans. Except that they were way more terrifying. Exceptionally terrifying. If I was to take my deepest, darkest nightmare and stick it on steroids, it still wouldn’t be as scary as the Wenm/Ir-Nohv. 

Fifteen feet tall, incredibly fast, incredibly strong, with claws, venom, and teeth that would make the saber-tooth tiger weep, they were lethal killing machines. Their homeworld was the definition of death-world.  But that wasn’t the worst of it. It was actually pretty par for the universe. 

What made the Wenm/Ir-Nohv scary was the fact that they were *smart*. All of their intellect had been focused into one thing: war. Us humans might have written *The Art of War,* but their children could come up with tactics that would put Sun Tzu to shame.

Even worse, their weaponry was crazy advanced. As I said, they were like us. The Wenm/Ir-Nohv had nukes before they had spaceflight. Actually, they had antimatter weaponry before they had spaceflight. Hell, they didn’t even *have* spaceflight until the Goidj were stupid enough to give them some! (Ah, Goidj. They always did have their heads up their fifteen asses. It’s a miracle they hadn’t fallen to natural selection sooner.) 

The Wenm/Ir-Nohv took to the stars like a shark to water, and they immediately began eating all the little fish in the ocean. And we were next. For once in our existence, the smartest minds of humanity—military people, diplomats, and scientists alike—all agreed on one thing. We were utterly and royally fucked.

The argument had died down. Some stared blankly, others fidgeted in place, and a few people were crying.

“So what do we do now?” murmured the same, coffee-less intern, voice quavering.

I closed the file. “We could try negotiating.”

That ended the stupor. Everyone began talking all at once, some in favor, some not. Vasiliev, who was in vehement agreement, was just about to throw his mug across the room, while the colonel looked about ready to have an aneurysm. 

The general laughed, his booming voice cutting through the noise. “We might as well,” he mused, voice thick with dark humor. “We don’t have many other options. Well, Madam Secretary, I’m sure you’d appreciate leading the delegation. Unless there’s any objections?”

He looked around the room, and I did, too. I tried to catch the eye of my boss, but he was studiously looking in the other direction. Coward.

I gritted my teeth. “Sure. Why not?

Damn. I’d just postponed my retirement, hadn’t I?

****

“They’re gonna kill us! They’re gonna eat us all—” Ambassador Arroz started screaming incoherently as several Oieyee were ripped apart. “We have to surre—”

I snapped my fingers, and the recording stopped. 

“Well,” I said mildly, “that’s what is at stake. Unless you want to be the next poor fools that're killed as an example, then we better study the shit out of them. We’ve negotiated good deals before. There’s no reason we can’t do it again.”

“Other than the fact that they’re a bloodthirsty, violent race that’s rampaged through the known galactic civilizations?” The colonel scoffed. “I doubt that asking them *nicely* will keep the Wenm/Ir-Nohv from killing us.”

I shrugged. “Has anyone tried?”

Everyone was silent for a moment.

“Well,” said Vasiliev slowly, “The Goidj gave them spaceships and tried to make them slaves. Then the Wenm/Ir-Nohv slaughtered them all and made *them* slaves.”

I frowned. “The North-Central Confederation declared war on them immediately after, since they were allies with the Goidj.”

“The Oieyee ruling council fled, and there was no government capable of negotiating when the Wenm/Ir-Nohv showed up,” piped up the intern.

We stared at each other. Even the war-hungry colonel seemed thoughtful.

“There’s no harm in trying,” I said finally. “It’s not like we can make things worse.” I clapped my hands, feeling hopeful for the first time since the morning. “We have seven days before they arrive. Alright, team! Let’s get to work!”

****

My team and I had used the week to study everything about the Wenm/Ir-Nohv. What they needed, what they ate, what they liked, *everything.* We’d pieced together their language and customs from their videos, and every single person on that delegation was fluent in Wenm/Ir-Nohv-ese by the time we landed on their mothership.

 The human treatment, as I liked to call it, was standard course for whenever we encountered a new alien species. This time, we did it with a little more desperation than usual. Know your enemy, am I right?

After our tiny, unarmed shuttle landed in the enormous Wenm/Ir-Nohv mothership, we were roughly grabbed and shoved to the grand “greeting room” of their warlord. The man bared his fangs at us, jutting his lower jaw at us. I suddenly knew how prey species felt when we smiled at them.

“Weak/Not-strong humans,” rumbled the warlord, “will be received with peace/not-danger. But for little/not-long. Why should we treat you with mercy/not-war?”

(The Wenm/Ir-Nohv spoke with a language of opposites. Almost every adjective and the occasional noun was accompanied by the negation of its antonym. Hence the slashes. It was weird, but whatever. Chinese was harder to learn. I simplified the dialogue a little for convenience. Not too much, because fuck you. Suffer along with me.)

I stuck out my own lower jaw, feeling stupid and uncomfortable, and tilted back my head to expose my neck. Slowly, I sunk to my knees, and the members of my delegation did the same.

“Oh, merciful/not-cruel warlord,” I simpered back, taking care to growl the words, “your honor/not-shame displays your intellect/not-stupidity. Hence we come to you, crouched down like the weak/not-strong creatures we are. Will you deign to share drink and bread, so we may discuss the terms/not-demands of our joining/not-war?”

I’d used the ritual opening that their weaker tribes used when joining a stronger one. It was a gamble, since I’d stolen this from one of the Wenm/Ir-Nohv’s TV shows. 

The warlord stared at us for a moment. Then, he began stamping his feet against his chair, hooting with what I hoped was glee. Or at least amusement.

“These weak/not-strong humans know where they stand! Welcome/not-threat and eat, so we may discuss your joining/not-war.” 

***** 

The next night, I called the President from the Wenm/Ir-Nohv’s ship, trying to ignore my fierce hangover.

“Hello?” I mumbled into the long-distance comms. “Madam President? We’ve come to an agreement with the Wenm/Ir-Nohv.”

The President’s normally frosty tone was taut with apprehension. “Well? What are their terms? We aren’t going to war, are we?”

“No, thankfully. They’ve agreed to accept a peaceful, non-violent surrender.”

“What do they want? Disarmament?” said a different, raspy voice. Ah, so it was a conference call! Lovely. With the pounding of my head, I’d have difficulty distinguishing the voices.

I shook my head, forgetting that they couldn’t see me. “Um, no,” I replied belatedly. “We can keep our weapons.”

“New leadership?” The President (or was that the general?) didn’t sound happy. Which made sense, considering that she’d be the one to lose out.

“Don’t worry, Madam President. You can keep your job. The rest of you can, too.”

My boss spoke up, now. His high-pitched voice cut right through the fog in my head. “We aren’t slaves, are we? Don’t tell me we’re going the way of the Goidj.”

I couldn’t help the smug smile. “Nope. We retain our planet and our freedom.”

“Then what are the terms?” snapped the President. Well, I may have pushed it a little too far. I decided to take pity and tell them everything. I’d be a little tense, too, if I didn’t know the fate of my species. 

“We’re vassals. We’ll pay tribute to the Wenm/Ir-Nohv every year for a decade, and then we’re raised to full clan status. Which means equal rights for us in the multiple eyes of the Wenm/Ir-Nohv.”

A short silence.

“That’s it? What’s the catch? What do they want for tribute?” The general seemed a bit skeptical. Well, really skeptical. I didn’t really blame him. If I hadn’t lived it myself, I wouldn’t have believed it.

“A bit of money and natural resources.” I yawned, still exhausted from last night. If there was one thing that the Wenm/Ir-Nohv did better than warmongering, it was partying. “The deal they gave us is standard for Wenm/Ir-Nohv vassal, er, clans. They’d normally ask for soldiers, too, but they want something different from us.”

I paused for dramatic effect, which was ruined by my second yawn. The people on the other end weren’t as amused, but I’d just saved humanity. Sue me.

“What is it?” said my boss, resigned to my attitude.

“They want us to be their ambassadors and negotiate with other governments and species for surrender. Apparently, most species are too intimidated to properly talk to the Wenm/Ir-Nohv, and we seem to have a knack for it. They were really impressed by us. Hell, they were really impressed by *Ambassador Arroz*, despite the whole screaming thing. He's on the ship, you know?”

Another silence. Man, I was on a roll!

“You’re telling me that they gave us a really phenomenal deal because they were impressed by how we surrendered?” the President said slowly. 

“Of course. Why wouldn’t they?” I smiled. “We asked nicely.”"

I almost quit today and feel like I am going to quit in the following weeks. Here's a list of reasons:
- Exhausting hours; I have to literally escape the office to find some time to eat, go to the gym, do laundry, etc;

- Salary is shit;

- I don't learn anything anymore, instead I teach others. Interns and assistants are slow learners and I have to review everything.  I told management, said I am slower because I have to keep and eye on them. Got told that I need to learn how to work with the new generation (they are at most two years younger than me);

- Manager doesn't even review my work. I have to literally explain point by point the night before we present our results to clients;

- Internal compliance is following me like a shadow. Almost everyday I am audited for expenses. They never find anything, and the only result is that my expenses are refunded at least a week later they were supposed to, due to this audit.

So, I find it hard, but maybe it's time to quit. I really like the office and I enjoyed it a lot, but for the reasons said above, I am really considering quitting."
5prx1r,0,2017-01-23,I am becoming increasingly worried about being able to graduate and the administration is working against my best interests.,HAL__Over__9000,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5prx1r/i_am_becoming_increasingly_worried_about_being/,"Alright, so there's a lot to unpack here. I'll start with some background.

I chose to go to a small college because I wanted to have a more personal experience. I thought I would be able to have a closer relationship with my professors and the administration. I was a little worried I might get lost in the shuffle of a large university. There were a few unique aspects of where I chose to go: the dorms were unlocked during the day, the school was in a rural town, and they were on a 4-1-4 schedule (two semesters with a J-term for the month of January where one takes a single class). 

Freshman year was bad. Despite doing very well academically in high school, even with 5 AP classes, I struggled. Partially because I was bored with the writing class and the chemistry and the math, partially because I really struggled to make any friends. The first J-term was really exciting, I did really well and it was overall really enjoyable. But I didn't like that they started locking the dorms. It somewhat ironically made me feel less safe. However, what annoyed me the most was that they wouldn't give me an answer as to why and when I asked they treated me like a little kid. Spring semester was a little better but I still considered transferring. I chose not to because I felt my complaints would have been found elsewhere. It seemed more of an issue with college itself rather than the particular school. The professors were great and I did make a couple friends. 

Sophomore year started out really great and somewhere along the line it all came crashing down. I started to do worse and worse in organic chemistry, the girl I liked turned me down, and then when I started taking my antidepressants less often I really kinda crashed. I ended up withdrawing from Orgo and taking spring semester off. Now, I worked and went to a community college so I wouldn't fall completely behind. I chose to go back because I couldn't imagine how hard it would be to restart making friends and learn a whole new area. Plus, when I was really upset I sent out an email about I wanted to go to Star Wars but couldn't find a ride. People were so nice, telling me about nearby areas, someone even put a Time magazine with an article about The Force Awakens in my mailbox. That meant a lot, I felt finding a community that kind would be hard to find. Plus I felt the dorm situation was what was really making things bad. 

Anyway, originally I wanted to live off campus and the Dean of students told me to do XYZ, but when I did XYZ she told me I couldn't.  I chose a single room in a quiet dorm as a compromise. 

Anyway, things started out alright, I even managed to get out of having to take a foreign language. But one thing I was planning on was taken away. I had planned to go to Italy for J-term but I was taken off that trip because I got mad and snapped at someone bullying me. Meanwhile the person harassing me for away with everything and was basically rewarded. That hurt a lot. The more I learned about the situation the more I learned how poorly it was handled.   

Anyway, here I am, not in Italy and failing a chemistry class. If I don't pass I can't graduate on time. I could take a summer class but then that would rule out having an internship this year and of course it's expensive. I don't know what to do. I'm a Junior, so dropping out now is hard and will probably end up being more experience. Staying here is hard because the administration doesn't respect me and is working against me trying to do my best. I want to live off campus next year, but the same dean is in charge and she had shown she doesn't emphasize or care about my well being in the slightest. 

Hoping for some advice, similar experiences, or any thing that could help, thanks.

Edit: more on Italy https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5maqm8/i_came_here_hoping_i_would_be_able_to_have_a/?sort=confidence

Also, TL;DR: I am super depressed and feeling really lost. College is hard and I don't know if I can graduate on time. Meanwhile the administration is working against my well being. "

5ps4m6,207,2017-01-23,"Three years ago, I began teaching myself how to code for the sake of building my own websites and apps. This was during college. Now, I work in SF as a Full Stack Software Engineer. This is my quick list.",DavidIlizarov,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5ps4m6/three_years_ago_i_began_teaching_myself_how_to/,"A lot of people ask me where to get started, or what they need to do to build iOS apps, Android apps, and websites. When I started, all I cared about was the ""User Experience Stack"" as I call it. That means having a website, iOS and Android App.

Feel free to ask me anything.

Also, if you're so inclined, there are bootcamps like App Academy you could go through too. Instead of an internship one summer, I opted to do that instead which helped me a bit in learning Ruby on Rails. It was a great experience, but the most important thing I got from it was that it takes a lot of determination and you're basically teaching yourself for at least 9 hours a day for 3 months. There are of course TAs if you have questions, but really, your peers and the internet are your best source.

**The internet has everything you need. I will not give you resources to go to... aside from this subreddit and Stackoverflow. I will give you the order in which you learn these things. Learning them is up to you.**

I only used one book in all my learning and that was this [Algorithms book by Sedgewick](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), a leader in the field. I also took courses on Coursera for algorithms.

The following is my list of things in order, and then why I recommend you learn things in this order.

1. Java - **OPTIONAL, but recommended** If you have no experience and know no language. More details later.
2. Ruby
3. Git
4. Ruby on Rails - SQL, HTML, CSS is learned here too.
5. Hosting on Heroku
6. Javascript
7. React.js
8. Android (Java required)
9. iOS with Swift

**Note:** I did not at any point list Algorithms or Data Structures. There isn't really a set time to learn them. What is your goal? Are you just trying to build your own things? Are you looking for a job in the future? Personally, while learning Java, I recommend you learn about different Data Structures and Algorithms. By applying them and reading the code behind them, you will learn a lot about problem solving and different ways of thinking in code. An exercise in Ruby and Java should be to implement different Algorithms and Data Structures. **Again, this is completely optional and might stress you out, burn you out, and not feel fun because you aren't actually building anything. Do this whenever you want. At some point, depending on what you want to achieve, you'll find yourself wanting to know this stuff. If you want a reputable job, you will definitely need this.**


#Why would I learn the things on this list?... What are the things on this list? I don't know any of these words... O_O

###Java

If you don't know Java, have never programmed, or are just getting started, then I recommend Java 100%. I think Java is on the crossroads of ""This shit sucks, and is way too verbose and complicated"", and ""Wow, this is so nice and simple."" Java will teach you about Object-Oriented Programming, which is a paradigm you'll encounter everywhere. You need to understand it. You'll also be forced to think about types. ""Is this a number? Is this a word? Is this a true/false? Is this something else?"" Further, Java has control-flow that you'll encounter in other languages. You may encounter them in different ways (iterate an array with a for-loop in Java, versus using the each method in Ruby), but Java's is the de-facto understood way of talking about them. Everyone knows for-loops, while-loops, etc. There isn't semantic sugar in that regard. Java is also an amazing language for interviews and to learn Data Structures and Algorithms in.

### Ruby

Much simpler than Java. Easier to read. Easier to write. Less things to think about. You no longer care if something is a number or word. Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? That is for you to decide. This is the start of web development for you. Feel comfortable with this language. Do some Object-Oriented stuff with it. Why Ruby over Python? This is a long talk. Ultimately it is my preference and Ruby on Rails is one of the largest web dev frameworks out there. Python is a lot more multi-purpose in that sense. It is used a lot scientifically for different applications. I also think Ruby reads easier, but again... that is all personal preference.

### Git

This is pretty important. Version control keeps your code safe if you accidentally screw things up. Git can get complicated really quickly. Get started with Github. Make an account. Then, when you have a project you want to work on, create a Repository there for your project. The commands you should know are `add`, `clone`, `push`, `pull`, `diff`, `remote`, `commit`, `status`, and `branch`. Branching is useful. Again, Git is huge and you can do tons of things... but usually you don't need to do much of any of that. While working, in your terminal you'll do things like `git add -A`, and then `git commit -m ""This is a message describing the work I've done so far""`. Then, `git push my-remote my-branch`. For group work, also read about pull-requests. Git is useful to have. Try to get used to it. If you wanna live life dangerously though, by all means move ahead, lol.

### Ruby on Rails

This one is important. A lot to learn here. First off, I have always used Ruby on Rails 4.1. If you start with Ruby on Rails 5, that is great, but at some point I feel they're over-engineering certain aspects of it. A talk for another time. Ruby on Rails follows the MVC architecture. Model-View-Controller. Someone goes to your website and gets connected to an action in the controller. There, you decide what to do. You'll probably talk to a model or two about data needed or data that needs to be processed. Then, you'll give that person back a view, or some data as JSON. Don't understand what I just said? That is okay. But, at some point, come back and see if you understand it. If you do, congrats, you're learning! Also, note. I won't go over it, but Gems are libraries in Ruby. You will use many gems that help enrich your product (so you don't have to write the code yourself!) In fact, Ruby on Rails is bunch of gems itself.

## Order of Learning Ruby on Rails

1. Models. If you have a website about dogs and cats, you might have a Dog model and a Cat model. Mess with that. Understand that generally, a Dog and a Cat will have their own tables in a database. How do you get data from that database? What if an Owner has a Dog. What is this relationship? How do we define this relationship? Can a Dog have multiple Owners? What attributes do we care about regarding the Dog? You do not need to know SQL, the language you use to talk to and get data from databases, to mess with models. SQL is abstracted away by ActiveRecord, Ruby on Rail's ORM. What is that? You should figure that out. I recommend learning SQL Basics, so that you can understand what happens under the hood. It will also help a lot when debugging. Learn about Database transactions. Learn about atomic actions. Are atomic actions important? Learn about race conditions. What kinds of validations can stop that? Database migrations... database constraints... model validations... Models are a big topic. Understand them. One more quick question... What if a Dog has many Owners and an Owner has many Dogs? Figure out how to handle this relationship... You may need a DogOwner model. What does that mean? Also, I recommend always using PostgreSQL as your database. Eventually, for different uses... you may discover MongoDB. When starting off though, get your Ruby on Rails project integrated with PostgreSQL so that you use that on both Heroku (where you will be forced to use it) and on your local machine.

2. Controllers. You will have a `routes.rb` file which is responsible for taking someone from `yourwebsite.com/amazing_cats` to some Controller's action. An action is simply a Ruby method. It is just semantics. Maybe you'll have a `CatsController`, with an `index` action to show a list of cats. Learn what CRUD means. Learn what RESTful APIs are. What are APIs? RESTful APIs are all about your Controllers. Do you need to 100% adhere to having RESTful APIs? That is situational. Ruby on Rails has a helpers folder. You could make helpers here to use in your Controllers and Views. Views IMMEDIATELY see your helpers... You need to import your helpers so that your Controllers see them. All Controller actions render something... JSON, XML, A View... which is HTML. If you were just building an API for your iOS App, you'd probably want your Controller to respond with JSON. You don't need HTML there. You will generally send either HTML or JSON. At first, probably HTML. Once you get interested in SPAs (Single Page Applications, and using AJAX, you'll send more JSON).

3.  Views is the last thing you learn. This is where you learn HTML and CSS. You don't need to be a guru in either. I know I'm definitely not a guru in either, but as you come across problems or you want to have your site look a certain way, you'll gradually learn more and more about HTML and CSS. This is also where you begin learning Javascript, the language of the browser. This is what you code in to make a button someone clicks do something. Event-handling and callbacks will become your friend quickly in Javascript. It is even looser than Ruby! I actually don't even use Views much anymore. I do all my front-end work (which Views are) using React.js. So, ultimately, you don't need to know much here if you plan on evolving your front-end to have it powered by a Javascript Framework.

### Hosting on Heroku

For Ruby on Rails apps in particular, Heroku is so extremely easy to host on. There isn't much to say here other than that. You may come across some struggles, but I urge you to push through and learn from those issues. When you first work on Ruby on Rails, you'll notice that the web-server it uses is called WEBrick which is only for testing. It should never be used when you're ready to have people on your app. I suggest migrating to Puma or Unicorn. These are all things to learn and read about when you're ready. Once your Ruby on Rails app is officially on Heroku you can go to the link associated with it, and actually use it (The link will be something like `yourapp.herokuapp.com`!

### Javascript

This language is very interesting and loose. You can do a lot of cool and a lot of confusing things. Yes, you could have learned this back when we went over Views in Ruby on Rails, but if you didn't go over Views, then this is when you learn it. A bit of a late note, but you don't really need to know Views in Ruby on Rails. Especially because they won't help you when you're building an iPhone app. Further, you may use one view just to boot up your React.js app, so again, you aren't going to mess with Ruby on Rails Views much.

### React.js

This is a frontend framework. Javascript is a very loose language and building a big website means your Javascript code can get very messy and tangled. React.js addresses this and a lot more. It is also very much in-tune with mobile development where every view has a lifecycle. You'll learn about that eventually. I actually learned React.js after I learned iOS development and it was nice to see many parallels. At this point, you've learned Javascript, Java, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. You're picking things up well and learning this should be easier. Your website can be a lot sexier too depending on how you want to use this for Single Page Applications. 

## Note about React Native and mobile development

I suppose you could tackle mobile development with React Native, but I've always been about doing things natively. It'll be easier to hire an Android or iOS developer to mess with your codebase if it is written natively. There are also a lot more jobs for native platform development. You also won't be limited by the framework you are using and you'll be on the cutting edge of the native platform. Frameworks have to integrate these cutting edge capabilities which could take time. Debugging with Stackoverflow is also harder to come by because less people use these frameworks.

### Android

If you learned Java earlier, then this will be easier for you. If you didn't, you'll need it here. If you only care about iPhones, then go learn that. I actually really dislike programming for Android compared to iPhone. It feels a lot clunkier and there are more moving pieces that frustrate me at times. But, doing Android first makes learning iOS development a lot easier because mobile development for both isn't too different. You could draw many parallels. Android gives the programmer a lot of power and responsibility. This could be a good and bad thing. Generally, for a newbie, it is a bad thing. It is what it is though. The fun of programming for both iOS and Android though is seeing what different bugs you come across because of the way certain things in the platforms are made.


### iOS and Swift

Go ahead and learn Swift 3. It is a breath of fresh air compared to Objective-C. I actually don't write Objective-C, which is what iOS apps used to be written in. I usually find myself contributing to open source libraries though which are written in Objective-C. These libraries will have 95% of what I want, so I'll patch it up to make it perfect for my needs. I think once you get going with iOS development, you'll notice that it is very straight forward and nice. That said, you do need a $99 yearly membership to test your apps on your phone and publish to the App Store. iOS development can be extremely frustrating the first time around though. There is a lot of setting up your account and credentials that you may feel is really dumb because Android didn't require the nonsense. Just get through it and you'll be set. Just wait until you want to integrate Push Notifications... then you may have to relive some hell again :).

When doing mobile development, you'll treat your Ruby on Rails app as a backend that serves you JSON when you need information.

I did not include topics like web sockets or AJAX, because those are all topics you'll potentially run into and when you do you should tackle them.

----

Those are my notes on all the topics. I didn't really proofread this or anything. I just wrote this in one go. I hope it helps some of you who need direction. If you have any questions let me know. This is the path I took and I highly recommend it."
5psar1,9,2017-01-23,Software Engineering vs Data Engineering at Capital One?,i47,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5psar1/software_engineering_vs_data_engineering_at/,"Hi! I was recently hired to work at Capital One this summer as part of their Technology Intern program. I have the choice of being a Software Engineering Intern or Data Engineering Intern. Here's the description of each:    
    
Software Engineering Intern    
  * Chart the digital frontier in one of our Mobile (Native), Web, or API development  
  * Develop your skills in a variety of languages and frameworks including: Java/Spring, .Net, JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, Go and Swift in the cloud and on devices.  
    
Data Engineer    
  * Build out our analytic capabilities using modern data technologies    
  * Deploy robust data products and services, as well as, enable rich visualization, data exploratory, and machine learning capabilities. Use open source technologies (Hadoop/MapReduce, Spark, Kafka, Pig, Python, NoSQL databases, etc.) and deploy applications in the cloud (AWS, Azure)    
  
I've been auditing an Artificial Intelligence course for the last couple weeks since the semester started and I've been really interested in it. I'm also currently enrolled in an Advanced Analytics Programming class that seems like it's going to be really interesting. So it seems like the Data Engineering role is a much better fit for me, but the only technologies they listed that I have any experience with are Hadoop, Python, and NoSQL. I'm fluent in Python, I wrote ONE driver/mapper/reducer package for Hadoop for a class like a year ago, and I've never done any work with NoSQL. However, I'm fairly comfortable in my ability to learn ""on the job"" so to speak.  
  
The only thing stopping me from just going for it is the fact that I come from a slightly different background. I'm majoring in Management Information Systems and have a Computer Science minor. MIS at my university is just fancy speak for Project Management + a little bit of tech, and as such, I've found it incredibly difficult to land an internship in Computer Science (where I really want to be). I feel like I should take the Software Engineering internship just to open up more opportunities for me in the future and ""prove"" that I'm capable of Software Engineering, and I feel like it's much easier to go from Software Engineering to Data Engineering but not the other way around. If I took the Software Engineering internship I'd pretty much exclusively be interested in iOS or API development, and I'm not sure how likely it would be that I get assigned to one of these teams. All that being said, what should I do?    
  
**TL;DR** - Debating between Software Engineering and Data Engineering Internship at Capital One. I'm *much* more qualified for Software Engineering, but I'm more interested in Data Engineering. However, I'm relying on this internship to open more doors in the future for me, not necessarily at Capital One. What do?"

Last time I asked you guys for advice I got many helpful answers telling me to ditch the restaurant job completely and focus completely on school as the classes will become more intense as I begin my junior and senior years of college and that taking out loans would be a means to finish school.


I'm TERRIFIED of going into debt for pursuing a degree I'm not confident I'll succeed at. I'm not even a real programmer! I haven't built any projects worthy of attention other than a shitty Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java class (not even a real game, it all took place in a JOptionPane. Real beginner stuff). I haven't the slightest clue how to implement code to build a real world project. 


So if I left my cushy restaurant job behind and transferred to FSU to pursue my CS degree I'd be putting myself at risk for dropping out of college and having thousands of debt on my hands. Whereas, here at FIU, at least I'd have that job to keep me going in case school doesn't end up working out. 


As a true beginner, do I have what it takes to succeed and by succeed I mean get internships in my junior and senior years? Suck at anything programing related but I will say my ONE strong point is being able to get straight A's. There's something about the rigor of coursework which encourages me to study hard for all of my classes. Even now, at 45 credits taken at college I'm averaging a 4.0 GPA. So I'm confidant I'll be able to graduate from FSU with a degree in CS with a fairly high GPA.


What then? Will computer science classes alone prepare me for an internship? I just don't know what projects even are or where to begin working on them. At least in class you have some defined coursework and you know the material you need to study. 


I'm sorry for the rambling. But I really need advice for next year. It's stressing me out every single day and my mind keeps shifting from deciding to move to Tampa (USF) to moving to Tallahassee (FSU) to staying in Miami (FIU).

5psmtl,12,2017-01-23,Comp Sci Interview Club/Group,ubc_tech_interviews,ubccsss,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubccsss/comments/5psmtl/comp_sci_interview_clubgroup/,"Hey UBC CSSSS, 

I've been reflecting on my challenges in getting computer science co-op jobs and internships over the course of my time at UBC. Although getting interviews is hard enough itself, I know that I’ve personally struggled with really excelling during technical questions and it’s certainly been a barrier for me in getting the internships I’ve wanted.

The conclusion I’ve come to is that my skills improved the most when I spent time working through interview questions face to face with friends and explaining my thought process. That being said, I don’t think there’s currently a consistent time and place where students are encouraged to meet and practice their interview skills. 

While comp sci co-op runs occasional technical interview clinics, these aren’t open to everyone and from my experience they aren’t necessarily the most helpful. Even employers running workshops may be helpful in the short term, but they don't provide the opportunity for consistent practice and improvement in skills over time. 

All this being said, I’m currently looking into forming a group/club devoted to practicing technical interview questions (and other interview skills) on a weekly basis. What are you thoughts on this? Would you attend? Do you think you would benefit? Are there other parts of getting a co-op job or internship that you think are significant barriers? "

They also have the same benefits for interns as they do full-time employees, such as a 401k and health insurance.

However, last week, I got an offer from Raytheon to do a summer internship as a Cyber Security Intern in D.C. I'm not sure how to approach this, because what I want to do after graduation is cyber-security, but I also know that a longer internship is more impressive. Raytheon will not be getting me a security clearance, but I feel like it's a more impressive company in the particular field I want to pursue as well. I am also very newly getting into security and would love to be exposed to the real-world dynamics of working in security.

I could talk to General Dynamics about the possibility of working at Raytheon over the summer, but I can't imagine it would go positively considering the conflict of interest, so I would most probably have to pick one over the other.

Which do you think would be the better experience for me in the long-run?"
5pt0dn,25,2017-01-23,Career Fair Advice from an IU alumni/recruiter,iurecruiter,IndianaUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/5pt0dn/career_fair_advice_from_an_iu_alumnirecruiter/,"Note: I'm leaving out which company I'll be representing so this doesn't break the subreddit rules of advertising, also it gives me freedom to be more honest about the process.

I graduated in 2013 with an Informatics major and will be back on campus for the **Arts &amp; Sciences Career Fair** Tuesday and **Informatics and Computer Science Career Fair** Thursday. I've made a list of what helped me during my career fair experiences as well as what I've gathered from going full circle to recruit from IU. Hope it helps!

* Career Fair:
 * Your school career fair website should list all the companies and whether they're hiring interns, full time, or both. Skip talking to companies not offering what you want unless you have extra time and want to talk to them for the future. Make a list of your favorite companies and talk to them first.
 * The most popular companies will have long lines, come early to avoid them!
 * In my experience it works best to introduce yourself and hand them your resume, them say what you're looking for e.g. full time position. Some majors are funneled into certain positions and you opening with your skill set helps the recruiter tell you if you should talk to someone else at the booth instead. The recruiter will then guide you with questions to see if you meet the minimum requirements like GPA or a work visa, and maybe ask questions like why you're interested in that company, what relevant experience you have, etc.
 * Don't make the mistake I did at first with a minute long elevator pitch about yourself. They won't remember most of it and can read your resume to get the same details. Exception - super relevant experience like applying for a consulting job when your whole family and best friend are consultants.
 * Absolutely ask questions if you want, but the super specific questions are best left to the actual interview/on site visit. Unless you're talking to the recruiter, I'm not going to be able to tell you the exact specific details of a job I haven't had besides the general information and requirements. Your first round interview and beyond are where to ask those questions, the career fair is just getting your foot in the door and considered for an interview.
 * Confirm how to apply - is giving them your resume enough? is there an online app you have to do?
 * When you leave shake their hand, smile and say thanks! If someone is very promising and then walks off with out saying goodbye that could mark them down.

* Resume:
 * Bring many paper copies, better save than sorry and paper costs a few cents a sheet
 * Spelling, grammar, formatting count! Not that I'm reading every line, just the overall experience, but if your margins are off or I see spelling mistakes that's a mark against you.
 * Get some nice paper to print them on for bonus points
 * Try to fit it on 1 page if you can

* Dress:
 * Any way you go above the minimum helps you stand out e.g. wearing a suite jacket instead of just dress pants and a dress shirt
 * General hygiene - shower, trim your nails, brush your teeth before coming, deodorant, no excessive cologne/perfume (some is ok)

* Don'ts:
 * Wear bad clothes - wrinkled, untucked, holes in it, etc. we *will* remember that and factor that into an interview offer
 * Bad hygiene
 * Argue with the recruiter - e.g. if the company doesn't hire above X GPA, the people there are not who set or change that

* What I look for:
 * Good social skills! Someone with little experience and a barely passing GPA but great social skills could be weighed as much as a 4.0 grad student who can't communicate well
 * Be respectful of our time and don't spend more than a few minutes at the booth if there's a line, we talk to hundreds of people sometimes!
 * Be yourself! Acting fake or like who you think we want you to be is obvious
 * If you meet the requirements for our hiring and seem like a decent person I'm almost always going to pass you to the main recruiter who decides first round interview offers.

Remember that some people at the booth are full time recruiters, others are regular employees, and others may be managers/HR/upper management. Some companies may have 1 recruiter make all the interview offer decisions and others may let anyone who is manning the booth pass people. Regardless treat everyone with respect and be friendly!

I can try to answer general questions here, or PM me if you don't want to post. Good luck to everyone!"
5pt4p8,24,2017-01-23,UBC Comp Sci Interview Club/Group,ubc_tech_interviews,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5pt4p8/ubc_comp_sci_interview_clubgroup/,"Hey r/UBC

I've been reflecting on my challenges in getting computer science co-op jobs and internships over the course of my time at UBC. Although getting interviews is hard enough itself, I know that I’ve personally struggled with really excelling during technical questions and it’s certainly been a barrier for me in getting the internships I’ve wanted.

The conclusion I’ve come to is that my skills improved the most when I spent time working through interview questions face to face with friends and explaining my thought process. That being said, I don’t think there’s currently a consistent time and place where students are encouraged to meet and practice their interview skills. 

While comp sci co-op runs occasional technical interview clinics, these aren’t open to everyone and from my experience they aren’t necessarily the most helpful. Even employers running workshops may be helpful in the short term, but they don't provide the opportunity for consistent practice and improvement in skills over time. 

All this being said, I’m currently looking into forming a group/club devoted to practicing technical interview questions (and other interview skills) on a weekly basis. What are you thoughts on this? Would you attend? Do you think you would benefit? Are there other parts of getting a co-op job or internship that you think are significant barriers? "
5ptbfq,1,2017-01-23,"I moved to a new city to study, and I hate this place. I have no friends, I dislike what I'm studying and I cry myself to sleep almost every night.",RegretMyWholeLife,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ptbfq/i_moved_to_a_new_city_to_study_and_i_hate_this/,"In august 2015 I moved to another city to get a bachelor in nursing (3 years). I had 3 good friends who lived in this city, and I was having a good time the first year, but it had it's ups and downs.

After the first year, two of my good friends moved (one because he got an internship somewhere else, the other because he wanted to get away). The third one is to busy with his girlfriends to even hang with me. I've been with him about 5 times the last year (and we used to hang every day back home).

I was hoping I would make some new friends at school when I got here, as I'm a very social guy who usually has no problem making friends. But it's pretty hard when you're the only guy in your group (20 people), and one of 5 guys in the whole class (200 people).
I've been invited by some of the girls to taco nights and stuff, but I don't really enjoy being with them, and also I've got this feeling that they kind of wish I turned down the invitation so it could only be the girls.

I've told my family I love it here. I've told them I've got some friends, and that I love what I'm studying. Those are both lies. I'm embarrassed of myself because I have no friends, and that I've lied to them. I've lied to myself too, it's only the last 2-3 months I've started to realize this. I've told myself ""It will get better"" and that I'll make new friends sooner or later, but I've started to realize that this is not going to happen.

I've got about $20k in student loan, and I'm only halfway through my studies. But I'm afraid if I stay here even a month longer it's gonna develop into a depression.

I'm *not* having suicidal thoughts, but sometimes I think about how it wouldn't be too bad to die in an accident.

I've ordered a plane ticket home for the weekend, and I'm gonna tell my mother everything. Hopefully she'll understand and forgive me, but I'm sure she's gonna be dissapointed. She's been so proud to tell all her friends that I'm following her footsteps and becoming a nurse.

Maybe I hate my studies because I hate myself right now, and maybe I'll continue studying this when I get back home. But for now, I just wanna go home.

I just wanted to rant about this, and get some support. I have nobody else to share this with right now, and I needed to get it off my chest before I'm going home.

Even though I don't wish this on my worst enemy, it would be comforting to see if anybody else is or has been through the same thing.

Thanks for reading.

However, I am currently living out in Montana working as an engineering intern and will be finishing up my degree in May of 2018. I was recently pulled over going 84 MPH in a 80 MPH zone along I-94 east of Billings Montana. I am 22 years old and have never gotten a speeding ticket before and still being a resident of North Carolina, I am concerned over weather this will cause my license to be suspended in NC. 4 MPH may not seem like a lot, but from some of the things I have found online about NC regarding insurance, points and fines I am having some trouble reconciling this. 

&amp;nbsp;

http://www.ncdoi.com/_Publications/It%20Pays%20to%20Be%20a%20Safe%20Driver%20Insurance%20Points_CAU1.pdf

&amp;nbsp;

According to this website, it states that “speeding in excess of 80 MPH when the speed limit is 70MPH or higher” will result in 4 points on my license. However, it goes on to state “no SDIP points will be charged for speeding 10MPH or less over the posted speed limit”. 

&amp;nbsp;

http://www.dmv.org/nc-north-carolina/traffic-ticket-fines-and-penalties.php

&amp;nbsp;

The above website states that speeding in excess of 75MPH will result in the immediate suspension of license.  I was originally going to pay the fine and move on but with all of this information I am not to sure any more. The vast majority of high ways in Montana are 80MPH speed limit, does this imply if I go even 1 MPH over my NC license will be revoked? 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR
Even though I was only going 4MPH over, since it was 84 in an 80 zone, will my license be suspended in North Carolina or am I just being paranoid?

5ptm3n,5,2017-01-23,Non CS major Applying to programming Jobs?,sniperzxD,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/5ptm3n/non_cs_major_applying_to_programming_jobs/,"Hello!

So I'm currently a senior chemical engineering major having lots of trouble finding a chemical engineering job. I thought maybe I can try applying to programming internship or jobs instead since I have a pretty strong interest in programming. The thing is I'm not sure if I have enough experience / am qualified enough to apply.

I had an internship at a large biotech company doing programming work (mostly SQL and VB.net) and working in an agile environment (had to attend scrum meetings, complete user stories, etc). I've self taught myself python and have built some simple CRUD apps (a small blog and a menu app) using some web frameworks (GAE and flask). As of now I'm trying to learn Javascript and React. I've gotten the hang of ES6 syntax for the most part and I'm just trying to build a simple application with React now. In addition, I went I attended a hackathon and wrote a python script that uses Watson's API to scrape wiki articles for data, so I have some experience working with APIs. Most of my source code is hosted on Github, and I've built my own personal page (although it's not very fancy). Lastly, I have MATLAB experience through my chemical engineering classes, and I took an intro to C class at university if that counts.

From what I just said, would you guys recommend applying to some entry level programming jobs? If so, what am I supposed to put for education as most programming jobs require a CS degree.

Thanks and much appreciated!"

I want to work in IT providing desktop support and eventually move up the chain of command into a management position. I graduated in December of 2015 with a BBA in Management Information Systems...not the ideal degree for someone who wants to work in IT, but that is a discussion for another post.

I own and operate a small business through which I provide GeekSquad-like services, namely, PC repair and what not. I have officially been *in business* since May of 2011. I have a handful of regular customers and gain a new one every now and then via word-of-mouth. I like my business and I like being in charge of but I want the *real deal*.

The business is somewhat legitimate in the sense that I have a DBA, business cards, a website, and business email.

My question is: Should I mention my business on my resume or not?

I've been hunting for jobs since graduation and have submitted *hundreds* of applications. I've had a handful of interviews, but none of them led to a hire. For each interview that did not pan out, I made sure to get feedback and make changes accordingly.

At this point, I am not sure what's going on and I am wondering if the mention of my business on my resume is actually hurting my chances. Other than my small business, I really only have two other sources of relevant experience: 8 mos as a part-time software QA intern during college, and ~1.5 years of part time IT work for a community college in my area (currently still employed part time at said college).

What do you think?"

I'm an Intern seriously considering pathology right now. As a matter of fact, it's probably my top pick and that's what I tell most people when they ask me what I'd like to specialize in. However, I do have one concern about the profession moving forward and that's in regards to future prospects with the onset of very advanced AI and automation.

I recently read a Stanford study that read:

""Computers trounce pathologists in predicting lung cancer type, severity""

In it they detailed how:

""Automating the analysis of slides of lung cancer tissue samples increases the accuracy of tumor classification and patient prognoses, according to a new study.""

The link is here below:

http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/08/computers-trounce-pathologists-in-predicting-lung-cancer-severity.html

As a medical student and now intern I looked forward to decades in the field of pathology doing service, research and teaching but I'm worried that eventually the job may be taken over by robots and fully automated.

So far I've only done the rotation during my clinical years plus a 5-week stint in my university's associated Cancer Research Unit where I did research and didn't shadow the pathologist so I can't claim to have a vault of first-hand experience and therefore know my concerns may be unfounded

As pathologists out there in the field what's your opinion on this matter and the future of pathology?

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

**UV / UltraViolet**  **–  VUDU**  Some movies will only redeem on myuv.com, Flixster, Universal, Fox, Sony and so on.  Most port quickly to the other services and it is rarely an issue.  If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

5pv3ib,14,2017-01-24,TIFU by playing with chance and getting drunk instead of working.,LetsHaveSomeTequila,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5pv3ib/tifu_by_playing_with_chance_and_getting_drunk/,"Dear Reddit, today (last night actually), I fucked up.


Before I start, there are two things you should know. 

Firstly, I have two jobs. One of them happens to be an internship at a software company where I can work remotely and on my own time. Working on my own time has its perks, but I become less motivated to actually get started. This night in particular I had a lot of work to do.

Secondly, I just turned 21 this past Friday (sadly, Donald Trump was my birthday present). Seeing as 21 is a big birthday to celebrate, I bought and drank a shit ton of alcohol. Obviously it was tequila, and obviously I was drunk off my ass, dressed in a very stereotypical Mexican outfit for my birthday...but that's not important.

What is important, is that I had about half a bottle tequila left (El Gran Centenario Añejo for anyone wondering). I wanted to finish it throughout the week and decided to play a game with my roommate to do so. The game was simple: guess the top card of a deck of cards and I'll take a shot (a fat double-shot, Mexican style).


I tell my roommate we'll do this a couple of time a day until it's gone and he agrees. We start our first round like at midnight. Roommate's guess was 3 of clubs. Checked the top card, saw a three, my heart sank but I realized it was the 3 of spades. I shuffle and tell my roommate since he was so close I'd let him have another go right away. His second guess is 7 of spades. Actual card was...holy shit 3 of spades again. That's fucking weird. Then I say: 


""Tell you what. Since that shit came out twice, I'll shuffle this deck thoroughly, then you'll shuffle the deck thoroughly, and then if it's the three of spades again I'll take three fucking shots.""


I shuffled that deck for like three minutes straight, trying to get it as random as possible...as if my life depended on it. I then pass it to him, and he seriously just takes the top card and puts it on the bottom.

He flips the next card and of course...it's the fucking 3 of spades again. At this point I'm just thinking: ""welp...momma didn't raise no quitter."" I curse god for making me do this and pound four fat shots.


At this point my throat is all warm and tingly, and I'm starting to get the spins. I tell myself I've worked tipsy before and can probably get my work done anyways. I sit down at the table with my laptop and pull up a project. Literally five minutes into thinking and I'm drunk. Like really drunk. Apparently four shots in rapid succession (more like 6-7 because it's the double-ish sized shot glasses) is enough to fuck me up real good. Naturally drunk me wants to talk to the ladies so I pull my phone and start spamming all of my lady friends (not smooth at all). 30 minutes into coding and chill, and I'm plastered on the living room floor. I wake up the today, having missed some classes, and with a bunch of emails from my boss asking me whether or not I've finished up the changes I needed to make. Woops! Part of me wanted to tell him that instead of working I got hammered and tried to hit on all of my friends, ending the email with ""keep slayin boi"" just like that one popular email. Instead, I told him I would get right on it, and went to the only lecture I had left today. And here I am now, almost 1:00 am and I still haven't started to work on the changes. I guess I should be doing that instead of wasting my time on Reddit. Oh well!




TL;DR

Played a stupid drinking game and lost. Proceeded to drunk text people instead of finishing up important work that my boss wanted.




Edit: its, not it's. "
5pv7gr,0,2017-01-24,Difference in Personality (M 20) G(F 20),Enonater,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5pv7gr/difference_in_personality_m_20_gf_20/,"My Girlfriend of 8 months and I have been having incompatibility issues nearly the entirety of our relationship, and in retrospect I have been aware of this nearly from the point of meeting her. The problem I am having is that she has a very set view of how she ""deserves"" to be treated in a relationship, and I do not share these same beliefs. Additionally, she new before we started dating, because I mentioned it time and again, that I am very oriented on my studies at University currently and will be taking every opportunity to explore internships as they come to me (and as it happens the majority are out of state in my field because of our geography). She seems to be looking for complete commitment from me, to the point that she expects this relationship to last the entirety of her lifetime, and I simply do not share that view, but am not able to bring it up to her without her exploding at me and throwing a fit ( which is something that happens often in this relationship). Additionally, recently she has been unemployed (for the past 5 months) and she continues to make excuses for why she can't find a job/ still lives at her aunt's house. 
 
 I like her, don't get me wrong, but I am having trouble seeing myself with someone who is so controlling over our relationship, and who does not share my ambition for life. She acts like she's been burned so often in the past that she doesn't even take the risk of making friends, and finds it unsettling some of the ""rumors"" shes heard about me from my past (which are all true and I find no shame in which upsets her more). 
   
I guess my question is, is it worth pursuing this relationship any further if i feel like she is limiting my potential and emotionally leashing me into her own depressing world? Or should I wait around hoping things might change?
  
Tl;Dr girlfriend is clingy and unambitious, I am independent and working on college, would you make it work?"
5pvh85,6,2017-01-24,"Community College, AS in Computer Science, and the next steps...",BrBoomr,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/5pvh85/community_college_as_in_computer_science_and_the/,"Hello,

A couple months ago I posted here in desperation and did not bother to be mature about it, so here's my second attempt while adulting for once. I am telling you now that even though I started college in high school I still have no actual clue about all the screws and bolts of how I should pursue my education. Please have patience.

Fall of 2016 I officially finished my Associate's in Computer Science. I ranted about how little to nothing I learned from the college itself as it was mainly focused on C++ programming and not real life applications. In other words, it was as if I was being taught how architecture and engineering worked by using Lego blocks. Regardless, I decided the only way to fix this would be to actually do my own research and learn other languages on my own, as the Java and Assembly courses were completely rushed by an incompetent professor. I am currently learning PHP as recommended by a former classmate.

The real reason I am making this post is to see how you guys feel about Community College education in general. I do not feel like I have wasted my time anymore (saved a lot of money), as I said in the post I deleted out of shame, but I am beginning to question whatever I should continue to pursue a Bachelor's in this CC. They do not offer Computer Science as a Bachelor's, but they do offer Applied Tech (Computer &amp; Information Technologies) which I am really interested on. I have a good 75% of classes already done due to my Associate's. It is either this, or transfer to an University and pursue something like Electrical Engineering, or continue Computer Science. Still juggling stuff around.

I like to program, but it feels that so far I have been restrained to only using Visual Studio applications, strictly Command Prompt calculator apps and occasional games. I do not feel comfortable actually seeking internships (not provided where I live, unfortunately) due to feeling so inexperienced. This is the reason why I am thinking of other career paths, but if an University can actually teach me more than using Legos, I would not mind continuing Computer Science. Regardless, Electrical Engineering and CIT are other paths I am highly interested in.

Thank you for the patience so far, I understand if someone being as clueless like me can get irritating.

5pvydz,1,2017-01-24,[M4A] Sex &amp; Dry Cleaning &amp; Rock'n'Roll,MattNCL,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5pvydz/m4a_sex_dry_cleaning_rocknroll/,"The wild guitars and reckless lyrics of Eat Your Peach hummed quietly from the new CD player in the dash of my beaten up old car. It’s a song that should really be played at earth-shattering volume through a tower of amps and speakers, but I’d turned it down so as not to draw too much attention to myself. I checked my watch again. 2:26 AM. Was this guy even coming? He was already almost half an hour late. This wasn’t how I’d pictured my first job out of high school - sitting in the parking lot of a closed fast-food restaurant, waiting to buy… well, who knows what, although I’d assume it was some form of drugs. 2:27 AM. I cautiously turned up the music just a little and shut my eyes, just for a moment.



Cardinal Sin had been my favourite band since I was 13 and a huge part of my life over the last five years. Sure, their particular brand of swaggering, boastful, oversexed and underwritten rock'n'roll wasn’t exactly in-vogue these days, but I loved them. One of my first acts of masturbation was in the middle of the night to the raunchy video for On The Pole with the sound turned down. I’d taken my first girlfriend to see their Seduction tour. I even lost my virginity with their album Deep &amp; Slow playing in the background. Most people loved their singer, Johnny Kill, but I had always idolised their kick-ass guitarist, Atticus Filth, not only because he actually wrote most of the songs, but because of his well known accolade of ‘the biggest cock in rock’. As an awkward, shy, but very well endowed teenager, he was my hero and made me feel like less of a freak during those uncertain and embarrassed years.



When I got my internship at the record label I was thrilled. Despite lacking any musical ability of my own, all I’d ever wanted to do was work in the music industry. When I was told that Cardinal Sin were working on a new album and I was to help Atticus write it, I almost had a panic attack. I had imagined myself knocking back beers with my hero, giving notes on his lyrics as he experimented with the new material in the studio. The reality however, had been a little different.



Mostly, I was an errand boy. I’d pick up his leather pants from the dry cleaners, go out to buy him booze or cigarettes (which was often difficult without any ID), or search through shops to indulge his every childish impulse purchase on the record label’s credit card. Other nights, like this one, I’d spend my time hanging around in sketchy parts of town waiting to pay for and collect various ‘packages’. My musical hero turned out to be a spoiled man-child and addict who was happy for me to work 18 hour days but hadn’t learnt my name in six weeks. I hadn’t even got a glimpse of the inside of his studio either, having to settle for the occasional snatch of screeching guitar noise wafting down the halls of his tacky mansion. But the most demoralising revelation of all was the one that came from his wife;


“The biggest cock in rock and roll? Ha! It’s just a bunch of socks that he rolls up and stuffs down there love.”



She was the only thing that didn't disappoint though, and often the only thing that kept my motivated through the exhaustion and tedious tasks. Penelope Filth was undeniably stunning, even as she spoke in voice like a Dickensian cockney street urchin and sucked down cigarettes with a sexy scowl. I’d had a crush on her ever since she appeared in the video for Bad Confession, swinging around a pole on an alter in a skintight latex nun’s outfit. It was a ludicrous bit of male fantasy but having now met her, I wouldn’t be surprised if she picked the outfit herself. Her daily attire seemed to exclusively consist of low cut leather pants, showy bras beneath sheer tops, spiked heels and assorted sexy PVC items. Her dress code was all black, all rock and roll, all the time. In fact the only colour she seemed to allow for, beyond her shock of blonde hair that often dyed a different colour every week, was her bright red lipstick and nail polish. She’d been my point of contact most of the time, with Atticus locked away in his home studio, as she bossed me about with a temperamental attitude that made me a little nervous. But, god did she look great. Sometimes I couldn’t help but stare at her in awe. At first she barely seemed to notice me, drifting in and out of rooms to give me orders or mundane tasks, but slowly she began to actually talk with me, clearly bored senseless with her husband locked away writing and recording day or night.


“I might as well not exist whenever he’s working on a new album” she’d once told me in that fantastically blunt and brutally honest way of hers, “Even I’m not allowed in the studio. He says I’d be too much of a distraction from his muse, but I think he just doesn’t want anyone to realise that his songs sound shit without the rest of the band”.



And so it was her that I thought about as I shut my eyes and waited in that dimly lit parking lot for some unpunctual night-owl dealer. I had thought that I was going to be living the dream, but it turns out that rock and roll isn’t that fun unless you’re the rockstar. Little did I know that later that night she’d give me an opportunity to know what feels like to be Atticus Finch. Even if I couldn’t ever stand on a stage and shout the chorus of Ten Ton Tongue to a sea of screaming fans, at least I would get a taste of what it felt like to be the real ‘biggest cock in rock’."

I've been carrying all of this around in my head and wanted to give real, concrete advice, rather than airy, head-space advice (like ""be open-minded!"") We're getting nitty-gritty here. 

Keep in mind that I've only been to one college. I was in English and Political Science. I tried to generalize this, but not everything will apply to every school, and I'm afraid a lot of it is writing-centric. I hope that some other former (or even current) college students can add to this, especially ones with stronger STEM backgrounds. 

And so: 

**Academic**

* While coffee is delicious, tea is better when consumed in mass quantities. If you're studying for finals, your body will feel much better on three cups of tea than it will on three cups of coffee. On that note, learn to eat fruits and vegetables if you don't right now. Your body will thank you. If you have access to unlimited food in the cafeteria, this is your time to try new things. 

* Get to know your faculty advisor quickly. Your school may assign one to you or you may get to pick, but whatever the system is, get on their radar as soon as you can. If they see an opportunity that needs students (research project, internship, whatever) they're more likely to send it to you if they know your name. They will also be better able to advise you if they know more about you.

* When working on group projects, if you're not using Google Drive, you're doing it wrong. Keep everything in there, even things that individual group members are working on and will share with the group later. You never know what can happen and so it's best to keep everything in a common space.

* Get organized. Somehow. I put every assignment and appointment in a Google Calendar and set daily ""to-dos."" Every Friday (or Thursday, because sometimes my weekends started on Thursdays, which was incredible) I created a list of everything I needed to do that weekend, and I stuck to it. Related:

* Use your weekends to your advantage. Things really slow down, so it's a perfect opportunity to jump-start a paper or a reading. 

* You don't have to read every word. Learn to skim. Skim the optional reading too -- it'll come in handy. 

* If you can, take notes on paper, not the computer. When you do this, you mentally siphon out the less important information in favor of the more important information because you can't write as quickly as you can type. This will make your notes more valuable later on.

* Take notes on what you read. Even short summaries like ""Skowroneck considers presidencies as part of long historical periods marked by prevailing ideologies established by certain presidents"" will make your life **much** easier when working on final papers. (Also, y'all should check out Stephen Skowroneck's theory of presidential leadership in political time -- it's fascinating.)

* Use the works cited page of books to your advantage. If you're struggling finding more information on a topic, that's your first port of call. 

* Learn how to write papers in ways that work for you. I always wrote whatever I wanted for the assigned length of the paper. Then I wrote a schematic of what had I puked onto the page, re-organized that schematic into a structure that actually made sense, and fleshed out key details and holes. Some people write a full outline and then start. Some people organize by scholar, case study, source text, or school of thought. Whatever you do, come up with something that works for you. 

* Ask for help. Your professor's office hours, a tutor, the writing center, the counseling center, your classmates. Nobody will think less of you. (Pro-tip: asking classmates for help means talking to the smartest people in your class, which also usually means the most interesting people. Talking to interesting people, I would argue, is the whole point of college.) 

* ""It's hard"" is a TERRIBLE reason to not take a class. The best classes I've taken have also been the hardest classes. ""It's Hard"" is also the name of a pretty bad album by The Who. 

* If you're in a program that lets you be undecided for a year or two, take advantage of that. If you see something that you don't know much about, don't write it off as uninteresting. 

* If you're working on a paper, don't stop your writing session at the end of a paragraph. Start the next paragraph and then stop. This way, when you sit back down to keep going, you don't have to putter about thinking ""how should I start?"" You will already have a beginning. 

* Find a pen you like. Mine is the Bic Grip Roller. I used to go with the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine, but they leak sometimes. 

* Balance out your courses. If you have the opportunity to decide which classes you'll take which semesters, plan ahead and avoid loading a lot of hard classes into one semester. 

* If you have a class that only meets once or twice a week, find another time that week that you can treat like that class to do homework only for that class. For example, the year I did a thesis, I dedicated 9-12 every Friday morning to work for that thesis. I did a lot of other work for it throughout the week, but having a dedicated time to work on it really focused me. 

* You can revise your work much more effectively if you put 24 hours between the last time you worked on it and the time you started revising it. 

* Go to campus conversations and events about topics that are outside your subject area. Just because you're not studying it doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about it. This is the one time in your life where you will have the benefit of professors lecturing for free right outside your door. (Also, these events tend to have free food.)

* Keep a novel going to read for fun. I would start all of my library sessions just by reading a little bit for my own enjoyment. The idea was to get my brain going with a warm-up before I jumped into the work I would get graded on. Crosswords, Sudoku, and Chess are good alternatives to this if you're not much of a reader. 

* Find a hobby. It's really important to be able to do something that is productive but not academic. You won't feel bad about working on this thing, because it's productive, but you simply can't spend all of your time on your studies. I played a lot of music, but I know people who tried woodworking, knitting, yoga, improv comedy, and one guy with a unicycle. 

* Purchase a copy of *The Elements of Style*. Read it once at the beginning of each semester. If you carry it with you everywhere, you're not over-doing it.

**Social**

* Learn to make one large, shareable dish like a dip, lasagna, cake, or bowl of chili. There are a lot of pot lucks in college, and you will be well-prepared if you have a dish like this on standby. PM me for a bean dip recipe that people actually request of me when I go to stuff at their houses. 

* Go to parties with people you know. Make sure that you keep track of them and they keep track of you (and that you keep track of them) throughout the night. Walk each other home. 

* When considering campus opportunities, it easier to say yes and then say no than it is to say no and then yes. You can always try something once (a sport, a club, whatever) and then say ""you know, this isn't for me"" if it isn't for you. It's much harder to jump on things once they've started. 

* If you're at a party, never leave a drink unattended. Ever. 

* Set aside structured time to see the friends who mean the most to you. This can be an orientation group, people from your floor, whatever. College gets busy, and so ritualizing friendship makes it A) more frequent and B) more special, somehow. I know people who had ""family dinner"" with their closest friends every Sunday, and nothing got in the way. 

* You are not bound to your friends, especially the ones you make early on. I ditched my first-semester friends in January of my freshman year and it was one of the best choices I've ever made. They weren't bad people; we just had nothing in common. Don't be afraid to branch out.

* Branching out is scary and that's okay. 

* Do not judge anyone's character or personality (unless they do something very heinous) during their first semester. Everyone in the first semester is very desperate to be liked, and people tend not to do their best when they're under that kind of pressure. Let people (and yourself) mellow out a little bit before you start deciding who you like. This advice goes doubly for sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are passing judgment on incoming first-year students. 

* Find someone who you're close to who does not go to your school who you can call if you just need to vent. 

* Don't get that upset when most of your high school friendships collapse. It just happens.

* Give people room to change and become better people. College has a way of knocking people down a peg. If you meet someone who looks like they need that, check back on them in a year or two. 

* Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Otherwise, you'll end up like one of the people in the above tip.

* Being a campus celebrity is not that fun. It's better to just know a lot of people so you have a lot of friendly faces on campus that you can say hi to than it is to just be ""known."" It's also okay to just have a small group of people who you like. 

* Meet older students. It doesn't matter if you do it through clubs or sports teams or greek communities, but these people have all the key info on your school, like which classes and professors are good, where to go for really good Vietnamese food, and which improv groups to see. They will also invite you to the cooler parties. 

* If you're unhappy, make a change. Cut or change an extracurricular, start hanging out with different people, break up with that person. Just don't make changes indiscriminately -- try to find the root of your dissatisfaction and fix that. "
5pwb3c,230,2017-01-24,My story about getting a job in the industry,Instinctx,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/5pwb3c/my_story_about_getting_a_job_in_the_industry/,"Hello!  
I thought I'd share my story.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

**The start**  
I started doing levels in Counter Strike when I was 16. I enjoyed it a lot, so I took a bachelor in Game Design in Norway.  
The job marked was really tough the year I graduated. All of the companies was at their final stage of development on their main projects, meaning they were either on the verge of bankruptcy or just didn't have time to going through the process of hiring + training a new employee.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Tough start**  
This was a big bummer for me, so I moved back to the city where my parents live. I asked the local university if they knew any game devs in the area. I got forwarded to a company that could hire me as an intern... without pay.  
  
At that point, it was either giving up, get a new education/job and move on. Or as I did, take the ""job"" anyway.  
  
They told me they only needed a programmer. I said that I don't have a clue about programming, I only had 1 year with Java where I made a broken calculator.  
""No worries! We don't expect much. Just try it out and see if you get the hang of it"" was the response.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Absorb experience, no matter what it is**  
My second day I was set to create a cannon that auto aimed and fired against enemies (Tower defense game).  
I spent about 1.5 months on it...  
  
But I kept at it, getting some tutoring from my boss, learning from forums and tutorials. I hated it at first, but when I first got that cannon to auto fire, god damn it felt good. And I was hooked.  
  
I spent 1 year at that company programming all kinds of systems and gameplay mechanics. I went from only knowing how to write debug commands in the game-update loop, to making an entire boss sequence in an action fighting game.  I even released a game on iOS with those guys!  
  
Our first game failed (of course), money was (really) tight, I worked a lot at a part time job. So I told them that I couldn't keep it up. So I quit.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Give up or keep going**  
At that point I was very demotivated, thinking my life would end up at a boring part time job.  
I had a break for 3 months, without wanting to touch programming (or design). But I kept making up game ideas in my head, kept analyzing games I was playing, kept wanting to create something... I had the passion, but not the motivation.  
  
So, one sunday, I had nothing to do. And I forced myself to open Unity and prototype a simple game for one week. It was a struggle at first, but when it was done it felt insanely good! The motivation was back!  
  
I tinkered on with my prototype for 1 year, making a 1v1 multiplayer action RPG game. The project was insanely ambitious. But I made something playable and it worked!  
I had the intention of releasing it (I still have actually), when suddenly a friend of a friend of mine on facebook shared a post saying: ""Does anyone know of a programmer and Unity? Need 2 programmers for a 3 month project, fast!"".  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The opportunity**  
I sent him a PM, some e-mails back and forth he told me he was very interested. He wanted me to send him some of my code. So I sent him my entire prototype.  
They were amazed, and I got the job (there were 13 applicants)!   
  
I spent 2 months working on a small app project with the other guy they hired. It was fun. But after 2 months I had done my job in the project, but I still had 1 more month left on my contract. The other guy still worked on the initial project.  
  
So the company transferred me over to their big main project. On that project my job was overall game design, balancing and level design. I loved it!  
  
---  
  
When there was only 1 week left on my contract I got a call, they told me that they really enjoyed working with me, but money was tight. But if I was interested, they could try to move some things around in the budget to fit me on the team.  
Of course I said yes! The only thing was that I had to move.  
And I now I am working as both a designer and a programmer on a project in a franchise that I have loved since I was a kid...  
  
**The dream came true.**  
  
---  
  
**TL;DR:**  
So what I am trying to say is. Getting a job in the industry isn't always easy. I studied for 3 years, worked for free for 1 year and did my own solo project for 1 year before finally getting to where I wanted. So nothing is impossible, it only takes a bit longer time. And you have to work for it, constantly getting more and more experience and knowledge.  
  
Disclaimer: This is not a ""how-to"" guide on how to get a job in the industry! There are many ways of doing it. Getting connections is very important (I got the job through a friend of a friend on facebook...), but more important is experience. "
5pwfrh,1,2017-01-24,Switching careers to programming in an undeveloped country,TurboSquawk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pwfrh/switching_careers_to_programming_in_an/,"Hello,

I've finished undergraduate and master studies in Finance, did a 6 month internship and hated it. I'm having trouble finding good jobs, the pay mostly sucks and you get exploited as much as possible. That's just how our Eastern European country works. Most of the young, ambitious people move to some developed European Union country where they fight from the bottom to succeed. I am unable to move from my city because of family, currently. I, my mentor, and even my manager on the internship seemed to do mostly Excel and SAP troubleshooting stuff. I've spent time doing robotic tasks and it didn't seem to get much better considering my coworkers were doing almost the same type of work but on a higher level I suppose. Since I always had passion for computers and programming but never really pursued it, I would think about how all this work could be automated, even a bunch of work that the manager does. I didn't have the energy to learn a programming language after spending 8+ hrs a day there. But after this internship finished, I was relieved and ready to learn.

I decided to get familiarized with the programming world through Java, using Tim Buchalka's video course. Since I had some touch with mIRC scripting (back in the day, made some scripts on my own), some basic C in high school, some HTML and setting up CMS based sites (this was a long time ago too, before I started Finance in university). I've blazed through the beginning of the course, understanding and applying the basics easily, understanding what the mentor wanted to do even before he finished, had fun doing challenges. After a while, things got a bit more complicated but I supplemented the course with an eBook and google research. I managed to understand classes and fundamentals of OOP, but it started to get more and more difficult to solve challenges on my own, but I had motivation to go hard at it.

What really disrupted my progress is the fact that I didn't quite understand how a person gets from learning something to actually start to do it for a living. And since my money is short and I'm on my parents' back, the pressure is high to starting making money as soon as possible or just settle and do finance/economics which I don't like. Since my country isn't really developed with the programming industry (my city especially sucks bad - for reference, currently **1** local job offer for a PHP programmer), internships are hard to get and I really liked the idea of remote work. But the more I researched, I understood that Java isn't really a good option for someone that wants to change careers and do remote work. I can't even network, since there are no conventions and literally nobody in my circle does real programming - I know that's one of the ways for US people. This really made me lose motivation to further learn Java and I got stuck not knowing what to do next.

Web development seems to be the most of the work that is available in my country. But the work conditions are more or less the same as finance. Pay is better, but still bad and there's still the worker exploitation issue. So if I was good with that, I reckon I could just stick to finance and be quite miserable.

Even though I'm not sure how much I like web development, from all my research I realized that this might be the best path for kick-starting a career and going further from there. Do some random personal projects, try to find a friend who has a need for a site and volunteer to create one for them, build my own site to show off my work. Also, I realize I could potentially make some easy profit with WordPress if I can find customers, but I don't want to stay limited to that. Would some freelancing sites be a good path, differentiating myself from the sea of low wage workers and trying to find good clients to cooperate with, maybe even boost my reputation and stay in touch longer term?

So how would you guys go about starting a career in programming in an unfriendly, undeveloped environment from which you can't move in the foreseeable future? Which path would you consider a fast one, how would you network with people from developed countries and how would you go about finding a job or do freelance projects? Which field and programming language would you take?

Can I even become skilled on my own and without actual mentorship irl? I realize remote junior jobs are hard to find and could be really inefficient. Maybe just start doing really small freelance projects and build from that? My motivation has really suffered and lately all I think is that I'm wasting time and going nowhere with this. I know it's a bad attitude but I feel limited with my city/country, with the fact that's I don't have a degree in CS, with not having an idea how to network with people from developed countries, with how hard is to establish yourself on freelancing sites, with how hard is to find clients here. Was anyone here at a similar position? Any guidance would help me immensely. I know there are a lot of posts like this, but this one is from a specific standpoint.

Prior to him moving in he had a full time job and played games after work so we could keep in touch. He moved in and did nothing for about 3 months and now school has started. He shows no interest in getting a job or internship. He wants to attend school and play games.


**Anger issues:**
When he games he is extremely angry. He games 4-6+ hours a day. We discussed it and he said he would work on it after the first time I said it was a deal breaker because he would yell and get red faced at a game, telling people to die. We talk to each other while I'm at work and last week he started going off again while playing his game. Full sentences of slurs, yelling, telling people to go hang themselves. Yelling at a computer screen while I was on the other end of the line in the office just looking dumbfounded at my phone. He gets BAD when he plays games. It caused a large argument this past weekend where I pointed out that he relapsed with his anger issues. He apologizes after and says he is working on it. Gaming continues. I told him I can't take it and he asked ""why can't you accept me for who I am?"". I've told him I don't like it and I don't want to live with it I'm not sure what else I can say. 


I suggested getting a job or internship to get out of the house and he wasn't okay with that. I suggested hobbies and he says it's too cold to golf and his bowling ball cracked 3 weeks ago so he can't bowl. There's more to do out there so I just hear more excuses. When we have these conversations he acts like I am attacking him instead of trying to help. Twists everything I say into saying that he isn't good enough. It hurts and it's frustrating. If I thought he wasn't good enough I wouldn't be trying to help him and our relationship.


He started to go off on me one day after binge gaming and I stopped him to ask why he is so worked up and he actually responded with ""I don't know"" and got quiet. Another time he started going off while he was playing and I had to hang up because he snapped at me later claiming because he was frustrated at the game. 


**Bedroom Issues**
I brought this up to him about two months ago. I was always initiating and after some time I felt unwanted because he didn't try. Later he told me he did try and claimed touching my shoulder or asking if I was on my period was trying. I explained he may need to be more direct like kissing me or touching me intimately. Well, nothing changed so I gave up. I stopped trying at all so he finally noticed because he said he was starting to feel like I did before. So now he is initiating, but his sex drive is a lot lower than mine and I'm not sure that will change.


I feel like i'm being very critical because my past few relationships ended poorly. Various reasons; cheating, mooching, etc. So now i'm paying attention to red flags and I see a ton with this guy, but I am worried I may be turning everything into a red flag. I just find it hard to be attracted to someone who does nothing but game and yell at a computer screen.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend has recurring anger issues and problems in the bedroom. We have been dating 8 months and he moved in, but I'm doubting the relationship. I feel I am being too critical because of past relationships, but some things are red flags. How should I approach it?"

But, it seems like I am decent in school subjects but am so far behind and I'll only keep falling behind. I genuinely feel like I don't have much interest in the subject compared to these people. Like in past internships when I had to learn something I was successful in teaching myself. But I just won't spend my free time learning. I guess my question is: is it possible to be a successful CS without coding in your free time? I am worried that because I am not exhibiting the same interest as my peers, I will only fall behind and lose motivation."

Here's how I have it laid out by column:

- Ranking Factor (I.E. Site Speed, Crawl Errors, Structured Data, etc.)
- Priority (numbered from most to least important)
- Urgency (1 out of 5)
- Difficulty (1 out of 5)
- Time (prospective time in hours to complete)
- Status (Stories, Removed from Queue, In-Progress, etc.)
- Status Updates (SEO intern comments on the progress being made)
- Check List (Everything the SEO intern needs to check for)
- Why It Matters (Breif explanation to the client and/or SEO intern on why the Ranking Factor needs to be cared for)
- Procedure Notes / Additional Tips (telling the SEO intern where to look)
- And then 10 extra columns dedicated to listing out important videos, articles and tools to use for understanding and/or analysing the ranking factor.

I'm currently going through articles that list out the ranking factors like the one Brian Dean posted, making notes of it, and then expanding upon the content by doing further research.

Any advice on how to turn this into the best SEO Audit Template out there is much appreciated."

5pydwa,6,2017-01-24,Advice on what I should do,anon09439125,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5pydwa/advice_on_what_i_should_do/,"I'm an senior engineering science major. I messed up on my planning, and I need advice on what to do for next year. I have one class that is only offered once a year, but I couldn't take it this academic year. So, I will be done with everything by June 2017 except for this one class. I already talked with the department, and there is nothing I can do except waiting until I can enroll for the class on Jan 2018 - March 2018.  

So, while waiting for January, I have no plan for July - December. I guess I will have to get a job, but I won't have a degree. Plus, I am at disadvantage compared to other engineers. Here are pro/con I've listed.  

Pro:  

1. I have a 1 summer intern experience at PCB material company in San Jose.
2. I passed FE mech
3. I have school projects on CAD making rovers and robots
4. I am trilingual (English, Japanese, Korean)

Con:

1.  My major is basically mechanical engineer but not ABET accredited. Some companies only pick mech eng while some companies don't care.  
2.  My GPA is sub 3.0
3. My intern experience doesn't really apply to jobs I want
4. I have no degree until March 2018

I don't know whether I should look for entry-level job that doesn't have degree requirement or look for intern job that wants students who are pursuing degree.

It's the beginning of the second week and I'm slammed with different projects.  I'm doing extensions for one manager, Another manager, Tons of basis calcs for 6 companies have many years and partners, and workpapers for our biggest client for another manager.   They all seem to want this yesterday.  I'm still learning and it takes me a long time to understand and figure things out especially if it was something I wasn't exposed to before. How do I get everything done within a 40 hr week? The partner won't let me work overtime? So I eat my hours.

The associate doesn't seem to have a lot on her list. I have more to do than she does and she leaves earlier than I do. I know it is busy season. Is it usual to give this amount of work to an intern? When I see our master project assignment list, I just find it odd that the associate has 2 projects and I have 10.

My gf and I have been together for 2 years, going to the same university but in different programs. We are both juniors, and she's been applying to internships left and right for this summer. I plan on doing research at my uni for the summer (related to my major). She recently got called back for the final round for a company that is her ""dream"" company, and I was super excited and happy for her. If she doesn't get this internship, her other option would be to stay on campus with me and work with professors.

I don't want to give much away but we both go to school in the Midwest, and her internship would be in beautiful San Francisco. She would get paid decently and get free housing with other interns, and get to work at the company HQ which looks amazing from pictures. I can see why this would be the dream internship for her. 

Yesterday, we were hanging out and I told her how proud I was for how far she's come in the interviewing process. She looked at me and took a deep breath and then told me that if she did end up getting the internship, she would break up with me. I was floored. I asked if it was the distance (the internship would be 10 weeks - we've been away for 6-7 weeks at a time and we managed it). She said no. She said that she would just be in a new environment with new people, working an internship at a really busy and cool company, and she wanted to see if there were other guys at the company she could see herself with. I honestly didn't know what to say because to me it sounded like she was breaking up with me, so I asked her (believe me I wanted to cry) if she wanted to end it. 

She looked confused and said ""no of course not, this is only if I DO get the internship. If I don't, why would I want to break up?"" I then asked her if she meant a real breakup or a ""break"" and she said ""well if I don't meet anyone I see a future with, we can get back together when I come back."" (paraphrased) I was so confused because she said she still loves me more than ever, and that she sees a future with me but just wanted to have a ""full experience"" at her internship this summer. She wasn't breaking up with me or saying she doesn't like me anymore, but at the same time I can't help but feel hurt by what she said. 

It's like I'm her second choice?? She is such a beautiful, kind, funny, and intelligent girl and never showed signs of cheating or lying. If anything, she's the one who is always critical of who I'm talking to/what I'm doing because she has this irrational fear I'll cheat on her (I won't, and I have never..)

I left her place last night after the conversation and she has acted 100% normal about it, as if we were discussing dinner date plans. I am really bad at understanding what girls mean sometime and I really don't know if I'm being oversensitive. I haven't talked to my guy friends about this because she asked me not to mention her final interview to anyone in case I ""jinx"" it. I don't know if I can trust her fully if she doesn't get the internship and we ""stay together."" Please help me reddit.

**tl;dr: girlfriend has her final round interview for her dream internship in 2 days. She told me last night that if she does get it, we would break up beacuse she wanted to date around with all the guys at the internship. I asked if she was breaking up with me or if she hated me, and she said ""ofc not! We are only breaking up if I don't get the internship, otherwise why would I break up?"" I feel hurt and don't know what to do.**"
5pymru,0,2017-01-24,Should I be hopeful about any of my 59 applications to Intel? General advise needed for recent grad.,party_g0er,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pymru/should_i_be_hopeful_about_any_of_my_59/,"I will finally graduate with a BS in Computer Science from a top tier Latin American university by April. I got a 3.83 / 4 GPA, but I have virtually no professional experience besides a 3 month job and a couple of teacher assistant positions. And I'm no particularly good at anything other than Haskell and Linux usage.  

I've been anxiously searching the local job market, but I've only found web development jobs with shitty pay. Last night I noticed that Intel is posting a lot of job openings for recent grads that don't ask for experience and that seemed a good fit to me; I ended up sending 59 applications all over the world. So far I've already been rejected three times; two because they are already taken, and the other one because it was an internship position (which  I think I can't get anymore). Anyway, should I be hopeful about any of this applications?

Are there other big companies that are hiring international grads without experience? Any advice on getting a decent paying job that is not web development will be highly appreciated."
5pynwb,4,2017-01-24,Trouble getting interviews for jobs I know I'm qualified for.,JustCallMeHandy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5pynwb/trouble_getting_interviews_for_jobs_i_know_im/,"I've been looking for full-time work in my industry off-and-on while between contracts for the last 3 years. I have nearly 10 years of experience within my field as well. I left my last full-time position because the owner of the company passed away and the company was liquidated.

I have immense difficulty even landing initial interviews for positions that I know I'm qualified for and I'm not entirely sure why. I reach out to recruiters, network as often as I can, and generally work very hard to make sure I'm not just another resume in the pile.

All of my contracts have left me with positive references, and good experiences overall, but it's difficult to find a company looking to hire somebody to do my line of work full-time.

I'm an Event Manager. And in the professional world there are really only 4(5) types of event managers.

* Hotels / Hospitality / Country Club
 * Won't hire from the outside except in rare circumstances - would rather train you up from a Front Desk or Concierge agent or have a lateral transfer from another hotel.

* Corporate / Fundraising
 * This job often has its basic responsibilities chopped up and handed to various marketing employees, so it doesn't exist as a standalone position. Other times this job isn't even posted online/publicly, so you need to know who specifically to call and speak to to find out if they're looking for an EM.
 * If this job wasn't chopped into various other positions and you actually manage to find it, grab on and never let go...

* Arena / Sports Contract
 * If you thought Hotels and Hospitality were exclusive clubs, boy have you got a huge surprise waiting for you. Good luck getting one of these jobs without aggressively competitive internships or sheer blind luck.
 * After a contract with a local sports team I was told that if I wanted to go full-time with them I would need to work my way up from their minimum-wage, part-time street team positions. This is considered the norm.

* Event Service Companies
 * These places typically want you to have all sorts of certifications and qualifications - which isn't bad in and of itself. But then they want you to come in and work 80+ hour weeks for what is typically severely under-market pay. They often tend to be very shady companies that change their names frequently to avoid bad reviews, and you're lucky if you aren't running headfirst into an MLM scam.

And for the parenthetical 5.... there's always Wedding Planning.

At this point it's getting to the part where I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning.

Several times a ""dream opportunity"" has opened up with companies I'd love to work for, I customize my resume for the position and apply, and then either never hear back, or get an immediate ""Thanks but no thanks"" standard form response.

I guess I'm just frustrated, de-motivated, and to tell it truthfully starting to struggle with depression as a result of this.

Just looking for some career advice.

I'm currently a masters student studying HCI, having done a bachelor's degree in computer science. I took the masters program hoping to go into UX. I had done a few engineering internships prior and found them okay, just a little boring.


I'm at the point of applying for jobs now and I feel like I don't have enough experience to land a solid UX job. The master's course i'm on is only one year so my UX design portfolio is quite short. I'm also starting to get the impression that UX is often treated as a small/unimportant part of many companies, e.g. ideas often ignored, no clear job descriptions.  I believe I could a lot more easily get a software engineering job. But then maybe I won't enjoy it as much.


I'd like to know what people think about the job market for UX vs. engineering. Should I persist with pursuing a UX career with little experience, is it worth it? Has anyone had experience of how the two jobs compare? I know this is subjective but I'd appreciate some guidance.


Thanks

And we all have our opinions on whether they should or shouldn't. This isn't about that. I wanted to see how many ways I could come up with for the movies to reference the tv shows without having title characters appear or mentioning specific events.

1. **New York Bulletin**
PRO: Very easy. They need set dressing anyway; why not use something they already have graphics for?
CON: This would probably only show up in a Spider-Man movie, in which case they'd probably use the Daily Bugle instead.

2. **Mentioning the Kingpin**
PRO: connects the Kingpin back to Spider-Man and provides a larger look at the crime dynamic in New York
CON: arguably a waste of time if they don't plan to do anything with it, especially since they could mention Silvermane or Hammerhead instead and actually follow up on it.

3. **Phil Urich**
PRO: An intern or fresh reporter at the Bugle living in the shadow of an uncle who died for the job would be a compelling supporting character.
CON: ...if they mention it. If they don't, he's basically as good as no connection at all.

4. **TrishTalk**
PRO: A pro-superhero news voice would provide an interesting contrast to the Daily Bugle, or they could just have ads for the show as set dressing.
CON: Actually using the show would require Rachael Taylor, which would lock her in to surviving to a certain point.

5. **Patsy Walker**
PRO: easy to print a comic or poster or mention in passing
CON: no real reason to do so

6. **Judas bullets**
PRO: powerful weapon that doesn't need explanation
CON: potentially dilutes the supposed rarity of them

7. **Seagate Prison**
PRO: bad guys go to and from prisons all the time
CON: location of prison may make it unrealistic to use

8. **General Talbot**
PRO: major Hulk character; able to fill any generic military role
CON: limits what *Agents of SHIELD* can do with him

9. **Man-Thing**
PRO: could be used in a headline or supporting role; details from the show are limited so there's little to contradict
CON: not many places to use him outside of his own movie, which is unlikely to be made (although he could appear in a *Doctor Strange* sequel)

10. **Dogs of Hell Motorcycle Club**
PRO: all it takes is a costuming choice
CON: I don't see much use for a motorcycle gang in the movies

11. **Rand Corporation**
PRO: provides set dressing; it'd be nice for companies besides Stark and Roxxon to show up in the movies
CON: For all we know, Rand could be defunct by the end of *Iron Fist*

12. **Heavenly Cities**
PRO: could be a nice throwaway reference in a *Doctor Strange* sequel
CON: doesn't add much

13. **Mentioning Jarvis**
PRO: all it takes is a mention or a picture, but could be as much as a flashback; could provide a humanizing moment for Tony
CON: there may not be a place for it

14. **Older Daniel Sousa**
PRO: it'd be interesting to see what became of other SSR members; could be used in any generic government role
CON: since it'd probably be a new actor, the impact might not be the same

15. **Have Enver Gjokaj’s cop return as Sgt. Sousa**
PRO: calls back to The Avengers as well as Agent Carter; solves a casting issue; confirms a fan theory; could provide a neat supporting character for Spider-Man (pro-superhero cop)
CON: I don't see any cons; they should definitely do this."

Now I'm not complaining since I've been searching for a 2017 internship for a while and am very glad I have made it to the interview process already but I never really thought I would Co op so early on, and especially as my first real job in the field. I'm naive when it comes to this stuff. Is there any detriment or advantage to accepting a Co op so early or opposed to an internship?

Also my future interviewer said that the position (assistant project manager, ie I shadow the main PM) is 80% management and 20% coding/engineering. I don't mind managing at all, but should I be worried about this? I wanted an internship to A) hone my application skills in a real world context B) open the door for future employers. I feel like Assistant PM may not be the best for A.

I'm probably over thinking this and taking a good opportunity for granted but I'd like some advice from more experienced people first."

My major is Management Information Systems, but I'm trying to take more CS classes on the side.

My academic history has been sporadic, changing majors 4 times and taking over 4 year leave of absence. I have no work or internship experience. I do have a 3.95 GPA, though I know CS recruiters don't care about GPA as much as they do experience. 

Apart from being familiar with excel (basic vba), Access (not SQL), I've yet to take any other courses relevant to my major. My school likes to save those classes until senior year. I have done a couple tech consulting related case competitions, but I don't know how relevant that experience is. 

I've taken an intro to programming class that covered basics using python. My final project for this class was side-scrolling arcade game using pygame.

I also took an intro to object oriented programming class using Java. My final project for that was a calculator GUI. 

I went to one hackathon, but I wasn't able to contribute much aside from being the idea man. Both projects were written in javascript by my teamates.  I spent the entire time trying to teach myself HTML/CSS and most of my work was corrected by my more experienced teammates. 

At this point, I'm not even sure what I'm doing. I technically could be graduating next semester, but I feel very ill equipped and might post-pone graduation to take more classes or possibly pursue a masters in CS. 

I still don't really understand the field and job opportunities. I feel like you need to have background knowledge just to understand what some of these job positions even do. 

I'd personally rather spend my summer learning, but everybody from family, friends, advisors, professors, are telling me an internship would be a better use of my time.

So, what should I be looking for? What am I qualified for?
I appreciate your help guys. 

EDIT: Hey guys, I really appreciate the passion, but I'm looking for more concrete answers to specific type of internship positions. Every listing I find seems to want qualifications I don't have. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places or maybe I should be applying despite not having the qualifications they're looking for. My programming skills are really just limited to rudimentary python/java or that of a freshman in a computer science program. "

I'm leaning towards ATT (mostly because of what I've read on this sub) but their pay is significantly lower than IBM's. COL would be similar between both locations.

Long time reader, first time complainer.

Me and you, we go way back. I remember sitting in my one bedroom apartment checking your site daily for updates on the rapist-in-chief President Clinton's ongoing little problem with a certain intern.

I remember the day that we broke the Internet when the Starr Report came out. All of us early Internet adopters overloaded servers trying to get our hands on it. It occurred to me then, I'm reading this report the same time the accused President was. Maybe this Internet thing was really going to stick around for a while.

Over the years, I've gotten older, news has changed but your site never has. My daily source of aggregated headlines that keep me informed. I'm some of your billion clicks.

Matt, (I feel I can call you Matt because of the years we've been together) things have changed. 2016 saw a rogue candidate flip a middle finger to the established press. Instead of admitting their bias, they doubled down. We know who the are (NY TIMES, WaPo, CNN...) 

I refuse...REFUSE to send on of my valuable clicks to their sites. Never again will I allow an advertiser on CNN to count my visit and believe they have made a smart investment getting in bed with the devil.

Here, Matt, is where we have a problem. I'm finding myself visiting your site less because I can't tell from my smart device where my click will go.

What I ask of you is simple. When you are linking the a site like New York Times, please title it as follows: NYT:.

If I visit your site and see the title ""NYT: Reports suggest Trump to abolish babies"" I will know to avoid this link. I'm afraid that without this change, I can't come back.

Dev Spectating mode, to spot cheaters (manual detection)?

    000000001D1E.07C: Custom Game (DEV ONLY) // did someone already bypass that?
This is quite interesting. This is apparently in the main menu (where you select Quick Play / Competetive / Arcade...) and there will be a special option if you have such an ""dev"" account? So you can modify the game?

    0000000018E2.07C: Beta Notification
    0000000018E3.07C: PRESS &lt;tx0C000000000044AF&gt; TO CONTINUE
    0000000018E4.07C: Overwatch is beta, pre-release software.
So you can start a few beta features when logging in with a special ""dev"" account? Maybe old HUD (which i love :P)?

    00000000230F.07C: Beta Build
This is after 0000000022D8 and 0000000022D9 which are the login strings for XBOX / PS4

    0000000045E8.07C: Beta Build
And finally this is before 0000000045FC which says ""Toggle Guardian Angel""... Maybe an ingame HUD displaying ""Beta Build""?

So is it possible to get ""beta"" / Blizzard intern Builds onto our computers?
could maybe be exploited with an memory hack... I know that you could modify the Memory with Cheat Engine back in the closed beta, maybe you could still do it?

That would be so funny if someone had ""God Mode"" in an live game and you could just make a fun out of it (closing server, changing map, ...) xD

Here is my resume and I would like all of the advice I could get.

Some extra info:

I am a 3rd year college student looking for an internship in the business world. After this semester is finished, I will have 2 semesters to go before I graduate.

This is formatted the same way my actual resume is formatted but with fake names, obviously. For the references section, I have their real names and the school that I met them at but I do not have their contact information inside and I'm not sure if I need to include it there. Also for relevant coursework, I plan on changing the courses included to be more specific to whatever employment I'm looking for. 

If there are others who know of certificates that I could include to really help my resume I would appreciate that alot. I saw one of the top posts in this subreddit about free certificates and I do plan on involving myself in that, but I also don't mind paying for an online course or two that will really help my skills.

If this helps, I recently had an internship interview at a major company nearby, and I got crushed because I wasn't very strong in Microsoft Excel, so any certificates or courses based on Microsoft Office would be a godsend. I already got my feet wet in r/Excel, but if anyone else has anything to add I'm all ears.

Should I change this to

 * Time Spent on Individual Site/Page

5q0kiy,2,2017-01-24,"About at wit's end with ""friends"", family, unemployment, life.",mateoenfuego,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5q0kiy/about_at_wits_end_with_friends_family/,"I wasn't diagnosed officially/medically until last year (I was 31), but I was able to get doctors to prescribe me Addy pretty much wherever I moved since college. Knowing what I know now, it was so freaking obvious that I had ADHD as a kid, but my parents (one of whom is a TEACHER) had zero understanding/empathy for my constant (and I mean constant) talking, fidgeting, arguing, emotional outbursts (I learned to mostly control (well, internalize and conceal) those by the end of high school...with caveats), avoiding homework to extreme degrees (but I did well in school regardless) and general wild nature at heart (still have that honestly). 

I had quite a lot of trauma as a kid/teenager...Im sure you can imagine what I mean...so I'm sure that contributed to my inability or lack of desire to conform to what was expected of me since I was betrayed in the worst way by multiple ""authority figures""...so what's the point? I've been diagnosed with PTSD. 

So, once I got away from my parents house &amp; home town &amp; source of despair and got to university (a big, state uni), I absolutely flourished. It was like a dream come true. I finally found friends who I loved and who loved me, who enjoyed everything I did, who didn't peg me as the fag or even think about doing such a thing. My brain is perfectly suited to university life: Making your matriculation path, planning your schedule, joining whatever extra-curriculars you can imagine (my high school class had a total of 28 people in it, so clubs were very limited and pathetic). I studied abroad in Spain for a year, and this has when I really discovered myself. It was truly and utterly life changing and affirming. 

I graduated with a couple degrees and did an internship in SoHo (NYC), coupled with all my college accolades, I and my mentors pretty much thought I was on the fast track to success. I moved to NYC and started my life. I hadn't been on Addy for a while and sort of forgot about it (irony). I quickly became overwhelmed due to being dropped alone in a sharp tank with very little money and no support of any sort (not just financial). Actually my mother was actively undermining my confidence and ability to focus. I hated my father my whole life...and the feeling was mutual I'm sure. 

I began an unbelievable and steady stream of self-destructive behavior. It was like I wanted pleasure, stimulation, punishment, failure, a 'reason' for depression, attention and peace. I guess I forgot to mention that I had suppressed memories of my childhood all through college, and they surfaced big time in NYC. I was a mess. My boss reminded me of someone who abused the shit out of me, but I felt like I couldn't quit bc it's expensive to live in NYC and my parents would have loved for me to just go back home. So, I felt trapped. Just like when I was a kid. Anyway, my untreated ADHD was juicing hard along with unbearable PTSD. I still didn't seek treatment. 

I eventually can't take it and move back to the big city near where I grew up in the Midwest. I continued my spiral. No treatment. Got a good job through a friend and ended up having it for three years. But the same issues eventually popped back up. I started to get treated for adhd at the end of the second year, but it wasn't soon enough. Lost the job for losing my temper (essentially) with a numbnuts sales rep colleague after explaining the same shit ten times at least 

Oh, I also apparently have a blood clotting disorder and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which cause dozens of blood clots in my lungs. Almost died. Have to take blood thinners for the rest of my life and I'm in pain 24/7. So, blah blah blah, I get painkillers from a friend and like an amateur I forgot what I was doing and got busted. Felony. On top of two DUIs over the past five years. And now can't work or make money in the short term, so, back to you know where...my parents house. And I'm here now. I hate everything, especially life. I have one ""friend"" and I hate her. I am nothing like the people here...I'm not better, just different. This friend constantly uses me and lies to my face as if I'm a fucking idiot. But there's nowhere to meet people in this shitty town. 

Why am I writing this? I guess to get it off my chest because nobody knows the entire story (and this isn't even that I guess). But I keep parts separate from each other for different people. So I'm just bitching. "

I just started an internship through my college and had a couple of questions. Our group has a general goal of collecting data about user's browsing habits and we are looking for a couple of different options before we pick one to develop. The current idea is to create extensions/add-on's for all the popular browsers and then have the user's sign in so that we can send the data generated back to a single back-end system. For right now we are focused just on the desktop environment but eventually we would like to try to develop something in the mobile sphere of things, sadly only Firefox has mobile add-on support. The data we are looking to collect is stuff like:

 * Individual Page URL's
 * User's Actions (What is possible here? i.e. clicks, selections, mouse movements)
 * Site Content and Page Content (What website is it/What is on the page)
 * Time Spent on Individual Site/Page
 * Which page is gone to (Could we generate a map of the different pages visited?)

Another idea that was floated was a standalone application on both Windows and Mac that would collect this data without browser integration but I have no idea how practical that is. What are some technologies we could use to generate and collect this data? I just have a background with front-end web development through school so how would I go about learning what it takes to set up a back-end system that would universally accept the data we want to collect from all the different systems our users would use? Thanks for any time or consideration."

I was born in USA, but raised 4yo-22yo in Indonesia.

I was graduated in some low-accredited University, majoring in Computer Tech (B.S. degree).

Right after I graduated, I moved to USA. Immidieately struggling finding IT job as they asking internships (which I didn't do and not a mandatory in my uni) and being graduated from a decent uni.

Living with very narrow skillset really lock me down.

I'm living paycheck to paycheck now as an Administrative Assistant. Not because it pays low, but I have family to paid aboard. It's already a full time with benefits. Hence part time work/school can be difficult.

I keep thinking if there's such a thing as ""weekend part time IT jobs""? Those who just asked for basic understanding of networking. Or even further trained database admin who monitors and report system's health.

Any suggestion appreciated."

I'm in kind of a pinch - I'm asthmatic, and my last rescue inhaler is nearly out (my fault, I have been using it more often than usual this month and wasn't bright enough to check the doses until two days ago). 

I only recently moved back to Gainesville after an internship, and only ever saw the school doctor, so I don't yet have a primary care doctor here. I called every doctor that is covered by my insurance, but could not find an open appointment until next week Friday at the earliest. Obviously at that point, I will be able to get a prescription filled, but until then I am kind of fucked.

I know that I could go to an urgent care center, but I am a recently cut-off college grad and that would absolutely kill my bank account. Does anyone know if there is a free clinic or something like that in Gainesville that I could go to? Or does anyone have an albuterol inhaler they aren't using? I have money, but I don't have money for an ER bill. I really suffer without it, and watching the doses tick down is starting to be scary. I figure I've got about 2-3 days left at this point.

I know it's unlikely - I'm just taking a shot in the dark to see if anyone can help out. Thanks, guys."

I have been applying for any IT helpdesk job or related jobs for the past month only. I wasn't expecting much interviews because I honestly lack the IT job history on my resume but I've been doing stuff here and there personally to compensate for it I believe.
Anyways, I get 3 job interviews in the span of last than a week and a half but I had applied for the positions about a week in advance before getting notified. I was currently a student full time last semester but I wanted to get into the field and gain something useful for my career and future. 

My first interview was for the job of a IT helpdesk clerk. I honestly felt the interview went great but now that I think about it.. I didn't sell myself well enough to the hiring manager there. I didn't get a reply, but it did give me some idea how to take care of my future interviews about this career. Like what questions to ask them etc.

My second interview was for the position of a Hardware Technician which seemed great because I loved dissembling computer/laptop hardware and working on them. I thought this was the job for me because the interview consisted of 5 people in the same room with me. I was shocked and quite nervous immediately when I was greeting them all. The interview made me forget so much things because of the presence in the room. I easily forgot what non-volatile ram was. I am also MTA certified since last summer which I am glad that I took the class for in college. After the interviews of these two jobs I got no reply after.

Finally, the last job interview was for the position of the IT Internship! I immediately felt in no way am I going to land this position because of my qualifications and experience. I felt like a beginner in my mental thinking of it. The interviewer was nice and patient. He told me that HR kept sending him people with a Masters or a Bachelors degree. He said he was looking for someone who is excitingly wanting to enter into the field, probably because I said it at the very beginning of our interview when we exchanged a few words. I felt good about the interview and then he gave me a laptop and told me to take out the ram and hard drive. I didn't take out the back panel at all. I went straight to the battery and took that off for safety measure and he was shocked saying no one ever did that before. I felt like I hit jackpot after that and continued to take off the back panel. He stopped me immediately after that and said you know what you are doing, so there's no point in going further. We ended the interview shortly after that test.

This interview was conducted on Friday and I was waiting what felt like forever to get any sort of response. I also sent a thank you email to their HR for how well the interviewer and company treated me there. It was a nice experience tbh. I finally got the call of acceptance this Sunday which took a load of pressure off my shoulders because I kept thinking that I probably will have to keep applying everywhere for a chance to work in this field with no near professional experience.

TLDR: Went to three interviews and the last one was for an IT Internship role which accepted me and I feel like I hit the jackpot because this was perfectly what I wanted!

Sorry for the long post!"

    - Plato 

Bob was born in a small quiet town called Middleton, Illinois. Bob's parents were right wing conservatives and raised Bob to be a good, humble Christian. Bob was vice president of Central High's student body government. He was shortstop of his baseball team, who ranked no. two in the county. Bob was well to do and extremely stable; if stable could be extreme. Bob felt secure; he knew everyone in his small town, and he'd been to every store and has had the same group of friends since he could remember. But Bob was bored. Bob was bored of his friends, of his town, the stores, people and most of all his life. 
When Bob was nine years old, he visited the city of Chicago, where he saw the tall buildings, bridges and people. The memory of that place: the sparkling lights, the grand hotel room with a standing shower and four star restaurant on the lobby floor, stayed with Bobby. In his Junior Year at Central High School, Bob applied to three Universities. All of them were out of state and in very big cities: NYU in New York, UCSD in San Diego, USC in Los Angeles and Miami State in Florida. He decided he wanted to try Los Angeles. A year later, he was on a nonstop flight to the city of LA with a couple hundred bucks in his wallet, and a father for a lawyer and a mother who taught English at the local community college, feeding his bank account. 

Richard was born at the USC Medical Hospital, just about a couple and a half months after Bob, in Los Angeles, California. Richard lived in a small suburban area in LA called Granview. Granview was a drug and gang infested neighborhood that was almost daily reported by shootings or robberies on the local news channel. Rick joined a notorious gang, the Granview Crazy Mob when he was just twelve years old. He grew up wanting to be the baddest, richest gangster on the block. He got locked up at the Los Angeles Juvenile Detention Center for grand theft auto just a couple years later. He was sentenced to a year and a half and got out a year later with a GED and good behavior. Thinking ahead was not his forte. When he got out, he had only two choices; go back to his gang or get a job. 

It was the summer of 2020, Bob had just finished his first year at USC. He had good grades and was super confident that this summer would be one of the best he's ever had. Bobby had joined the fraternity Lambda Beta Epsilon where he successfully become a pledged member. He applied and been admitted to his first internship at the Angelina Biology Lab Center. Bob had a lot to look forward to near the end of his first year at the University. 

It was early mid-July when Bob's parents received the horrifying news. Bob had been in a car accident. He was walking home one night after a party at the Lambda house when he was hit in a car accident by someone who obviously didn't give a f*ck and ran off. Bob's parents were on the first flight back to be by his side at the nearby USC Medical Center. 

Rick tried the job thing. He pushed carts at the parking lot of the local Roll-Mart. He was getting paid fifteen bucks an hour while working twenty hours a week. The rest of his time he was either getting high or playing video games or both. He was getting fed up. He was fed up with the way people talked to him at the Roll-Mart, he was fed up with the way people kept leaving their carts in the middle of the driving lane every two minutes and he was fed up with the way his boss paid him when he felt like it. One day, Rick was picking up some weed from a friend when they got a call. Supposedly, a group of them had beef with a rival gang from a neighboring block. It had started with a girlfriend of one of the gang members and had escalated into a fight where someone got stabbed. They were looking for retaliation. Rick decided to roll with his old crew. He apparently didn't know that the other gang was going to roll by that night with a fully automatic weapon and open fire. They were lucky that nobody got hit, except Rick. Rick had been hit twice; once in the shoulder and another in the chest. His friends tried to rush him to the hospital when unfortunately, the driver couldn't pay enough attention to the road. 

The light turned a blurry hazy green, maybe a bit blue, he wasn't sure, and he took a couple steps off the curb and into the street. Bob had had a few too many when he decided to walk back to his apartment just a couple blocks away. That's when the black '99 Ford Impala plowed straight into him. Bob was lucky it was a busy street because if someone hadn't called the ambulance just a few minutes earlier, he probably wouldn't have made it. 

Rick and Bob both ended up at the USC Medical Emergency Room. Though both had come from different walks of life, right now, none of that mattered. Rick and Bob looked at each other in wonder, as they stood in line. Then they both looked around. Everything was white but it was also red. It felt strangely comforting but at the same time terrifying. They both stood there, not knowing, wondering and contemplating. It did not come into their heads to look straight in front or to look back. Neither did it occur to them to ask any of the other people waiting in the line. Rick and Bob just continued to stare into each others eyes as if in a daze, then everything turned black. Rick and Bob did not know but their lives would never be the same again. 

Doctor Patterson in the emergency room had used the defibrillator to revive Rick while at the same time Doctor Hanish had also been using the same electrical shock to revive Bob. Amazingly, like an act of God, the electricity for the entire region had gone into a rolling black-out. Fortunately for Rick and Bob and everybody else in the hospital, the hospital's back-up electrical battery fired up right in time. Unfortunately, for Rick and Bob and nobody else in the hospital, their souls, which had been in a purgatory-like transcendental state, had crossed paths through the electrical current that ran through and cut off at exactly the precise moment the power blacked out. This had created a dilemma, one that nobody on earth could comprehend, that nobody in their right mind would believe. Rick and Bob's souls had been revived into their bodies at exactly the same moment through exactly the same current of energy but crossing each other at opposite electrodes to occupy each others' bodies.

I just started my internship at a semi small company (about 60 people here). So please be gentle :)

My department boss wants a web-based system like netdisco, observium etc. but want to be able to search for an LAN IP and find the computer and which switch + port it is on. So far I have tried mrtg, netdisco and observium without luck.

I have setup SNMP on all switches (HP) with a community. Most of them can only run SNMP v2 it seems (if that matters)

Is this even possible? He says a guy who worked there before (like 3 years maybe) made it possible, but they lost the backup of the system.

How would you advice me to go forward? Should I look into doing it with shell scripts, look at other tools etc.?

I would prefer the system to be run by Linux, but I'm open to suggestions.

Oh also, it can cost a bit of money (they are okay spending like maybe 200-300$ a year, but probably not much more) but free would be awesome :D

Kind regards

I'm looking for work (junior front end dev) and trying to fill in any gaps I might have in my knowledge. Finding a first job is damn tough!

The shitstorm I've been getting from my family lately is horrible. My mom is obsessed with me and what I'm doing. She needs a psych more than me. She's literally stuck in a though loop of obsessing over me. It's likely she thinks I'm wasting my time and should go back to college. My sister thinks the same. They must have forgotten about how we can't afford our mortgage anymore and we need money to pay for the house. 

Neither of them believe I have ADHD or understand how fucking debilitating it can be. They think I'm a loser college dropout who sits at home all day. They tell me I've been doing this for 3 years, when I'm relatively new to having self-control (excluding that horrible Indian medicine, it's been &lt; 3 months). 

Now that I'm on meds, I'm fucking trying. HARD. I'm working on my laptop at least 10 hours a day if not more. I'm going to meetups and hiring events. I'm marketing myself on social media. I can't remember the last time I took a day off anymore. 

I know we're going through hard times, but does that really justify the verbal abuse I get? I'm starting to consider leaving my family completely and moving out of their lives. I miss the old days. :(

5q3cu4,2,2017-01-25,Should I Leave My Toxic Internship ASAP?,MonolithyK,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5q3cu4/should_i_leave_my_toxic_internship_asap/,"So I currently work in a paid internship position ($15 an hour), and just started last week. I graduated last semester with a degree in multimedia, and found this position in graphic design, but it is more so spreadsheet management than graphic work - so it's busy work and not any kind of learning. I'm wondering, given the following info, if I shouldn't just leave without giving a proper 2 weeks notice.

So this company is an incredibly small company that makes and sells dental equipment to countries abroad, since they do not have the proper license from the FDA to sell within the united states. My job is to arrange all of their proper documents and text files so that their FDA application runs smoothly - which means hours and hours of referencing catalogue ID's, numerical guides, spreadsheets, and writing legal clauses. What's funny is, all of the InDesign files are already done - all of the designing components anyway, so I spend my days editing text blocks in PDF's using Acrobat. I have yet to even touch Illustrator or Photoshop. They have had the same pamphlets, fliers and brochures for years since the owner does not want to change the company's visual identity. . . So why even hire a designer? This is not the job I thought it was, or the job they told me about. This is merely hours and hours of busy work.

These are some of the other things they didn't tell me in the interview. . .Right now, the company may be small, and still calls itself a ""startup"" - even though it started in early 2012. This was clearly a stunt. Red flag #1.  My first day was more of a ""test"" day, which was an unlaid gauge of how fast I can work, but the owner of the company yelled at me because taking a lunch break showed that I was undedicated to the company. I didn't even work there yet. I discovered that people are harassed for wanting to leave on time, or take more than a 15 minute lunch. I figured I could at least give it a chance, and that these these little things would just pan out. 

On my first paid day, I did not sign a contract of any kind, but made an verbal agreement to show up on time. I still have yet to sign any kind of paperwork. I am not bound to any kind of contract or time frame - I am pretty sure they expect people to leave if this is the case. . . The ""agreement"" was to show up at 8:00 AM, leave by 6:00 PM on most nights, and sometimes stay longer but with no overtime pay. I am paid a flat 8 hour day, sometimes with no lunch break (because if you do, you are a savage time waster who has no passion for the job). I was also told that they typically write out their paychecks once every two weeks, but I'm not even sure if I believe that - especially when I don't even know if my name is in record, or if they know my last name.

The workload is equivalent to an actual career position, and I am the only one in the office who has the relevant experience in any actual graphic design (yet the position is still considered an internship). If I left, and they actually NEED graphics made, they would be screwed. I have seen other job openings with the same workload and basic description, NOT EVEN in graphic design, paying between $30 and $40 an hour with a 401K and benefits. So I am essentially working at half price with no benefits and no contract of any kind. I bet if I quit tomorrow, they wouldn't even have a file to get rid of.

My boss, apparently, has also been accused of malpractice in his dental career. He has wronged a lot of people, owes money in medical damages and unlaid loans, and cuts corners in both his own work, and in the company he owns. For instance: his only graphic designer is an intern. Most of his other employees only last about 3 months. Maybe if he called the position an ""internship,"" he could lure people in with the prospect of expanding their craft. I guess he succeeded in that regard, but I haven't learned anything thus far.

So I have taken it upon myself to secretly go to other job interviews on my lunch break. I did one yesterday, and this new company may call me back in the coming days - the interview went extremely well. Sure, I take 50 minutes to a full hour to take these interviews, and I have received flak for doing so, but I think it is worth it. I am also being contacted via LinkedIn from people urging me to apply to actual positions that are not internships, and have actual need for an artist. It is only a matter of days until I get a full-on opportunity that is actually in my field and industry.

If I were to leave this place, I would also have a fairly decent amount of money to live for a solid few weeks without work. Luckily, the fiscal risk of leaving just isn't real at the moment - I get enough money from weekend commissions. Also, I would probably never hear from this dental company, or worry about them ever again - since they have no actual ties to anything in my target industry. This would have little-to-no effect on my future employment, since I am getting out of a toxic work environment for my wellbeing. I saw this as more of a transitional  ""job"" anyway that wouldn't last more than a few months, but if I feel that it would be unhealthy for me to stay any longer than I need to.  Should I inform my supervisor and duck out soon?

My intentions weren’t 100% altruistic — I mostly just needed a distraction and a place to be other than at home, sulking. Somehow, I figured the best way to approach my depression was to visit a place that would be ten times more depressing: an old folks’ home.”

5q3e7c,3,2017-01-25,Legality of university 'internship' in return for free MSc,unithrowaway90,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/5q3e7c/legality_of_university_internship_in_return_for/,"Hi, 

I'm in desperate need of any legal advice you can give to me regarding a university 'internship' advertised as a scholarship / bursary to work for 400 hours in return for the masters fees to be paid.

I have been working this 'internship' and have so far done approximately one third of the hours with great difficulty. At the beginning I made them aware of some medical conditions affecting certain roles I can do within the organisation which they have disregarded, setting me tasks I cannot complete, and as a result i'm strongly considering withdrawing but i'm worried about the financial implications.

My question really: Is this allowed to be advertised as an internship? Because we have set roles and are not doing any shadowing or anything of the such, really it is work, and should therefore be paid? Or can they advertise it as such as make 'payment' by offering the MSc in return for the work undertaken?

Since I have no working rights as an intern, I get no holiday or sickness leave, and since i'm subject to discrimination in the workplace I have no comeback?

Ideally I don't want to withdraw from the program, I just want a job role which takes into account my health difficulties and could do with some advice about how to approach the university?

Thanks"
5q3jng,55,2017-01-25,"I visited brooklyn recently, and living in Arkansas now seems so horrible in comparison. But I can't leave because I just got married.",Metronomy515,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5q3jng/i_visited_brooklyn_recently_and_living_in/,"I used to be a rural girl, hating on city people and thinking they were all snobby pricks. I could not understand why ANYONE would want to live in a major city, it was incomprehensible. 

4 months ago, I got invited to stay at my friends place in Brooklyn for 20 days. Asked my husband (married 9 months ago) and he said I could go without him but he cant because of his job. 

So I went by myself. I cant even describe how amazing it was. I have NEVER BEEN TO A PLACE LIKE THIS. I kind of assumed everyone in NYC was rich hipster liberals but this just was the opposite of the truth, people REALLY struggle here. We went from a Russian/Ukrainian neighborhood, to a jamaican/haitian neighborhood, to an orthodox jewish neighborhood, to a chinese neighborhood all in about 3 hours of walking around! It seemed like every neighborhood had such a distinct feeling to it, all the ethnic enclaves and everything was just so amazing. 

We went to warehouse parties in Bushwick, we hung out at a punk show, we went to a rave, we went to a place called Barcade, we got halal food, we took the subway everywhere instead of driving. We saw people hanging out on the streets and the stoops, we saw kids playing soccer in the street, we saw broken fire hydrants and kids playing under them. the streets felt alive. In Arkansas, NOBODY IS OUTSIDE, everyone is either in their car or at work or in their homes, there is zero street culture. In Brooklyn, just walking around a few blocks meant a plethora of interesting people and stuff to see. 

Every night was something new. Whether it was a dominican block party, or a cool underground club, or some weird warehouse venue, or even just hanging out on the streets and passing by people you knew. It felt magical, it felt like how I wanted to live in my life. The different cultures, ethnicities, the blasting booming music on street corners, the smell of pot (which i tried for the first time), the feeling of semi-lawlessness, the fact that you can just hang out on your stoop and have people hang out with you walking by, there is a warmth and excitement to it that i never really knew. 

And people here really work hard too! I stereotyped people living in cities as sort of lazy and working as social media interns and not having 'real' jobs but the people here work hard as hell! Way, way more than people back home. There are hipsters here, theres no doubt about that, but they seem immensely outnumbered by the working poor immigrants here who make up most of brooklyn. We went to williamsburg, and I quickly discovered why people dont like williamsburg in the rest of brooklyn, because it is what people from outside of Brooklyn think of brooklyn. 

Every stereotype that I had about this city has been flipped on its head honestly. I feel like all of the things I learned living in arkansas about this city, that people who live in cities are pretentious and lazy and dont work hard, and that they are all rich and dont talk to each other, and they dont go outside, blah blah blah.... i find these things more true about my old hometown. 

So I went back to my old hometown after. I went back to my husband, I went back to my parents and grandparents and neighbors. I cant even describe how depressed I am now. This place... it is not a real community. I feel like I have experienced what the city life has to offer and now i want more, i  want to go back. I feel TRAPPED here like never before. We went to the local bar/restaurant and we just sat there and talked... and i swear to god it felt like the energy was being drained out of me. They... talked about crops, and the new neighbor and what the neighbors kids was wearing, and how the school got a new paint job... I felt angst, I feel like this is not somewhere I want to be all of the sudden. The people here are so just lazy and fat and bigoted and just uncultured and ignorant!! God I sound exactly like a city person, which i would have hated a year ago, but my god its fucking true! These people are not living any form of a real life! This is so sad. 

I will never forget my time in NYC and the sheer contrast it had to my life in arkansas. The feeling of true socialization and community fun, the crazy block parties, the feeling that you could just roam brooklyn and see fun and interesting stuff, the different cultures, the vibe... everything. It is the superior way of life. I cannot see the positives to living in Arkansas unless your retired or something. Yet people here DESPISE city culture and see it in this horrible light. I am married now to my wonderful husband, we plan on having children after I turn 25 in 4 months, and so I likely wont ever leave. But holy shit, I will never erase those beautiful memories. "

My bachelors is in Computer Science, and I'm 75% through an MSc. in ""Computer Science"" though the programme has a more pretentious title and involved a consultancy project, living abroad (China), entrepreneurship/design classes and working with 2 companies (one at home, and a partner company in China). 

I worked alongside my undergrad as a Software Developer. I can program, I like it, but I don't want it to be my 9-5. The best part of that role was the stakeholder engagement, translating the requirements of stakeholders into software, though as a developer I was limited in this capacity. 

I'm about to commence a marketing internship alongside my MSc. The internship is a digital marketing role, which is exciting, but that alone won't be enough to land a job in the field and I'm keen to not stray too far from my tech roots. I hope it can give me a good insight into how organisations function (it's a $XXXmillion funded start-up).

What jobs exist for people like me. I don't want to be a programmer, but I want to stick around in tech, blurring the line between the business and the code monkey. It seems the only route is: code monkey for a few years, team lead, project manager. 

Is there a fast track? I've been looking at internal tech consulting roles/technical analyst and they seem promising though very few are entry level. Am I missing anything else?

Thanks!"

My wife and I have a mutual acquaintance who we met while living in Los Angeles. We recently found out this person whom we’ve known for about 3/4 years is going to be co-starring in a major film alongside some very respected and successful actors. My wife and I are absolutely thrilled to the moon for this person. 

It has been a dream of mine to be in the entertainment business whether as a musician or an actor since I was 15 (32 now.) After I got out of the military my wife and I moved to LA. We both loved the city, the beach, and I loved the opportunities out there. I enrolled in acting classes immediately and started to network. Eventually I was able to land an internship on a film starring Seinfeld alumni which was exciting and an incredible learning experience. The shoot lasted 3 months and when it was over I was getting contacted for paid production work, however the work was few and far between and what I really, really wanted to do was acting. Unfortunately I wasn’t getting anywhere. 

Time went on and we eventually got tired of living check to check and considered moving back to Arizona. Eventually we did relocate back to the desert but our hearts remained in SoCal. 

This is where I need some advice… We know this actor well, but I would say they’re more of an acquaintance than a friend at this point but we are very friendly. I want to ask for help or a “break” from this person to get into acting but am having trouble going about it and am terribly anxious about the whole thing. I know that this will take hard work, dedication, and everything I have to be successful at it, but I am more than ready and willing. Being a veteran of the military I am no stranger to hard work and long hours.  

I’m not asking to be famous or to be a movie star, I’m simply asking for an opportunity to prove myself; To show someone in the industry who recognizes talent what I can offer. That’s all. 
I hate cliches but I really don’t want to be that person thinking “what if” my whole life....

So Reddit- please, any helpful advice? 
Genuinely thankful for anyone that replies let alone reads this!"

I am based in London and I am set to attend a 12 week coding bootcamp in less than a week. I'm excited to learn and develop my skills but the idea of being unemployed for an extended period of time after graduating is terrifying to me. I want to get some developer work experience on my CV ASAP.

Assuming I do well in my course and build a decent portfolio, what are some strategies to ensure I gain employment quickly?

I'm not too picky really. Money isn't an issue and I would work for minimum wage or accept a paid internship as long as I was making enough to pay off my student loans. I'm open to working in any sector as long as they are willing to invest time in helping me learn and develop. 

Do I have a good chance of earning a developer position in  London quickly? Which sectors should I be looking at? Are startups more likely to hire boot-camp graduates than larger companies? Is it a good idea to be candid with employers and admit that I am willing to work for minimum wage or does that devalue my skills? Any advice appreciated.  "

This is a summer internship opportunity for my DREAM job. It is extremely competitive I'm assuming because the company is huge.

My question though is, which one do you think would have more people attending? I have a really bad case where when I see a lot of people in one giant room (like the career fairs in the HUB) I just start sweating, loose my confidence, and just want to get out... it just derails from there. Its definitely all in my head, but I'd just avoid having to deal with all of that if both career fairs do have the same companies.

Also, why would the Diversity Career Fair bring on majority of the companies attending today's SWE career fair? I am assuming those same companies instead are opting for all majors for the Diversity Career fair?

And lastly, I was curious, what are peoples opinions here about the career fairs?

Just left my career fair and I possibly could have an interview with a company. However, he told me the internship is going to involve Altium and that I should take the next 2 weeks before interviews to learn Altium so I'm prepared for the interview.

5q5lw6,177,2017-01-25,Why did I bother to get a degree?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5q5lw6/why_did_i_bother_to_get_a_degree/,"I'm a recent CS grad and I'm not getting any interviews. I had a decent GPA, but I didn't land any internships.

Looking through job postings, it seems like 99% of employers want skills I don't have. So now I'm teaching myself web development, but other than actually writing code, it feels completely foreign.

This is all my own fault for not staying career-minded while I was in school, but seriously, why the hell did I get this degree? It seems to have no value. I'm confident I can pass a coding interview, but I can't get past HR to get my foot in the door. And once my foot is in the door, I have no clue whether I'll be able to perform my job function since all I learned in school was how to build FTP clients and BSTs.

I guess I just have to stay in my grind, but I'm so depressed from sitting alone in my apartment in front of a screen for 10-to-12 hours per day that I'm having difficulty concentrating. I posted my resume here yesterday and got minimal feedback. I feel stuck, and I have no idea how to move forward. I'm open to any and all advice.

5q5xg5,1,2017-01-25,Entry Level Project Management Positions?,awaythrow9201,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5q5xg5/entry_level_project_management_positions/,"As a graduating college senior this year, I was just introduced to Project Management and I'm really interested in the field. As I'm currently looking for entry-level jobs in CS, I have been rejected countless times with: ""Thank you for applying, but we have decided to pursue more qualified ..."". A lot of these are for entry-level SWE positions at tech companies without even getting an interview.

I think the reason is most likely my low GPA (&lt; 3.0, started as a Chemical Engineer first 2 years; I don't add my GPA unless required). My resume is a bit lacking, with only one Data Analyst internship, some TA'ing, and no side projects (Hopefully soon). I honestly feel like I have a decent understanding of some computer languages (Java/C++) and common algorithms. I'm currently applying to non-tech companies in hopes of at least having a chance at an interview, as I typically do very well on them, especially on behavioral sections. 

Anyways, I feel like Project Management is a great fit me as I'm much more confident of a designer/thinker than a programmer (Can probably answer the intermediate level coding interview questions, and Project Management/SWE is much more than that). I was wondering what companies would give me and my GPA a chance? I'm not really interested in the big 4, at this point any job in the Project Management field would work."
5q60rd,114,2017-01-25,"WATCH OUT: ""Internship"" Scam!",ThisGoldAintFree,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/5q60rd/watch_out_internship_scam/,"Hello everyone, I am here today to warn you about a scam that is currently plaguing the campus. I am not sure of how widespread this issue is but am aware that these sorts of scams have been going on around campus for years, as well as on campuses nationwide for quite some time now.

For those who don't read further: DO NOT trust random strangers who come into your class and promise an ""internship"" without giving any details, DO NOT trust ""College Work Painting"" or any affiliated parties with your information or time. They are scammers trying to get you into their pyramid scheme. 

To describe what this scam entails, let me first talk about my experience in class today. I sat down in my criminology class (weird for a chemistry major but hey some of the coolest classes are outside of your major sometimes) and waited patiently for class to begin. Right around 3:00, my teacher began to speak and welcomed us all to class, stating that first there was a student who wanted to share an opportunity with us. 

A random girl, probably around the age of all the other college students there, began to speak to us about a wonderful internship opportunity. She didn't say anything at all about what this internship was, just that it was ""an internship"" and that some of the best interns could make up to 7,000 dollars in a single summer! I could tell almost immediately that the whole thing was a scam considering she didn't even provide any details on the internship, or talk about what it was even about. Rather, she passed out little slips of paper saying ""internship"" on them and wanted us to fill them out with our names and personal information such as e-mails. 

After a minute or two, she actually become a little aggressive, as if she wanted the class to quickly fill out these papers and give them back to her so that she could get out of there as quickly as possible. She tried to make it seem as if this was normal and that this was all approved by the professor (who had no idea what was going on), but in reality, she was trying to find gullible students to scam and trick into getting involved with the College Work Painting pyramid scheme.

I have personally never been involved with this scam or fallen victim to it, but I do have a couple of friends that have, and have read countless articles online about it to want to make the UMD community more aware of this issue. Basically, they contact you at the beginning and make it seem like this is some sort of exclusive internship. If I recall, the girl who visited my class even pointed out that ""only 5% of applicants get accepted."" This is complete BS. They accept anyone for the job as long as they think you are dumb enough to fall for their tricks.

Basically, they make you think you're getting this extremely well paying job which is very exclusive and would look great on a resume, but what they really do is trick you into managing your own team of employees (i.e. victims) who you must hire and manage on your own, purchasing all of the necessary paint supplies and basically, starting your OWN business and doing all the work yourself, but having to waste a ton of money and giving them a humongous chunk of the revenue (even if you go through with this, expect a miniscule amount of profit in the first place) that you get from managing the other saps.

It is a PYRAMID SCHEME and I was really disappointed to see so many people fall victim to this in my class today, all because some girl mentioned vaguely that there is ""an internship"" without giving any details whatsoever. 

Point is, don't fall for these internship scams, and always be aware of such things. Be sure to spread the word and if you hear that a friend or even someone you vaguely know is falling for this, let them know what's really going on.

Thanks, stay safe and have a great semester!"
5q64tb,2,2017-01-25,[RI] I was asked to sign a 5 year non-compete agreement as an unpaid college intern.,isjfiesjfio38,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5q64tb/ri_i_was_asked_to_sign_a_5_year_noncompete/,"I recently got an offer to intern at a local accounting firm. Even though it's unpaid, the firm seems to offer some good, hands-on experience working with the general ledger, tax preparation, audits, proof of cash, and accounting software. 

I went in today to drop off my BCI check. The accountant was not in the office, so I just talked to the secretary. She gave me a manila folder with the firm's employment application, a NDA, an I9 form, and a non-compete agreement. 

I had never seen or heard of a non-compete agreement before. I don't have a copy of the agreement on me, but it said something to the effect that I could not work for any competing firm (any firm that engages in tax preparation, bookkeeping, etc.) for five years after my ""employment"" at this firm. 

Obviously, I'm not really an ""employee"" at the firm. I'm surprised I even had to fill out an I9 to be honest. I ended up signing the non-compete form (again, I wasn't pressured or anything, I was actually alone in a room when I was filling it all out.) I figured that it was something typical and maybe I was just misunderstanding the document. 

I did ask the secretary an unrelated question about where I was supposed to sign on the NDA. She called the accountant and the accountant said she would go over all of that paperwork with me on Monday (five days from now). I suppose it's possible that the secretary assembled the usual documentation given to new employees and that I wasn't meant to actually sign the non-compete clause. 

But now I'm a bit concerned about the potential legal ramifications of this agreement. I mean, it doesn't make any sense to offer an internship to college sophomores and juniors, and then expect them to refrain from working in their field of choice for up to four years *after* graduation.

I've also read that a court typically wouldn't enforce a 5 year non-compete agreement, much less in the context of an unpaid college internship. 

Still, if it turns out that the accountant does, in fact, expect me to abide by the non-compete agreement, what should I do? Should I resign? Should I just go along with it and pursue my career path howsoever I choose in the future, knowing that a court would be unlikely to enforce that agreement (provided the accountant even knows what I'm doing in the future and decides to file a lawsuit against me)?

5q6mtl,29,2017-01-25,Sex Offender Tapping on My Window,hanasays,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/5q6mtl/sex_offender_tapping_on_my_window/,"(So, I just made a reddit today to tell this story, pls let me know if there’s any formatting errors.) I’m a senior in college. I have one roommate, who’s in her first year of a social work master’s program. We’ve been good friends since my freshman year, and this year decided to rent a small house together for a change of scenery (my first year living off campus). 


Our university is in kind of a shitty city, but it's small. The main problem is the layout—one street you’re in perfectly safe, middle-class family territory, but one wrong turn and you’re on gang turf. There’s not a lot of room to get lost safely. My roommate and I don’t live in the worst area, but I will say there’s a reason our rent is cheap and why our landlords installed super-bright motion detector lights all around our house. We’ve been super strict about keeping everything locked up, keeping valuables out of sight of windows, trying to keep the fact that we’re a couple of early-20s females living alone on the DL, and besides one small incident the first month we were there, nothing had happened and we generally felt pretty secure last semester. 


Class doesn’t start until the 30th, but I headed back this past Saturday. Roommate has also been back for a couple weeks because of her internship. This happened the night I got back, around 11:00 pm. I was just hanging in the living room, watching movies. I had bought wine and I just turned 21 before New Year’s so this was very exciting to me and I was feeling like a real adult. My roommate was sleeping over at her boyfriend’s. I started hearing this tapping noise on the window by our front door. For a little while I just ignored it, pretty sure it was just my imagination (I still get a little freaked out being home alone at night). The blinds were down so I couldn’t see anything but I was sure the motion lights would come on if someone was out there, and they weren’t so I was sure it was fine. 


As time passes by, however, I realize that no, that’s definitely tapping, and it’s moving from one window to the next, progressively getting closer to where I’m sitting. I muted the TV to listen better, and as soon as I did the tapping paused and then came back louder and much faster.  At this point I'm frozen, totally freaked out, but when the tapping moved to the window right next to my head, I grabbed my phone and slid off the couch, crawled into the kitchen where we have a glass sliding door, and peered out. It was hard to make out but thankfully the kitchen lights were off which made it a little easier to see outside (and I hope more difficult for me to be seen), and the lights coming through the living room windows combined with some light from the street lamps, just barely allowed me to see a man crouched in our garden, face pressed against the glass—and I mean smushed right up against it. He had one hand stretched way up above his head (which looked really awkward) and was tapping with a couple of fingers. 


I was just like…fuck. I think he was trying different windows because he couldn’t see inside well and didn’t know where I was sitting, except that the living room was the only room in the house with lights on. Or at least that’s what I was hoping when I crawled out of the living room, down the hall, and into my bedroom. I locked the door but kept the lights off (if he really didn’t know what part of the house I was in, I didn’t want him to figure it out) and called the police. They asked if he was actively trying to break in the house and I said no, and they said they would send someone over as quickly as possible. I was really hoping the officer would stay on the line, but they just gave me instructions to call again if things escalated and to hold tight. 


Fifteen minutes later, still no police. I wasn't sure if he was out there but I wasn't trying to find out on my own. I had been trying to call my roommate but she wasn’t answering her phone and I didn’t know who else to call. Eventually I decided to call my ex-boyfriend (we had broken up amicably right before winter break) because he had been my go-to person for the last two years and I couldn’t think of anyone else. He’s a good dude and still came over since he lives only a few minutes away. 


Around ten minutes after I called him I could tell he was there because I could hear shouting and then running. Another five minutes or so and he calls and says he’s out front and to let him in. Ex told me there was a dude with a small bag at the kitchen door, peering in and trying to force the door open. He yelled and the guy dropped the bag and started running. My ex chased him a little bit until they got to this one shitty road towards the back of my neighborhood, then he headed back. Motion lights didn’t come on this whole time. 


A few minutes later the cops came. It was only a little over a half an hour since I'd called them but it felt like so much longer. Cops searched the area, didn’t find anyone. The only thing that was in the bag was lube and a box of condoms, which makes me want to die if I think about it too hard. I didn’t have a solid description of him, having not him well, and neither did my ex. The cops said they would keep someone outside and my ex spent the night in the living room to keep an eye on me. My roommate finally called me back at like 7am going ‘what the hell happened?’ Her boyfriend has also spent the night every night since.


Honestly idk if I was just shocked or processing but the next couple days I was just kind of ‘eh’ about the whole thing, even though I knew the guy was still out there. My roommate called our landlords up and bitched at them about the lights not working. I went to my work and told my coworker about it and he was like ‘you should put it on reddit.’ But then yesterday my roommate called me as soon as she got out of her internship, freaking out, and told me she had something to tell me.


 So her internship with the social work program has her working with and occasionally leading a group of court-ordered drug addicts, which includes some sex offenders.  She told me that while she was leading group she was just not getting along with one of the members (one of the sex offenders) who was being very contrary and just acting annoyed with what she was saying. And towards the end he said something along the lines of ‘your roommate’s cute, you can tell her I like Asian girls’ (I’m Korean) and that we need to fix our front porch light (it’s out). I’m pretty sure that he didn’t have an opportunity to see my face that night so I don’t know how many times he’s been here.


 She reported him, her supervisors got in contact with the police, and he confessed easily. I guess he probably followed my roommate home one night which is terrifying to me and I’m glad he never tried to do anything to her. And he also must have known that she would report him after he said those things to her so I don’t understand his thinking there at all. It’s just today that I’m starting to feel really freaked out about the whole thing and I will probably not be spending the night alone here for a while.

5q6nj1,1,2017-01-25,Graduating w/ One Degree; Staying to finish up another degree and minor?,RosyMilk,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5q6nj1/graduating_w_one_degree_staying_to_finish_up/,"Hey guys,

My school allows you to earn double majors without having both of them completed at the same time. I'm trying to get a BS in Business Administration (IT Concentration) and French Language and Literature as my second, and Computer Science as my minor.

I would try to graduate with the BSBA first because it'd be my bread/butter degree. What I was curious about though, was, if I got a job right after graduation, would I still be able to complete my French degree and the minor in CSC? I feel like jobs wouldn't really let you work and do school at the same time unless it was something you were doing as an internship? Like because most jobs are 9-5 type of things.

I hope I'm wrong because I'd love to do all three of these things but I worry about the time and also how I'd get everything done. I'm already 21, 22 this year and I should be graduating next Spring but stuff happened and I ended having to do an extra year altogether. I feel screwed and kind of messy about this because do people really want to hire older people? Idk if I'd even be old tbh..I really just don't know.

I would also like to go for an MBA soon after I'm done with undergrad.

Thanks for all help. :)"
5q6tux,6,2017-01-25,Bell Let's talk...I am going to try talking..,wtfman1988,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5q6tux/bell_lets_talki_am_going_to_try_talking/,"Let’s talk...

It’s a weird thing typing this out...everyone is super supportive today in regards to mental health and I just don’t know how to put “pen to paper”, I am hardly a writer. I don’t recall exactly when I became aware that I wasn’t feeling 100% right or realized that I have depression...and anxiety, it’s been over a decade at least. I’ll generally try to keep the details of my life somewhat vague. While some people know I have been dealing with depression and anxiety, no one really knows how deep it goes. It’s a lot easier to get this kind of stuff off my chest  anonymously with a whole group of non-judgemental strangers heh.

I grew up in a small town, teased a bit more when I was younger...grew up went to high school, never quite popular...wouldn’t say I was unpopular though either. I was mostly teased for having a few extra pounds, and to this day I am a bit self conscious about my weight. College was much better socially for me, I partied a lot more, made friends easier, and people were out of that bullying/teasing phase. At heart I was still an introvert who was more comfortable to catch a hockey game on the tv, play a video game, read a book, but I wanted to push myself to be outgoing, and it was fun. I still struggled with depression and anxiety though through no fault of those social experiences in college.  

I had taken a year off between high school and college to figure things out. My parents definitely gave me a push forward in that regard, they told me “go to college, get a career” – very true likely in their day, but the world has changed so much, I hold no resentment at all, they wanted what was best for me. I ended up basically throwing a dart at the wall and landed on marketing. College was frustrating regardless of social improvements. There were times I would be super down on myself for no reason. Stress and anxiety with school could often times get the best of me, there were a few times when it got bad that I did consider ending it all. I ultimately couldn’t go through with it for a couple of reasons. 1. I couldn’t do that to my parents. I absolutely love them with all of my heart and I couldn’t do anything to intentionally hurt them in any way. 2. I am actually terrified of death. Maybe it would be easy if I knew there were something on the other side? Scary philosophical conversation. 

As it turns it out upon graduation from college I found out marketing wasn’t exactly a hot field to get into. You intern for free, do door to door sales, or you magically have 10 years experience and become a marketing manager. I had aspirations of heading to university afterwards but missed the deadline to apply. I ultimately worked in a call centre for 5-6 months to pass the time between when I graduated and when I could apply next for university. I made a lot of friends at the call centre and consider a few of them my best friends.  

I ended up having to university only to find that it wasn’t much different then college except the learning style wasn’t for me and they generally try to fuck you left right and centre with extra courses that do not have much bearing on your major. Everything is incredibly expensive. I ultimately dropped out after 4 months because I did not think it was for me despite actually having some decent grades. 

I ended up getting into another call centre and rose through the ranks. It’s a pretty dysfunctional work environment, i’ve seen hundreds and hundreds of people leave. Some deserving, some not. I still astonish myself that I am still somehow working there. A lot of people are surprised I work where I work and do what I do, and that is not to put myself up on a pedestal. They say I should try to apply for this and that but my managerial experience is still limited and to be honest, my self esteem is incredibly low.

I also feel incredibly trapped with my job. I don’t want to make my life sound like it’s horrible. Not the case at all. I have a small but amazing circle of friends that I am blessed to have. I have a fiancé that I am fortunate to have, and a mostly awesome family (who doesn’t have drama in the family tree?). Trapped though, I definitely feel trapped. I worked hard for years and saved and was able to buy a condo with my fiancé. We’re mostly okay for finances each month, saving for a wedding at the same time is tough, and there is that worry if I lose my job we can’t afford the place or i’d need a job in a similar pay grade to make things work. 
The struggle there is even if I got into another role, I am not sure how passionate I really am about the call centre industry. I mean if you asked me my dream job it would probably be “NHL general manager” but I didn’t go to law school or play pro hockey in my earlier life. Likely too late for me in life to go back to school to do any law or courses to get myself into either industry.  Other passions? Gaming and animals. I always thought if I won the lottery i’d likely volunteer at an animal shelter and/or make some donations to help try to make a positive difference. 

What does help a lot is loving family, friends, and my fiancé. The Bell Let’s Talk initiative is nice and I never thought i’d actually type something out like this. You hear about people battling mental health and getting better, and I just hope there is that light at the end of the tunnel that doesn’t involve “the end” but actually getting up each day, feeling great, and going out there into the world to do something you love. I don’t want to come off as whiny or hard done by. I am probably better off than most in this world and there is guilt in that they I feel like I don’t appreciate the little things I have as much as I should. 

So while I don’t know if anything is ultimately changing any time soon for myself, the Bell Let’s Talk initiative does put a smile on my face, because you can see people care. Maybe some day i’ll talk about it a bit more openly not on the internet.

Thanks for the read.

5q6vj8,2,2017-01-25,*** Mitgliederrundbrief zum Thema Björn Höcke ***,Alternativer,Die_Alternative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Die_Alternative/comments/5q6vj8/mitgliederrundbrief_zum_thema_björn_höcke/,"Liebe Mitglieder und Förderer der Alternative für Deutschland,

fast auf den Tag genau acht Monate vor der Bundestagswahl und vier Monate vor den Landtagswahlen in Schleswig-Holstein und Nordrhein-Westfalen steht unsere junge Partei zum wiederholten Mal vor einer großen inneren Herausforderung, während wir unsere Kräfte zugleich für die sachliche Auseinandersetzung mit den politischen Gegnern bündeln müssten.

Es ist uns wichtig, Sie auf direktem Weg über die Inhalte und Interpretationen der Dresdner Rede von Herrn Höcke vom 17.01.2017 zu informieren, die für uns vor allem ernste Fragen bezüglich seines Verhältnisses zur Partei und ihren demokratischen Gremien aufwerfen. 
Darüber hinaus haben seine Äußerungen der Partei zum wiederholten Mal in der nationalen und internationalen Öffentlichkeit geschadet, weshalb der Bundesvorstand mit großer Mehrheit Parteiordnungsmaßnahmen für erforderlich hält. 
Es ist aus unserer Sicht nicht hilfreich, die Verantwortung für diesen Schaden bei verkürzten oder verfälschten Zitaten der Medien zu suchen, die wir gleichwohl scharf kritisieren.

Zu einer politisch reifenden Partei wie der AfD, die von wachsenden Wählergruppen ernst genommen werden will, gehört auch die bittere Erkenntnis, dass in dieser Rede nicht nur Sprengpotential für die Einheit der Partei, sondern insbesondere auch für das Demokratieverständnis der AfD enthalten ist. 
Diese Probleme nicht zu verschleppen, sondern zeitnah zu klären, halten wir als Bundesvorstand für unvermeidlich.

Da uns viele Bitten erreichen, die Sicht des Bundesvorstandes genauer zu erläutern, werden wir in diesem Schreiben mit wenigen Beispielen problematische Passagen der Rede vorstellen und Ihnen außerdem ein Transkript der Rede zur Verfügung stellen, damit Sie sich selbst ein eigenes und umfassenderes Bild machen können.
Den vollständigen Wortlaut der Rede und eine kommentierte Kurzfassung finden Sie auf unserer Webseite unter folgender Adresse (Kennwort: afd2017):
https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/

**1 . Einheit der Partei, Parlamentarische Arbeit**

Erinnern wir uns: Spätestens seit Anfang des Jahres 2015 hat die Partei leidvoll erfahren, wie damals wichtige Protagonisten versuchten, die Mehrheit der Partei inhaltlich zu verengen. 
In monatelangen Auseinandersetzungen wurden viele Mitglieder und innerparteiliche Konkurrenten bis tief hinein in die Privatsphäre beschädigt. 
Die inhaltliche Debatte aus dem Wahlprogramm 2013 blieb dabei auf der Strecke, der innerparteiliche Streit eskalierte, die Zustimmung laut Umfragen sank bis auf 3%.

Heute, im Januar 2017, sind wir in zehn Landesparlamenten plus dem EU-Parlament vertreten, es gibt zahlreiche Gesetzesentwürfe und Anträge zu Landes-, Bundes- und Europathemen, die teilweise Eingang in Regierungshandeln gefunden haben. 
Zwar hat die Intensität der Ablehnung des politischen Establishments mit den AfD-Wahlerfolgen dramatisch zugenommen, allmählich wandelt sich jedoch die Berichterstattung zu politischen Inhalten, extern verstärkt durch vergleichbare Entwicklungen in ganz Europa und den Vereinigten Staaten. 
Die Umfragewerte im Vorfeld der Wahlen stehen bei bis zu 16%.

Innerparteilich stand B. Höcke bereits mehrfach im Fokus der Kritik. Obwohl der neu gewählte Bundesvorstand 2015 das Verfahren auf Amtsenthebung im Landesverband Thüringen aufgehoben und damit einen konstruktiven Neuanfang markiert hatte, führten Vorfälle wie sein Auftritt in der Jauch-Talkshow im Oktober 2015 und eine höchst problematische Rede über das angeblich genetisch bestimmte Fortpflanzungsverhalten der Afrikaner im Dezember 2015 zu Hunderten von Parteiaustritten und Zerreißproben auf verschiedenen Parteiebenen und einer einhellig beschlossenen „gelben Karte“ seitens des Bundesvorstands. Als Partei haben wir nach all diesen Auftritten dutzende Veranstaltungsorte, Unterstützer und Spender verloren, auch der AfD wohlgesonnene Verbände ziehen sich zurück, und die Verankerung in der Gesellschaft wird dadurch immer schwieriger.

Die Beteiligung B. Höckes an einem Hintergrundgespräch mit der Hauptstadtpresse in Berlin im Juni 2016, die dort vorgetragene, medial wirksame Diskreditierung der Parteispitze als „moralisch ungeeignet“ und zuletzt eine Presserklärung über angebliche Tricksereien auf einem Parteitag in NRW hatten am 7. Januar 2017 zu einer Befassung des Konvents mit seiner Einmischung in Angelegenheiten eines anderen Landesverbandes geführt. 
Durch einen mit breiter Mehrheit gefassten Beschluss wurde B. Höcke zur nächsten Konventssitzung vorgeladen. 
Dies hat seinen Grund auch darin, dass im August 2016 der Konvent klare Verhaltensregeln für Funktionsträger beschlossen hatte, nach welchen solche innerparteilichen Übergriffe zum „Tabu“ erklärt worden waren.

Nachfolgend ein erstes markantes Zitat aus Höckes Rede:
„Wir müssen immer bedenken, mit Bernd Lucke sind nicht alle die gegangen, die ihren Frieden mit der Rolle eines Junior-Partners in einer zukünftigen Koalition mit einer Altpartei gemacht haben. 
Manche von ihnen, manche von diesen Luckisten sind geblieben. 
Es sind die, die keine innere Haltung besitzen, die Establishment sind und Establishment bleiben wollen oder so schnell wie möglich zum Establishment gehören wollen. 
Und liebe Freunde - nicht wenige von diesen Typen, nicht wenige von diesen Typen drängen jetzt gerade in diesen Wochen und Monaten als Bundestagskandidaten auf die Listen, oder als Direktkandidat in den Wahlkreisen entsprechend nach vorne.“

Hier werden pauschal AfD-Listenkandidaten in allen Landesverbänden und fast 300 Direktkandidaten unter Generalverdacht gestellt, entweder „Luckisten“ oder rückgratlose Karrieristen zu sein. 
Aus dem Mund eines Vollzeitparlamentariers (mit Dienstwagen und Chauffeur) ist dies eine Respektlosigkeit gegenüber den zumeist aussichtslosen Direktkandidaten und den tausenden ehrenamtlich engagierten Parteimitgliedern, die für ihre Leute vor Ort kämpfen.

Fortsetzung Zitat:
„Nicht wenige werden – das muss man leider annehmen - nicht wenige werden ganz schnell vom parlamentarischen Glanz und Glamour der Hauptstadt fasziniert werden. 
Und nicht wenige werden sich ganz schnell sehr wohl fühlen bei den Freifressen- und Freisaufen-Veranstaltungen der Lobbyisten.“

Dutzende Parlamentarier in den Landtagen beweisen tagtäglich durch inhaltliche Arbeit im Parlament und durch Arbeit in Bürgerbüros und bei zahlreichen Veranstaltungen, dass dieser Vorwurf haltlos ist. 
Parlamentsabgeordnete, die sich Tag für Tag der oft zähen Arbeit an den Sachthemen stellen, verdienen die volle Rückendeckung der Partei, keine Abqualifizierung als „Karrieristen“, insbesondere, weil sie nicht nur ihren eigenen Kopf, sondern auch die Reputation ihrer Familien und Freunde dafür hergeben, dass die Programmatik der Partei weiterhin mit klarer Kante vertreten werden kann.

**2 . Differenzierte Geschichtsbetrachtung statt „180°-Wende“**

Ein Zitat zum Umgang der herrschenden Politik mit der Nationalgeschichte Deutschlands:
„Und diese dämliche Bewältigungspolitik, die lähmt uns heute noch viel mehr als zu Franz Josef Strauß’ Zeiten. Wir brauchen nichts anderes als eine erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad! 
Wir brauchen so dringend wie niemals zuvor diese erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad, liebe Freunde. 
Wir brauchen keine toten Riten mehr in diesem Land.“
Wir alle verurteilen den Missbrauch von problematischen Teilen unserer Nationalgeschichte für die Zwecke gegenwärtiger Politik. 
Dabei handelt es sich um eine pseudomoralische und pseudopädagogische Instrumentalisierung der Geschichte zur Verhinderung einer vitalen und interessenwahrenden gegenwärtigen deutschen Politik. 
Eine solche Instrumentalisierung soll die Bildung eines unverkrampften Nationalbewusstseins unmöglich machen, das jeder gut funktionierende Staat benötigt.

Es braucht jedoch keine „180° - Wende“ der heutigen Selektion der deutschen Geschichte mit umgekehrter Verengung des Blickwinkels. 
Wir fordern stattdessen eine offene und allseits kritische Befassung mit der Universalgeschichte, in welche die deutsche Geschichte als eine von vielen Nationalgeschichten eingebettet ist. 
Unsere Geschichte ist in weiten Teilen ohnehin nur aus der Interaktion mit anderen Völkern, Staaten und deren Kulturen zu verstehen und gegebenenfalls zu bewerten.

**3 . „Das Denkmal der Schande“**

Diese Passage der Rede hat in der medialen Öffentlichkeit erwartungsgemäß ein großes Echo ausgelöst. 
Teilweise wurde von Zeitungen unvollständig oder gar verfälschend zitiert und anschließend auch korrigiert (FAZ). 
Für den Bundesvorstand ist diese Redepassage zwar ebenfalls problematisch, gravierender ist jedoch B. Höckes Umgang mit seiner Aussage. 
Denn er veröffentlichte am Tag nach der Rede dazu die folgende Erklärung:

„Wörtlich habe ich gesagt: ´Wir Deutschen sind das einzige Volk, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat. 
Das heißt, ich habe den Holocaust, also den von Deutschen verübten Völkermord an den Juden, als Schande für unser Volk bezeichnet. 
Und ich habe gesagt, dass wir Deutsche diesem auch heute noch unfassbaren Verbrechen, also diese Schuld und damit verbundene Schande mitten in Berlin, ein Denkmal gesetzt haben. 
Was ist daran falsch? Was ist an dieser Feststellung zu kritisieren? Gar nichts!“

Tatsächlich hat B. Höcke am 17.01.2017 in seiner Rede etwas anderes formuliert und versucht nunmehr, mit einer nachträglichen Erklärung die Öffentlichkeit zu täuschen. 
Denn auch er zitiert sich selbst verfälschend:

Hier das Transkript der gesprochenen Rede vom 17.01.2017:
„Wir Deutschen –und ich rede jetzt nicht von Euch Patrioten, die sich hier heute versammelt haben- wir Deutschen, also unser Volk, sind das einzige Volk der Welt, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat.“

Höcke nimmt am 17.01.2017 die anwesenden „Patrioten“ ausdrücklich aus der Gruppe der Deutschen heraus, die das „Denkmal der Schande in das Herz der Hauptstadt gepflanzt haben“. 
Anders gesagt, dieses Denkmal ist nach Höckes Worten eben gerade kein Denkmal der Patrioten. 
Er charakterisiert die Errichtung des Denkmals auf diese Weise als unpatriotisch. 
Unabhängig von der Bewertung einer solchen Aussage sollte man als aufrechter und ehrlicher Mann dazu auch einen Tag später noch stehen.

Ganz abgesehen von diesem Geschehnisablauf bleibt die Frage, warum wir uns als AfD in dieser Zeit vor vier wichtigen Wahlen in dieser Form mit diesem Thema „Holocaust-Denkmal“ öffentlichkeitswirksam beschäftigen, statt unsere politische Programmatik mit Leidenschaft und Fleiß zu betreiben. 
Denn unsere Wahlergebnisse werden in hohem Maße davon abhängen, was wir den Wählern an politischen Inhalten zu bieten haben.

**4 . Das Demokratieverständnis der AfD und seine Vermittlung für die Öffentlichkeit**

Wir lenken Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf folgende Passage der Dresdner Rede:
„Ich möchte, dass Ihr Euch im Dienst verzehrt…Ja, liebe Freunde, ich weise Euch einen langen…und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Ich weise dieser Partei einen langen und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Aber es ist der einzige Weg, der zu einem vollständigen Sieg führt, und dieses Land braucht einen vollständigen Sieg der AfD und deshalb will ich diesen Weg –und nur diesen Weg- mit Euch gehen, liebe Freunde!“

Die AfD hat einen Gründungsmythos, der mit dem Gedanken der Erneuerung der Demokratie in Deutschland zu tun hat. Darüber reden wir viel, bemühen dieses Prinzip – manchmal auch etwas schlagwortartig als „Basisdemokratie“ – und haben einiges dazu in unser Grundsatzprogramm geschrieben. 
Fest steht, dass wir uns am stärksten von allen Parteien in Deutschland darum bemühen, die Mitglieder in Programm- und andere Prozesse einzubinden. 
Versuchen Sie, diese uns so wichtige Grundhaltung in Verbindung zu bringen mit dem hier abgedruckten Zitat. 
Versuchen Sie sich vorzustellen, welche Gedanken sich Bürger von außerhalb unserer Partei dazu machen, wenn sie diese Passage lesen und Ansatzpunkte suchen, um uns fundamental politisch und juristisch anzugreifen. 
Einen weiteren Kommentar zu dieser delikaten Frage wollen wir uns ersparen.

Die vorgenannten und weitere hier nicht zitierte Passsagen aus der Dresdner Rede vom 17.01.2017 in der Gesamtschau mit vorangegangen Äußerungen seit 2015 haben den Bundesvorstand am 23.01.2017 veranlasst, sich mit der Einleitung von Ordnungsmaßnahmen gegen B. Höcke zu befassen.
Das komplette Redetranskript als auch eine Version der Rede mit Kommentaren und Fragen finden Sie - wie oben schon ausgeführt - auf unserer Webseite unter der Adresse: https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/ (Kennwort: afd2017).
Es ist uns bewusst, dass die Befassung mit den aufgeworfenen Fragen ein für die Partei schmerzlicher Prozess ist. 
Unsere Verantwortung als Bundesvorstand für alle AfD-Mitglieder und die vielen hoffnungsvollen Wähler in Deutschland sowie politische Partner im Ausland gebietet uns jedoch, eine offene und ehrliche Debatte über die Natur und Ausrichtung der AfD als parlamentarische Partei oder als „Bewegungspartei nach B. Höcke“ zu führen. 
Dazu gehört auch festzustellen, wie wir intern mit unseren selbst gewählten demokratischen Gremien umgehen und welche politischen Themen wir in der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren wollen.

Die öffentliche Debatte über das Verhältnis der AfD zur historischen Betrachtung des „dritten Reiches“ der Nationalsozialisten ist keine demokratische Entscheidung der Basis, sondern wurde ihr durch B. Höcke zum wiederholten Mal aufgezwungen. 
Nicht, weil medial berichtet und skandalisiert wurde, sondern weil B. Höcke ausdrücklich für sich in Anspruch nimmt, den besten Weg zum Erfolg für die AfD zu kennen und umzusetzen. 
Er zelebriert sein Geschichtsverständnis und verleiht ihm seine Sprache. Damit zwingt er die ganze Partei ohne Not, sich damit – eben auch öffentlich – zu beschäftigen, wann und wie er es möchte. 
Der demokratische Entscheidungsweg wäre, zu solchen schwierigen Themen die innerparteiliche Meinungsbildung zu suchen und sich dort Mehrheiten zu verschaffen. 
Eine öffentliche Kommunikation kann eben erst dann stattfinden, wenn sich eine Parteimeinung gebildet hat. 
So funktionieren demokratische Parteien!

Der Bundesvorstand ist sich bewusst, dass die Medien kurzfristig den Streit zu Lasten der AfD in ihrer Berichterstattung nutzen werden. 
Gleichwohl halten wir die Frage der Ausrichtung der AfD als realistische parlamentarische Alternative mit einem klarem Bekenntnis zu Deutschland in all seinen Facetten einschließlich der Verbrechen des „dritten Reiches“ für geboten und den durch Björn Höcke aufgezeigten Weg einer 180°-Wende in der Geschichtsbetrachtung, sowie die Verächtlichmachung des Parlamentarismus und seiner Vertreter für einen Irrweg, der die AfD von einer Partei zu einer „Bewegung“ (ein Begriff, den B. Höcke wiederholt verwendet, jedoch nirgends definiert) umformen würde, die ihren Anspruch, demokratische Mehrheiten zu generieren, aufgäbe. 
Dieser Weg würde die AfD als Partei nicht nur unglaubwürdig machen, sondern mittelfristig auch ihrer demokratischen Legitimation berauben. 
Es ist also inhaltlicher Dissens in einer substanziellen Frage der Alternative für Deutschland, die uns zu diesem Schritt veranlasst.

In gemeinsamer Sorge um die Partei grüßt Sie ganz herzlich
Frauke Petry im Namen des AfD-Bundesvorstands

5q6xkd,9,2017-01-25,"[24F] I have a degree in Psychology, now studying IT conversion Masters - I am unsure about my employability prospects/career options",IvyB999,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/5q6xkd/24f_i_have_a_degree_in_psychology_now_studying_it/,"Hi,

While studying psychology I decided I don't want to become a psychologist so I started a 1-year Masters conversion degree in IT. The course is very intense (requiring at least 50h work per week) and the main languages we learned are Java, Python &amp; SQL. The degree also covers topics like project management, software engineering, cyber security &amp; human computer interaction.

An obvious problem is that a 1-year degree won't make me a specialist of a particular area and in the job market I will have to compete with people who studied IT in more depth and perhaps had time for internships. Also, because I have been studying this for literally 5 months, I don't have a clear idea of how I could find my place in the industry.

Throughout the course I struggled most with Java. I do understand the theory, can read and modify existing code but lack the creativity needed when writing programs from scratch. I started Python a couple of weeks ago, so can't comment on it yet. I found SQL/JDBC to be very easy and enjoyed project management and human computer interaction classes.

While working on various groups projects, I noticed I tend to analyse and synthesise different ideas (not necessarily mine) to create some sort of clarity from the initial chaos. I make sure we adhere to requirements (but with no gold-plating) and usually notice any mistakes before they start causing bigger problems. I prefer to plan and think about different options beforehand to avoid any waste of time or effort. I also like to think from the perspective of the user and what steps they'll go through when using the system.

My previous work experience includes market research, statistics and event organising for training purposes.

Thinking about previous experience and this degree, I can honestly say I can achieve great results under high pressure but it makes me feel miserable and takes a huge toll on my health so I would ideally avoid very fast pace high stress jobs.

One thing I'm quite sure about is that I don't want to spend all day staring at the screen and writing Java code, although I enjoy being involved in the discussions of the program structure, suggesting how to improve something etc. I'm a bit nervous about job positions that people with no technical degrees can get because that will probably mean higher competition and I have to be realistic.

So my question is: what career options should I look into? How could I improve my employability prospects keeping in mind that the degree is very time-consuming?

If it's relevant, I am currently based in the UK but hoping to relocate after graduation.

I know the post is a bit long, so I'll be very grateful if anyone answers :) Thanks!"

What do you guys do in your free time/how much of it do you tend to get?  Is it possible to still balance jobs and internships and clubs/organizations?

I know it might seem like a dumb question to ask, but I know that each major is different in terms of expectations and workloads and whatnot, plus the only people I've seen in my major that work jobs while doing school are either TAs or tutor or something and aren't involved in as much as those of other majors outside of studies."

I finished with a 2.93 GPA and no internships (even though I applied every year). I did the whole job search thing for about 3 months after graduation and wasn't getting anywhere, so my brother offered to help me get a job at the insurance company he works for so I can make some money. I took it in August 2015 and have been stuck there since, hating every minute of it, but I figured I at least have something to pay off my loans. In the meantime I've been applying at nights and on weekends and haven't gotten anywhere in all that time.  I know others have gotten jobs with sub 3.0 GPAs and no internships but it just seems impossible. I live with my parents so I have no living expenses and have saved up enough to pay off my loans for quite a while. I don't necessarily want to quit my job as I don't want a gap in my resume but I also can't focus on obtaining the job I want, not to mention I hate my current job. Just seeing if anyone here has been in a similar situation. Would it be better to quit my current job so I can focus on what I need to do to obtain my dream job? Do gaps in resumes matter that much to people hiring ChemEs? Has anyone had any luck with obtaining a lower position (like a plant operator) and worked their way up to engineer?

Obviously we can all see now that he is definitely the joker in every sense. So how can they move forward on season 3. 

My current thoughts are that he will trigger Bruce into following the batman path and intensifying training. During the encounter next week Bruce will beat jerome almost to death but stop last second instilling his no killing rule into himself. Jerome will then be taken to Arkham. It wouldn't surprise me to see harleen quinzel at the end of the next episode as a young Arkham intern his last scene of thessentially 3 possibly being him turning to her saying something along the lines of 'have you ever had a really bad day' this could possibly lead to her becoming harley at the end of s3 instigating Jerome's breakout for an inevitable season 4 return.  

I personally think it's a bit early for Harley right now but we know she is coming this season and a mad love homage could be an interesting side story.

I am always on the computer and in my room for the days that I don't have classes. I procrastinate on all my work until the night before, I even procrastinate eating and showering. I feel like I have lost all control of my life. This has been going on for two years now, and every time I make progress in getting out of this rut (e.g. going to the library to study for a day), something knocks me back down even further.

I've come to the point where I realize all the things I did wrong and all the missed opportunities and bad decisions I made, but I'm too far gone. Just today, I played Skyrim from 3 pm to 8 pm. Now its almost 3 am and I am watching the Namek Saga from Dragonball Z.

I wasn't always like this. I used to prioritise work and studies. I used to socialize with others but I just gave up when I entered university. Everything was moving at such a fast pace and I felt left behind, and decided not to even bother trying. I know not trying was a mistake, but the effects of not trying feel irreversible, especially two years down the line.

How do you get out of a rut like this. Every day feels like a battle that I'm always going to lose. I get anxious over thinking about my future so I don't think about it anymore. What are some concrete steps I can take to make sure I start doing things again.
Thanks for reading this far. Here are a few bullet points of me trying to explain my thoughts and feelings:

- The future is stressful to think about. My grades are shit so I am not going to get a job. Even opening application forms for internships give me this feeling of stress and anxiety.

- I have always been scared to fail. I prefer to not try and fail then to try at all. Because trying and failing would mean that even my best is not good enough and I can't accept that.

- I feel inferior to others around me, especially students. I think this was brought on by my performance in school. I associate my self-worth with my grades, like a lot of students do, and when I didn't have that, I didn't have anything. It also doesn't help that I don't have a hobby or passion in anything.

- I constantly feel like everyone is judging me, and even though the rational side of me is telling me that everyone is too busy with their own stuff to do something like that, once I get to one of those moods, my thought process becomes warped and stupid and I believe my false thoughts again.

- I feel that i am scared of a lot of things. I am too afraid to open my e-mail because I am anxious over e-mails from my university or professors. Its hard for me to look at people in the eye, I can't seem to do it (but I could before).

- I keep trying to find a ""miracle pill"" - one thing I can do to make everything better and good again. For a while, it was NoFap. And then it was changing the lights on my desk to a darker color rather than a neon lamp so I can focus. And I actually and genuinely believe that these things were my only hope. That doing one thing is going to miraculously make things better. Right now, as I am typing this, I know it isn't but when I feel hopeless, I will start looking for those things again.

- Everything I need to do feels like a chore. Washing the dishes, eating, going to school. If I can avoid something, I will postpone doing it. I don't wash the dishes until the next day. I don't eat until I feel my stomach rumble.

This isn't my last straw. I have gotten so used to living this way that I will probably just continue existing like this. Its a sad life, but what else can I do. Nothing pushes me to do better or improve anymore. Failing exams, getting lectured by concerned parents, seeing my mom cry. I have learnt to tolerate all this so that I don't have to face my fears. I am tired, honestly I am, but not tired enough to change. And I feel that I will never ever change. Its horrible."
5q81e6,7,2017-01-25,I'm an adult male getting emotional over a car,batting_1000,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5q81e6/im_an_adult_male_getting_emotional_over_a_car/,"It seems very silly, I know. There's really no way to sugar-coat it. I'm a grown-ass 31 year old man, and I'm getting ridiculously emotional over getting rid of my car.

In December, my Dad passed away, and I'm honestly still dealing with that. It's one of the more difficult things I've dealt with. In fact, that may be a contributing factor to what I'm about to talk about. But my Dad, about three days before he passed, told my stepmom that if he died (he was not doing well and was on his way to the hospital), he wanted me to have their car. It's a very nice vehicle, and I really don't deserve it.

Anyway, I don't need two cars so I took the insurance money and paid off my 2009 Impala, and decided I want to give it to my older brother. He has a large family, including my nephew who turns 16 this year. Their second car recently took a shit, so they need it more than me.

But it seems I'm having almost as much trouble with the idea of getting rid of this car as I am with dealing with my Dad's death. I bought this car in 2013, and it has been with me through the most turbulent years of my life. A couple depressing jobs, my last two years of college, a nearly year-long relationship, an out of state internship, a couple moves, many adventures, a major slump in life, and many other highs and lows. I even taught one of my college friends how to drive in that car.

So after 3.5 years, and 94,000 miles, I'm giving this car up. I don't know why I'm having such a hard time with this. Maybe it is because it was there during all the crazy events that have taken place in my life since I got it. I've changed so much, and it has been with me through so much.

I really want to keep it, but I'm single and not married, and I just don't need two cars. My brother's family needs it more than me. It's just going to be a hard time signing that title over and seeing it and all the memories I have with it drive away.

It feels ridiculous talking about it because when it comes down to it, it's just a car. But it's more than that to me.

Am I being ridiculous?"

I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues and I was in a very horrible space. I was feeling very suicidal but I learned a long time ago that I could never cause the people I love more pain just because I feel like I can't handle mine. Anyway, I started self-medicating with alcohol and drugs and even had a few moments of drunk driving. I've struggled with some alcohol abuse but this just really went over the edge.  Everything just felt dark and scary, and my partner was definitely a guiding light for me but I realized I couldn't be there for her if I wasn't able to help myself but I didn't know how to do that and kept slipping further.  I started feeling like things had to end so I could focus on myself but I didn't want to lose her because I still love her. Well, one night I got extremely fucked up on an excessive amount of booze, smoked some weed and did a few lines of cocaine. I ended up at a house with some folks I know but I didn't know where I was and my ride had fallen asleep and my phone had died. Someone I didn't know had made a move on me and I didn't really stop it from happening. I know this is on me, and I felt like destroying everything around me was the answer including my relationship.  I had made a huge mistake. I felt like I had dreamt the experience, but knew I hadn't.  It was real and I couldn't handle it. I've never done anything like that. It ate me up for a few days and I broke up with my partner that weekend. I did not tell her I had slept with someone else. I panicked, pushed her away, and responded by doing more drinking and a lot more drugs and stopped sleeping. I realized how much I was hurting myself when I hurt her. I asked if she would meet up the next weekend after we broke up, as I wanted to be fully honest with her because I really wanted to fix things between us and get back together if possible, and at the very least, wanted us to have an honest friendship if that was an option too. I told her that I had slept with someone else then. I believe that I don't get to make that decision of how she feels for her, if I hadn't told her. We talked the next week and she was rightfully very mad about everything. She had known about my drinking and we were both worried, but she had no idea about the drugs.  Anyway, she invites me to come over to her place after our conversation.  I really, really wanted to go but if sex was even on the table, it was too early for me to get tested for any stds and I refuse to compromise her sexual health for my selfishness. 

Anyway, we send some decent texts to each other in attempts to start creating some closure, I suppose, and stay cordial. About a week and a half after our conversation, I see a snapstory of a random new person. I naturally wonder who the fuck that is but didn't really think too much more of it. More time goes by, and I am trying to check in on her because I realized I was ready to trust myself and tell her I know I am capable of doing all the work to make amends, if I could get another chance.  I quit my job that was fueling my depression to spiral into excessive binge drinking and really trying to focus on healing myself from all the damage I had done to myself, as well.  She is confused as to why I'm texting her more often than I did in our relationship (not necessarily true, we saw each other almost every day so there was less need to text that often...) and I tell her that I would love to talk about that in person.  She tells me she is unavailable to do that and doesn't know when she will be but sure.  My gut says something is very off about this. I didn't expect her to drop what she was doing but I know her schedule and it was winter break. No school, no internship, etc. 
I get this sinking feeling that maybe she's seeing someone else when I see only one new friend on facebook.  I click on this person and I could totally see my ex being attracted to this person.  I have no proof until a few days later. I am hanging out with mutual friends--we moved here together for her to go to school so we built a lot of friendships together--and we're just catchin up. I start talking about how I want to really fix things and what my plan is for myself and how I really want to let her know that I want to fix things and they seem super supportive of this but they have to tell me something...She's been seeing someone. 

Anyway, a lot of our mutual friends would love to see us work on things and are in support of it. They also know that she's just tryin to have some fun and explore some things and don't think this will last. To make it worse, almost all the people I know who have met this person have said some not kind things. I will go into this later. 

I've been left for other people in break ups, and I've dabbled in non-exclusive relationships, so I have a pretty healthy relationship with jealousy. I definitely feel it but it's not consuming. I feel very lucky for that.  I send my ex a letter saying how I really want to work on things and that it would mean the world to me if she would consider it but I know that it would take a lot of time on her end to forgive me. I also let her know that I know she's seeing someone else and that I want her to be happy. (I had only heard one story about this person so far; it was still unfavorable but I didn't have much else) We start texting and she thinks that I'm only saying all the things about wanting to fix things because I'm reacting to the consequences and also because she's seeing someone new. I disagreed with her; that's why I had been keeping contact and no longer pushing her away like I did the first week our break up. We did not otherwise talk about the person she's been seeing.

Well, now it's been almost 2 months since our break up.  A few weeks ago, I was on instagram and stumbled across a picture of her that this new person had put on the internet.  It was waxing poetic about their connection. At this point, they had known each other for a month at most. (I do not know all the details of their interactions but it's pretty easy to put the pieces together). I cringe, because I think putting your new relationship on blast on the internet is kind of gross especially so quickly. But of course, I get obsessed with checking in and accidentally like one of this new persons other pictures.  A few hours later, there's one of my ex sleeping in bed with more dreamy words.  I feel so grossed out by this point and realize that checking in on this is very unhealthy for me, so I block them both. 

So the things I have heard about this person are starting to seem more and more true.  The first story I heard was about this new person laughing hysterically at a friend who had fallen down the stairs, and not in a nervous laughter.  Second I heard was that this person is just young, aka immature. This was the nicest thing I had heard.  Third, goes into some territory that makes me very uncomfortable and very nervous.  I ran into a friend who does not know my ex, as we were work friends and never really ran into each other when my ex and I were together.  I'm catching up with her about a job interview I have that I'm really excited about and just really doing the things I need to do for myself while I heal from my actions and this breakup. She realizes that she actually met my ex the other night and the new person she's seeing.  Within moments of meeting my ex's new someone, my friend starts getting grilled over grabbing the last slice of pizza she was offered.  She was being gaslighted over a slice of pizza and it's relentless. I ask if maybe she thought the person was trying to be funny, and we both sort of realize that it doesn't matter because gaslighting is not funny. She tells me how uncomfortable it made her from someone she didn't even know. She had not context or bias to tell me this story, but started saying how nervous she is for my ex because this person is going to build her up and then really tear her down. Super charming at first, seemingly smart but throughout the night, my friend realized how much this person seems to put on.  Another friend tells me whenever she sees this person that they are always smarmy, curated, and creepy. 

With everything that I've heard and everything that I feel, I think this person might be a complete malignant narcissist.  Moving so quickly with someone freshly out of a 2 year relationship was my first sign that I don't trust this persons intentions and then just everything else that followed. Friends say it's none of my business and that my ex has to figure these things out for herself.  It's killing my conscience to not say anything because I have dated some not great people for me and friends didn't tell me how awful they thought they were until after we broke up. I know I can't say anything though, because my ex is definitely not thinking clearly (accused me of breaking into her house to drop off something--i never had a key to begin with?) and would think that I was trying to smear this person so we could get back together.  I think that would drive her more into this person's life and really fall more into the grips of what could be a very dangerous relationship.

I'm really trying to move forward but I'm having a hard time not getting upset at the situation.  I know that by living better, I am doing the right thing for myself even if there were ""no promises"" made about getting back together or not. I've finally implemented no contact, because I said what I needed to say and I guess we've both said all we need to say until some time goes by.  I just don't know how people can move on like this so quickly and I feel like our whole relationship meant nothing, and that moving on is the only thing I can do but damn. this sucks.





  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Broke up with my ex two months ago to take care of myself and my mental health.  Ex met someone new within 2 weeks. I've heard real bad things about this new person. We also haven't fully resolved our relationship and what happens next, whether it is friendship or more or nothing.  I think she's falling victim to classic Narcissistic, possibly malignant, behavior. A friend of mine was gaslighted by them. How do I stop thinking about how shitty this person is and stop worrying about my ex being with them? "

I've read that I must fly to Quito, take a bus, then take a bus into the sanctuary. I can get from New York to Merazonia, but I feel since this is likely to be once in a lifetime travel opportunity, I hope to be able to visit many more places. I was wondering how to book hotels, hostels, flights, and WWoofing stays. However, I am unsure if I bring a computer or will even have access to the internet during my stay. I've been so reliant on the internet at home to plan whenever I want and my phone for directions. Would one recommend that I should plan everything in advance or can somebody offer insight to help me figure out how to book and travel with very limited access to the internet?

As for myself, I've traveled often in America and other countries, but I've always had either my car, my phone/internet, or friends to offer a solution. I don't speak Spanish well but I am picking it up at an okay pace.  I am traveling alone so there's no help there.  I am Korean but I really doubt I'd run into any issues of that sort but I am starting to worry standing out as an obvious American, and after the election, I'm unsure how that will affect how I'm viewed.  I have never Woofed but I'd give it a chance if it allows me to see a new place and a roof over my head.  I would ideally love to feel comfortable and confident enough so that I could rent a motorcycle and just explore the towns as I have in America. I'd love to make this a reality. 

EDIT - 1.26.17 - 8:06
I think I'll unlock my phone to save maps, look up places to stay, figure out bus schedules, etc. Since I think I am not bringing a computer, does anybody know how to store photos? Usually I dump my card every night onto the laptop, but now I'll be unable to. I don't know if I can upload to a cloud either if I only have my phone and my camera. FWIW, I own a Fuji XT1 and want to shoot a lot of nature to broaden my professional opportunities in the future.

5q9etv,0,2017-01-26,9 Y/O Mixed/Domestic Breed Cat,antigroove,AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/5q9etv/9_yo_mixeddomestic_breed_cat/,"Hello, my 9 year old short-hair domestic, mixed breed cat was recently diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma. Unfortunately there seems to be some confusion/consternation among the vets we've spoken with given the history, what's happening with him now, and the specific diagnosis. I'm hoping someone might help make sense of all this and provide some insight on treatment options.

The main points are follows (detailed history at bottom of post):

* We've been struggling with an area of apparently necrotic tissue since April, first in the mouth, now the nose; continuing despite maxillectomy procedure in December.
* Tested negative for cancer in late May.
* Tested positive for cancer in December.
* No obvious tumor or evidence of metastasis, rather localized necrotizing tissue.
* He has had a milky-white eye since he was a kitten. Tested negative for FIV and FeLV; but family history of FIP, with one female sibling having a similar trait of one milky-white eye dying of accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (we suspect effusive FIP).
* Consternation by local vet, oncology consult intern, and oncology radiation tech about the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma given how rare that is in cats and that it has manifested in the mouth followed by the nose. Also given that we've been fighting *something* since May, and it hasn't progressed to a point of being life-threatening (yet, although I suspect we're on the cusp now).

I suspect it's a cutaneous lymphoma, but that's based on 0 medical training and just hours of Google-Fu. So first I'd like to get a little more confidence about what we're facing.

From my discussions with the various vet folks, it sounds like treatment would be a tossup of radiation (~$6k sans travel) or chemotherapy ($5,500). Since I'd have to drive a considerable distance for radiation and the cost would be all at once, I'm leaning towards chemo (CHOP). But wow, that price tag, when the average I'm finding around the web is closer to $1,500-$3,000. Apparently we don't have anywhere local who can do the... mixing? dosing ... of the drugs, and our vet is looking to use Oncure, which apparently bumps the price considerably.

What are your thoughts on my cat's situation? Does the diagnosis seem logical? If so, what should I expect in terms of prognosis, and do either of the treatment options change that? Are there alternative treatment options I should explore?

I feel like I've just vomited info all over the place, so please forgive me. I'm alternating between dark despair and unspeakable hope. I just want enough knowledge to feel like I'm making a well-informed and reasoned decision.

Thank you.

History of events as follows:

* 04/11/16: Semi-regular teeth cleaning resulted in tooth extraction for top-left canine. Everything else looked normal, and vet was shocked by the level of apparent tissue rot in the gum there.

* 05/10/16: Cleaned out wound. Dental and flushed abscess.

* 05/27/16: Another cleaning procedure and also took first sample for histogram from hard palette. Came back positive for osteomyelitis, negative for cancer.

* 07/08/16: Performed bone graft / flap procedure. Vet wanted to wait 3mo or more to give it a chance to heal.

* 10/25/16: Still not healing properly. Vet attempted another bone graft but was unsuccessful due to lack of healthy tissue/bone.

* 12/13/16: Maxillectomy performed on the upper-left part of his jawbone to stop spread of infection throughout the rest of the jaw. Procedure went well, and all seemed OK apart from a small bump on his nose which we attributed to the surgery. Second sample taken during surgery for biopsy. No indication of masses in abdominal/chest X-ray. Mandibular lymph node not noticeably enlarged.

* 12/22/16: Biopsy came back positive for round-cell neoplasia. We requested immunohistochemistry stains to differentiate it.

* 12/27/16: The bump on his nose became a sort of black scab.

* 01/05/17: Additional scabbing occurred on nose itself, growing to encompass the majority of the left side of his nose.

* 01/17/17: Received results from staining:

CD3: The neoplastic cell population exhibits diffuse, moderate to strong immunopositivity.    

CD20: The neoplastic cells are diffusely negative.

INTERPRETATION, COMMENTS: 
These findings suggest the neoplastic cells are of T-cell origin and support a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.

* 01/18/17: Tested for FIV and FeLV - both came back negative. The large area of scabbing on his nose fell away, attached only by a small patch of tissue, resulting in a large cavity.

5q9ixn,4,2017-01-26,Are there any books which I can use to help clearly define what my goals should be if I want to become a software engineer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5q9ixn/are_there_any_books_which_i_can_use_to_help/,"Hey all, I haven't been able to find this in the FAQs or from searching, but do not hesitate to point it out if someone has already asked this.

I am a goal oriented person. If I have something I want to do (e.g. Become a software engineer, learn Python to a working level, become proficient with git to the point where I can list it as a skill) then it is tremendously helpful if I can break this down into smaller goals, and sort of draw out a path through them that I should take. 

I think I know what I need to do on the programming side in order to learn a language, at least to get beyond beginners level, but on the careers side I'm floundering. Beyond 'learn a language', I don't know what I need to do to become a software engineer. For reference, I am a second-year mathematics student at a good British university, with a beginners level knowledge of Python that is steadily improving. 

Of course, tips like 'get internships' are helpful, but the ideal for me would be some sort of panoramic overview of what I need to know, what I need to do, and what preparations I need to make. At the very least, I'd like to know enough to *know* that I'm headed in the right direction with what I am currently doing. Are there any books/blogs/websites/etc that can help me figure out these goals? "
5q9mim,11,2017-01-26,*** Mitgliederrundbrief zum Thema Björn Höcke ***,Alternativer,the_frauke,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_frauke/comments/5q9mim/mitgliederrundbrief_zum_thema_björn_höcke/,"Liebe Mitglieder und Förderer der Alternative für Deutschland,

fast auf den Tag genau acht Monate vor der Bundestagswahl und vier Monate vor den Landtagswahlen in Schleswig-Holstein und Nordrhein-Westfalen steht unsere junge Partei zum wiederholten Mal vor einer großen inneren Herausforderung, während wir unsere Kräfte zugleich für die sachliche Auseinandersetzung mit den politischen Gegnern bündeln müssten.

Es ist uns wichtig, Sie auf direktem Weg über die Inhalte und Interpretationen der Dresdner Rede von Herrn Höcke vom 17.01.2017 zu informieren, die für uns vor allem ernste Fragen bezüglich seines Verhältnisses zur Partei und ihren demokratischen Gremien aufwerfen. 
Darüber hinaus haben seine Äußerungen der Partei zum wiederholten Mal in der nationalen und internationalen Öffentlichkeit geschadet, weshalb der Bundesvorstand mit großer Mehrheit Parteiordnungsmaßnahmen für erforderlich hält. 
Es ist aus unserer Sicht nicht hilfreich, die Verantwortung für diesen Schaden bei verkürzten oder verfälschten Zitaten der Medien zu suchen, die wir gleichwohl scharf kritisieren.

Zu einer politisch reifenden Partei wie der AfD, die von wachsenden Wählergruppen ernst genommen werden will, gehört auch die bittere Erkenntnis, dass in dieser Rede nicht nur Sprengpotential für die Einheit der Partei, sondern insbesondere auch für das Demokratieverständnis der AfD enthalten ist. 
Diese Probleme nicht zu verschleppen, sondern zeitnah zu klären, halten wir als Bundesvorstand für unvermeidlich.

Da uns viele Bitten erreichen, die Sicht des Bundesvorstandes genauer zu erläutern, werden wir in diesem Schreiben mit wenigen Beispielen problematische Passagen der Rede vorstellen und Ihnen außerdem ein Transkript der Rede zur Verfügung stellen, damit Sie sich selbst ein eigenes und umfassenderes Bild machen können.
Den vollständigen Wortlaut der Rede und eine kommentierte Kurzfassung finden Sie auf unserer Webseite unter folgender Adresse (Kennwort: afd2017):
https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/

**1 . Einheit der Partei, Parlamentarische Arbeit**

Erinnern wir uns: Spätestens seit Anfang des Jahres 2015 hat die Partei leidvoll erfahren, wie damals wichtige Protagonisten versuchten, die Mehrheit der Partei inhaltlich zu verengen. 
In monatelangen Auseinandersetzungen wurden viele Mitglieder und innerparteiliche Konkurrenten bis tief hinein in die Privatsphäre beschädigt. 
Die inhaltliche Debatte aus dem Wahlprogramm 2013 blieb dabei auf der Strecke, der innerparteiliche Streit eskalierte, die Zustimmung laut Umfragen sank bis auf 3%.

Heute, im Januar 2017, sind wir in zehn Landesparlamenten plus dem EU-Parlament vertreten, es gibt zahlreiche Gesetzesentwürfe und Anträge zu Landes-, Bundes- und Europathemen, die teilweise Eingang in Regierungshandeln gefunden haben. 
Zwar hat die Intensität der Ablehnung des politischen Establishments mit den AfD-Wahlerfolgen dramatisch zugenommen, allmählich wandelt sich jedoch die Berichterstattung zu politischen Inhalten, extern verstärkt durch vergleichbare Entwicklungen in ganz Europa und den Vereinigten Staaten. 
Die Umfragewerte im Vorfeld der Wahlen stehen bei bis zu 16%.

Innerparteilich stand B. Höcke bereits mehrfach im Fokus der Kritik. Obwohl der neu gewählte Bundesvorstand 2015 das Verfahren auf Amtsenthebung im Landesverband Thüringen aufgehoben und damit einen konstruktiven Neuanfang markiert hatte, führten Vorfälle wie sein Auftritt in der Jauch-Talkshow im Oktober 2015 und eine höchst problematische Rede über das angeblich genetisch bestimmte Fortpflanzungsverhalten der Afrikaner im Dezember 2015 zu Hunderten von Parteiaustritten und Zerreißproben auf verschiedenen Parteiebenen und einer einhellig beschlossenen „gelben Karte“ seitens des Bundesvorstands. Als Partei haben wir nach all diesen Auftritten dutzende Veranstaltungsorte, Unterstützer und Spender verloren, auch der AfD wohlgesonnene Verbände ziehen sich zurück, und die Verankerung in der Gesellschaft wird dadurch immer schwieriger.

Die Beteiligung B. Höckes an einem Hintergrundgespräch mit der Hauptstadtpresse in Berlin im Juni 2016, die dort vorgetragene, medial wirksame Diskreditierung der Parteispitze als „moralisch ungeeignet“ und zuletzt eine Presserklärung über angebliche Tricksereien auf einem Parteitag in NRW hatten am 7. Januar 2017 zu einer Befassung des Konvents mit seiner Einmischung in Angelegenheiten eines anderen Landesverbandes geführt. 
Durch einen mit breiter Mehrheit gefassten Beschluss wurde B. Höcke zur nächsten Konventssitzung vorgeladen. 
Dies hat seinen Grund auch darin, dass im August 2016 der Konvent klare Verhaltensregeln für Funktionsträger beschlossen hatte, nach welchen solche innerparteilichen Übergriffe zum „Tabu“ erklärt worden waren.

Nachfolgend ein erstes markantes Zitat aus Höckes Rede:
„Wir müssen immer bedenken, mit Bernd Lucke sind nicht alle die gegangen, die ihren Frieden mit der Rolle eines Junior-Partners in einer zukünftigen Koalition mit einer Altpartei gemacht haben. 
Manche von ihnen, manche von diesen Luckisten sind geblieben. 
Es sind die, die keine innere Haltung besitzen, die Establishment sind und Establishment bleiben wollen oder so schnell wie möglich zum Establishment gehören wollen. 
Und liebe Freunde - nicht wenige von diesen Typen, nicht wenige von diesen Typen drängen jetzt gerade in diesen Wochen und Monaten als Bundestagskandidaten auf die Listen, oder als Direktkandidat in den Wahlkreisen entsprechend nach vorne.“

Hier werden pauschal AfD-Listenkandidaten in allen Landesverbänden und fast 300 Direktkandidaten unter Generalverdacht gestellt, entweder „Luckisten“ oder rückgratlose Karrieristen zu sein. 
Aus dem Mund eines Vollzeitparlamentariers (mit Dienstwagen und Chauffeur) ist dies eine Respektlosigkeit gegenüber den zumeist aussichtslosen Direktkandidaten und den tausenden ehrenamtlich engagierten Parteimitgliedern, die für ihre Leute vor Ort kämpfen.

Fortsetzung Zitat:
„Nicht wenige werden – das muss man leider annehmen - nicht wenige werden ganz schnell vom parlamentarischen Glanz und Glamour der Hauptstadt fasziniert werden. 
Und nicht wenige werden sich ganz schnell sehr wohl fühlen bei den Freifressen- und Freisaufen-Veranstaltungen der Lobbyisten.“

Dutzende Parlamentarier in den Landtagen beweisen tagtäglich durch inhaltliche Arbeit im Parlament und durch Arbeit in Bürgerbüros und bei zahlreichen Veranstaltungen, dass dieser Vorwurf haltlos ist. 
Parlamentsabgeordnete, die sich Tag für Tag der oft zähen Arbeit an den Sachthemen stellen, verdienen die volle Rückendeckung der Partei, keine Abqualifizierung als „Karrieristen“, insbesondere, weil sie nicht nur ihren eigenen Kopf, sondern auch die Reputation ihrer Familien und Freunde dafür hergeben, dass die Programmatik der Partei weiterhin mit klarer Kante vertreten werden kann.

**2 . Differenzierte Geschichtsbetrachtung statt „180°-Wende“**

Ein Zitat zum Umgang der herrschenden Politik mit der Nationalgeschichte Deutschlands:
„Und diese dämliche Bewältigungspolitik, die lähmt uns heute noch viel mehr als zu Franz Josef Strauß’ Zeiten. Wir brauchen nichts anderes als eine erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad! 
Wir brauchen so dringend wie niemals zuvor diese erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad, liebe Freunde. 
Wir brauchen keine toten Riten mehr in diesem Land.“
Wir alle verurteilen den Missbrauch von problematischen Teilen unserer Nationalgeschichte für die Zwecke gegenwärtiger Politik. 
Dabei handelt es sich um eine pseudomoralische und pseudopädagogische Instrumentalisierung der Geschichte zur Verhinderung einer vitalen und interessenwahrenden gegenwärtigen deutschen Politik. 
Eine solche Instrumentalisierung soll die Bildung eines unverkrampften Nationalbewusstseins unmöglich machen, das jeder gut funktionierende Staat benötigt.

Es braucht jedoch keine „180° - Wende“ der heutigen Selektion der deutschen Geschichte mit umgekehrter Verengung des Blickwinkels. 
Wir fordern stattdessen eine offene und allseits kritische Befassung mit der Universalgeschichte, in welche die deutsche Geschichte als eine von vielen Nationalgeschichten eingebettet ist. 
Unsere Geschichte ist in weiten Teilen ohnehin nur aus der Interaktion mit anderen Völkern, Staaten und deren Kulturen zu verstehen und gegebenenfalls zu bewerten.

**3 . „Das Denkmal der Schande“**

Diese Passage der Rede hat in der medialen Öffentlichkeit erwartungsgemäß ein großes Echo ausgelöst. 
Teilweise wurde von Zeitungen unvollständig oder gar verfälschend zitiert und anschließend auch korrigiert (FAZ). 
Für den Bundesvorstand ist diese Redepassage zwar ebenfalls problematisch, gravierender ist jedoch B. Höckes Umgang mit seiner Aussage. 
Denn er veröffentlichte am Tag nach der Rede dazu die folgende Erklärung:

„Wörtlich habe ich gesagt: ´Wir Deutschen sind das einzige Volk, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat. 
Das heißt, ich habe den Holocaust, also den von Deutschen verübten Völkermord an den Juden, als Schande für unser Volk bezeichnet. 
Und ich habe gesagt, dass wir Deutsche diesem auch heute noch unfassbaren Verbrechen, also diese Schuld und damit verbundene Schande mitten in Berlin, ein Denkmal gesetzt haben. 
Was ist daran falsch? Was ist an dieser Feststellung zu kritisieren? Gar nichts!“

Tatsächlich hat B. Höcke am 17.01.2017 in seiner Rede etwas anderes formuliert und versucht nunmehr, mit einer nachträglichen Erklärung die Öffentlichkeit zu täuschen. 
Denn auch er zitiert sich selbst verfälschend:

Hier das Transkript der gesprochenen Rede vom 17.01.2017:
„Wir Deutschen –und ich rede jetzt nicht von Euch Patrioten, die sich hier heute versammelt haben- wir Deutschen, also unser Volk, sind das einzige Volk der Welt, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat.“

Höcke nimmt am 17.01.2017 die anwesenden „Patrioten“ ausdrücklich aus der Gruppe der Deutschen heraus, die das „Denkmal der Schande in das Herz der Hauptstadt gepflanzt haben“. 
Anders gesagt, dieses Denkmal ist nach Höckes Worten eben gerade kein Denkmal der Patrioten. 
Er charakterisiert die Errichtung des Denkmals auf diese Weise als unpatriotisch. 
Unabhängig von der Bewertung einer solchen Aussage sollte man als aufrechter und ehrlicher Mann dazu auch einen Tag später noch stehen.

Ganz abgesehen von diesem Geschehnisablauf bleibt die Frage, warum wir uns als AfD in dieser Zeit vor vier wichtigen Wahlen in dieser Form mit diesem Thema „Holocaust-Denkmal“ öffentlichkeitswirksam beschäftigen, statt unsere politische Programmatik mit Leidenschaft und Fleiß zu betreiben. 
Denn unsere Wahlergebnisse werden in hohem Maße davon abhängen, was wir den Wählern an politischen Inhalten zu bieten haben.

**4 . Das Demokratieverständnis der AfD und seine Vermittlung für die Öffentlichkeit**

Wir lenken Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf folgende Passage der Dresdner Rede:
„Ich möchte, dass Ihr Euch im Dienst verzehrt…Ja, liebe Freunde, ich weise Euch einen langen…und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Ich weise dieser Partei einen langen und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Aber es ist der einzige Weg, der zu einem vollständigen Sieg führt, und dieses Land braucht einen vollständigen Sieg der AfD und deshalb will ich diesen Weg –und nur diesen Weg- mit Euch gehen, liebe Freunde!“

Die AfD hat einen Gründungsmythos, der mit dem Gedanken der Erneuerung der Demokratie in Deutschland zu tun hat. Darüber reden wir viel, bemühen dieses Prinzip – manchmal auch etwas schlagwortartig als „Basisdemokratie“ – und haben einiges dazu in unser Grundsatzprogramm geschrieben. 
Fest steht, dass wir uns am stärksten von allen Parteien in Deutschland darum bemühen, die Mitglieder in Programm- und andere Prozesse einzubinden. 
Versuchen Sie, diese uns so wichtige Grundhaltung in Verbindung zu bringen mit dem hier abgedruckten Zitat. 
Versuchen Sie sich vorzustellen, welche Gedanken sich Bürger von außerhalb unserer Partei dazu machen, wenn sie diese Passage lesen und Ansatzpunkte suchen, um uns fundamental politisch und juristisch anzugreifen. 
Einen weiteren Kommentar zu dieser delikaten Frage wollen wir uns ersparen.

Die vorgenannten und weitere hier nicht zitierte Passsagen aus der Dresdner Rede vom 17.01.2017 in der Gesamtschau mit vorangegangen Äußerungen seit 2015 haben den Bundesvorstand am 23.01.2017 veranlasst, sich mit der Einleitung von Ordnungsmaßnahmen gegen B. Höcke zu befassen.
Das komplette Redetranskript als auch eine Version der Rede mit Kommentaren und Fragen finden Sie - wie oben schon ausgeführt - auf unserer Webseite unter der Adresse: https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/ (Kennwort: afd2017).
Es ist uns bewusst, dass die Befassung mit den aufgeworfenen Fragen ein für die Partei schmerzlicher Prozess ist. 
Unsere Verantwortung als Bundesvorstand für alle AfD-Mitglieder und die vielen hoffnungsvollen Wähler in Deutschland sowie politische Partner im Ausland gebietet uns jedoch, eine offene und ehrliche Debatte über die Natur und Ausrichtung der AfD als parlamentarische Partei oder als „Bewegungspartei nach B. Höcke“ zu führen. 
Dazu gehört auch festzustellen, wie wir intern mit unseren selbst gewählten demokratischen Gremien umgehen und welche politischen Themen wir in der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren wollen.

Die öffentliche Debatte über das Verhältnis der AfD zur historischen Betrachtung des „dritten Reiches“ der Nationalsozialisten ist keine demokratische Entscheidung der Basis, sondern wurde ihr durch B. Höcke zum wiederholten Mal aufgezwungen. 
Nicht, weil medial berichtet und skandalisiert wurde, sondern weil B. Höcke ausdrücklich für sich in Anspruch nimmt, den besten Weg zum Erfolg für die AfD zu kennen und umzusetzen. 
Er zelebriert sein Geschichtsverständnis und verleiht ihm seine Sprache. Damit zwingt er die ganze Partei ohne Not, sich damit – eben auch öffentlich – zu beschäftigen, wann und wie er es möchte. 
Der demokratische Entscheidungsweg wäre, zu solchen schwierigen Themen die innerparteiliche Meinungsbildung zu suchen und sich dort Mehrheiten zu verschaffen. 
Eine öffentliche Kommunikation kann eben erst dann stattfinden, wenn sich eine Parteimeinung gebildet hat. 
So funktionieren demokratische Parteien!

Der Bundesvorstand ist sich bewusst, dass die Medien kurzfristig den Streit zu Lasten der AfD in ihrer Berichterstattung nutzen werden. 
Gleichwohl halten wir die Frage der Ausrichtung der AfD als realistische parlamentarische Alternative mit einem klarem Bekenntnis zu Deutschland in all seinen Facetten einschließlich der Verbrechen des „dritten Reiches“ für geboten und den durch Björn Höcke aufgezeigten Weg einer 180°-Wende in der Geschichtsbetrachtung, sowie die Verächtlichmachung des Parlamentarismus und seiner Vertreter für einen Irrweg, der die AfD von einer Partei zu einer „Bewegung“ (ein Begriff, den B. Höcke wiederholt verwendet, jedoch nirgends definiert) umformen würde, die ihren Anspruch, demokratische Mehrheiten zu generieren, aufgäbe. 
Dieser Weg würde die AfD als Partei nicht nur unglaubwürdig machen, sondern mittelfristig auch ihrer demokratischen Legitimation berauben. 
Es ist also inhaltlicher Dissens in einer substanziellen Frage der Alternative für Deutschland, die uns zu diesem Schritt veranlasst.

In gemeinsamer Sorge um die Partei grüßt Sie ganz herzlich
Frauke Petry im Namen des AfD-Bundesvorstands

5q9ot5,0,2017-01-26,Should I work during this summer? (CS related),pompom_123,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5q9ot5/should_i_work_during_this_summer_cs_related/,"Hi guys, I am currently 3rd year UBC student majoring in CPSC. I know tomorrow is the technical career fair and quite a few of co-op jobs are available on scope but I'm not sure if I want to work at any of the companies that are listed on the scope. During the winter holidays and up to few days ago, I had interviews from all of the big four companies but I was not able to qualify for the SDE intern position from all of them at the final round. 

As there aren't that many 4 month work term for co-op, should I just take summer courses and re-apply to these companies in July so I can prepare myself for those interviews? Recruiters from all of four companies have encouraged me to get in touch with them if I want to do the interview for Jan 2018 internships. My only concern is the ""gap"" between May to July. I do want to do a personal project that is quite ""huge"" but obviously from recruiter's perspective, it might seem like there weren't any improvements after the initial rejection. What do you guys suggest? I was thinking of maybe seeking for research positions related to CS during the summer but I'm not sure if that even exists. 

tldr; am I better off prepping for those interviews on my own again until July? Or work in May~Dec(Possibly Aug)? 
Would love to hear some suggestions, thanks in advance!"

5qa5so,3,2017-01-26,"I was viciously emotionally abused by my mother, who uses playground bully antics for everything.",wolvenreign,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5qa5so/i_was_viciously_emotionally_abused_by_my_mother/,"Before I start, i want to thank you for reading this. Really, really truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking the time to read my story, whereas so many are unwilling to hear it at all. Not my Dad, not a good chunk of my friends, not my family, not even the police. Thank you.

Let me introduce myself. I'm 28, male, and I was born in Orange County Hospital in Orange, CA. My Mom was 45 at the time she adopted me, having already had 3 girls of her own by my Dad, who is a year younger than her. We moved out of California to Indiana when I was 2 years old, for my Dad's job as an electrical engineer.

I grew up in a small Indiana town called Zionsville. As a child, my life was completely miserable. My allergies were so bad that I could barely breathe outside, despite my parents calling it ""fresh air"". At school, even starting from Kindergarten, I was relentlessly bullied. No kid would even give me the time of day, except for one that I became close friends with. I was so socially ostracized that, despite knowing the answers just about any time our teacher would ask, I was relegated to the special education room, known as the ""resource room"". Even though I kept being nice to everyone I met, they would only look at me in scorn and insult me. It's no wonder I had bad grades; school was a nightmare that I just wanted to be over. 

Of course, the nightmare didn't really end at school. It just meant that I had to deal with one bully as opposed to 20. When I went home, there she was; my Mom, waiting to taunt me relentlessly over any little mistake I made. If I misspelled something or if my shoes were untied, she would immediately scream at me. Usually it was, ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! ARE YOU RETARDED OR SOMETHING?!"". Something I found out would be a recurring theme. From that point even to this day, she has had this compulsion where she can't just correct you on something, she has to compound it with an insult. ""ARE YOU RETARDED?! YOUR KEYS ARE RIGHT FUCKING THERE!"", if you're looking for your keys. (This is something she does to both me and my Dad, by the way. No one else, though.)

If I ever got hurt and started crying, she'd look at me and do the mocking gesture for crying. ""BOOHOO! GROW UP! YOU'RE 5 YEARS OLD ALREADY!"" or however old I was at the time. If I was sick, she'd insist that I was faking it to get off of school, sending me to my room and not even pretending to care. Although, admittedly, I would do that too, but considering school was an absolute hellhole, I think I might have been justified about that.

Oh, last thing about my school before we move on. I was so tortured by all of the kids in class (which the teachers would never believe me about) that in the fourth grade, I went absolutely psychotic. I took my recorder (the instrument) to class that day and tried conquering my fear of heights on the jungle gym. But I was overweight and I slipped and fell, right on my face. My class was gathered around and they laughed at me, not even stopping to see if I was okay. I snapped and chased after them with the recorder, catching all 13 of them and smacking them across the face with the recorder before being caught by the faculty. I was suspended for two days from school, during which I was grounded.

(That was, however, the last violent incident I ever caused in my life. And I still don't entirely excuse it or say that it wasn't my fault at all, just that it was what brought me to that point.)

After the fifth grade, I was home schooled because of how much the constant bullying was distracting me from my schoolwork. I barely avoided flunking in 5th.

Anyway, back to my mother. She would often shove me growing up if I ever spoke back to her when she insulted me, even if I just politely asked her to stop calling me stupid. She'd frequently talk about my Dad behind his back, which is apparently something she'd done even when my much older sisters (who had moved out at that point) were growing up. They'd argue all the time, my Dad's meekness constantly giving in to my Mom's insanely aggressive, freakishly bullying demeanor. She'd just start picking fights with him over small stuff, like dishes or how he would refuse to buy her something she wanted. If something was the tiniest bit out of place because of my Dad, she'd launch into a tirade about how he never does anything right and how he's a stupid, ignorant man. For the record, I always thought my Dad was cool, if a bit spineless. He was very intelligent and taught me how to use a command line from the time I was only 2 years old. It always made me sad to see him pushed around for no good reason. The weirder part is that we were a Christian family, and our church always talked about how the man is the head of the household. (I'm an atheist now and I no longer believe that, just as an aside. No, it doesn't have anything to do with my family situation, it has to do with reason, but I won't get into that right now.) It didn't seem to matter to them, though; despite how religiously dogmatic they were, that was one rule they were content to leave broken.


When I got a bit older, around 14 or so, my Dad lost his previous job and signed up to work for Basement Beautiful, an Owens Corning division that installed this specialized basement finishing system. He wanted me to work with him, and I did. In fact, throughout all of my high school years, even when I wanted to leave the job and try high school again (though I had thought it would be a nightmare just like elementary school), he wouldn't let me and said he needed me to work with him or else our family would go broke. (Oh, one time when I was 12 he forced me to climb Iron Mountain in San Diego, CA...with no water and starting at 4 o clock in the morning, racing me up there before the sun rose and figuratively pushing me back down when I collapsed multiple times. But he just told me ""I'd get over it."" I guess that was the one weird time he was really uncool.)

Anyway, around the Basement Beautiful era is when my Mom truly went insane. She kept demanding that we move from Indiana to Hawaii, even when we came home dog tired from working from 8 o clock in the morning to 2 o clock the next morning. She'd wake up and tell us how stupid we are and how we should just move to Hawaii. My Dad would meekly tell her that we couldn't afford it, and her only response was, ""WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! GOD WILL SORT IT OUT! IT'S WHAT GOD WANTS! HE SPOKE TO ME!"". This would be the conversation they would have every day, no matter how long or hard Dad and I worked when we got home. No appreciation, no love, just more screaming about moving to Hawaii and more insulting us.

The other daily conversation was about the hardwood floor that my Dad had started to put in for my Mom's birthday and didn't have the time to finish. Every day, she'd scream, ""DAVIT! WHY HAVEN'T YOU FINISHED MY FLOOR YET?! WHY?!"", right into his face as loud as she could. She'd break into tears and keep yelling. My Dad's only reaction was to meekly apologize.

Whenever I asked her why she'd do that, her response would be something along the lines of, ""He owes it to me! He gave it to me for my birthday and he never finished it!"". I'd bring up that he's a 58-year-old man who was busting his butt at a physically intensive job, and she'd say, ""So what?! He gave it to me for my birthday and he DIDN'T FINISH IT! That's what matters!"".

Anyway, the company melted after the 2008 housing crash, and me and my Dad found ourselves out of a job. I was done with home school at that point and got my GED to back up my home high school diploma. I started college at DeVry, but quickly dropped out when I realized what a scam that school is and what a sucker I was taken for. In the meantime, my Dad had to desperately look for another job. When he found a really good paying one, he took it, but it was in Indiana. When my Mom found out that my Dad took a job that wasn't in Hawaii, she was furious (what else is new?). She went into a tirade and yelled and screamed even louder than I thought was possible for her. ""WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MOVE TO HAWAII! WE AGREED TO MOVE TO HAWAII!"", she said over and over and over again. I had just about had it, and I stood up for my Dad. Or, at least, I tried. When I started matching her volume, yelling at her about how ungrateful she was (quick note, she doesn't work. Ever.) and how she's crazy to think that we can just move to Hawaii and everything will work itself out. Of course, then I got scolded for that from my Dad. Sigh.

Things didn't get a lot better from that point on. I struggled to find a job, only getting into internships occasionally for computer places. My Mom would relentlessly torture me about it, too, and does even to this day because I'm still struggling to find permanent employment (although things have changed well enough in very recent history, so that's good). She'd scream at me everyday, ""WHY CAN'T YOU FIND A JOB?! EVERYONE HAS A JOB, IT'S EASY!"", despite never being able to hold a job herself, EVER.

Here's a pretty good example of our interactions. I'd try a way to make money online, and being enthusiastic about it, I'd occasionally tell her about it and what I'm trying. (My mistake, I guess...) She would constantly interrupt me and say, ""Well, if it's such a good idea, where's the money?!"" Obviously it was still in process and I hadn't managed to make it happen yet, but she would still shriek it at me in her insanely shrill, witchy, angry voice. She put her fingers in her palm and squirmed them around to signify money and put that gesture right in my face, as if to annoy me on purpose. I got so frustrated that I knocked some of her books over. She then acted incredibly shocked. ""HOW DARE YOU! HOW DARE YOU KNOCK OVER MY BOOKS JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR LITTLE HISSY FIT!"" I tried to apologize, but then she said something she's said since I was a little kid; ""SORRY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!"", which got me incredibly agitated and I started yelling at her again. About a week later, I tried apologizing again, and gently tried to explain how frustrating the particular gesture she used was. I said to her clearly that I was just demonstrating it, but she immediately got so upset that she pointed a knife at me.

So to recap; getting angry enough to knock some books over at her gesturing X is unforgivable, but me doing EXACTLY the same thing to her, not even genuinely meaning it, but trying to demonstrate how agitating it is, means that she gets to point a knife at me.

My Dad refuses to listen, despite being a victim of the same bullying behavior. He just says that I should never raise my voice at her, and threatens to kick me out of the house if I ever yell back at her after she yells at me. Even when she shoves me or grabs me by my throat. I have been deeply tempted to slap her, but I have never raised my hand against her, no matter how violent or insulting she is towards me.

Things came to a head recently. She started screaming in my ear about some dishes, and I yelled back, mostly out of surprise because it came out of the blue. So she did something I thought even she wouldn't do; she went to go find my Dad's revolver so she could point it at me. Yes, that's right...she went to find a GUN. Thankfully she never found it, but I heard her looking for it and got scared enough to call the police.

Of course, the cop that showed up was much more obsessed with me being 28 and without a job, so he immediately took my psycho mother's side. He actually told me that even if he found me unconscious on the ground and bleeding if my Mom had hit me with a frying pan, he'd still want to take me to jail. ""Because your Mom is your Mom, and she could make you pay rent if she wanted."" Dumbass hick cop probably couldn't tell his ass from his elbow, not unlike my own mother.

And make no mistake, she IS incredibly stupid, though I never insult her to her face. She's a 7th grade dropout, for fuck's sake! She can barely figure out how to open her E-mail, and she loses things all the time. When she loses her keys and I see them, I just calmly point to where they are, despite deeply wanting to scream at her the same way she does to us. ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! ARE YOU STUPID?!"", she'll say with a sneering look on her face. ""YOUR KEYS ARE RIGHT THERE!"". When I ask her about this behavior, she says, ""I didn't call you stupid! I just asked if you ARE stupid!"" And she really thinks that is a legitimate excuse. She thinks insulting people in this way is okay and normal. That's how dumb she really is!

Oh, and she LOVES to gaslight me. She'll say, ""FUCK YOU!"" over and over again, and then later she'll deny it. ""I never said that! You're just making that up!"" again in her ridiculous, sing-songy, childlike tone.

I don't know what to do. I have tried deep introspection, and I am always thinking about what I can do to make our relationship better, but nothing works. I try to change my habits, but she'll always find some small slip-up to scream at me about. Yelling back, even just to show her how incredibly provoking it is, doesn't work either, because I'll always be seen as the bad guy by everyone else involved, especially my Dad. Her hypocrisy never ends, and I'm constantly drowning in it.

Because of her, the idea of having a relationship is completely poisoned for me. The first time my girlfriend would yell at me, I would immediately want to break up with her and never speak to her again, which is obviously unreasonable. For that reason, I try to find relationships with strictly submissive women who wouldn't even think of raising their voices at me, but I never find any. But maybe I'm too emotionally damaged to even inflict that kind of relationship on someone else. Why should my girlfriend have to pay for the emotional baggage that my mother relentlessly heaped on me? As painful as the idea is, it really is best for me just to stay alone for good. Not that any woman has ever been interested in me, mind you. I want to be happy with that, but a part of me won't let me. Yet, the part of me that won't let hope die is also likely the part of me that will just make some undeserving woman's life complete hell. No one deserves that...

Sigh...I guess I'm finally done. Sorry, I know that was super long, and I'd be really surprised if anyone read it all...it's just left such a deep scar. I don't even really think that getting all of this off of my chest will really cure it, but maybe it'll let me sleep tonight."

I'm currently a software dev working full-time on a flights/crew management platform for a local company. A lot of the work is web dev customizations for large clients like BP, Apache, Shell, etc. It's a nice gig, and I truly can't complain. Good team lead, great tools, ""startup-feel"" nested in a more stable company. It's the job I've been looking for since finishing college two years ago. But I've been here two months, and this just isn't fulfilling.

I really want to serve people, and build relationships. I enjoy work that is hands-on; not just ""hands-on-keyboard"". And have a bigger purpose than a paycheck for why I work every day. I hope to make my way into network pentesting, but I'm afraid I'll get there and find the work unfulfilling again. A good mentor of mine running a staffing business suggested I find an IT/tech-specific career aptitude test. Do those exist? I've only found the more generalized tests like that. Does a position like this exist in our industry?


EDIT: I don't mind programming. I frequently work on my own projects at home, and it feels like creating. But this throwing code at a wall until shareholders and team lead are happy makes the C#, JS, &lt;hip-framework&gt; feel no different than when I was writing COBOL and JCL 3 years ago for an internship."

The medics carry off a bloodied Junkrat into the backstage as the two towering LED screens flashed into a clip: a fat, plump man, with his hairy stomach out, was swaggering to the camera, with his one hand beating his chest, the other firmly gripped onto his large, golden trophy.

It was finally the day he has been waiting for. It was the Royal Rumble.

Reinhardt was finally broken from his trance when he heard the referee shout at the top of his lungs: ""Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelcome to the Royal Rumbleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!""

""Standing in the ring at 7 feet, 4 inches tall, weighing in at 754 pounds, from Stuttgart, Germany.... Reinhardt!""

The crowd went wild, and shouted ""Reinhardt! Reinhardt!"" While the armored German bowed to the audience.

""Bring it on! I LIVE for this!"" 

The noise abruptly ended when the entire coliseum went dark, smoke seemingly slowly creeping up on the stage and even the front row seats, as a dark hooded figure suddenly appears beside Reinhardt, and then spins out of control, taking the tank by surprise.

""Ah, Reaper! I should have known it was you."" Reinhardt says with a heavy accent.

Reaper does not say a word, and immediately goes in for a Shadow Step. This time though, his motion was met with a heavy swing which sends him flying off the ring, and out of the competition.

The watchers on the sidelines chant ""Justice! Justice! Justice!"" while he howls ""Justice will be done!"" 

But just before he could celebrate his knock out, a piercing zing and a zap bolted from the backstage -- the next thing Reinhardt knew, a large bomb was lobbed at him and explodes, sending him to the clothesline.

Tracer congratulates herself, as she stalks the bulky piece of armor, looking for an opening. ""Right on target!"" she voices, when a rapid barrage of mini-rockets poured from overhead. 

""Justice rains for above!"" Pharah screams, as she follows up her signature move with a sneaky wrist rocket that knocks the Englishwoman into the sidelines.

Audible disappointment could be heard from Tracer's elimination, but she beamed a large smile at the audience. ""This one's for you, Emily!"" which sends droves of men and women swooning.

With Reinhardt gaining some footing -- thanks to his barrier, which shielded most of Pahrah's shots -- a new challenger calmly walked onto the stage, throwing a flashbang so he could not be preemptively knocked over.

McCree aims his revolver onto Reinhardt, and looks at Pharah. ""Now, hold on. We both want this guy out, right? Now, let me do my darn work.""

Too late -- in a split of a second, Reinhardt was charging like a mad bull onto the bounty hunter. He effortlessly rolls to safety, but the whole ring is now thrown into utter chaos.

""I tried being reasonable, didn't take to it,"" McCree taunts, his face turning red. He fires a whole round from his trusty revolver, Peacekeper, and nimbly dodges all of Reinhardt's failed charges. 

While the two were in a brawl, the sniper distances herself from the fight, doing her best to line up an aerial killing blow on to both of them, when suddenly, a chain hook pulls her off the stage, and out of the competition. ""Grounded!"" he roars among a booing crowd, while he himself slowly climbs on stage.

He boldly declared ""Roadhog time!"", as he carelessly throws his trophy on to the commentators.

With both McCree and Reinhardt significantly weakened and weary, the one-man apocalypse props his Scrap Gun, and lets loose blazing hot pellets which pushes back the two aspirants as they helplessly crumble to the steady stream of shrapnel.

Both competitors down and Roadhog unscathed, he arrogantly bellows ""No pain, no gain, boys. This is why *I* am the champion here. Violence is usually the answer."" The crowd boos yet again, hurling insults and 

Suddenly, the limp and worn out McCree rolls to Roadhog's side. He shifts his gaze to McCree's direction, and Reinhardt took the chance to sneak in a huge Earthshatter, which destabilized the current champion.  As if the world slowed down for Roadhog, who was down on his knees, McCree then flashes a weary smile to the camera, mutters ""It's high noon,"" and mercilessly fires his killshot onto Roadhog.

""I heard there's a nice reward for bringing you fellas in,"" he says as he blows the smoke off his gun.

But his penchant for flair likewise got him into trouble, as the heavily armored man bashed through McCree's body, pinning him to the corner 

""Back, and ready for more!"" he shouts, as he swipes his hammer to propel the bounty hunter off stage.

Ding ding ding!

Reinhardt has just won. The crowd was cheering him on. There was no greater feeling.

The referee went on stage, holding what was once Roadhog's prized possession, and lifted Reinhardt's hard -- or at least, up to where the referee's arms could reach.

""Ladies and gentlemeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen, your NEW, Overwatch Wrestling Champion --""

**Thud.**

A brief case plopped down on stage, and opened to reveal a huge sum of literal cash -- the fabled Payload in the Bank. The owner was cashing in on the opportunity to take down the now-dead-beat-and-drained Reinhardt.

The camera pans to a 19 year-old to the sidelines, in her easily recognizable uniform of predominantly purple, with countless advertisements fighting for space.

""Annyeong!"" D.Va perkily greets, as an imposing machine descends from the ceiling. She hops on the mech, capitalizing on the utter shock of Reinhardt, the referee, the commentators, and the bystanders, to prep herself for the inevitable battle ahead. ""MEKA activated!"" she cheers, as she uses her boosters to jump on the stage and start firing on to the poor supposed-to-be champion.

Reinhardt braces himself for another huge hammer shot, enduring the pings from D.Va's mecha, and successfully breaks through her Defense Matrix -- her shield of sorts -- and manages to destroy the machine.

D.Va ejects, visibly shaken, but Reinhardt was, alas, too spent. The Korean pop culture icon readies her Light Gun, amidst cheering fanboys and even *sasaengs* -- who waited in bated breath for her to finally cash in. She launches a continuous chain of projectiles on the helpless Reinhardt, until he was completely shoved off stage.

The lady looks around, wary for retaliation, but when the crowd finally chanted D.Va's name over and over again, she knew she had finally won the championship title. 

""Viewers from all over the world, we have just experienced a *shocker* of an ending to this year's Royal Rumble. Your *new* Overwatch Wrestling Champion, The 16-Bit Hero, D.Va!""

She excitedly snatches the microphone from the referee, and jumps around the stage, as she greeted everyone with her victory cry: ""*Geim-eul hamyeon igyeoyaji*. (I play to win!)""

**About me**

Hello, /r/GiftOfGames, I'm kennish from the Philippines, 21 years old. I am fairly new to computer gaming. My interest was rekindled last December, when I gifted my girlfriend a copy of The Sims 3, plus Pets, because I remember her telling me stories of how much she has wanted to play Sims ever since. She couldn't find a download anywhere. But during the Steam Winter Sale, I chanced upon the discount, and immediately grabbed it for her. This led me to exploring more of Steam.


During a Christmas party where we stayed over my friend's place, he offered to let me play on his Overwatch account, and I was immediately hooked. Being the KPop and KDrama fan that I am, I opted for D.Va, with my friends making remarks such as ""That's no surprise,"" and ""Of course you'd pick the Korean!"" I hosted some board games that night, and a session of DnD, and played whenever we would take a break, or when they dozed off to sleep.


Since that day, I've really wanted the game, and have followed content, memes and news about it.


**What is Overwatch?**

Overwatch is one of the most-requested game in this sub, according to what I've read. Produced by Blizzard Entertainment, the same makers of Starcraft, Hearthstone, and WoW. It's a team-based first-person shooter game, but instead of rigid roles, there are various heroes with abilities and designs which separate the game from other shooters -- and it definitely lives up to the hype.

Each team is divided into six players, with each team trying to secure a certain objective on the map. And speaking of maps, there are various locations in the game, which makes it all the more immersive.

**What do I like about the game?**

I firmly believe that if you ask any Overwatch players what they like most about the game, they will answer the heroes. They bring a certain quirk to the game, which many other games do not bring. In a manner of speaking, it's like a MOBA game, since each character has his or her (or its) own strengths and weaknesses, and the other team must consider these while engaging.

Okay, I still need to gush some more about character design. Overwatch, not just a game, but rather as a pop culture phenomenon, has made waves throughout the world. Each hero has a backstory which some people may relate to, and Blizzard even follows up the content with comics and cinematics. I've definitely developed a certain attachment to some of the characters, and it's one of the most persistent reasons why I want the game.

**My background**

I hate to leave a sob story here, but aside from my short story, I'll expound a bit. I've always wanted to play computer games (played DotA2 during my internship breaks with my boss), but couldn't due to financial restrictions when I as a student while I balanced some part time work so I wouldn't be much of a bother to my mom. Now that I'm working, life hasn't been the best, but it's improving little by little. I still have two part time jobs, but sneak in gaming during my breaks and weekends, when I have some time to unwind. Our country isn't the most well-off either, so what I earn is usually funneled into living expenses for my mom, sister, and I.


**What spurred me to make this post?**

I would really love to be the most patient gamer, and slowly save up for Overwatch. However, Blizzard has revealed the Chinese New Year event, which comes with some exclusive skins. All my friends immediately tagged me in their D.Va posts. The D.Va skin was really what captured my attention, and now I really cannot shake it off my mind.

At each internship I was kind of surprised at the inefficiency of some of the older employees. At each internship I spent time working ""under"" a couple different engineers and ended up doing a lot work similar to what they did, if not the exact same work. Which is great, I'm thankful for the job experience, but I was surprised at how long it took them to do the same task ESPECIALLY if it involved any work on a computer. At the internship I'm currently working at, I'll get week to week and a half long projects (according to the person who assigned them to me) that are easily doable in 2 or 3 days. I'll admittedly slack off a bit and finish the projects in 4 or 5 days, and even then the older employees are always really impressed how I got ""all that work done so quickly."" I am just curious as to if anyone else has had a similar situation? "

Call your state's National Parks, and ask to be connected to the social media manager. Tell them that you are a state resident who regularly uses the park, and that you are worried about Trump's fascist suppression of scientific facts. Tell them that you approve of the Badland/Golden Gate/Death Valley twitter trend, and that they should do the same. Offer to do research for them. If they're a natural park, then offer to link them to a couple of climate change studies. If they're a historical monument, offer to look up the average temperatures during the year the monument memorializes, and compare that to the last three years.

This will be effective for multiple reasons:

* Social media managers are almost exclusively millennials or interns, who will most likely be willing to contribute to the cause.
* There is a great level of autonomy afforded to national parks. This can cause them to be able to post scientific facts over social media for an extended period of time before the administration demands removal.
* Few, if any, people call national parks regularly. If there is an inundation of calls, the individual park will be more likely to take them seriously/respond.
* Trump has unintentionally hyper-legitimized social media. By de-legitimizing the regular media and posting almost exclusively on twitter, he's shifted power **heavily** towards social media.

This can happen. Look at the attention that those three parks have gotten. We can literally make a change with this.


If you google ""List of (your state's) National Parks"", you will probably be presented with a list, with the contact info of each park just a click away.

A couple of days ago I applied for an internship position. It was more of a ""why not?"" application, as I am unqualified for the position (for one, they require C++ expertise, and I have no such thing).

Today (two days after my application) I received an email from a recruiter asking for a phone interview with me. For any other position I would have accepted, but I am having second thoughts about this one.

I'm in the middle of my midterm examination and the coming week is extremely pressing for me. I don't know whether I'm qualified enough for the position, probably making this interview a waste of my currently very limited time. Also, I don't have time to prepare for this phone screen either.

So on one hand I doubt they would waste their time with a phone screen for someone far below the qualifications, but on the other hand I don't have the time to prepare for this.

Any feedback is very much appreciated. Thanks."

5qbvoq,1,2017-01-26,Future Advice Request,mrmopper0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qbvoq/future_advice_request/,"I am a Math major and enjoyed coding all throughout school. I developed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for my final project in java (big mistake). But when I graduated I got involved with a group that wanted to be actuaries.


The position sounded great and I had no internships under my belt. They have these exams that take 500+ hours of studying each to pass on probability and financial mathematics. I thought it was nice be able to earn a career through tests so I studied. I am now on the other side of these exams, having passed both of them.

I find myself completely outclassed by people who have been pursuing the career since highschool (even middle school!) and I am ready to give up. It is that competitive. It is a lot of work down the toilet, but I at least learned a lot of financial and statistical concepts.


I have just gotten back into coding because a redditor said that it would be a good option for someone like me, and have learned quite a bit. There are of course things on postings that I don't know. I am about to start working in a warehouse for Amazon. I've had this position before, at the end of the day I am exhausted and can barely even stand, much less study. I am currently 1.5 years out of school.

**Here are my questions:**

1)Is this Amazon position as beneficial to getting a professional coding position as studying coding? 

My thinking is on one side it is easier to get a job if you have one, and Amazon may want to hire me as a programmer if I am committed to the company already. On the other side there are plenty of terms on posts that I don't recognize, without studying my knowledge may not be great enough. My knowledge level so far is I can write programs for dynamic algorithms, sorting and the like, make apps with winforms, develop websites with html/css/javascipt, R graphics, basic data analytics, and brief sql queries.


2)Given a list of technologies, how should I approach topics I do not know (such as frameworks I haven't used)? Am I really expected to know all of them for an entry level position, or are they expecting me to lie?

I feel I would need to lie to some extent as I have not seen two jobs with the same list of technologies, and just because I can write SQL in Oracle, doesn't mean I could in MySQL or MS SQL Server. The combinations of skills seem endless.


3)My final question questions are general. What are some unexpected challenges to becoming a programmer? Is there as question I should be asking but am not aware I should be?


With this I will open up the flood gates. If you require additional information to answer, I would be happy to give more details. However I am leaving over the weekend to help supervise some youth inter-tubing in the mountains so if it is after my departure you may need to wait a couple of days (with bated breath). 

Thank you in advance.

5qce41,8,2017-01-26,[Rant/Vent] FREEDOM IS BEAUTIFUL,WynterTwylight,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5qce41/rantvent_freedom_is_beautiful/,"I've posted in here once, and commented a little, and generally found a lot of support here. 

First, I've got a question: do you all find that you attract Ns as SOs? 

Basically I found this awesome girl. She agreed with me on almost anything and we shared a lot of the same hobbies. After a bunch of deep conversations (we were friends for nearly 2 years before we started dating) I quickly realized she was the closest thing to perfect I thought I could find. She even got along with my shitty N family and all of that. So we started dating. I fell in love. She claimed that she was always in love, and everything was wonderful... until it wasn't. 

Most of you know the story. You basically wake up one day and something doesn't seem right. They're too agreeable. Or a story doesn't make sense. Things like YOU WERE THERE and the story is different now. They copy you, and you start realizing that everything they say is just what you want to hear, and it all suddenly feels fake. 

Basically, I realized quickly (thanks to my Dad--who divorced Nmom and took me with him) that she was totally an N and I felt duped. Like I'd given up a lot of my friends because hers were so much better, and the attention she gave me was so easy to fall into. But I FIGURED IT OUT. So enter the breakup (she broke up with me because I ""wasn't giving her the emotional attention she needed"" and she ""needs twice as much attention than what I can give"". I'm not an emotionally distant person, but geez red flag army appeared again and again. I made the mistake of trying to be friends (she suggested it, so it couldn't be that bad) and that was an awful choice. Enter the whole everytime-things-are-fine-they're-suddenly-awful phase. Last Friday I was at a social gathering with her, and I didn't know anyone but one person besides her there, and she wouldn't stop talking to the one person I did know the whole time amongst putting me down in front of the people I befriended and generally making me feel like shit. 

Now, N-ex had gotten me into writing fanfiction, and used to look over my stuff before I posted it, and I got it in my head that I couldn't post something without her seeing it first. So I quit letting het see my stuff because I didn't want the criticism (it was getting worse towards the end and it wasn't fun to write anymore). By the time she left me, I'd broken away from needing her to edit, and didn't have any negativity from it and actually nothing but good reviews. 

But I went home after that party and did see a harsh review, and the first thing that popped in my head was N-ex's voice telling me (in that creepy, flat tone) ""this is what happens when you don't have an editor"" and I made the decision to go NC because she was in too deep. Like f*** that. No way that's any way to live. 

I'd never done NC before though. Not with my Nmom or her family, because I needed their financial support for college. But N-ex... I blocked her on everything. Snapchat, Facebook, my phone, Tumblr (that's the big one), etc... basically everything but real life. And it was SCARY. 

But geez, I saw her the next day, and just turned around and walked away. She tried to get my attention, but I ignored her for the first time ever and I felt so GOOD after that. Like I'd sprouted wings and was flying. I'd been so depressed about all of this for so long... and now that she's gone I feel like I am my own person again. The best part of running into her was that I could walk away and she could never contact me. I'll still see her around campus, but she graduates in May and got an internship on the other side of the country :)

But through all this, I figured out something interesting. I hate my Nmom for just being awful to me and abusing me growing up, but my dad always told me he didn't hate her, he just pitied her. I wondered why, and I didn't get it until I dated an N, and it's weird. Like, I really don't approve of what my N-ex did, at all. I won't forgive her because she tried to get away with all her crap. But I don't hate her. I just want her gone, and I have that now. 

Inevitably she will try to come back and be all nice and such, but I won't fall for it. Nope. I've got my friends and my good family to make sure I don't too :) 

BUT GUYS I'M FREE AND MYSELF AGAIN AND I FREAKING LOVE THE WORLD AND WAKING UP AND NOT HATING MYSELF!!!!!! 

I'm now on Day 5, and she's tagging me in posts on various social media websites, but since I blocked her they're just empty usernames with no links. My good friends told me about this, and how it makes her look like an idiot. 

AND I DIDN'T EVEN CARE. LIKE SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS AND HAS NO CONTROL OVER ME!!! 

And no one ever will again :)

TL;DR - Dated a Narc. Finally went NC with them. Best decision I've made in years."

I obtained a programming certification from UCLA extension (did 4 quarters there while working day time at a IT job). So far i have had the following roles: a unpaid internship at a digital agency, what i did at this role was learn web dev (not that i was foreign to it, just hadnt worked w/html/css/javascript before) and i brought myself up and i continued to ask my project manager to review my work and he gave me work to do but only one project and rest of the internship i got nothing so i ended up asking the boss to consider me for a role but he said he'd let me know (which never happened)

a few weeks after this conversation with the boss i landed a role as a developer at a company that sells womens airbrush products, i did a programming test for them on site and they seemed to like my work and i was hired and i worked there for three weeks, now keep in mind im not a bad employee (my own bias here: on time, respectful, all the basics, doing what i needed to do to not ensure any problems). i was laid off, due to poor sales or they thought i was a nice guy and didnt wanna throw the book at me.

4 months after this i landed a job at another company that makes auto dealer websites and i went out of state for a week to train with them and same story again, but this time i was fired after three weeks, i asked for feedback, they wouldn't answer me on it, nothing, and keep in mind i dont know what i did wrong here.. no clue period

i found another company and i got in and i started right away as a junior programmer this time for a company in asset management, i did QA for them first since their program was huge, then later i started using doing work for them in COBOL (yes because they were founded in 1979) then i was supposed to move into ASP.net since they were migrating their code to that, 6 months into that job i was let go, on the basis that i didnt pick up their program fast enough..

being that it has been a year since i was let go, i still wanna go into development but job hunt has been slow, not that i havent been trying, i interview well (based on the feedback i got from others) but for one reason or another im not getting in, i mean at this point what suggestions you have? i wanna be a programmer maybe i should do IT first then hope i can move in a company?"

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

I did five internships at a company but when I graduated they had already finished hiring and didn't have any openings for me.

I've gotten a few interviews and one on-site but I only wanted the on-site (fair pay/ great environment), and they didn't offer me the position. 

I also discovered my Resume was actually far too long so the 70ish positions I applied to all got a rather poor resume. 

I've since updated it (you're welcome to review it). I've been applying to new places.

I've been plugging away, but I'm getting discouraged heavily because the only recent interviews I've gotten are places that try to undercut a fair salary by roughly 10k. 

It's getting really difficult to not get discouraged because my girlfriend just got a Software Engineer position for a great company and has significantly less on the job experience than me. As happy as I am for her it makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. 

I probably should have been more career-minded during my undergraduate studies but hind-sight is 20/20. 

I'm looking for advice on keeping positive minded, what fair expectations should be for my job search and possibly what resources are available to me that I haven't tried yet.

Career Fairs at my University are a good place to start right?

Any and all advice is appreciated."

* Total Compensation: $120,000 - $130,000  

I'm going to reply with a counter-offer, I have a few ideas. I am contemplating just asking for $125,000 base with $10k bonuses, or keeping the $120,000 base with $15,000 in bonuses, but $5,000 paid out as a sign-on. What do you think? Thanks!  

**Edit**: I'm a Computer Scientist  
**Edit2**: I'm a 26-year old male with a Computer Science degree (Bachelors and Masters) from a top 10 university. I am currently at my first job out of college, with 3.5 years experience there. I also have 4 summers worth of internship experience working for NASA. I've brought in about $2 million to my current employer every year. I do business development (engage with customers, write white papers and proposals) and also execute technical tasks that cover software and hardware, most closely related to ""DevOps"". I am currently based in Washington, DC and commute to Maryland. With my current company, I have to stay in Maryland. With the startup, I will be able to move wherever I want. The startup is offering healthcare (price unknown), dental (unknown), vision (unknown), 401k (unknown how good the options are), and unlimited sick time. Parking at the startup is about $6 a day that I need to cover. There is no relocation bonus. I have a fiance that runs an online business so she can move wherever. The startups proposed bonuses are completely set at the owners discretion. No equity/stock/options."
5qd80o,1,2017-01-26,Whats the point??,cyberdioxin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5qd80o/whats_the_point/,"First of all, im 23. I havent been diagnosed with depression and google isnt the most reliable source for questions like ""do i have depression"". Im thinking of finally going to a phychologist though cause maybe it will help me a bit. My story goes like this: i was bullied during elementary school nothing that extreme as ive read or heard but i wanted to suicide so badly when i was about 10yrs old, i tried to hang myself but i miserably failed cause i couldnt even do that, im that useless..soo i was crying every single day back then. In middle school i was like a ghost, these were 3yrs of my life that i decided to study hard but i was always mediocre or bad no matter how much time and effort i had put in, i just couldnt understand so many things. High school,, i met my bf when i was 16, he brought light into my life, i didnt have suicidal thoughts since elementary school and when i met him i felt blessed i didnt do it back then. And about that time my problem begins. The educational system in my country sucks but i wont go into details, the thing is that we are paying extra tutorings schools after school to get prepared for the final exams that will place us in some university. And at that last year i just broke, overworked so much and at the last 2 months i couldnt even study, i got 11/20 (i just felt again so shitty for myself), i passed to a uni at a different city, i went there, the first year was the best year of my life, i liked it even though it wasnt my option, not that i had any dreams, i have no dreams and i hate that. Around these 3 yrs i was there, i developed thanatophobia, i couldnt sleep, i have insomnia since i was 17, i was crying and kinda screaming when i was thinking about death and i would sit down and move back and forth to relax. And on the 4th year of uni, i went back to my city, my family home, u see i could stay back there but since i was done with all of my classes, i decided to go back earlier and save more money for my master (i believe a master will make me feel smart cause im just so stupud).Aaaand was the worst decision, i havent regretted anything that much. My mother divorced my father and went to live with her 10year younger bf she had the past 7 yrs, so basically the whole ""family"" that wasnt even a family proved to be absolutely fake, my dad was like shit and a piece in me died seeing him like this, but i also feel my mother cause its just bad being with someone u dont love anymore. So, my mother had to spend some money for her new life and at that time (1 year ago) i basically spend almost all of the money i had aside (the irony) my dad also needed money for me and my sis so i couldnt ask him or my mother for more. I spend 6 months lookin for an internship, i was like shit at that time cause i was doing noooothiiing! And here i am today, im doing my internship in a really cool place (i wanted to go abroad but i also failed to do that) i dont even deserve to be. I dont have money for my master, i still dont feel happy with the things that used to make me happy, i just wanna cry everyday again, thanatophobia + suicidal thoughts, mediocre and stupid, havent achieved anything special for my standards at least,insomnia, i hate that i dont live alone anymore, i wanna get the hell out of this house and my country. The only good thing in my life is my bf i met when i was 16 and i havent told him how i feel inside cause i dont wanna make him sad. And lately im like, whats the point?all the struggle??for what??mediocrity?still not achieving anything??being empty inside??i dont rly know anymorr why do i wake up every morning .."

5qd89l,7,2017-01-26,Quick Internship Question,slowsuby,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qd89l/quick_internship_question/,"Quick question for you fine folks. 

I recently found out that my college offers a lot of math/CS classes during the summer. Great! This lightens the load during the regular semester. I also realized I can get into Data Structures (required for internships) as soon as spring 2018. Previously it was Fall 2018 so I can get a jump on internships a year earlier than I expected. 

Here's the question. I currently work in a non tech role with good benefits, but a shitty wage. I could easily make $3-$7 more an hour at an internship, but I'm guessing interns don't get insurance. Target graduation date is spring 2020 so I'd graduate with that magic 2 years of experience. My daughter is also on my insurance so she'd have to transfer to my wife's, which is going to be expensive. 

If you were me, what would you do? I'm itching to get started and dive into some real world work. 

Tldr: To start an internship a year early or not?

Pros: 2 years of experience upon graduation. 

More money

Good connections. 

Cons: losing insurance for myself and child. 

Not always guaranteed to be working? Maybe? Not sure how internships work exactly. 

Thanks!!"

Let me tell you a story. A story that begun many years ago but its most important part starts right now. A story that answers the question - how to be free?

I guess the beginning of this tale should be placed when I was a kid but I'll skip the boring stuff and go straight to the point when I'm finishing my BE in Economics and thinking what do I want to do in my life. After finishing my high school I was so full of life, so happy to learn new things that can help me become a successful person. I didn't know what I want to do but I wanted to be somebody. So I went to a university. I saw all those ambitious students talking about internships in multinational companies, sharing their experience about their projects and stuff. That looked promising. The next day I applied for a job in one of those multibillion dollar enterprises. A corporate. A job for people in suits. At first I was quite excited to learn how that kind of company works. You know, employees sitting in a big office at their desks from 9 to 5. They looked happy so I was happy too. At least I looked like I was. That was the first time that I asked myself - is this who I want to be? Do I want to spend next 20 years sitting at this very desk and considering moving to an office as the biggest achievement of my life?

So I quit. I went on a job interview and got a job in startup. Didn't know a thing about programming but everyday after work in the corporate I sat on my laptop and learned what I needed for an internship. I guess it was enough because I still work there. Of course, now after almost 2 years I got quite experienced but I wouldn't call myself an expert. I still strive to be one. But do I?

I dropped my university thinking that I have no time for learning things that I will never use. It turns out that school doesn't they don't teach you how to be a successful entrepreneur. They want you to be a great worker. Kind of 'Rolling Stones' style. I wanted to learn something that would be valuable in my life. So it's high time to officially start the Financial Freedom Project.

From now one, till the last day of 2017 my goal is to quit my job. Well, I know, I can quit it anytime but you know what I mean. I want to have financial freedom.

How can I do it? It's easy. Sort of. Not really. No.

A change like that is never easy but no one told me that it will. I'm prepared for what's to come.

You'd say - hey, dude, you should have a plan before starting that kind of project. Indeed I do.

Fortunately it's not only me in this project. One of my best friends also realized that working for somebody else is not an answer if you have dreams. He asked me once - where did our dreams disappear? I want to see the world but how could I if my office is the place where I spend most of my life? We need to change it.

So now we take the matter into our own hands.

Let me take you on this journey from starting a company to quitting a job by the end of the year being able to live without the need to work.

Soon I will let you know what will be the first step but now let me get some sleep before heading out to work tomorrow morning. Again. Just like everyday. But, hey, it's about to change, isn't it?

If you already did it, please let me know, any help will be much appreciated.

If my topic doesn't seem right in r/personalfinance, give me a call where should I post i.t"

A little back story on me.
So I'm 25 years old and I currently work for LA County making about 30k I have always wanted to try IT but due to bills, a wife that does not work and a kid on the way I figure I could not afford to take the chance to start a brand new career as it may lead to a pay cut since I have no experience or certs.

Now, God is good(not pushing religious belief on anyone) I get a call for a paid internship with the county since I'm a veteran which needs no experience and its a pay increase, abut 40k. 

The job consists of :

Heavy phone support

Call intake

Documenting calls

Working with multiple applications to resolve helpdesk tickets

Data entry

Now I accepted the job and am just waiting on a background check.  My question is what should I be doing to get ready for the position and where should I be looking to be in 5, 10, 15 years.

TL;DR: Got lucky with new job in IT field, don't wanna mess it up, don't wanna be stuck.

A lot of full time jobs require internship experience. How are you supposed to gain that, after graduation?

The recent situation in the US has pushed me over the edge and I have begun looking for jobs in other countries.

I will be graduating with a B.S. in Bioinformatics which as far as I am aware helps me as it has applications in a number of in-demand fields such as data science/statistics/machine learning and medical fields.

However, I am wondering if it is worth my time to look, as I imagine they generally would prefer someone with more experience.  I have a couple of internships but nothing major that would necessarily give me an edge.

I am really fine with going just about anywhere that speaks English, but failing that I am also ok with countries that don't necessarily speak English but may conduct a lot of business in English (Hong Kong, etc.)

It seems like my specialized degree can be both a blessing and a curse, because it is simultaneously considered in-demand, but with few openings.

I also wouldn't be opposed to getting a Masters / Ph.D in said country but I would prefer to get a job immediately.  However if that is my only option I may take it.

What would be my best path to a working visa in another country/ what is worth my time to look into?  For example, I've heard about Work Holiday Visas but I'm not sure whether they would apply to me.  I'm also not sure whether these can be upgraded to permanent resident status eventually, which is an option I would strongly prefer to have."

I would really appreciate any advice or words of encouragement. 

I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering in June 2016. I kind of knew that I really didn't like my major and was feeling a lot of anxiety at the time, but felt that I would just graduate, get a job, and figure things out. Well it's now 2017 and I still don't have a job. I feel like I am just trying to bull shit and fake my way into an engineering job that I don't even want. I feel like engineering is a poor fit for me, but then on the other hand I haven't had much industry experience besides internships. I'm pretty smart and technically minded, this is why I went the engineering route in the first place. I think I'm kind of getting depressed. I moved home with my parents to save money and that's fine, but I feel so lost and like a failure. I started taking classes for healthcare related options because that was something that deep down for the longest time I always wanted to do, but I still have a lot of doubt in pursuing this. I feel such an overwhelming sense of anxiety and stress about my future and I feel like I don't really know who I am or what I enjoy anymore. It's a rough feeling and I've never had to deal with something like this before. I know I should probably suck it up and stuff, but I can't help having the feelings I do. 

If anyone has felt similarly and could give some advice that would be great. Everyone tells me ""things will work out, you will figure it out"" but I'm in a really dark mindset right now and can't see that perspective. Something that recently got my interest was Sales Engineering because I feel like for me I do enjoy learning about technical things and products, but since I don't like actually designing them maybe that would be a good fit. I'm more extroverted than any of my peers ever were and am someone that really enjoys social interaction and building relationships. 

Thanks for hearing me out. Sorry if this came off as super winy, but I'm not in a very good mood and am just looking to vent and maybe hear some positive remarks right now. "

First I was thinking of an RP where I fuck daddy while mommy is in the same room (or mommy while daddy is in the same room) so we have to be quiet and secretive about it.

Maybe a scenario where I am a business woman, or supervisor of an office, or something similar. You could be they young intern, or new hire, or an employees child on take your child to work day. Either way we do it things can get very naughty very fast.

If you want we could do something different, maybe I am a housewife in your neighborhood and you've always been attracted to me, and today you finally decide to make a move. I could be your best friends mom.

One idea is that I am an equestrian or a jockey of some sort and I sleep with the horses or am raped by them or something like that.

Another Idea would be a teacher being fucked by her student, willingly or unwillingly. I kind of like adding the idea that she has a fiance and the student gets her pregnant.

Another would be me as a slave master's daughter and you play the slave with a very very large cock. I am in love with you and your cock, but we can't let anyone know how you dominate me when no one else is around

Another would be a bimbofication RP. Maybe taking me from a nerdy or petite and boring girl and turning me into a bimbo who only lives for cock.

Another is where I would play a fairy or pixie or some other variation of very small girl. Where we go from there is up to you. Maybe I am a girl who finds some kind of bug or plant or alien creature and it lays its eggs inside my fertile body.

Another is a scenario in which I play a young woman who maybe is going around selling cookies, maybe as a girl scout and you invite me in so I can tell you more, but that's not exactly what you had in mind

Another still I could be a girl who either you slip drugs into my drink or in some other way force me to take drugs until I am addicted to them. Potentially you could somehow associate the drugs with sex and therefore get me addicted to sex or cock or cum as well.

one scenario that might be fun that fits with this is if you were to play a character with powers like Kilgrave from Jessica Jones, just imagine how much fun you could have with a girl who never says no, even when she doesn't really want it.

Maybe one that features some bondage. Maybe you keep my tied up and have a machine fuck me until I'm raw.

Maybe one where a girl accidentally (or maybe on purpose) summons an eldritch horror and has to worship it for the rest of her life.

Maybe one where I'm a babysitter and things get a little messy, either with the kids or with the parents ;)

Maybe a Rule 34 scenario if you are interested

Any of these RPs would be awesome to play, but feel free to come up with your own RP scenario as well. All of these could be played as consensual or rape as well as adding in whatever kinks you would like. Maybe some raceplay added in as well, maybe some foot stuff. I've had footjobs on the mind for a while. One example that sounds good to me might be beastiality ;) I have a kink list [here](https://i.imgur.com/EsQ0fWk.png) If you would like to look at it. Keep in mind that I have almost no limits so feel free to add whatever you would like ;) in fact the more fucked up and dark the better. I am really in the mood for some very naughty kinky shit. Maybe some extreme bondage ;) I can't wait to hear from you ladies and gentlemen. send me that little orange letter ;)

**P.S. Tonight I am really in the mood to get very fucked up and potentially very violent and gross. I understand that isn't everyones thing so please don't be scared away, but if that is something you are interested in let me know ;)**"

I always shied away from programming and computer science for the longest time because I felt like it wasn't something I could be good at. I was struggled with math a lot.

I also felt alienated by my lack of experience in comparison to the other students in my introductory courses. Most, if not all of of the male students had taken AP Computer Science or some other course than had exposed them to programming in high school - or they had parents who helped them. I always felt like I was ten steps behind. 

I'm trying to get back into it now, after pursuing a different major for a while, but since I'm a junior in university, I feel like I'm so many steps behind. I only started looking for internships now, and it's been so long since I took those introductory courses that I feel like I'll never be good enough because I'll always be playing catchup."

I did a few internships in different size companies before graduating. After that, I worked for nearly a year at a large hardware-focused company under a contract. After that, I worked at a startup for 2.5 years, eventually taking on a leadership role managing a team of engineers. The company is having business type problems out of my control and I decided to leave.

My problem is, I don't know what I should do now. My first thought was to get a big name on my resume for the first time and join the ranks as an IC for a few years, but suddenly it seems unexciting to me. I went job hunting and was fortunate enough to get offers at Facebook, Microsoft, Uber and an early stage startup. I have to decide now. I'd have a bigger impact at the startup, but it pays less by at least 25% depending on which company I compare it to. I could do what my gut tells me, go try another startup. Or, I could follow the money. What I really want to do is what's best for my career, but I don't know what that is. I'd like to someday have an important directional role in a company as a technical leader. Or have my own company, but I need an idea first so I'm not holding my breath on that idea yet. I don't have any debts or children so I can handle some risk now.

Should I join another startup and try to do as much as I can and have a big impact and learn more things, or join one of the big companies and risk getting lost in the noise while giving my resume some name recognition?"

I have tried to pursue my own creative ventures that have just failed because my anxiety kicks in and holds me in my tracks. I just feel completely trapped.

I have a boyfriend who is loving and I'm happy with him. However we have had some serious things happen in the past that constantly puts me on edge and when I do move on from them, something else happens.  Since I've been with him I barely ever see my friends or have time to myself. He stays over all the time which a part of me loves but it means i cant work on my own things, my room is tiny, and when ive brought up the subject he says he will give me my own space but then i feel an awful sense of abandonment. It's a never ending cycle. When I say I meeting someone I feel like he thinks I'm going to cheat (he's been cheated on 4 times, so I can understand his paranoia). We argue all the time because I feel like he's trying to hurt me like the rest. We argue almost all the time and each time breaks my heart and i break down crying. We are barely intimate - he used to shower me with love in the beginning then he just stopped. Thinking back - he has never deliberately done so, and has been the most supportive of how I'm feeling at the moment. 

For the past 3-4 months I've contemplated suicide to the point where I have actually been googling effective ways to do so. I sit in my boyfriends car and barely speak and feel incredibly numb almost all the time. I cry newrly everyday and quite frankly I just want this to end. I want to be happy again even if it's just in one avenue of my life.

I have tried to arrange to see a doctor but it's been incredibly difficult, either something comes up, I'm bed bound and scared or appointments are weeks away. I physically can't afford to pay for a private therapist as I'm learning to drive for my job and that in itself is expensive. I have no support and when I talk to my family about how I feel they never understand. I'm told I'm overreacting which infuriates me. I cry all the time, stare into space for ages, lose focus on my job and the things i want to achieve. I genuinely don't know what I'm gonna do to myself at some point and I could really do with some of you to relate?"
5qfuba,2,2017-01-27,I have around a year and a half left until graduation. I have basically nothing. What can I do?,pomegra,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qfuba/i_have_around_a_year_and_a_half_left_until/,"So, I'm knee deep in a political science degree right now. I have basically no relevant experience and no relevant classes. I know it's not really a good predictor of future performance or interest, but I really enjoyed the introductory programming course I took last quarter. Plus, I'm thinking the political science degree isn't going to turn out so well financially for me.

I can't major in CS. It's far, far too competitive at my university - they turn down students for getting under a 3.5 for one prerequisite class in terms of getting into the major, and I bombed a few calc courses a year ago. So I'm going to need to look into other options. I go to the University of Washington, if you haven't guessed. Notorious for having a hell of a rat race when it comes to the tech majors here.

I'm thinking about switching to majoring in one of the related tech majors - Informatics, but I'm not counting on it, because it's nearly as competitive as CSE - around a 20% acceptance rate last year. 

I might end up having to stick with computer science or major in something very peripherally related like Geography and rely on what little experience and classes I can scrape up with my remaining time. 

What should I be considering? I definitely don't have enough experience to get any internships this year, but I'm thinking about picking up some of the recommended textbooks here and studying through data structures and algorithms so I might be able to apply to some next quarter. Perhaps starting up some projects. Maybe that's unrealistic. 

EDIT: Not sure if it matters but I have a metric ton of volunteer experience and political intern experience. Maybe that's irrelevant now. Or maybe it'll make me more interesting?"

I guess to some extent this is just an outlet for myself, but any advice would be welcome as I’m not sure how to move forward from different events that have happened in my life, as every time I try they seem to repeat.


I was a confident and overzealous kid, surrounding by supportive friends and family. I had so much love in my heart for everything and everyone, and I wasn't afraid of anything.


That person seems so far away now. 


At the age of 16, I got into my first serious relationship...and I fell hard. M was an artist with words and to date the most talented musician I’ve ever met. He was also deeply emotionally disturbed and depressed. I had never been exposed to this before, and a person that I cared about was hurting. I wanted nothing more than to make him happy in any way that I could.


M used to tell me about his past, about his cutting and suicidal thoughts. He assured me that that it was over, that I had made it all better. He put me on this pedestal as his savior and one true love. So when he started to message me in the middle of the night that everything was wrong, that he hated himself and he wanted to die, my teenage brain decided that I was no longer good enough and I had to change to become the medicine he needed again. I spiraled downward into this self-conscious mess that jumped at whatever opportunity they could to patch up another leak in the dam.


This begin to manifest in all sorts of aspects of our relationship, primarily our sexual relationship. We grew up in the bible belt - and premarital sex came bundled with excitement, fear, and true Southern guilt. What started as a frequent endeavor turned into constant rejections on his part. As a horny teenager this was frustrating, but I attributed it to a lowering sex drive due to his depression. Until he confided in me that he was using porn to get off, frequently. My self esteem plummeted, and M noticed. He attempted to remedy or solidify this (I’m still not sure) by initiating, then would deny me once I was hopeful enough to actually ask for it or make a solid attempt at having sex.


M broke up with me after a year of long distance in college (3 years total together), by telling me that he needed to get away from the things that hurt him.


I spent 2 years single in college, without even attempting to date. I struggled with bad depression and anxiety, and had trouble getting myself to leave the house.


Then I did I very stupid thing. In an attempt to overcome my fears of sex and rejection, I decided to form a FWB situation with C. C was a random guy off of Tinder that was the first person that really listened to me. He shared how excited he felt about me, and was also broken from a (much more recent) relationship and I naively decided to trust him. There’s not much to say here - C was a manipulative asshole who was well aware of (and agreed to respect ahead of time) my issues and instead used them to his advantage. He would alternate telling me how deeply he felt about me and it scared him, to telling me he never wanted to see me again and didn’t care for me at all, to trying to convince me to come over for easy sex. 


Now, I’m with T. T is older, established on his own, and more mature. He has let me open up in ways that I’ve never been able to before, and I think I’ve been able to do the same for him. I honestly thought he was a good guy that loved and cared about me, but was practical, not dramatic. He balances me in some very good ways, we have tons of similar interests and hobbies, and he can make me laugh like no one else. I could very easily see us working well not only as a couple, but as a partnership.


T and I met during a summer I spent at an internship. At early stages of our relationship, we’ve had to go through a lot of things that might break up a lot more established couples. Due to me finishing school, being financially dependent on my parents (and them holding that over my head), and dealing with planning my future, we’ve faced a lot of strain. He took a break from work and moved to be with me, but I dealt with more depression and heavy self-deprecation my final semester of school and it was rough on both of us. I ended up graduating a semester early, and am moving back to the same city as before in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, I am at home with my parents while T is already in the city. We’ve signed an apartment lease together and I’ve made a bunch of steps to take better care of myself and my mental state. I’ve started eating better and going to the gym, managing my stress levels, and pursuing things that I enjoy. 


Now that I’m “doing better”, T has begun to share reservations and issues he had during my final semester of college. He felt that it was drastically different than the summer (it was), that he couldn’t talk to me anymore and that I was just an accessory to him, that he was frustrated by our situation, and finally that he was having a bunch of issues about being sexually attracted to me. I gained a fair amount of weight that semester and was / am having an even harder time with my self-image. He says he thinks he has trouble seeing his partners as sexual partners, and that he wants attention from other people. He doesn’t understand it, because objectively he “knows these women are less attractive than me”, but he desires their attention more. He thinks it stems from his last relationship that was largely sexless and broken, and is compounded by the fact that I cannot get off from sex, only oral.


He finally has admitted this is a problem, as he one night flirted heavily with a mutual friend in a game we play online and discussing various sexual things with her in a joking manner, as well as polyamory. She afterwards told me very vaguely about it, and I become upset and confronted him about it. He then got very defensive and told me that he didn’t really do anything wrong, that it happened because he was unhappy with us (see above reservations / issues), that I was choosing to hold on to something just to be dramatic and I needed to let go (approximately 4 hours after I’d learned about this, granted I was still asking for details as they were coming out very slowly), that he really needed a partner that would just trust him (I’ve never to my knowledge displayed any mistrust before this event). He concluded all of this by getting really dark and saying cryptic things, and somehow the night ended with me consoling him and begging him not to leave me. 


Despite this, I somehow still really desire for things to work out with T. I feel like we’ve dealt with an incredible amount of stress that, while it doesn’t excuse this, definitely brought situations that were abnormal and not fair to him. I feel like me finally having a steady place to live, independent of my controlling parents (another, entirely different story that contributed a lot to T’s and my issues) will finally give us the fair shake we never really got.


I am moving, in three weeks, to live with T across the country from everyone I know. I am terrified of what my life is going to be like if we stay together and this continues to get worse. But I am even more scared of managing my life alone in this unstable state.


And I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so broken, unwanted, and useless. I know I’m supposed to find value in myself, but how can I, when 3 very different people have wholeheartedly rejected me not only as a person, but sexually as well. I really wanted to get better, to like myself and be happy, but everything in me is screaming I must be the problem. Nobody is this unlucky, just fucked up. Nobody will ever like me as a person. Nobody will ever find me sexually attractive.


I’m grasping at straws, now, to find reasons to keep trying. What can I do to overcome this and start seeing myself as a valuable person, or should I just give up on ever liking myself?

tl;dr: Struggling to find reasons to continue to try to like myself due to repeated emotional and sexual rejections in long-term relationships."

I'm currently deciding between 2 offers:

 - 3 months internship with G company.
 - 6 months with the largest online payment company. 

The 3 months internship allows me to graduate in 3.5 years with 1 more 3month internship. 
The 6 months one allows me to graduate in 4 years with 2 more 3month internships.

I'm currently undecided between the two because they each have strong merits. 

By the way, these are all situated outside of US.  
What I'm looking for is the course of action that increases my chances of intern-ing in the US in the subsequent year. 

May I know what are your thoughts about these two different course of action. Thank you so much!"

Although I frequent this sub a lot and have knowledge in the interview process, I'm completely clueless as to what happens after.

1. My starting pay is $18/hour, which the recruiting manager said was ""very good"". I know that a lot of west coast companies pay more with a housing stipend, but since the position is in South Florida, I guess it's adjusted for the area. It might also have to do with the fact that I have no experience. Am I being low-balled, or is this normal? 
2. The role I was offered was in embedded systems. Although I think the field is interesting, I'm more interested in software engineering and development. Will this have an adverse effect on my internship opportunities next year?
3. I was given around a week to accept the offer. As I was hoping to get farther in the interview process with some other companies first, I feel like it's a little fast. Is this normal?

5qh4lb,6,2017-01-27,Guy outside my apartment,Whiskey_neatPlease,creepstory,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepstory/comments/5qh4lb/guy_outside_my_apartment/,"So last summer I landed a paid internship in a small town in michigan. My dad drove me out there with all of my things to live on my own for the summer. I would be living alone and would have only my bike for transportation. This was actually fine because work was 3 miles away, a quaint little downtown area was about 2 miles in a different direction, and I could walk to the grocery store. There were bike paths everywhere too. I had hit the jackpot. 

I am a 5'1"" girl, and even though I lift a lot and am strong, I'm still small and could easily be taken advantage of. My dad is a police officer and was not thrilled that I would be living on my own, but he looked up the crime rate of the city and it was non existent so he felt safer. 

Anyways, I rode my bike to work the same time every morning, went to the gym attached to my work after work ended, then rode home and brought my bike inside so no one would steal it. On Sunday's I would walk to the grocery store literally .1 miles from my apt, and get food for the week. One day, in july, I was walking down the path of my complex to my building after grocery shopping. My door opened to the outside and was on the ground floor. I noticed a guy, about mid thirties, well dressed, with a veteran marines hat on standing in front on the path to my section, looking at the building. When he saw me, he stared at me the whole way. When I reached him I tried to step around but he wouldn't let me. Immediately i got a weird vibe from him. He stuck out his hand and introduced himself, saying he saw me walking and wanted to give me a ride, but instead he drove past me and waited outside my building. He said he had been watching me and knew I didn't have a car because I rode my bike everywhere or walked. I was like yeah I like being outside so I enjoy it, and started going towards my door when I realized he knew what section I lived in, but maybe not what room. I didn't want to go to my door and let him see which room I lived in. I kept trying to say well, have a nice day, bye, stuff like that to see if he'd leave, which he didnt. He got closer and closer to me until I was like screw it im going inside my apartment. As I was unlocking my door he was like, I live upstairs in room 412 or whatever it was, so come to me if you need a ride or help or something. I was like yeah sure, ok.

Next week, I take the company car home because I had a hair appointment and didn't want to be sweaty. This means I didn't go to the gym. I went to my apartment for about a half hour, then walked to my car parked across from my window. I hear legit sprinting behind me as I'm getting into the car. I thought I was going to die, and I turn around and its him, being like where did you get this car? I thought you only had a bike?? I told him I usually left my car at work because I liked riding my bike so much. He shook my hand again for a really long time and tried to talk to me more, and I noped out of there. 

A week later, my bf came to visit me. We got to my apartment from the airport with groceries, and who's sitting on their idling car but this guy, facing the window of my apartment, again around the time I should have been coming home from work. He gets out when he sees me and starts approaching, but then my bf comes around the side of the car and this guy gets in his car and drives away. I never saw him after that. In between all of these events I would see him multiple times in the week coming down the stairs when I would leave my apartment and stuff when I had been there for TWO MONTHS and had never seen him before, and after he saw my bf, I never saw him again. How did he know all this stuff about my every movement and I had never seen him before? Ugh creepy."

We have talked about it before and she wasn't looking for a relationship, which I was fine with. Feelings are coming back and I don't know what to do.",ineedathrowawaynowww,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qhcmr/me_24_m_have_had_a_huge_crush_on_a_very_good/,"I'm a final year student in a Finance course, which is where I met my friend (let's call her Sally) a couple years ago. We very quickly hit it off, and although I noticed she was very attractive and quite the type of girl that I am usually into, I also knew she had a boyfriend of 5-6 years, so I didn't think much of it and moved on with my life.

The next year was a gap year in my curriculum, she went to another country while I stayed in France doing internships, and although we still talked regularly, we kind of drifted a bit for a while.

Fastforward to the start of this term last September. We had started talking again in anticipation, even debating being roommates with a bunch of other friends, but it didn't pan out. We saw each other on the first day back, just the two of us for a couple hours before other people joined us.

From that point on, we saw each other a lot, sometimes in a group, sometimes a lot. We messaged each other constantly, talking about random stuff and whatnot. I don't know what changed during that time, but I started seeing her in an other light. I had heard she had broken up with her boyfriend during the gap year, so I tried to send signals and see if there could be something there. And it really felt like there was. Some of my friends even though we were secretly dating.

After a while I decided to go all in and ask her out. That's when things started to get confusing for me. She told me she did not want to date anyone right now, during the year we were apart she had a rough life crisis (wouldn't tell me the details) which was the reason she broke up with her previous boyfriend, because he could not handle the situation. She was now ""sort of dating"" a guy who had been there during that hard time, but they never saw each other or talked to each other, she told me he was ""a placeholder"" of sorts. She said she was sorry because she could see there was obviously something between us, but did not want to explore it.

It was hard to hear but there wasn't really anything I could do, so I respected her decision and situation and did not push on the subject. We went back to being friends quickly as I thought I could handle it. We kept talking and seeing each other a lot, in the same way as before really, little flirty at times and such.

Now it's been almost three months and I have gone back into full crush mode, and I don't know what to do. I am not expecting anything from her, I don't want to turn into a ""NiceGuy"" and behave like an ass.

It feels like we have reached the same point as before where it feels like there is something between us, but I don't know how to brush the subject. I told her I respected her wishes and I'm afraid talking about it would break that. But at the same time I don't think I can keep going as is, maybe I need to back away for a while.

Also in 5 months school will be out for good, people will go their separate ways, and I'm afraid if I back away now I will lose her for ever, both as a potential love interest and as a friend.

So basically I'm looking for opinions on what I should do, if anything.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: former crush has redeveloped with someone who told me three months ago she did not want to date anyone, I want to find out if the door is still closed as I don't think I can keep being just her friend right now, way too into her."

I am a 31YO from the Atlanta Metro area, and I just recently graduated with a my AS in Network &amp; Security Administration in December 2016. I'm currently enrolled in a BS program for the same degree and should be graduating in December 2017 with it. So now that I have a degree I am currently looking for a job in the IT.  I have very little professional experience with IT, but I have years and years of Home networking, PC Builds, and what was learned in school. I have not had an internship as I have a family and mortgage and need to pay bills, and cannot really work for free or take a giant pay cut in doing an internship. I have had a stable job for the last 15 years as a Firefighter/Paramedic, and gained numerous valuable skills throughout, and I tried to relay them into my resume to make the transition to IT.

I have already passed my 901 &amp; I am scheduled to take my 902 next week to give me A+. Once I get that done, I do plane on getting my Network+ Cert in the end of Feb or March. I do plan on taking my CCNA once, this semester gets done as I am finishing my last networking class.

Here is were it gets little disheartening for myself. I have applied to numerous jobs, and have only received 2 call backs and then nothing after that. I am applying to Dekstop Analyst, Tech Support, and anything that I seem to be a fit for with me AS. While these are not my first choice of jobs, as I would like to do something with Networking &amp; Securities I figured they would give me a decent point to start to off my career with and let me gain some experience.

So my questions would be: What jobs should I be looking for?  Are there some other tech job sites that I don't know about like DICE. What can I do to make myself seem more appealing to the IT field hiring managers? 

TLDR: Need some advice as to what entry level jobs I can apply for as a new grad, with minimal IT experience.  "

I'm likely going to be rejected from UWaterloo's CS co-op program. That leaves me with either CS at local university (ie: UOttawa) or math co-op at UWaterloo. The co-op would be at UWaterloo and would most likely be software-intensive (software dev, engineering, QA etc.) 

The co-op program at Waterloo is essentially world-renowned because of how it works and the jobs/interships that are available. 

My long term goal is to move to the United States (or stay in Canada at a big company). It boils down to this - would a BMath in, say, computational mathematics or combinatorics/optimization with 4-6 internships be better or just a CS degree? Can you work in software engineering and development with a BMath?

Also with a BMath, it would also be possible to work in other sectors such as finance/quantitative analysis. What do you think?"

During the Summer or at other times during the year we need to image an entire workstation lab of machines. I would love to move this ability from our interns and workstation technicians from PXE booting to me deploying a mandatory OSD Task Sequence and doing ZTIs. 

What appears to be happening though, is that any OSD Task Sequence that deployed to a machine before and succeeded will not rerun again.

I have created a Collection for reimaging that is set to ""As soon as possible"" deploy the OSD task sequence to all workstations in that collection. The Rerun Behavior is set to ""Always Rerun"". This does not appear to be working, the machines will image fine the first time but they will not rerun if they already imaged successfully sometime in the past. The Software Center on the workstation will say ""Installed"" and will never run.

Even if I create a new deployment and deploy the OSD Task Sequence to the lab's Device Collection itself it will not rerun if the machine has already been imaged sometime in the past.

Do any other school techs have a setup for how they do lab ZTI OSD for Summer or general refreshes?"

* **[Spectra S2 pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBKFFJM/)** – A friend who just weaned her second baby gave me her Avent pump, but it stopped working one month after the warranty expired. I picked the Spectra up when it was miraculously under $200 on Amazon, and I love it. It’s quiet, and I like the two modes (quick and gentle to get letdown going, slow and strong after letdown). It can be plugged in, but the battery lasts me all week, so I only have to plug it in on weekends. 
* **Avent-style [flanges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017CYL6YA/) and [comfort breast cushions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N4R4C46/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)** - I really like the Avent comfort cushions. I got them to sort of work with the Spectra flanges that came with my pump, but they’d pop out and get milk between the cushion and flange. I’m going to be doing this for a year, so I didn’t feel bad about trying out a couple different flanges and setups until I found one that feels good: no pinching, fits my nipples comfortably without getting any areola, makes me look like Xena.
* **4-ounce Avent bottles** – Same friend gave me a ton of bottles. 
* **Pump Bag** – The Spectra oddly doesn’t come with a bag, so I use the one from my friend’s old Avent pump.
* **[Lansinoh breastmilk storage bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006XISCNA/)** – I like these better than the Medela ones because they’re much easier to zip and they hold 6 as opposed to 5 ounces. The Medelas have holes at the top so you can hang them from the pump and pump directly into the bags, but the holes make it easy to spill when you pour milk into/out of them.
* **Sharpies** for labeling bags
* **Tide pen** for any spills/splashes on my clothes
* **[Nursing bra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNJ0CBO/)** – Underwire is not your friend while nursing. These are comfortable, fit great, and have removable lining. [These](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J27DGMU/) are my favorite for overnight.
* **[Hands-free pumping bra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00295MQLU/)** – Take some time to adjust the velcro on the back to the right size, and add the zipper panel in the middle if it helps the holes line up with your nips. I don’t use the straps, which makes it tricky to put on the right side up. I remember the Label is on the Left so I put it on the right way.
* **Nursing pads** – During the first 6 weeks I had oversupply, so I wore [Lansinoh stay dry pads]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TLU5JO/) during the day and [Lansinoh ultimate protection pads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0179BQBP0/) overnight. Now that my production has settled down a bit I wear [Dr. Brown’s pads]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00363M7GI/) during the day and the Lansinoh stay dries at night. The Dr. Brown’s don’t get much love on Amazon, but I prefer them to [Bamboobies]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboobies-Super-Washable-Nursing-Sample/dp/B01LXD0GFO/). You know that feeling when you rub velvet the wrong way? Imagine that on your nipples. No thanks, Bamboobies.
* **Nipple cream** – In my experience [lanolin]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNZQHJA/) is like duct tape: it’s great as lip balm or to moisturize cuticles, basically everything except its advertised purpose. I vastly prefer [Earth Mama Angel Baby Butter Natural Nipple Butter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YB62ES0/), also available at Target. Lanolin is like putting butter straight out of the fridge on your nipples; Earth Mama is like room-temperature butter. Much more gentle for your potentially sore nips.
* **Muslin receiving blanket** – Protects my clothes and desk from spills, helps clean up spills, and reminds me of the adorable little baby I’m doing all this for. (Did you just tear up reading that? You might be pregnant.)
* **Book** – I’m reading [Mists of Avalon](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402045.The_Mists_of_Avalon) on my Kindle. It’s the same book I read while nursing her on maternity leave, so I associate it with nursing. It works out really well as a nursing book because it’s long, it’s easy to drop off/pick up at any point, and there are lots of mentions of pregnancy/nursing/motherhood.
* **Mini Fridge** - You’ll probably find a ton of them on Craigslist. If you live in a college town, there will probably be even more available after the spring semester. I waited until after baby was born to get ours, so we bought one online that was shipped to our door to avoid the hour-long voyage to pick up a Craigslist fridge.
* **Gallon-size Ziploc bags** - For bringing bottle assemblies home. I was bringing in a bag each day, but now I keep a box at the office.




**My Pumping Process** 

*Don't be put off by the 20 steps. I'm being very thorough here.*


1. **Put up a sign** on my door that says “Pumping – Back at &lt;20 minutes from now&gt;” *It usually only takes 15 minutes, but this way I’m not rushed, and it’s better to under promise and over deliver*
2. **Refill my water bottle** if it’s low. *Previously I’d put up “Back in 5 minutes” while I got water and switch it to “Pumping” when I got back, but once there was someone waiting for me when I came back with water. It had been 3 hours and I really needed to pump.*
3. **Close and deadbolt the door** *IT intern started unlocking my door while I was pumping once despite the sign. Not cool, dude. Wait the two minutes, come back later, or at least knock.*
4. **Get out pump**
5. **Put together bottle assembly** if it’s the first pump of the day or pull it out of the mini fridge
6. **Put receiving blanket in lap**
7. **Pull down nursing bra flaps** and put on pumping bra over clothes
8. **Apply flanges to breasts**, secure with pumping bra flaps
9. **Start pumping** for a minute or two on the quick and gentle mode to get letdown. Lean my head back, feel my body relax, think about my daughter, and think about the sensation in the nipples to encourage letdown. *When I first started it helped to look at photos/videos of her, but now that I’m used to it and have a comfortable setup I generally get letdown more easily in a minute or so.*
10. **Switch to the slow and strong mode** after letdown
11. **Read while pumping** – I go for a few minutes after the milk stops flowing, which is usually about 10 minutes.
12. **Carefully remove flange**s, using receiving blanket to wipe up any milk on the cushions/flanges
13. **Take off pumping bra**, reclip nursing bra flaps (at home I’ll let my nips air dry but at work I pat them dry with the blanket), and apply nipple butter
14. **Move receiving blanket to desk** and put the bottles on the blanket-covered desk
15. **Remove cushions from flanges**, wipe them down with blanket, and put them in the holder on the back of the pump. *If you refrigerate the assembly between uses you don’t have to clean it each time. I keep the cushions at room temperature because brrrrr.*
16. **Pour milk from bottles into bag**, fold bag to squeeze out air, zip closed, and label with a Sharpie
17. **Disconnect bottle assembly from tubing** and put the assembly in the mini fridge with the bag of milk
18. **Check clothes for drips** (attack with receiving blande pend Tide pen), retie dress, rebutton blouse, etc.
19. **Put pump, pumping bra, blanket, Sharpie, etc. back in pumping bag** and stash in drawer
20. **Open door and remove sign**


**Notes**

* I waited until 4 weeks and started pumping with a manual pump. I used the one that the nurses gave me for free at the hospital, which has a two-handed piston assembly like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Medela-Lactina-Cylinder-Assembly-8007190/dp/B003F0UH0A/) rather than the [standard](https://www.amazon.com/Medela-Harmony-Manual-Breast-Pump/dp/B0006HBS1M) carpal tunnel-inducing style. It worked well--got letdown going, pumped enough ounces--but it took both hands and you can only do one boob at a time. If you're going to be pumping on the regular, get yourself an electric pump. 
* I managed to bank 100 ounces of breast milk by pumping once a day most days from weeks 4 to 13. Most work days I pump 10 to 14 ounces over 3 sessions and baby drinks anywhere from 5 to 20 ounces (averaging about 12) while she’s at her grandparents’.
* I pump around 8:30, 11:00, and 2:00 each day. Here's a post with my full [post-baby workday schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/5qiuue/our_weekday_schedule_with_baby_working_fulltime/).
* US moms: If your plan is grandfathered like mine and doesn't pay for a breast pump, you can sign up for a flex spending account and use pre-tax dollars. Breast pumps and parts are FSA eligible.
* I bring my electric pump into work on Monday, leave it there for the week, and take it home on Friday. There’s not a lot of time in the mornings and evenings to pump, and it’s one less thing to carry back and forth each day. I pump once a day on the weekends.
* I have a manual pump in my car and an extra electric assembly (all the plastic bits and tubing) at the office just in case.
* I pump in my office. It has a lock and a deadbolt on the door. US moms: your employer is [legally required](http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/workplace-law) to provide a “reasonable” amount of time to pump and a private space that is not a bathroom.
* My pump-friendly work wardrobe mostly comprises wrap dresses, button-up blouses over stretchy camis, scoop-neck tops with cardigans, skirts, and pants. I scouted out local consignment shops for breastfeeding- and pumping-friendly dresses. I determined my size in Ann Taylor and Banana Republic wrap dresses, then bought several on Ebay.

I recently graduated with a B.S. in Comp Sci and although I'm very good a programming, I've realized through my 4 internships that I don't love doing it 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. 

I put my resume online and I received a job description that was ""software engineer/tech support"", which was first installing software for clients and then teaching them how to use it and receiving support calls, ect. Then it said later I would be doing some development.

This works really well for me because I'm definitely a people person and I'm also really really good at teaching software / having patience. However I also do enjoy programming and improving the product.

My question is, how would I look for more jobs like the one I received? Surely companies must have developers who go onsite to teach, receive feedback, and generally take care of customers. Is there a job title for this position? I'd really be interested in a job like this (especially if I could program as well) but I don't know where to start looking or how to represent that this is what I'm looking for. 

Currently online I just have my desired title as ""software developer"". Pretty generic.

Thanks guys, I really appreciate any suggestions you might have!"

5qjq6f,2,2017-01-27,Help me /r/apple! You're my only hope! - Need to recover pictures from special un-syncable section of iPhone,TheAnusOfSauron,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5qjq6f/help_me_rapple_youre_my_only_hope_need_to_recover/,"So I have a customer with an iPhone 6s. It is running iOS 10. At some point a computer with about 8,000 pictures was syncronized with this phone; then that computer died. So the only place these 8,000 photos exists, is on my customer's iPhone.

Since they were put on the phone from a computer that has died, I cannot get the pictures onto another computer. iTunes sync simply ignores the pictures. Windows photo Importer and iPhoto similarly cannot access the pictures in order to download them. When I browse the phone directly, using a USB cable plugged into a Windows machine, the pictures are nowhere to be found. I can only see pictures that were taken by that iPhone, or downloaded via other means.

All of the pictures can be opened and appear to be otherwise healthy on the iPhone.

I've opened a ticket with Apple support, and they tell me there is no way to get them off the iPhone, other than emailing/texting every single one (vomit).

I have considered Jailbreaking the phone, so I can access the filesystem directly and simply drag the picture files off the phone; but I don't think this version of iOS can be jailbroken, and if it could, i'd be afraid it would wipe the photos.

So, does ANYBODY have any ideas on how to get these pictures off the phone, onto a computer... short of hiring an intern and having him email every single one?!

Edit:

I ended up figuring it out. Nobody's suggestions helped, unfortunately. What finally did it was AirDrop. I had to borrow a MacBook pro and get everything happy. It took a few hours but I finally got them over. Now they are backed up to a USB drive and another PC.

Thank you everyone for you suggestions!"

5qk2y8,1,2017-01-27,"Went to college 3 years ago after dropping out of high school, failed 3 god damn semesters, 0.0 GPA. Back in College, took two classes last fall which I aced both, need advice",commcollegefailure,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5qk2y8/went_to_college_3_years_ago_after_dropping_out_of/,"Please do not ridicule me.  I know I'm a fuck up.  3 god damn chances and I let my past self take matters into his own hands and abuse alcohol and be a piece of shit stoner, which motivated me to stop going to classes all three semesters.   I stopped enrolling and took a a couple of years off to find myself and enter the work force.  Completely sober now, but my past is still weighing a burden on me.

So yeah, I scheduled a meeting with an advisor in a couple weeks to discuss my options, but my anxiety is making me want at least some answers right now.

So basically I was a computer science major for those first three horrible semesters, but now at this new community college I'm at, I'm doing a 2 year Computer Information Technology: Computer Programming degree.  I really enjoy it, I took intro to Java and history of computers last semester and aced it, and now I'm in English Comp, Intro to statistics, and Intro to networking, and I'm really starting to enjoy myself and feel better about myself.  

Now my issue lies with this. In order to complete this two year degree I have to have an internship, to have an internship I have to have a 2.5GPA at least.  Once I have the GPA I should have no issues as this school has a really high statistic of getting students internships, including some internships at national labs, and other very cool places.  

One thing I noticed when looking at my transcript is all of my grades are ""TF"" or ""TW"" which I think means temporary, but the classes that I dropped out of I retook, and dropped out again, and because these were at a different community college, some of the classes offered at my current college are different.

Do you all have any advice?"

The worst part for me is how painfully aware of the situation I am and how that knowledge in turn creates a vicious cycle for it to only repeat itself.  At the end of the day, I feel like a few mistakes I made out of naivety has sent me down a rabbit hole that I cannot climb out of.  I will try to tell my story and hopefully someone who understands can reach out a helping hand to pull me out, I mean, what is there to lose?

I graduated from high school at the top of my class and attended one of the most prestigious universities we have in the country.  I didn’t fully understand the point of college at the time, I just thought it was something you did to get a job.  So I took a challenging major that was “in demand” and was somewhat related to things I liked.  I got through just fine, but I spent most of college enjoying the social aspects rather than focusing on school.  I didn’t take an internship and never made a resume while in school.  So when I got out it was rather difficult to find a job.  I was in over my head.  It took over a year but I found one, a good one.

 I was part of a development program and rotated through various engineering roles.  When it came time to come off and become part of the team, my manager showed me an offer of 80,000 but wasn’t allowed to actually print it out and hand it to me.  Other managers also tried to recruit me, but I wanted to part of the engineering team so I waited.  Fast forward 3 months later after sitting in limbo…and I was laid off.  I found out in the email, they had forgotten to tell me.  Obviously that is depressing, but hey I wasn’t fired and got a severance + unemployment.   

I felt like I was going to be at that company for a long time, so I didnt have a linkedIn, an updated resume, or any industry certifications because I expected to work my way up from within based on merit.  It took a while to get that sorted and afterwards I tried to find similar jobs.  Issues were abound as I had not actually held the title I was supposed to, nor did I feel that I had the necessary experience most employers were actually looking for.  Not to mention, it was a rather niche market so there were few if any “exact matches.”  I interview and tried quite hard for a year and got in the final 2-3 candidates for about 7 positions but was not selected.  Admittedly, I don’t really have a “network” to tap which is what everyone suggests doing.  I don’t use social media and it seems ridiculous to me to call up people out of the blue that I haven’t spoken with in a long while to ask for help.  So I did not have the “inside track” for any of those positions.  

Out of desperation I took a bad job installing cable and it was a total disaster.  I worked there for about 3 months and am pretty sure at the end of the day I may have lost money.  It was ridiculous.  That just set me further behind and exacerbated the oncoming depression.  

At this point, I had to move home with my parents.  Very depressing.  But I still tried to find jobs but I wasn’t getting responses anymore.  My job gap had become too long and I was no longer in the actual place that I was applying to jobs for, not to mention there aren’t really any “exact matches” to my previous experience.  Every time I think about the situation I get depressed to the point of paralysis. 

The worst part is, the whole situation has completely drained me of any self-confidence and my self-image is rather poor.  Which makes it hard to “sell myself” to an employer.  Moreover, I am so embarrassed that I have fallen from grace so dramatically that it has created social anxiety.  I am afraid to speak to people I know for fear of them asking “what are you up to now?”  As a result,  I have become a total recluse and have not spoken to hardly anyone in over a year.  

Basically, now, I have no friends because I just stopped talking to them.  Not only do I have social anxiety stemming from shame of disgrace, I also have it from shame of falling out of contact with my friends.  I don’t talk to them because I haven’t talked to them in so long I feel that it will be weird.  So more time passes and makes it even weirder causing the anxiety to grow.

At this point, it really feels hopeless.   Both sides of the issue feed into each other resulting in a supernova of depression.  I’m depressed that I don’t have a job.  I feel that I can’t get a job because I don’t have a job (and haven’t had one for a while now, the old job gap issue).  I’m depressed I don’t socialize.  I don’t socialize because I’m depressed about not having a job.  I don’t have the self-confidence any more to strike out and start anew.  The clock is ticking now on when I will have to pay off the interest free credit cards I took out, putting a sense of urgency and impending doom into everything I do.  

Then I go to start working on ways to get a job but again, as I start, I just see all the reasons no one will hire me and it feels like a completely lost cause, so I get depressed and paralyzed.  The end result of which, is that, I accomplish nothing and just keep doing the same things that fail.  

At this point when I do self-inventory, I am literally 4-5 years behind where I should be at this point because of a long job gap after college and the one I am currently experiencing.  The worst part is, it was always my overarching self confidence in myself and my skills that pushed me through.  But now, I have none and in fact, it feels as though I have the exact opposite.  Instead of there being a voice in my head that says “you got this” there is a voice that says “you can’t do that, you aren’t good enough, they don’t want you.”  

Its gotten really bad I would say in the last 3-4 months.  I have never felt so hopeless, but that’s not why its so bad.  As I said in the beginning, I am quite aware of what is going on…just powerless to make it cease it would seem.  Over the last few months I have completely stopped taking care of myself.  To be quite honest, I can probably count on one hand the number of times I’ve even showered during that period.  

My hope is by putting this out into the ether, someone will have pity on me and help me out.  I don’t have my own “network” to tap into but maybe, just maybe, I can tap into the network of fellow humans suffering from depression.  

If nothing else, writing this has been cathartic.  In fact, it has brought me to tears and I cannot remember the last time I actually cried.  My general strategy is keep everything down and lock the inner door to my soul to prevent from getting hurt.  So at least I have somewhat shared my feelings anonymously and it feels good but still doesn't exactly move me forward.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Any advice or help is greatly appreciated and is of course the reason I took the time to do this in the first place.

They have asked me to complete a small digital marketing plan before they interview me here. This is what they said

""By January 30, Develop a digital marketing plan to generate paid admissions for a movie of YOUR CHOICE which is now showing or coming soon to [CINEMA] (Please visit our website to select your preferred film) using ALL of the available digital channels; Website, Email Marketing, Paid Search, SEO, Social Media and others.

As part of your plan, we would like to see a projected timeline and your proposed use of a $1,000 budget. You will be expected to describe how you would plan to measure and report on the performance of the campaign, including the measurement tools you would use and an estimate of the expected performance each channel will generate (e.g reach, reactions, likes, opens and click-thrus). Please be prepared to discuss your plan in the event you are selected for an interview.”""

Could someone help me in regards to this bit? I am a graduate with internship experience though i have never created a digital marketing plan myself before so it is a little daunting and i thought i would see if any of you guys could aid me through this process.

They would just require a basic plan, so making some timelines in terms of the budget and how i would go about it. If i can get some advice on what channels, how to go about it and the budget used i could use all that information and put it together for my plan, but at the moment i am a bit stumped because i haven't done this before all on my own.

Thank you heaps in advance, i really appreciate it

They're paying about 40k a year and I'm currently in my second year...with about 3(?) more years to go.

I'm studying engineering at a school that's number 1 for my major.

I was supposed to be at an internship this semester but after a difficult fall semester, I've been struggling with self doubt and A LOT of anxiety so my parents have put me on medical leave.

I have an above 3.0 GPA and I came in with a bunch of credits. Despite all this and in a way because of this (haven't touched physics and/or calculus since senior year of high school) I feel incredibly unprepared and don't believe I can continue in my specific major or engineering for that matter.

I'm scrambling for outs even so far as thinking about dropping out. The thing is, I don't have an alternative plan, yet going back to school is scaring the hell out of me--I'm convinced I'll fail/not do well. 

I'm thinking about switching majors since that seems like a whole lot better plan that dropping out but I don't know to what... 

Comments, thoughts, suggestions?

I have advanced to the next level of the application process, so now I'm starting to think about what that might mean. They don't go into detail about what the drug test is, and after some research I found out that some places test your hair apparently? 

Forgive me for sounding naive, but are they going to cut off a chunk of my hair?! 

I've never used drugs besides alcohol on rare occasions, but unfortunately over Christmas I contracted acanthamoeba keratitis. If you don't want to look it up or watch its episode on Monsters Inside Me, it's a rare eye infection caused by a single celled parasite that eats the cornea tissue. It takes months and months to treat and has left me blind in one eye (hopefully temporarily). One of the symptoms, however, is extreme pain for extended periods of time, so I've been prescribed hydrocodone. Is this going to prevent me from getting the job even if it's a prescription? I'm afraid to ask because that will reveal that I'm taking it. Do I just need to make it on ibuprofen? 

The summer is a few months away, but do I need to avoid parties for fear of accidentally ingesting something? All of the positions are many states away so I don't imagine there would be testing well before the internship started. Maybe I could be weaned off by then?

I am now trying to work on eating more vegetables and don't really know where to start. 

Right now this is what I am trying to do. Any type of advice on what to to will be helpful. 

breakfast: cereal/oatmeal + banana + rice cake with peanut butter 

Lunch: I want to try and do brown rice with vegetables and chicken and maybe eggs (essentially friend rice with chicken i guess) and just make this in bulk to for lunch every day of the week. maybe add in a bag of pretzels and some granola bars cause I don't see myself being able to give all that up immediately. I am just worried about making it taste not bland and I have no clue what vegetables to get for this. 

Dinner: No clue but I want to try and do the same thing with lunch and make in bulk and then dish it out every night so I have more free time in the evening. I like fish a lot and I knwo it is pretty healthy so maybe something with that? 

i saw a burrito recipe here for massive burritos that were healthy and I will look into those as a lunch time option.

main thing I am looking for is what vegetables are cheap/healthy and whats your recommendation on how to prepare them to get the most out of them. Also looking for food that can last awhile if possible.

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

────────

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well!
I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon!

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid.  This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."

Recently, I presented a paper at an International Conference on **'The Role of Analytics in Smart Cities'**. I want to pursue my career in the Smart City domain.

Some more info. I was a nursing major, then worked as a CNA. Fuck that. Then switched to Computer Networking and interned with this certain company for 2 Summers. The first Summer I had no idea what was going on (might as well have been a real life potato everyday I came in). After the next year of school I went back for another internship and got A TON of hands on experience. They sent me out to represent the company to a client and pretty much handle a sizable project on my own. Also, I achieved several decent beginning certs with Palo Alto, Brocade, Citrix, and Nutanix (I was a busy bee that Summer).

Now I'm finishing up my last semester and getting ready to graduate with my bachelors. Upon thinking about applying to the company (in which they show great interest in me) I struggle with the possibility of if they low-ball my salary, what will I do? I love the work environment, my boss, and other employees -- but money is definitely a motivation of mine. 

What would you do in my situation if they end up low-balling me?"

So I am in a situation where I would like to intern however I only have 6 months of study under my belt from a CS degree here in Australia.

I would like to start interning however I feel that I may be viewed as too green?  I am doing a bachelor in computer science but due to having a degree before I only have core content to complete meaning I only need study 2 years full time.

Beyond studying I have little to no programming experience mostly due to not being sure what to do a personal project in.  This is again due to unsure how to approach the issue since I have only studied for 6 months.

Any advice on how you guys approached internships would be greatly appreciated."

Allgemeingültige Antwort: *Sollte man aber nicht machen müssen.*

#**""Sich in Linux einzugewöhnen dauert länger, als Windows nach der Installation zu ent-scheißen!""** ~ein Pleb, der Logik nicht nutzen wollte
[False equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) - der richtige Vergleich wäre Eingewöhnungszeit von Linux vs. Eingewöhnungszeit von Windows von Punkt 0 an, wer mit Linux statt Windows aufwächst, wird das genaue Gegenteil behaupten. Der andere richtige Vergleich wäre Entkrüppelungsdauer von Linux vs. Windows, diese ist bei Linux eindeutig geringer, wenn nicht sogar 0 (abhängig davon, welche Distribution man wählt).

#**""Kein Mensch wird Linux nutzen, es kommt nichtmal vorinstalliert!""** ~ein Pleb, der Google nicht nutzen wollte

Manchmal ist das korrekt, wobei mittlerweile [Steam viele Spiele mit nativem Linux-Support anbietet](http://store.steampowered.com/linux), linuxkompatible Open-Source-Alternativen zu Software das Original mittlerweile manchmal schon übertreffen (vergleiche Kdenlive mit Windows Movie Maker oder Git mit jedem VCS zuvor oder viele Linux DE's mit dem Windows 10 Desktop) und das [Wine Projekt](https://www.winehq.org/) es ermöglicht sogar nicht-native Spiele wie [Skyrim mit Mods mit fast-nativer Performance zum Laufen zu bringen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqUoR3PvRE). Aber es gibt durchaus Software, die einfach nicht unter Linux laufen will - aber Hand auf's Herz - kein Entwickler wird Linuxsupport in seiner Software als wichtigen Punkt ansehen, wenn keiner Linux nutzt, deshalb müssen zuerst die User Linux annehmen, dann ziehen die Devs hinterher. Und auch so, ist das kein direkter Widerspruch - ein Dualboot-Setup mit einer minimalen Windowspartition für FL Studio, Adobe Premiere usw. und dem Rest unter Linux, ist absolut in Ordnung für den Übergang. Wer aber Linux nicht nutzt, weil es keine Software gibt, weil es keiner nutzt, der verfehlt den Punkt. Wenn man einsehen kann, dass Linux vieles besser macht, dann sollte man es nutzen, auch wenn nicht alle Software direkt verfügbar ist - die Softwareverfügbarkeit kommt mit ausreichender Nachfrage.

#**""Die Linuxcommunity ist feindselig gegenüber neuen Usern, eingebildet und generell unsympathisch.""** ~ein voreingenommener Pleb, der keine normale Konversation mit validen Argumenten führen wollte
Falsch, wer an Linux nicht feindselig als Windows-Masterrace-Fag herangeht, wird in einem der tausend [Foren, IRCs, Subreddits und sonstigem herzlich begrüßt und geleitet](http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Help-With-Linux) - ansonsten erntet man, was was man sät.

##**Wer jetzt bereit ist, es zumindest mal zu probieren: Hier, wie du auf die dunkle Seite kommst**
#**Eine Distribution wählen**
Linux ist kein Betriebssystem. Linux ist ein [Kernel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013937/what-is-an-os-kernel-how-does-it-differ-from-an-operating-system). Das bedeutet, für ein komplettes Betriebssystem braucht es eine Hülle mit allerhand Software um den Kernel herum - das Gesamtprodukt ist eine Distribution von Linux. Bekannte Distributionen sind u.A. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, openSUSE und Fedora. Von diesen Distributionen gibt es wiederum Abkömmlinge, das ist eine Konsequenz der Freiheit von Linux. Jeder kann eine Distribution bauen, das erklärt, warum [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity) so unmenschlich viele Distributionen listet, die größtenteils irrelevant sind - aber es ist gut, dass es diese Vielfalt geben **kann**. Selbst Ubuntu ist an sich nur ein Abkömmling von Debian, der versucht, benutzerfreundlicher zu sein. Distributionen unterscheiden sich in der Software, die sie von Haus aus mitbringen, dem [Desktop Environment](https://www.linux.com/news/best-linux-desktop-environments-2016), d.h dem kompletten UI mit dem der User interagiert (wie z.B Windows' Aero Desktop), dem [Window Manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager) etc. - das einzig wichtige für den Anfang wird aber das Desktop Environment sein und die Distribution darunter.

#**Wer als Anfänger eine Distribution heraussuchen will, kann sich hieran orientieren**

Zuerst: Man wähle einen Desktop aus. Die relevantesten sind folgende:

* [Unity](https://unity.ubuntu.com/) - der Standarddesktop von Ubuntu, selten unter anderen Distributionen zu finden. Eigen, aber gefällt manchen Usern. Ja, die Leiste kann man auch [nach unten schieben](http://www.howtogeek.com/251616/how-to-move-the-unity-desktops-launcher-to-the-bottom-of-your-screen-on-ubuntu-16.04/).
* [Gnome Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhY7rpWXm1Y) - einer der beliebtesten Desktops, sehr eigen, aber auch recht benutzerfreundlich und weit verbreitet
* [KDE Plasma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgH1Clgr-uE) - ebenfalls ein sehr beliebter Desktop, wahrscheinlich ein guter Einstieg für Leute, die sich nicht von Windows umgewöhnen wollen und Eyecandy möchten (hat auch ein sehr gutes Dark Theme by default dabei)
* [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/), ein Desktop der von Haus aus weniger auf Eye-Candy setzt, jedoch extrem ressourcensparend ist, vor allem beliebt bei Leuten mit mehr Erfahrung bzgl. Theming, die holen aus XFCE [ziemlich viel heraus](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5qm6ev/xfce_trying_a_minimal_life_with_linux_mint/)
* Weitere Desktops, die interessant sein könnten: [MATE](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YHQd5pHyxts/VtIJeABXUHI/AAAAAAAAHMU/1oSQjjDwwhE/s1920/mate-desktop-3.png), [Budgie](http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/solus-budgie-desktop-turns-2-years-old-version-10-is-full-of-goodies-498176-2.jpg), [Cinnamon](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/uploads/themes/V76O-01DZ-DOAP.png)
* Anhand des Desktops lässt sich die Entscheidung für eine Distribution meistens eingrenzen, auch wenn prinzipiell alles unter allem installiert werden kann - meistens ist es jedoch einfacher, direkt eine passende Distribution zu wählen.

Danach: Man wähle eine Distribution, am besten die, die den Desktop direkt mitliefert. Anfängerdistros die sich eignen:

* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) oder ein Ubuntu-Derivat; wer z.B den XFCE Desktop mit Ubuntu will, sucht nach ""Ubuntu XFCE"" bei Google und findet [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/). Die zu empfehlende Version ist entweder die letzte LTS (Long Term Support) Version, wer die Installation lange behalten will, oder die neuste Version, aktuell 16.10 (Ubuntu-Releases erscheinen immer im 4. und 10. Monat des Jahres - 16.10 erschien somit im Oktober 2016 etc.)
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/de/) ist nicht nur ein autistischer Hut, sondern auch ein Betriebssystem von Red Hat, einer der größten Linuxfirmen weltweit. Meistens kommt Fedora mit dem Gnome Desktop. Wird auch an den Computern des KIT genutzt.
* [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/de/) ist eine auf Ubuntu basierende Distribution mit sehr sehr sehr sehr viel Detail im visual polish - wenn dein Linux direkt schön aussehen soll, installiere elementaryOS. Der Desktop ist an Gnome angelehnt, ansonsten hat man prinzipiell die komplette Funktionalität von Ubuntu 16.04.
* [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) ist der Klassiker unter den Einsteiger-Distros. Angeboten wird sowohl eine Edition mit dem MATE Desktop als auch eine mit dem Cinnamon Desktop. Weit verbreitet unter Anfängern, sehr beliebt, wird jedoch wegen diverser interner Entscheidungen oft kritisiert. Dennoch zu empfehlen.
* [Solus](https://solus-project.com/) ist eine Distribution, die auf keiner anderen Distribution basiert - es wurde von Grund auf renoviert. Nutzt den Budgie Desktop. Sehr benutzerfreundlich und lightweight, jedoch noch relativ jung und neu, mit Vorsicht zu genießen.
* Auch möglich, aber nicht direkt für Anfänger: [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.de/), eine Distribution für Fortgeschrittene. Vorteile sind die große Menge an Software, die auch noch immer auf dem neusten Stand ist, sowie die Entscheidungsvielfalt. Aus Arch kann man alles machen, jeden Desktop mühelos installieren, etc. etc. - aber auf Kosten der Benutzerfreundlichkeit bei der Installation. Wer ein halbes Jahr aufwärts mit Ubuntu o.ä gearbeitet hat, kann den Schritt wagen, für Anfänger aber nicht zu empfehlen. Wer aber unbedingt die Arch-Vorteile genießen will, kann sich [Antergos](https://antergos.com/) ansehen - dies vereinfacht zumindest die Installation sehr. Von [Manjaro](https://de.manjaro.org/) wird aufgrund vergangener Debakel bzgl. SSL-Zertifikaten abgeraten.
* Wer die Zeit und Möglichkeit hat, soll sich von mehreren Linuxnutzern direkt beraten lassen. Meistens ist eine der oben genannten Distros ein guter Start, oder man testet einfach alles durch. **Bei Linux gilt immer: Ausprobieren. Und sei es nur in einer VirtualBox bzw. KVM.**

#**Wie funktioniert Linux? - Installation**
Eventuell willst du vor der eigentlichen Installation noch weiterlesen, vor allem die Partitionierung wird in den Linux Basics unten kurz aufgegriffen, falls du deine Distribution nicht automatisch partitionieren lassen willst (möglicherweise empfehlenswert bei SSD-HDD-Kombinationen). Das Thema ist an sich viel zu weitläufig, aber für Anfänger ist das Prozedere meistens dieses:

**Entferne vor der Installation alle Wechselmedien von deinem PC, außer das eigentliche Installationsmedium, du überschreibst sonst ausversehen evtl. deine USB-Sticks, externen Festplatten etc.**

* Du suchst dir eine Distribution aus, siehe dazu den Leitfaden oben
* Du brennst die Distribution auf eine CD/DVD oder erstellst einen USB Stick (unter Windows z.B mit [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/?locale=de_DE)) - USB Stick ist allgemein besser, der lässt sich im Nachhinein wieder formatieren und hat meistens mehr als ausreichende Speicherkapazitäten
* Falls du Dual-Booten (zwei Systeme nebeneinander nutzen und beim Boot zwischen ihnen auswählen) willst, solltest du im Vorfeld Platz für deine Linux-Partitionen machen - Partitionsmanagementtools sollten bei Windows und MacOSX vorinstalliert sein, 50GB aufwärts dürften sicher reichen
* Du führst den USB Stick sanft in deinen Computer ein, nachdem du ihn zwei mal wenden musstest, um die richtige Seite zu finden und fährst deinen PC hoch
* Du hämmerst auf deiner hoffentlich mechanischen Tastatur rum, bis du ins BIOS kommst und veränderst die Boot-Reihenfolge so, dass vom USB Stick gebootet wird (hier [ein Guide](https://lifehacker.com/5774997/getting-started-with-linux-how-to-install-linux-on-your-computer) für die Unerfahrenen)
* Es bootet die Distribution deiner Wahl. Von hier an ist der Installprocess abhängig von der Distribution, bei den Anfängerdistros ist es meistens so simpel, dass du hier kaum mehr Hilfe brauchst
* Zu empfehlen: Festplattenverschlüsselung oder zumindest die Verschlüsselung deiner /home-Partition (vergleichbar mit dem Ordner bei Windows, der deinen Namen trägt) - aus Sicherheitsgründen, falls mal dein PC verloren geht oder die Kripo nach CP suchen will. [Passiert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgQ0W7Nq5A).
* Falls Dualboot erwünscht ist, haben die meisten Installer hierzu eine Option, z.B ""Ubuntu neben X installieren"" wähle dies an, der Rest ist selbsterklärend
* Username etc. wählen, installieren lassen, fertig - du hast ein Linux. Im Falle eines Dualbootes kannst du von nun an beim Boot dein OS auswählen. Meistens installiert sich GRUB. Falls dir GRUB zu hässlich ist - unter Linux lässt sich [alles tweaken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijPb8f7oVXU).

#**Linux Basics I.: Das Terminal**
Ja, dieser Abschnitt muss sein. Selbst wenn Linux jemals so weit ist, dass kaum einer das Terminal mehr ansehen muss, ist es trotzdem sinnvoll, es zu lernen - alles was man sieht und was man nicht sieht, baut auf dem Terminal auf; Dinge können deutlich schneller über das Terminal erledigt werden etc. Deshalb hier die Basics:

* Jede Distribution kommt mit einem Terminal-Emulator, z.B dem Gnome-Terminal, urxvt, Terminator etc. - das sind **alles** gute Terminals, aber jedes mit eigenen Feinheiten. Wenn man ausreichend fortgeschritten ist, wird einen die Wahl des Terminals evtl. interessieren, für Anfänger tut es eigentlich jedes Terminal
* Wer das Terminal nicht in einem einzelnen Fenster haben will, sondern maximalen H4xx0r-Modus erfahren möchte, der drückt die Tastenkombination STRG-Alt-F3, F4, F5, ... etc. - über die Funktionstasten sind ab F3 aufwärts eigene Terminals verfügbar. Damit verschwindet alles, außer ein Terminal im Fullscreen. Wer zurück zu seinem ursprünglichen Desktop will, drückt STRG-Alt-F2. Auf STRG-Alt-F1 läuft für gewöhnlich der Display-/Login-Manager (darüber loggt man sich ein). Über diese Funktionen kann man bspw. 3 User gleichzeitig einloggen und diese können unabhängig voneinander agieren.
* **Verzeichnisse wechseln**: Normalerweise befindet man sich bei jedem Launch eines neuen Terminals im Home-Verzeichnis ~, hier landen alle persönlichen Dateien, vergleichbar mit dem Windows-Ordner der den Benutzernamen trägt. Um das Verzeichnis zu wechseln benutzt man ""change directory"", kurz ""cd"" - z.B ""cd Bilder/"" bringt einen in das Bilderverzeichnis. ""cd ~"" bringt einen immer in das eigene Homeverzeichnis zurück. Wer ein Verzeichnis nach oben wechseln will, benutzt ""cd .."".
* **Verzeichnisinhalt ausgeben**: Da man nicht zwingend den kompletten Content des aktuellen Verzeichnisses auswendig kennt, schafft ""ls"" Abhilfe. Wer noch genaueren Output braucht, benutzt ""ls -lA"". Meistens ist dieser Output farbkodiert, z.B blau für Verzeichnisse, grün für executables etc.
* **Kopieren**: Für das Kopieren einer Datei nutzt man ""cp"", bspw. ""cp porn.mov ~/Videos/"" kopiert das gute Heimvideo in den Videoordner. Wenn man kein genaues Verzeichnis angibt, sucht cp immer im aktuellen Verzeichnis.
* **Verschieben/Umbenennen**: Um eine Datei zu verschieben nutzt man ""mv"" analog zu ""cp"". Will man eine Datei umbenennen, reicht es, sie im selben Verzeichnis zu bewegen, aber den Namen zu ändern, z.B ""mv porn.mov keinporn.mov"".
* **Adminrechte vergeben**: Beim Ausführen von Befehlen/Programmen ist es manchmal notwendig, Adminrechte zu vergeben, z.B weil ein Programm auf geschützte Ordner zugreifen will. Hierzu benutzt man ""superuser do"", kurz ""sudo"" am Anfang des Commands. ""sudo cp porn.mov /"" kopiert somit porn.mov in das ""/""-Directory, was normalerweise geschützt ist. Meistens hat man ohne Adminrechte keinen Zugriff, Ausnahmen sind z.B das eigene Homeverzeichnis.
* **Text im Terminal ausgeben**: Bei kurzen Textdateien ist es manchmal sinnvoll, den Text einfach im Terminal ausgeben zu lassen, statt ihn extra in einem Editor zu öffnen. Dazu benutzt man ""concatenate"", kurz ""cat"". Bspw. ""cat textdatei.txt"" gibt den Inhalt von textdatei.txt aus.
* **Text im Terminal editieren**: Für kleinere Edits im Terminal, z.B einer Config-Datei, ist es meist langsamer, einen richtigen Editor wie Sublime Text zu öffnen, deswegen empfiehlt sich ""nano"" für Anfänger (später kann man dann immer noch ""vim"" oder ""emacs"" lernen) für schnelle Edits. Einfach ""nano textdatei.txt"" ausführen, dann öffnet sich innerhalb des Terminals ein Editor. STRG-O speichert die Datei, STRG-X schließt den Editor, sobald man fertig ist.
* **Programme ausführen**: Jede Software, die unter Linux installiert wird, ist über das Terminal ausführbar, auch wenn sie sich letzten Endes in einem eigenen GUI abspielt. Bspw. Firefox lässt sich mit ""firefox"" einfach vom Terminal heraus starten. Warum das nützlich ist? Firefox gibt im Falle eines Absturzes z.B Debug-Output aus - wird es im Terminal ausgeführt, kann man diesen direkt dort mitlesen und muss nach einem Crash keine Logdateien suchen. Generell ist dieses Vorgehen sehr nützlich für Debugging.
* **Autovervollständigung**: Wer während dem Tippen im Terminal die TAB-Taste antippt, erhält die Autovervollständigung von Befehlen. Das ist einerseits schneller, andererseits weist es einen frühzeitig darauf hin, dass man sich vertippt hat, wenn das Programm nicht gefunden wird. Ein doppeltes Antippen zeigt weiterhin alle möglichen Treffer an.
* **Befehle genauer betrachten**: Befehle sind meistens über Parameter veränderbar, z.B beim Kopieren vor Verzeichnissen per ""cp"" ist es nötig, ""-r"" als Parameter anzugeben, damit rekursiv in alle Unterverzeichnisse geschaut wird. Woher man das weiß? Erfahrung, oder von den Manual-Pages. Diese findet man für jedes Command per ""man &lt;command&gt;"", z.B ""man cp"". Oder man googelt. Euch überlassen.
* **Befehle wiederfinden**: Wer sich grob an die Funktion eines Commands erinnern kann, aber nicht mehr weiß, wie es genau hieß, dem hilft ""apropos"". Angenommen ich will etwas kopieren, erinnere mich aber nicht an ""cp"" - ""apropos copy"" liefert mir eine Liste aller Copy-Tools die installiert sind, inklusive Kurzbeschreibung, darunter auch ""cp"".
* Für weitere Terminal Tipps&amp;Tricks siehe [hier](http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/linux/common-linux-commands/)

#**Linux Basics II.: Software installieren**
Ein großes Argument für Linux ist Paketmanagement. Die grundlegende Idee ist es, eine zentrale Software zu haben, die über Paketquellen (""Repositories"", ""repos"") Programme installieren kann. Es ist eine Art App-Store, nur schon viel länger existent und wer dieses Wort dafür benutzt kriegt normalerweise faules Obst an den Kopf geworfen. Im Falle von Debian/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-basierenden Systemen (elementaryOS, Kubuntu. Xubuntu etc.) ist dieser Paketmanager ""apt"", in älteren Releases (vor 16.04) meist ""apt-get"" genannt. Anhand dieses Paketmanagers wird nun allgemein Paketmanagement erklärt, wer Fedora nutzt findet analoge Commands für ""dnf"", Arch und Gentoo User wissen sowieso was sie tun. Im folgenden sei angemerkt, dass sich in allen aktuellen Distributionen die apt nutzen, ""apt-get"" einfach durch ""apt"" ersetzen lässt. ""apt-get"" funktioniert aber auch weiterhin.

Die Vorteile eines Paketmanagers sind u.a. folgende:

* Zentrale Verwaltung aller Software ermöglicht es, alle Pakete z.B über ein einziges Command zu updaten, da der Paketmanager weiß wo alles herkommt und prüfen kann, ob man auf dem neusten Stand ist
* Da alle dieselben Softwarequellen nutzen und Paketmanagement generell kryptographisch gesichert ist, erhält man eigentlich immer was man angefragt hat
* Keine Bloatware, Toolbars, tanzende Affen, Viagrawerbung etc. - man muss diese Dinge nichteinmal abwählen
* Schnelles und einfaches Finden von Software, oft kein Googeln nötig
* Dependencies von Programmen, z.B Bibliotheken, werden falls nötig automatisch mitinstalliert

Anhand von apt gibt es 4 grundlegende, wichtige Befehle:

* ""sudo apt-get install &lt;Programm&gt;"" - weist den Packagemanager an, &lt;Programm&gt; zu installieren
* ""sudo apt-get remove &lt;Programm&gt;"" - weist den Packagemanager an, &lt;Programm&gt; zu entfernen
* ""sudo apt-get update"" - updatet die Paketlisten, sodass Ubuntu weiß, wie die aktuellen Packages stehen, was geupdatet werden könnte etc.
* ""sudo apt-get upgrade"" - führt das eigentliche Update durch, aktualisiert Software etc.

Ihr fragt euch jetzt sicher - **woher weiß ich, welche Programme ich installieren kann?** - gute Frage. Viele Paketmanager haben eine Suchfunktion, z.B Arch's ""pacman"". Apt löst dieses Problem mit:

* ""sudo apt-cache search &lt;Programm&gt;"" - sucht nach einem Programm in der Cache

Alternativ kann man auch googeln, aber wer hat schon die Zeit dazu?

Wer alternativ ein graphisches Frontend für apt will, der kann das Gnome Software Center nutzen. Irgendwann passiert es jedoch, dass eine bestimmte Software nicht verfügbar ist. Das liegt daran, dass euer Distrohersteller nicht jede neue Software direkt in die Repos lässt, das dient der Sicherheit. Im Falle von Arch gibt es hierzu das AUR, was das Problem einfach löst, im Falle von Ubuntu kann man weitere Repos hinzufügen. Diese findet man z.B über Google, meistens bei Launchpad - googelt einfach ""&lt;was ihr sucht&gt; ppa"", dann findet ihr einen Launchpad-Eintrag mit der PPA, dem ""personal package archive"", eines Users, meistens des Developers selbst. Angenommen ihr wollt die aktuellsten NVIDIA-Treiber - eine kurze Suche nach ""nvidia drivers ppa"" bringt euch [hierhin](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa). Dort steht auch alles, was ihr braucht, um das Repo hinzuzufügen:

* ""sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa"" - fügt das neue Repo hinzu
* ""sudo apt-get update"" - updatet die Paketlisten, damit die neuen Pakete beim Installieren auch gefunden werden

Von hier an kann man ganz normal mit ""sudo apt-get install nvidia-378"" die aktuellsten Nvidia-Treiber installieren. Klar, ist das mit Aufwand verbunden und diese Lösung ist nicht perfekt, Arch macht dies z.B Welten besser, aber ist dafür in anderer Hinsicht zu schwierig für Anfänger. Dafür werden diese Treiber automatisch installiert und von nun an immer mit allen anderen Packages geupdatet. Auch kann man Packages davon abhalten, mit dem Rest geupdatet zu werden, aber das ist ein anderes Thema und lässt sich per Google auch selbst herausfinden. Problematisch ist manchmal, dass vor allem Windowsnutzer gewohnt sind **Programme einzeln auf SSD und HDD installieren zu können** - das geht prinzipiell auch unter Linux, ist aber aufwendig und fortgeschritten - und meistens unnötig, wenn man bei der Installation richtig partitioniert, mehr dazu in Part III.

#**Linux Basics III.: Das Dateisystem**
Linux ordnet vereinfacht gesagt alles unter einem großen Baum an. Ganz oben ist das ""/""-Verzeichnis, alles andere ist darunter - z.B unter ""/home/deinBenutzername"" ist dein Homeverzeichnis. Auf diese Art und Weise wird alles fein sortiert verteilt. Hier ein Überblick der wichtigsten Ordner, falls ihr jemals nach etwas suchen müsst:

* /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin - diese Ordner beinhalten die executables des Systems
* /sbin/, /usr/sbin - diese Ordner beinhalten administrative executables des Systems
* /etc - systemweite Config-Dateien
* /dev - Devices, **nicht** die Mount-Points, wenn ihr auf Geräteinhalte zugreifen wollt, schaut bei /mnt oder /media
* /home - hier befinden sich einzelne Benutzerverzeichnisse für jeden Benutzer
* /usr - hier finden sich die meisten Systemtools, Bibliotheken und installierte Programme
* /var - Variable Systemdateien, z.B Logs sind hier

Um nochmal auf die SSD-HDD-Verteilungssituation zu sprechen zu kommen: Bei der Installation eines Linuxsystems braucht man mindestens zwei Partitionen, eine für Boot, eine für Root. Zusätzlich kann eine SWAP-Partition erstellt werden. Hier lagert das System, sobald der RAM nicht mehr ausreicht, Daten aus, um Platz zu schaffen. Interessant: Man kann einige Directories wie /usr oder /home auf die HDD legen, während der Rest unter Root auf der SSD liegt - damit ist das Betriebssystem an sich auf der SSD, die Programme werden auf der größeren HDD gespeichert. Wer allgemein aber auch für Programme die Geschwindigkeit der SSD nutzen will, sollte alles außer evtl. /home auf die SSD legen, der Platz wird bei einer &gt;200GB SSD ausreichen. Was ist mit Steam? Steam an sich ist das Programm, dass auf der SSD liegen wird, aber die Spiele selbst installieren sich by default in euer Homeverzeichnis - damit ist der größte Speicherfresser auf der HDD. Anderweitige Software ist selten so groß, dass sie die SSD sprengen wird, dementsprechend reicht dieses Setup in der Regel komplett aus und das ""Problem"" ist weitestgehend beseitigt. Für fortgeschrittene lässt sich auch mit symbolischen Links da nachhelfen, aber das ist ein anderes Thema.

#**Wie geht es von nun an weiter?**
Benutz deinen PC. Das ist alles. Linux installiert dir meistens das Wichtigste vor, LibreOffice als Office-Suite, Firefox als Browser, etc. - sogar ein Torrent-Client kommt oft mit. Wenn du Software brauchst, hast du meistens ein Software-Center (Gnome Software Center o.ä) mit dem alles wie von selbst funktioniert. Ansonsten lässt sich über das Terminal **alles** machen. Da von hier an alles von deiner Distribution abhängt, empfiehlt es sich, einfach mal eine Introduction dafür anzusehen, für Ubuntu und Derivate empfiehlt sich [dieses hier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpn1dnDO5Os), was auch nochmal die Installation veranschaulicht. Schau dich in der Hilfe um und bleib neugierig, dann hast du das Wichtigste schnell gelernt.

#**Bereits bekannte Software die unter Linux nativ vorhanden ist, die man evtl. installieren will**
* Unterhaltung: Steam, Spotify
* Produktivität: Audacity, Blender, Bitwig Studio, Gimp, Inkscape, Lightworks, LibreOffice, Sublime Text, TeamViewer, FileZilla
* Web: Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi
* Mail: Thunderbird
* Torrenting: qBittorrent, Transmission
* Messaging: Telegram, Skype, Pidgin, diverse IRC Clients (Quassel, XChat, Weechat), Discord (sowohl Web- als auch Desktopclient)
* File Hosting: Dropbox, MEGA
* IDE's: Die IntelliJ Suite, Eclipse, NetBeans, CodeBlocks, Brackets uvm.

#**Alternativen für Windows-Software**
* Adobe Illustrator: Inkscape
* Adobe Photoshop: GIMP für Bildmanipulation, Krita für Malen/Zeichnen
* Adobe Premiere/Finalcut: Kdenlive für [leichtes Videoediting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIzpXnJZlKU), LightWorks für industry-level productions, Blender für Masochisten
* Microsoft Office: LibreOffice, WPS Office, Google Docs
* Notepad oder jeder beliebige Texteditor: Sublime Text, GEdit, Atom, Vi/Vim/NeoVim, Emacs, Nano, Kate
* WinRar: Linux kommt meist direkt mit einem Entpacker (z.B File Roller)
* DaemonTools: ISO und ähnliche Abbildformate kann Linux direkt mounten
* CAD: FreeCAD
* WinAMP, iTunes, MusicBee etc.: Lollypop, Gnome Music, Amarok, Clementine, Rhythmbox
* DAW's, z.B Cubase: Ardour
* Visual Studio: Texteditor (z.B Sublime Text) + Compiler (Clang, GCC, Javac, je nach Sprache) (+ CMake/Premake, z.B für C++ und C) oder [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Weiteres](http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software)

#**Weitere interessante Software, die man von Windows/MacOSX nicht kennt**
* [Plank](http://www.noobslab.com/2014/08/install-plank-dock-and-plank-themer.html), ein Dock, ursprünglich von elementaryOS, sehr minimalistisch, aber erfüllt seinen Zweck
* [TLP](http://thinkwiki.de/TLP_-_Linux_Stromsparen), unter anderem wichtig für ThinkPads, aber nicht exklusiv - verbessert die Stromspareigenschaften von Linux; eine einfache Installation tut meist den Zweck vollkommen, dass man einen Unterschied bemerkt, andererseits lässt sich aber auch alles auf's genauste tweaken

#**Software nutzen, die keinen nativen Linuxsupport hat**
* Schreibe dem Entwickler, dass du gerne Linuxsupport hättest - wenn alle das tun würden, ständen die Chancen für einen Port nicht schlecht und es ist ein Aufwand von wenigen Minuten
* [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/de/), was intern wiederum [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) nutzt
* [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/products), was wiederum eine Art kommerzielles, besseres PlayOnLinux ist

Auf diese Weise läuft auch [Photoshop unter Linux](https://www.bitblokes.de/2014/10/adobe-photoshop-cs6-laeuft-unter-linux-playonlinux/). Oder [Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqUoR3PvRE). Oder [League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUB0soeTAuw).

##**Was tun, wenn Linux breakt?**
Das sollte unter normalen Bedingungen nicht vorkommen. Wenn jedoch z.B schlecht geportete Treiber installiert werden, du per Terminal irgendwelche Dateien gelöscht hast, mit sudo-Rechten um dich wirfst wie ein Verrückter oder sonstige Schelmereien betreibst, dann kann es schon mal sein, dass man beim Boot nicht allzu weit kommt. Folgendes kannst du tun, wenn du einen Blackscreen oder ein wenig weißen Text aber keinen Login-Manager bekommst:

* Benutze STRG-Alt-F3 und logge dich ein. Wenn nur der Display-/Loginmanager abstürzt, kannst du von hier aus per Terminal alles reparieren, Packages entfernen und neue installieren, per Nano/Vim/Emacs Configs editieren usw.
* cd'e in /var/log und schau dich dort in den Logfiles (per ""cat | less"" oder Editor wie Nano/Vim/Emacs) um, ob du nicht irgendwelche Fehlermeldungen findest, die du googeln könntest
* Update dein System, wenn dieser Fehler nach längerem nicht-updaten auftritt
* Schließe eine Backup-Festplatte oder ähnliches an, ziehe mit ""cp"" alle wichtigen Ordner und Dokumente auf die externe (wahrscheinlich unter ""/media"" zu finden), ziehe die Externe ab und installier das System neu, falls gar nichts funktioniert

Falls nichtmal das Terminal erreichbar ist, nutze eine Livedisk wie bei der Installation, schließe den Installer und benutze das Linuxsystem von der CD, um per [chroot dein System zu reparieren](https://superuser.com/questions/111152/whats-the-proper-way-to-prepare-chroot-to-recover-a-broken-linux-installation).

5qo4st,7,2017-01-28,Internship threatening to go awry,krirby,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5qo4st/internship_threatening_to_go_awry/,"Hey guys, hoping for some advice or perspective from one of you, because I don't really know who else to turn to.

Basically, I've been doing an internship in a psych clinic for a few months, and in the beginning it was great, but since they've been expecting me to do duties on my own I've learned I'm falling short.

Basically, I'm dealing with anxiety stuff I never realized was present in me. Whenever I'm in the therapists' chair, 75% of the time I freeze up. Turns out I have a lot of distrust in me and a lot of other stuff I didn't realize was there, and it's preventing me from empathizing with patients. So I freeze up and can't really talk on an emotional level, I just close off.

The problem is I never realized this was going on in me, and I don't think my colleagues/supervisor does either. They sometimes see me doing really well (the 25% of time I feel at ease with patients) so they keep telling me to be more confident. But unfortunately I can't bring myself to that state where I do well regardless of how much I try.

So, I'm now at a bit of a loss what to do or how I can make my situation better. I only have a short time at my internship left and the pressure is starting to get to me, I really wanna fix this but I'm not sure if there are any short-term solutions. I'm thinking about telling my supervisor of course but scared of how he'll react...

Sorry for the blog-post style, just really could use some perspective on this.

I'm currently a 3rd year at one of the better universities for my state, 20 years old, getting a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I didn't pick the degree for monetary reasons or because the job security, I just love sitting around and coding things, so there is no question about whether I ""care"" about Computer Science.

I am looking to graduate in Fall 2017 and have literally no real internship or work experience.
My GPA is okay, it's a 3.2 despite bad attendance and me on purposely taking 0's on assignments because ""Hey, I have a 98 right now, what's it gonna do, make me fail?"". I am also a part of my school's ACM, but haven't really organized any events or anything for them. As far as projects go, I had a really big project in my Software Engineering class that I was a part of a team for that ended up being the best in class, where I implemented part of the front-end UI for iOS and some unit tests for the backend in Python. 

Upon me having an ""Oh shit, I've done nothing for 3 years"" moment, I went to my school's engineering day and applied for internships, only to be told by a few people that they wouldn't consider me even for an internship because my ""extracurriculars were lacking"".

I intend on participating in my school's ""hackathon"" this semester, so hopefully something cool comes out of that and that can pad the resumse.

But that's literally all I can say on my resume outside of shitty food service jobs, languages and environments I'm proficient with. 
What can I do to make myself more desirable? I understand I already fucked myself by not taking school as seriously as I should and skipping my way to a 3.2, I'm working on trying to raise that up. 
I just want to be able to find work after I graduate, I don't want a big fancy job and I'm easy to please. I'd just prefer to not live in a dumpster because I have no real financial safety net once I graduate out of uni.

Thanks for reading reddit.

**TLDR; About to graduate, okay grades, young and fuck all experience, give me advice please.**

I have a couple questions/could use some advice.

Having been told that the chances for freshman landing a summer internship are low, I was wondering is there such a thing as a freshman-friendly company? In other words, are some companies probably easier to land an internship with, etc? If so, how can I spot them out through the list of companies my university released? I know that I should also do what I'm interested in but I've yet to have any experience to actually tell if I dislike/enjoy something so I'm really open to a lot, therefore I just wanted to know which companies might be most receptive to freshmen.

At expo, what are some do/don'ts when talking to recruiters? Or, how do I transition from standing in line to talking to the recruiter to hopefully impressing them enough that they can remember me/offer an interview? I feel like when I went to my university's expo last fall, I didn't have much of a game plan and while nothing wrong happened, I don't think I got much out of my time there so I want to fix that this time around.

Until a few months ago, I had aspirations to work in the US. I consider myself quite competent, so I'm not talking about working in sweat shops like Infosys. I wanted to work at Google or Facebook full-time when I graduate (I have done internships with MS and Amazon).

But with Trump's recent spree of executive orders, it looks like my future will be highly uncertain if I go there (assuming of course that people are still allowed to enter the US). I'd much rather work elsewhere where I can have the luxury of not having to worry about my visa everyday.

Before you implore me to work in my own country - please don't. There are reasons why I want to work elsewhere.

So I'm just wondering - what are some other places in the world where there's a lively tech scene (i.e. Big 4 and unicorns have offices), the salary is competitive (maybe not as high as Silicon Valley, but close) and the quality of life is good in general?"

I am not sure where to even begin or if it even needs to be acknowledged, but I have no one to talk to and I obviously am not good at making my own decisions. 

I met Ted (not his real name) in Aug of 2011. We had just started college and we majored in the same thing- so we spent a lot of time around each other in class. 

At this time in my life, I was a very naive person. I was going into college having never kissed a boy much less anything more then that. Growing up I was a tom boy, and I went to a small school where you most likely had been at the school since you were a baby so every person in my grade I grew up with. I had low self esteem because of this. I never thought boys (or anyone for that matter) would ever like me romantically. I had dreams of having a family (amongst my career and other things) but deep down I believed that is wasn't possible for me so I never told anyone about my hopes. I settled into the idea what having a relationship just wasn't in the cards for me. 3 years prior to me starting college, my parents divorced which added a lot more insecurities to my life. Since 2009 I haven't had a room or a home for more then a year at a time. I haven't lived with my parents since 2009 so I jump from city to city trying to fill a hole inside of myself. 
Anyway, the actual problem. 
I met ted in 2011, he had a girlfriend. Like I said before I was very naive so I didn't have a crush on him at all. I liked him as a person but i would never consider liking him more then that Bc I didn't think it was possible for anyone to want me romantically. 
Slowly something changed, we would talk a lot. Usually about theatre and tv. We ended up being assigned to work on a scene for a theatre competition together, a scene with a kiss in it. This was my first kiss. I really didn't think anything of it but then the weekend of the competition we were in a store and the lady asked if we were dating (he and I are both very sarcastic and we like to shit talk playfully, so I guess she found it cute) when I went to say no, he said yes. 
This was very shocking to me. She said prove it and he kissed me right there. 
I was smitten. 
Still, the dark self hating monster inside of me started screaming and told me to ignore it. So I did.
That night he stayed up all night with me practicing for another part of the competition that I was signed up for. 
The next day we did the competition and then went back to the small town where our school was. He stopped talking to me. It went on for a little over a week and I was so upset. At that point I considered him a good friend. 
I went to his room and confronted him and he told me ""I have been ignoring you because I have feelings for you, and I didn't realize it until the competition. And that's not allowed Bc I have a girlfriend. So I can't be around you"" 
I was shocked so I left and went to my room but he followed me down. He apologized but we still went our separate ways. 
The next week at theatre rehearsal, he pulled me aside and told me he broke up with his girlfriend. 
From that point we began to spend every second together. From February to May of that year we spent the night together almost every night (I lost my virginity in mid- march of that year. 
We would talk about the future and our lives and he made me feel like the most special person in the world. 
In may of that year when we had to leave campus for summer break- he got back together wth his girlfriend. 
I was so heartbroken I reached out to my grandmother and asked her if I could come stay with her. She lived in my hometown so I would be around my friends from high school which in my head, was what I needed to heal. 
I had never been an over emotional person and at this point in my life I had never felt pain like this before. 
To top it all off, I found out I was pregnant. 
I didn't tell anyone Bc I didn't know what to do. In my head I would leave school, stay in my hometown, and raise the baby. - childish. 

I ended up having a miscarriage in late July of that summer. I have never told anyone about it. Not even Ted. 

I went back to school that august and avoided him wth everything I had. I couldn't all the time but I did a good job for the most part. He wasn't mean, he tried to be friends. He apologized for what happened. At one point when I was sick he brought me food and I started crying and he kissed me. I pushed him away and said the name of his girlfriend and he got up and left. 

From then until April 2014 he and I never really talked. We had a thing called ""I owe you one"" where we would make bets (we worked together in the theatre department of our school so we would make bets occasionally-we are both very competitive) and whoever lost owed the winner an ""I owe you one"" which basically was a no questions asked favor that could be as simple as write my essay for class or take me to luck or give me a ride to the neighboring town.

We had a very civil friendship (if you want to call it a friendship) if I was ever upset I could go to his house and we would smoke weed. We never talked about anything too deep. Usually superficial conversations. 

I ended up moving to California April of 2014 (I was depressed and decided moving away from the south would be the best medicine) 

Now jump to July 2015- I was working as an intern for a theatre group in Charleston, SC running social media pages when ted followed the group on Twitter, I didn't think much of it. Ironic but not important in my head. A week later he followed me on my own personal account. A day after that he messaged me. 

He was asking how I was but other then that. Not much was said. But then he asked me for my number. I obliged. From July until nov I talked to him 24/7- texting, calling, and skype. I visited him in NYC that November around my birthday. It was like old times again. We enjoyed each others company, we liked the same things. On my birthday I woke up in the middle of the night and he was holding my hand. My whole body went numb. Something in my head said- he was the one. 

I went back south and he set up an interview with his work for me. So I went between New York and SC 3 times before I ended up moving to NYC in late January 2016. 

I cut him off in late December Bc the week after I left to go back south after my second interview, he posted a Snapchat of his ex-coincidently the ex he went back to summer between our freshmen and sophomore year. 

I was heart broken but I toughened up. I deleted him from my Snapchat to I didn't have to see her and him together and continued to work on my relocation to NYC. (Clarification- I haven't wanted to move to NYC since I was a kid and it was my ultimate goal. I didn't move to NY for ted. But he did help me get a job which I will always be grateful for. 

After I moved to NY we didn't hang out much. I didn't want to get played the same way I was when I was younger. At least in my head. 

April after I moved things changed. Ted started making an effort to spend time with me all the time. We began spending the night together every night. Eventually our relationship turned physical. 

I started getting feelings again and I asked him what was going on between us and he said we are just friends, I'm not looking for a relationship. 

I was heartbroken but he never cut things off. Since April we have spent every second together. We commute to work together, he stays at my place, and I stay at his. He takes me to anything he gets invited to and vice versa. 

It's a very mutual relationship. No one gives any more then the other. Sometimes he pays sometimes I do. 

But still, he says he isn't ready for a relationship. In my head he is already in one. 

Every day he kills me inside. I am so in love with him and he doesn't seem to feel the same. He says he doesn't want to lead me on but then I does. On New Year's Eve he kissed me at midnight. I've never been kissed at midnight before. 

What makes it worse is that when I go to touch him. Not even to initiate anything but just to put my arm around his arm or my head on his shoulder- he pushes my away. 

When I get fed up and I end things he is the one who comes and tries to get me back. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I want an adult relationship, I want someone to love me. I am tired of these games. 

A part of me just wanted to say fuck it and move on but then another part of me still thinks he is the one. 

I know this a lot and I am sorry if this isn't what this thread is for but this is my last ditch effort to get some kind of clarity. 

I'm just tired of living with this broken heart


Edit: I am not saying I want anyone to love me... I'm not desperate. I just want ted to reciprocate. If not I want to know if I'm wasting my time. I feel guilty even thinking about the possibility of trying to meeet someone else. 

Also: I apologize if my post doesn't make sense at times or for any typos. "

------

The four soldiers snapped to attention the moment they caught sight of him. He was powerful. He was stern. He intimidating. He was indomitable, bad tempered, and a legend on the rise. He was the Knight Commander Oriaxus, and he was in a foul mood. 

He'd received the call on his NID shortly after coming on duty. It was a Army Master Sergeant by the name of Ciddeco calling to let him know they'd arrested one of his Rangers. The knight's name was Piedwhar Moonchild, and he'd been arrested for assaulting a pair of civilians while drunk and on duty. Both were court-martialing offenses. If the charges were found to be true, Oriaxus fully intended to take the Ranger to task for his transgression. That being said, he was willing to give the knight the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't unusual for a soldier with a grudge against the knighthood to use his position to settle a score. He had no worries though. There were strict rules on how to deal with the arrest of a knight. If the Master Sergeant or one of her men went too far, they'd surely end up paying the price. Oriaxus was not a man to be trifled with.  

The Knight Commander didn't bother to acknowledge four soldiers waiting for him in the corridor ahead. They were all low-ranking Imperials with none of them ranking higher than a corporal. They were hardly worth his time. They saluted him as they were taught. He dipped his head in acknowledgement and kept walking. Showing them the kindness and respect of a salute just didn't feel right. He had no idea what part they played in the apprehension of his ranger. For all he knew, the grudge he suspected was at play was one of theirs. 

""Commander?"" one of the soldiers greeted as he passed between the four. Oriaxus ignored him and kept walking, forcing the soldier to quick-step out into the middle of the corridor to block his way. The Knight Commander swept him aside with a brush of his armored arm. The soldier recovered quickly and skipped backwards to get in front of the knight again. Oriaxus stopped to study the man he was on the verge of throttling. 

The soldier was more or less the man Oriaxus believed him to be, an unwashed imbecile. The man's uniform was wrinkled and spotted with food from his last meal. There was rust on the hilt of the blade sheathed on his hip. He was unshaven, had yellow teeth, and smelled like old onions. His hair was too long, feathering out over his ears, oily from infrequent washing, and speckled with dandruff. The man was a slob and unfit to wear the uniform he was neglecting.

""You think this is wise?"" Oriaxus asked coolly. 

""My apologies, Commander. Master Sergeant Ciddeco has asked that we intercept you before allowing you access to the prisoner. She wishes to meet with you before giving you leave to interview your man. If you'll accompany us to the Master Sergeant's--""

Oriaxus grabbed him by the throat and squeezed, lifting him off the ground to let the man know just how pissed off he was. He let his armor aid him in his feat of strength, not that he was going to let them know that. There was an advantage in subterfuge. The other soldiers reached for their weapons out of reflex. Oriaxus, however, was the quicker draw. He pointed his halo at the head of the soldier closest to him and dared the others to finish drawing theirs. They froze in place with their weapons half-drawn. 

""Before giving me leave?"" he queried. ""Master Sergeant Ciddeco has no authority to deny me access to my man just like she has no authority to arrest a member of my Order. We do not answer to agents of the empire. We are outside of it."" He gave the soldier he had dangling in the air a hard shove that sent him staggering backwards. ""If Ciddeco has a problem with me questioning my man, she can come to me. Men of my status are not summoned by subordinates and especially not by low-ranking Imperial,"" he snapped. Oriaxus turned on the others and dropped his eyes to the weapons they were palming. When he met their eyes again, each man understood the warning and gingerly moved their hands away. He re-holstered his halo then and resumed his march, his eyes going to the door at the far end that was the interview room where suspects were questioned. The guard he'd shoved was quick to scramble out of  his way, proving that even the shabbiest of soldiers could still be taught.

""The Master Sergeant is going to hear about this,"" the soldier called out after him. ""There will be repercussions for this, Commander."" Then again, maybe shabby soldiers incapable of learning.

""What fear you spread,"" Oriaxus mocked. ""Weak men threaten. Strong men act. We do what needs doing when it needs to be done. There will be repercussions, Corporal. You're right about that, but they'll be geared toward you and your fellow soldiers. They drew weapons on a superior officer, and not just as superior officer. They drew weapons on a Knight Commander of Heidish Order. I'll be testifying at your court-martials."" The four soldiers exchanged nervous looks, suddenly a little less certain of themselves.

""You've never met the Master Sergeant, Knight Commander. This isn't over,"" the Corporal promised.
 
""Shut up, man. We're in enough trouble as it is. Don't provoke him,"" one of the other soldiers hissed, a sandy-haired soldier with a round face and a nose that turned up at the end. He had the orange eyes of a Haifeasian, but the pale skin of a Yortharian. He was a maastizo half-breed.

""He can't threaten us,"" the Corporal disagreed. ""Ciddeco will set him straight. You'll see.""

""Listen to your friend,"" Oriaxus called back in warning. ""Every word you speak only adds to the number of charges I plan on bringing against you."" The Corporal opened his mouth to respond but closed it when his sandy-haired comrade reached out and took him by the arm. There was fear in the eyes of the other three, enough to end the Corporal's tirade. Oriaxus smirked and kept on walking. He loved putting drudges in their place.

Ever since his capture of Magpie, he'd been permitted to write his own ticket professionally. He was in the favor of everyone important associated with that arrest. He knew the arrest was a sham. Magpie had let the Commander arrest him. That was the only way anyone was taking him into custody. But, Oriaxus still got to take credit for it, and it'd done wonders for his career. 

He was asked quite often by his peers and his subordinates privy to the knowledge of the arrest how he managed it. He hated that he couldn't tell the truth. While it was a boost to his career, it was also a lie. Oriaxus seriously disliked the fact that he was taking credit for something he didn't do. When they asked, his habit was to shrug and pivot the conversation away to a less controversial subject. That's not to say he didn't enjoy the perks of the lie. When word gets out that you're the one who captured the Butcher of Sylar, all kinds of doors open. One of those perks he was enjoying right now. He detested interactions with his Army counterparts. Imperial soldiers were beneath him. 

If he made a demand now, they had no choice but to acquiesce. He had the full weight of his Heidish Council of Elders behind him. He could tell them to fuck off without having to worry about being dressed down for it by a superior officer. Yes. Capturing Magpie, despite the fact that it was just for show, had fast-tracked him. There was even whispers around the Battle Command hinting that the Council of Elders and Pemphero were looking to fill a couple of command positions soon and that he was their top pick. He wasn't sure which positions they needed to fill, but the rumor mill had it that one of them was a Knight Marshal position. The other was the position of the Knight Numeric, High Commander of the Paladins. 

He was thrilled by news. Both positions were prestigious ones. There were only six marshals aboard each saucer, each in charge of a hundred levels of the ship. It would be a significant promotion, it being two ranks above the one he held now. He much preferred it to role of the Knight Numeric. He had no wish to become a paladin even though that would technically make him a Brigadier General. He just wasn't a religious man.

Oriaxus understood the need to protect the monastic arm of the Heidish Order. The knighthood had benefited greatly from its relationship with the monks. A knight's ability to resist the psychic attack of an opponent was a direct result of their teachings. Despite that, Oriaxus didn't want to spend the rest of his career protecting a bunch of meditating monks and their Abbots from the nonexistent threats of the other monastic orders. He was a man built for war, for battle, and as a paladin, there just wasn't anyone to fight. The holy wars were over. The launching of the fleet had practically put an end to religious dissension. People were allowed to worship their gods in peace, and if they had a problem with a particular belief paradigm, they could simply move to another saucer where that religion wasn't an issue.

When he grabbed the door handle to the interview room, he found that it'd been locked. That angered him more than the arrest of the ranger. They were treating his knight like a common criminal, like he was a man without honor. He slammed his knee into the door hard. It flew open, giving him unfettered access to the room and prisoner beyond. If the thought the locked door angered him, then seeing the condition of his Ranger threw him into a murderous rage.

The young knight was haggard and sleep deprived. His pouches and sidearm had been taken. His sword had been locked. Oriaxus suddenly felt like speaking to the Master Sergeant, or rather, he felt like throttling the bitch. No one treated his knights like this without suffering in return. The fact that they'd held on to him long enough to deprive him of sleep was troubling. He'd only just received word of his subordinate's arrest. Calling him should have been the first thing that Master Sergeant Ciddeco did after the arrest. It was unheard of. Knights could be detained with a reason, but never interrogated. There were special protocols in place for dealing with these kinds of situations. It was part of the accords negotiated between the Emperor and the Baron. 

The Heidish Order was outside the empire, meaning that its constables and justices had no authority to incarcerate, interrogate, or sentence a knight suspected of a crime. Only the Council of Elders and the Baron were permitted that authority. 

Despite his disheveled appearance and clearly weakened state, the young knight still had the presence of mind to snap to attention in the presence of his commanding officer. He surged out of his seat trailing his manacled hands. They were tethered to the table with a chain. He still tried to salute, but could only drag his hands up as high as his navel.

""Lord Commander,"" the Ranger greeted, a look of desperation in his eyes. Oriaxus marched around the table and drew his sword. He severed the chain tying the Ranger to the table with a swipe of his sword. The cuffed prisoner quickly saluted then presented Oriaxus with his cuffed hands. Oriaxus brought his blade down on the chain with a grunt and growl. The Ranger's hands flew apart, free of their constraints at last.

""Name and assignment?"" Oriaxus barked, eyeing the knight closely.

""Piedwhar Moonchild, Ranger, Yorth Brigade,"" the Ranger reported.

""One of Sergeant Rothman's men, eh?"" Oriaxus responded thoughtfully. ""Do you have no respect for that armor, son? Do you have no loyalty? Has the Order let you down in some way that you feel the dishonoring of it a justifiable act?"" Piedwhar's mouth opened and closed without uttering a word. The man was clearly confused.

""I love my armor, Sir. I love the Order. I love being a knight. If I've dishonored myself, Sir, or embarrassed you with my actions, I apologize. Just tell me what I've done wrong, and I will make amends."" A door to their right opened suddenly, admitting two soldiers. The first was known Oriaxus. It was the dark-haired knight he'd grabbed by the throat out in the corridor. The other he didn't know, though judging by her gender and the sergeant pins on her collar, she was Master Sergeant Cidecco. 

""I believe I requested you attend me before speaking with the prisoner,"" Ciddeco told the Knight Commander crisply. ""There are details of his arrest that you need to be made aware before I can release him into your custody, Commander.""

""I require the key to his manacles, Master Sergeant,"" Oriaxus told her, holding out his hand for the key. I also require a list of the charges you've falsely accused him of."" 

The Knight Commander had what some might call an unhealthy preoccupation with self-image. How others saw him mattered. He'd had a meager up-bringing. His father had been sewage tech. His two older brothers were sewage techs. His little sister and three of his first cousins were sewage techs. Everyone in his family but his mother was a sewage tech. It was embarrassing. It was a lifestyle that was beneath him. The other kids had teased him growing up. He'd suffered more humiliation in the first twenty years of his life than he had in the seven hundred and seventeen years since. 

His mother hadn't fallen into the trap though. She had dreamed bigger, taking a job as a data retentionist for the ministry. Unfortunately for her, she'd been unable to shake of the stink of what her family did for a living. The Knight Commander though, he'd figured out the secret to success early. Put yourself first. He succeeded where his mother failed, but distancing himself from his parents and siblings. As soon as he had his labor card, he went to work for the Ministry just like his mother. He'd started out as a runner for a lesser known magistrate, and worked his way up and into an internship with a Truth Speaker. The more distance he put between him and the sewage tanks on Level 40, the faster he was able to climb. He was now a man with a notorious reputation for doing anything to increase his public image--anything but betray his Order and the knights who answered to him.

While the opinions of others mattered to him, none meant more to him than the opinions of the men he was responsible for. The admiration of Pemphero and Commander Rains was heartening and exciting, but they were nothing compared to the love and respect that his men had for him. That he would never betray. It was what he'd been searching for all his life.

""I really believe we should speak in private,"" Ciddeco urged, stepping aside so that the Commander could pass through the door she'd just entered through. ""My office is close by.""

5qoo30,0,2017-01-28,MS in Computer Engineering or MIS? Which course should I do my Master's in?,misslunartic,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5qoo30/ms_in_computer_engineering_or_mis_which_course/,"I did my bachelor's in Electronics &amp; Communications Engineering from one of the top 10 engineering colleges in India, with an aggregate of 71% (including 4 backlogs in 1st and 3rd semester, all of which I cleared in my Third year in the first attempt). I got 70-85% in the last two years of my college. I also won the 2nd prize in an electronics design challenge in my college, which was organized by a major Japanese Semiconductor Manufacturer at our college, beating 30 other teams. I have done decent technical internships both in Summers(2 months) &amp; winters(2 months), dealing with microcontroller based electronics design and Smart Cities. I also have a decent research experience in Computer Vision, although no research papers published. For the last 8 months, I have been working as an Analyst at a mediocre-ish firm in India. I have a good knowledge of statistical model building and exploratory analysis using languages such as R and SQL. Recently, I presented a paper at an International Conference on 'The Role of Analytics in Smart Cities'. I want to pursue my career in the Smart City domain. I am confused if I should go for an MS in Computer Engineering, dealing with databases and Cyber-Physical Systems or to go for an MIS/MISM with a work ex of &gt;12 months at the time of application. I want to go for Computer Engineering, but since my profile isn't stellar, I am worried. Can you identify the pros and cons of each, regarding my profile and help me out? Can you also point out any good courses worldwide for the same? Thanks. :)"
5qosbj,0,2017-01-28,Graduate Assistantship vs Entry level jobs,Sven_Braun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qosbj/graduate_assistantship_vs_entry_level_jobs/,"This is bordering on some of the FAQ stuff, so if this is too similar let me know and I'll delete it.

To preface, I graduated in December 2016 in Computer Engineering. Some of the stuff I'm about to say/ask will be specific to CE and my situation, but I'll try to keep it more general.

I have been job hunting since graduation. During the last two years, I worked for a professor on some side projects, and he allowed me to continue working for him while I find a job. (This is normally a student role, and it's not possible nor is it career smart to work for him in the long term.)

I am still in the posting resume/interviewing stage, and have one more set-in-stone interview in a few days. This professor that I work for approached me this past week asking if I had considered graduate school, and through our conversation asked if I'd like to be a GA. 

For those who don't know, GAs (or Graduate Assistantships) are masters students who get a masters program mostly/completely covered through some sort of credit allowance and a yearly stipend, in exchange for a certain number of hours spent doing research. In this specific situation, I'd be working for this same professor - as I'm doing now - doing the same sort of work that I do now, as a part-time GA with the possibility of additional funding through grant money. Part-time GA compensation would not be enough for me to stay afloat, so I would need to grab a second job or hope that grant money can cover the rest.

An additional bonus of accepting right now would be the ability to start Masters classes that day, as our school waives the GRE for graduates of this school. Even though class has gone on for a few weeks, I could enroll that day and take advantage of the more-interesting classes that are being offered this semester.

I honestly don't know what to do. On one hand, I could get a masters degree partially/completely paid, and I become a more-desirable candidate for job searching. On the other hand, I would forfeit the opportunity to join industry now and delay the start of my career. Masters was maybe part of the plan in the future, but it seems like everything got expedited and it blindsided me. I don't necessarily need to be propped up by a Masters degree, as I have about two years of experience across two internships as a fresh graduate.

So, in general terms, I'm looking for either advice on what you'd do/what I should do, or hear from people who have been caught between GA vs job and what they chose.

TL;DR: GA or entry job?"

I was an average dude in high school and university. Never got bullied or anything but wasn't popular. I had friends in high school and I wanted to follow my own path and become a software engineer because I loved computers, developing video games and websites, so I went down that route and lost my friends as our paths were different I guess. I didn't really make friends in university, didn't really get along with the nerdy types found in software engineering beyond school work. Obviously no girls in software, so never got laid unfortunately.


I worked my damn ass off in university. I didn't want to go into debt with student loans so while people were partying and having fun, I was working a full time job or doing internships. If I wasn't studying or working, I was at the gym. I even got in shape, started dressing much nicer, cleaned up my face (no acne, well-groomed hair, beard). I lacked opportunity to get laid because I never had time to socialize and never really had friends to go out with.


I graduated and ended up getting a job with one of the big four (think Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) so I make decent cash and am pretty content with what I have financially. But really I feel like during this pursuit of money, I missed out on life and especially girls. I have money but I don't even use it, I invest it, it grows but what's the point? I'm alone with no friends, no girls to share my life with. I don't want to flaunt my wealth and make superficial friendships either.


All my hobbies are introverted (reading, video games, gym, programming) so I don't go out anywhere to meet anyone new. I tried making a Tinder account and I didn't get any matches whatsoever except some fat whales and I'm a decent looking guy imo. I met one girl and she was a major party girl with nothing going on in her life aside from the travelling and partying she's done... I can't bring myself to pursue a girl like that. When I was busy working and making something of myself, you were having fun and now you want me to spend my life's hard work on you so I can have sex with you? What's worse is when I realize how easy these girls can have sex without any effort whatsoever where a guy like me who dresses well, fit, is well-off STILL has to put in work and even then can't get laid.


Sorry this is a bit of a rant, Idk, I feel like I'm getting old now and don't really have much to show for experiencing life and haven't had any fun whatsoever."

When I apply, I'll have 6 months of Academic research experience in Welfare economics with a professor in our business school, and 1 year of work experience (6 months as an IT Compliance intern at an insurance company, and 6 months as an Accounting Clerk at the Department of Streets)

Even with a good GRE score I'm worried I won't be a competitive candidate because I won't have as many math courses under my belt.

I will only have:
Calc 1 - 3
Linear Algebra 

Plus an Econometrics course.

Because of course load, I can't take any more math classes. 

Is there anything else that I can do to be more competitive?"

So I know the gist of it is to list specific accomplishments you did in the bullet points and mention technologies used. Here are some questions I have:

* If every feature mentioned in your bullet points uses the same languages/tools, do you have to mention it in every bullet? In my last internship, I pretty much used JavaScript and the company's custom framework for everything, so I feel like it would be redundant to say ""developed using JavaScript and custom framework"" in every single bullet point.

* How many bullet points is too many? And what's the max number of lines a bullet should take up? I currently have 4 bullet points and each bullet is 2 lines long. Is that too long? Would it make a recruiter not want to read it?"

1) I was wondering how to make friends! Would it be weird for me to hang out alone in bars? I'm presuming there will be fewer tourists at this time of year... is this likely to be true? Will the locals hate me? If I tried to strike up conversations with strangers would that go well? I'm single so not opposed to using apps like tinder to meet people - is this a thing in Reykjavik?

2) obviously I would like to do things like the golden circle tour etc whilst I'm there - what's the weather like sept - Nov? I appreciate it's gonna be cold but is it going to be light enough during the day to fully appreciate everything? How many hours of daylight am I likely to get? 

3) do you have any tips or recommendations for me as a solo traveller in Reykjavik during this time of year? 

Thanks all! :)"

I am looking to found a start-up, we currently don't have a technical co-founder and therefore I was hoping to build our MVP myself. Here is where I come unstuck. My background is as an Embedded C developer during an internship and at Uni. Since then I have put the majority of those skills on the backburner in a technical management role.

Therefore my questions would be, if I wanted to transition into web development what are the best tools you would recommend.
What are the best languages and frameworks to allow me to build a web product reasonably quickly and are still relevant technologies? Where should I point my evening and weekend attentions?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have been going round in circles, I got quite a few intensive days down a learning path with Ruby on Rails and then got advice that this was an ageing framework and should move to Angular and Node. "

This is a long one with a lot of background, so I hope you'll bear with me. TLDR at end.

I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables (perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I'd expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke, and some other things; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make. My coworker constantly make me feel inadequate, and I felt like I had nothing to contribute to what was meant to be one of the most important tasks of my career. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving my well-being and the quality of my life.

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and out of more than 60 applications so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications and no interviews (I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all applicable jobs in them.

For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family, so I thought, was being pretty supportive and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture basically about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

The day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that if it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser (this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items. I’d only told a few very close friends because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad, and I only found out about it because my sister confronted me afterwards. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

My mom called me a few hours ago. She basically ignored the job posting and acted as if nothing had happened; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s talked about to others, truthfully or otherwise. I’ve trying to decide if I should keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family."
5qrbk7,3,2017-01-28,Masters for a job in Cybersecurity? (about to be compsci/infosys bachelors grad),zabenno,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qrbk7/masters_for_a_job_in_cybersecurity_about_to_be/,"I am going to graduate mid-year from my bachelors degree with a double major in computer science and information systems, with a focus on security. I have recently become very interested in the security side of IT but have no real experience, I'm just now setting up a lab at home to learn Sys/Net Admin skills.

My grades will be good enough that I will have two options for a masters degree one from a lesser prestige uni, AUT, and one from my current, AU. I don't really care about prestige but employer might.

AUT is really security focused and requires me to either write a thesis or do an applied research project. AU is much more of a general IT skills course however I can choose papers that allow it to be mostly focused on security and IT project management/design.

 The AU degree also has a compulsory internship with ""Industry partners"" which I assume means they will make it fairly easy to get an internship. This could be valuable as I live in New Zealand and there aren't that many internships/entry level jobs requiring no experience.

If I was to do a masters degree it would be out of these two as I do not want to be in uni forever. What degree do you think I should go for? Any advice related to getting into IT security more so on the defensive side or a govt job would be greatly appreciated.

AU degree: Masters of Information Technology

AUT degree: Master of Information Security and Digital Forensics

I also have done CCNA1 and CCNA2, with merit, and received the Cisco Cyber Ops scholarship which is to start in June. This would be during my finals for first semester and overlap second semester which would effect my masters if I took it."

Would it be okay if I had two reference sheets loaded up to help me out with syntax in case I forget? Was planning on loading these two links up before the interview:

**General C++ syntax:**

https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c++/

**C++ STL reference**

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/

Just asking since I'm not sure if the interviewer expects me to know C++ in and out thoroughly. This is for Amazon by the way, so if anyone has experience with using a different language for the interview that'd be helpful to know!"
5qs6jp,13,2017-01-29,Detroit Lions In-Depth Mock Draft,chaseman421,detroitlions,https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/5qs6jp/detroit_lions_indepth_mock_draft/,"Hey /r/detroitlions, hope you guys have been having a good offseason so far. I’ve been following the Detroit Lions for as long as I’ve been watching football and hope to one day be the Detroit GM. I’m currently an intern with the Washington Redskins but I won’t tell them my allegiances if you don’t. I’ve been following the draft hype pretty religiously and so I wanted to share my thoughts on who I believe we should target in the draft. Please feel free to discuss and disagree but keep it respectful. At the end of the day, I trust our management to draft the best players for our team and bring us our first SuperBowl!
Our picks are as follows: 

•	Round 1, pick 21

•	Round 2, pick 53

•	Round 3, pick 85

•	Round 4, pick 126

•	Round 5, pick 167

•	Round 6, pick 206

•	Round 6, pick 216

I also don’t expect us to receive any compensatory picks so these pics are set in stone. I will try to keep my predictions as accurate as possible based on where I see most players going.


**Round 1, Pick 21**

**Zach Cunningham – LB – Vanderbilt** 

 In 2016, Cunningham had 125 tackles with 16.5 for a loss, three passes batted and two forced fumbles. At 6’4, Zach is a load at ILB and would be a great anchor for our defense for years to come. His presence would likely mean that Whitehead could be kicked outside into a more natural position. As many of us know, Whitehead graded out as PFF’s second worst linebacker. Zach excels in run defense but is also able to cover RBs and TEs when necessary. Although not as polished in his pass defense as his run defense, Zach is a high-ceiling linebacker that can only get better. The one true knock on Zach is his arm tackling. He doesn’t always wrap the ball carrier up correctly or square up to make a tackle. Luckily, these are problems that can be fixed with the right coaching staff……a coaching staff that helped the Lions lead the league in fewest missed tackles. 


**Round 2, Pick 53**

**Gareon Conley – CB – Ohio State**

This was probably my toughest pick to make in this entire draft because we haven’t yet addressed our D-Line and this draft is rich in CB prospects. That said, I believe Conley will be a stud if he’s still on the board around this pick. I’ve seen Conley listed between 6’0 – 6’2 which is solid size for a cornerback. Conley had a coming out party in 2016 as he was tasked with shadowing the #1 receiver on opposing teams and boy did he deliver. On the year, Conley defensed 8 passes and had 4 interceptions. His playmaking was clutch too (looking at you Michigan State). Conley was big enough to press receivers at the line or drop back into coverage. He was equally excellent in man coverage as he was in zone coverage but on the Lions, they’ll ask him to work more on a man-to-man level. With Lawson heading for a contract year, it’d be smart for us to start looking at a possible replacement or someone we can trot out onto the field in nickel/dime packages. 


**Round 3, Pick 85**

**Tanoh Kpassagnon – DE – Villanova**

This might be wishful thinking based on the way this kid has been performing at the Senior Bowl. Tanoh measured in at just around 6’7 and 280 pounds with nearly 35 inch arms and a 84.5 inch wingspan. In case you didn’t know, those measurables are absolutely insane. It was also reported that back in June, he ran a 4.74 40-yard dash. Tanoh also won CAA’s defensive player of the year with 21.5 TFL and 11 sacks. With Devin Taylor coming off a terrible season and set to be a free agent, Tanoh could slide right into his spot at DE across from Ziggy. I have a few knocks on Tanoh. The first knock on Tanoh is that I’m not sure how he’ll do against elite level OTs. With Villanova playing against teams such as Rhode Island and Elon, he was able to dominate their subpar talent. How would he do against NFL O-lines? My second knock on Tanoh is that it appears he’s a little slow off the line and relies too much on his speed to get around blockers. Any great OT in the NFL would be able to neutralize him unless he learns some new rushing techniques. 


**Round 4, Pick 126**

**Montravius Adams – DT – Auburn**

I am a big fan of Adams. At 6’4, 310 pounds, he is a beast. Adams was part of that monster D-Line for Auburn that also featured Lawson. This past year, Adams had 43 tackles, 8 TFL and 4 sacks while constantly facing double teams. He is a physically imposing individual and is fast off the line. Likewise, he was used in lots of stunts during his time at Auburn. With Ngata possibly being a cap casualty this summer, the Lions would be smart to invest in another young DT to put next to Robinson or to be a part of their rotation. My knock on Adams is that he doesn’t appear to always give 100% on every play. Sometimes you see him take on two blockers and still move himself in front of the ball carrier and other times you see him get tied up in a 1 on 1 with a guard or center. Remind you of any other DTs from Auburn? I’ve seen enough from this guy to believe he will be much different than Fairley though in terms of work ethic and consistency. 


**Round 5, pick 167**

**Ryan Switzer – WR – North Carolina**

I know what some of you may be thinking. A wide receiver? Really? Yes, really. Boldin will be turning 37 next October, Andre Roberts will be a free agent and TJ Jones has really yet to establish himself as anything special. Enter Ryan, who by all accounts, has been lighting up the Senior Bowl. At roughly 5’9, Ryan isn’t the most intimidating player. He also doesn’t have the top notch speed that you might expect from most receivers his size. He does however have great hands and a knack for running great routes. This past year at UNC, Ryan recorded 96 receptions for 1,112 yards and 6 touchdowns as the main benefactor of Trubisky-thrown balls. Ryan has shown over this past year and at the Senior Bowl that he has a unique ability to always get open. His ability to studder-step and stop-and-go have made some heads turn at the Senior Bowl (honestly though, check out some of the videos of him from the Senior Bowl). I think Ryan would be a great addition to the Lions. I see Ryan contributing right away on special teams or as a kickoff/punt returner if we decide to let Roberts walk. 


**Round 6, Pick 206**

**Jalen Reeves-Maybin – LB – Tennessee** 

Now this pick excites me a lot. Jalen’s full talents weren’t on display too much this past year as a shoulder injury limited him to just a few games of action. During his junior season though, he recorded 105 tackles, 14 TFL, 6 sacks and 4 passes defensed. Jalen is a tad smaller, coming in at roughly 6’0 and 225 pounds. However, he is an absolute beast especially in the open field. He uses his quickness to get past blockers and blow up run plays or screen passes. He is a sure tackler and due to his lack of size, has a knack for wrapping up the ball carrier around the legs. His closing speed is deceptively faster than the 40 time he is expected to run (somewhere in the mid-4.7s). Jalen is best suited for a 4-3 defense and would do well on the weak-side. The main knock on Jalen besides his size is his unproven ability to defend against the pass. Jalen defensed only 4 passes during his entire 4-year career. He reminds me of a poor-mans DeAndre Levy. I think with the right coaching, Jalen could be our biggest steal of the draft. 


**Round** **6,** **Pick** **216**

**Joe** **Mixon** – **RB** – **Oklahoma**

Were it not for his off-the-field troubles, Mixon would be easily gone by day 2. He is arguably one of the top 3 RBs in this draft class. However, several NFL sources have said that Mixon won’t be drafted at all. Mixon is an all-around great RB. He rushed for 1,274 yards this past year with a 6.8 YPC average and 10 TDs. Furthermore, he caught 37 passes for 538 yards and 5 TDs. At 6’1 and roughly 225 pounds, Mixon is a load to bring down and yet he plays so fast for someone his size. I expect him to run a 40 around the 4.48 – 4.54 mark. In the open field, Mixon is sure to make someone miss with his combination of spins or jukes or hurdles. He is an electrifying player who could very well push Washington off the roster due to his poor showing this past season. At his size, Mixon could be taught to be a great pass protector as well. I genuinely believe this man feels remorse for his actions and I think he would be an excellent addition to our backfield and might even push for some solid playing time during the season. Overall, Mixon is a great runner/pass catcher and doesn’t fumble much (looking at you Abdullah). He would be a steal at this pick.

Currently I am really drunk because I am unable to coop with myself for the first time in my life. I transferred recently from a community college to a very prestigious university (worldwide recognition) in California. I am going to go off on a huge rant, I was debating to post this to depression subreddit but thought this was better suited because i many of the things I'm about to say I am unable to confide in friends due to lack of close friends. Probably going to rattle off from most desire to get off my chest to least. Thank you in advance to everyone who replies in case I am unable to remember my newly made log in credentials.

1
I have the most caring and loving girlfriend in the world. She is truly an angel, loves me unapologetically, like true unconditional love. I've cheated on her multiple times and yet I can't break up with her. Her brother died in a tragedy and along with a whole bunch of family drama, I can't break up with her because I feel as though she needs me in her life to keep her emotionally stable. She's a smart girl, the relationship has been going for about three years, but I honestly stopped being fully committed after a year. Part of me wants her to be happy and not be depressed in the unfortunate life that she had. Another part of me doesn't want her to be happy with someone else. I don't know what to do, I am not looking for sympathy, only guidance. I realize how despicable I am, but I don't know how to approach it. In addition, she is taking care of my dog who I love very much. My dog was neglected by my brother, who I tried getting to take care of him before I went off to university, but he refused to. I truly love my dog but I know if I leave him with my parents he will be neglected due to their work schedule. She takes care of my dog, and loves him a lot. I would not shed a tear if she kept my dog after a break up because I would know he is being well taken care of. Sorry for the disorganization. 

2
I have very little friends. I had a very close knit of friends due to the sport we played together but after a year in being in puppy love, I lost the close connection to them. At university, I joined a fraternity, due to a friend from high school who pushed me into it, but got dropped almost at the end of the pledge process. Turns out I got dropped mostly because the person in charge of the pledge process had a personal dislike for my friend, primarily due to his lifestyle of doing drugs and having a poor GPA. He dropped me and tried having my friend dropped but failed because he was a more established member, unlike me. All the friends I had within the few weeks of college, all of a sudden vanished. I live in an apartment, barely off campus, but have unable to have a social life as a result. In highschool I have felt like an outcast before, but eventually I found friends due to the sport I joined. This is the most outcastish? ive felt in my life. 

3
Ive have almost no motivation to study for my classes. Admittedly, in community college, I developed an adderall habit, eventually going to the doctors to secure a prescription. I truly have ADHD, but adderall has not benefit for me anymore. I lost all motivation to succeed in my field of study, despite having taken 3 internships at the community college level while working and going to school. At the university I am at, it is a top school for my major, yet I feel no motivation to study for my midterms next week. Instead of studying, I chugged a bottle of wine. I literally hit rock bottom. I am ashamed of myself due to the economic struggle my parents faced to come to the USA to give me a better opportunity. I still face an economic struggle, but despite a better opportunity, I am wasting it away in self-loathing. My mother has a history of professionally-medical diagnosed depression but idk if thats relevant or not.

In sum, I truly feel like I hit rock bottom. So much opportunity but I don't try to accomplish anything. I am seriously in a bad place right now. I don't know what to do. If you think I am a piece of shit, seriously, let me have it. I need blunt truth.

5qsibb,2,2017-01-29,"Didn't get in ""trouble"" today, but I'm still angry. advice?",JuanTheButtPlug,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/5qsibb/didnt_get_in_trouble_today_but_im_still_angry/,"So to start off, I'm a 20 year old college student just trying to get some experience in the business world for when I transfer. So I decided to take an ""Internship"" with a certain amusement park for the next few months. Even though technically it's not counted as an internship even though that's how it was portrayed through my school. But I still decided to keep the job. I don't mind working and it's nice to have cash in my pockets to pay for things I want and just to save up. The issue I'm having is with the immediate expectations they are having. 
So my job is as an HR representative. At first I enjoyed it, it was simple, the days were quick and it was only paperwork standing between me and punching out. But because HR needs to set an example for every other department in this amusement park, we have to follow the rules to a T. Again, I don't mind it makes sense, which means, no phones out during work, name tags at all times and being diligent with your work. Again I can do that. If I feel I'm trained properly.
I am currently part time and am on the learning grade pay rate, which means for the first 100 hours, I get paid 0.50 cents less than I normally would if I were done with training. I'm only at around 65 - 70 hours or so. So I have a few more shifts before I get there. 
But my supervisors just compare me to the full time employees, especially the new ones who are done with the learning rate training and moved on. So whenever I come in and ask about a file or what is the best course of action after I've been gone a week for school, I feel it makes sense for me to forget a few things. Maybe I'm in the wrong though. 
Moving on, it feels like the supervisors are guilting me into more hours when I know my sheet says a maximum of 20 hours so I don't overwork my self with my studies. But my schedules are pushing close to 30 for the next few weeks. Honestly, that's just infuriating to me considering I have paperwork for this. When I brought it up, they said they don't really read those for work, so I would need to enter it online on the website. 
On top of this, most of my co-workers are middle aged while all of the college kids around my age are gone for the spring for their classes and don't start until summer. So I was thinking of asking for basic training so I can focus on the most important aspects of the job, while keeping my hours in a good place to allow me to focus on my classes and job. But after a previous conversation, it sound like if I were to ask for less hours, I could lose my job. Even though I promised them full time during spring break and the summer. 
Which brings me to today. Overall, today was just terrible. I skipped breakfast, I was almost late, and forgot my name-tag (big no no). I didn't notice until an hour before lunch when one of the supervisors asked where it was. It wasn't there so I had to use a back up and ended up using my lunch break to go pick up the original. I came back, an lo and behold I couldn't remember the password to my computer. So I asked if one of the supervisors might be able to access them. I was told none of them can and we have to wait for a certain tech department on Monday to unlock me. So now I'm locked out and starving. All while having to deal with people I can't process without a computer so I have to send them to my supervisor. Now I not only look lazy, I look inept at the job. But (and I refuse to take the blame for this), my supervisor still decided to keep me at the front desk to help process people. Why? I honestly don't know. I can't help, so why not send me back to do paperwork. Of course that doesn't happen until the last hour when were swamped and I can't do a damn thing. And here's the cherry. As the day was ending, I started looking for the shredding room, a location I was never shown yet, but couldn't find it. So I asked. I found it. I shredded.
End of the day comes, and my supervisor wants to talk to me. He say ""You're not in trouble."" Obviously I am if you pulled me away from everyone. He starts to bring up my day and how as HR we should never forget our name tags and our passwords. I will accept that, I made a mistake and messed up my training day. He then goes on to tell me it seems I haven't been putting in effort the last few days or today as well or that I can't find certain areas like the shredder room. Confused, I say that no one ever showed me the room, and that this is only day I've had issues with my password or name-tag. On top of that, I'm early to all of my shifts, my meals are never late, my paperwork is solid, I have never complaint at work and I still only have 65 hours worth of training in  3 weeks times. 80 after a month I think. So shouldn't it make sense for me to mess up a bit considering every coworker I work with is middle aged and full time. For them, HR is all they do, while I need it just pay for a few things. 
Honestly, maybe I am in the wrong and just wanted to rant. It's just that working at a place that seems simple but then feels like people are expecting you to fail in the matter of 8 hours is kind of demoralizing. But some advice or ideas on what my next course of action for this job so it lasts through my 4th semester and maybe then some would be greatly appreciated.  "
5qsil4,16,2017-01-29,"It's been a year with the sleeve for me, jotting down my thoughts and would love feedback.",IHadWLS,wls,https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/5qsil4/its_been_a_year_with_the_sleeve_for_me_jotting/,"Hey guys,

I had the sleeve done in January 2016.  I'm considering doing a regular AMA about it, just wanted to get your guys perspective first.  Your thoughts, questions, things that I could include and/or clarify in my 'diary', etc.

First, I should thank this community.  I lurked here and asked a couple questions on an alt, and you guys were very helpful.  It's been a year, and I am down to 250 pounds.  I can't even remember the last time my weight didn't start with a 3.

I'm a 23/24 year old male that weighed 375 pounds in January 2016.  I then had the sleeve done and a year later I now weigh 250 pounds!

**What is a Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Lap Band?**

The Lap Band is essentially an adjustable silicon ring that goes around your stomach.  It is slowly tightened with further appointments to allow you to get used to eating less.
The Sleeve is a similar idea, but a lot more permanent and 'head on'. A good chuck of your stomach is cut out and a smaller stomach 'pouch', or 'sleeve' is fastened.  Any food you eat is automatically slowed down. The first few months you are gradually re-increasing the size of your stomach.  Because your stomach is so much smaller, you feel full after a much smaller portion and you also stay full longer as the food goes 'down' slower.  The average amount of food is about a half sandwich now and I feel full.

**Why am I sharing this?**

I feel that Weight Loss Surgery (WLS) has a lot of preconceived notions about it that discourage a lot of people form looking into it. Some of it is true, most of it applies only to a certain type of surgery.  By no means is WLS a magical or 'cheating' way to lose weight while still eating crazy amounts of food.  And /r/loseit will gladly tell you that it's possible to lose weight without it. (Great community there by the way as well).  If you are new to losing weight there is no question you should be starting there - intake is most of the formula. If you can control your intake using their tips you will be well on your way to a healthier weight.

That said, some people can't do it. If you've given a fair shake and feel you need a tool, that is the point of the sleeve or lapband. (There is gastric bypass also and is a little more extreme).  They are tools to help you not feel hungry and control intake. Nothing more, nothing less.

I also met some people that clearly need other help: Chronic snackers. If you are literally walking around with a bag of chips in your hand most of the day, the Lapband or sleeve will not be as effective. The point is to make you feel full and NOT continue eating.  Slowly snacking all day bypasses the whole point of these operations.

##Life now:
[Chart because Reddit.](http://imgur.com/a/XtTwH)

No question I feel much better.  My feet problems alone are due to genetic issues and probably won't go completely away, but the difference I feel is amazing.  
I was on vacation for a few weeks that required hours of walking around - and I was able to take it like a champ, if I do say so myself.  125 pounds prior, there was no way in hell I would have been able to do it.

Clothing I've gone from a 4-5XL to an XL. It's amazing. I have a much larger selection on amazon. I can go to normal stores and buy in the normal section.  It's been way too long since I could just pick a pair of pants at a store.

The hardest part now, at least for me, is listening to your stomach and not your brain.  My brain will still insist that I must finish the plate. It will still insist that I should be hungry. It will still insist that I should go for seconds and thirds.  It will insist that I can't just accept that 50-75% of that awesome sandwich is enough.  You must eat the whole thing.  But I now have an easy tool to tell it to shut the fuck up.

Typical meals for me now:
* Breakfast: 1 scrambled egg with veggie sandwich (If thick bread, will only eat 75%) or 2 egg omelet with cheese and veggies - no bread.
* Lunch: 1 slice of pizza.  Or 1 health shake. Or bowl of soup and a couple crackers. Or a piece of salmon. Or tuna and some crackers.
* Snack: Handful of cashews. Or a kind bar. Or a cookie (occasionally).  Or a pear/apple. It's much easier to make some hunger pain go away with even a simple swig of diet snapple.
* Supper: Slice of meatloaf. Or piece of chicken. Or Salmon. Or Burger (Full w/o bun, or half w/ bun). Or large salad.

Long-term consequences:
* Change of appetite.  There were very few foods that I disliked before the surgery.  Now, there is a fair numbers that I simply don't feel like eating.  My feeling is these are food that before I simply was OK with, but now that I have to decide what to 'spend' my space on I feel it's not worth it.
* Very very occasionally carbonated drinks - even then let it sit in the cup and allow most of bubbles out.
* No drinking and eating at same time.  I couldnt imagine dealing with this, but the truth is you eat so little anyway its doable. A sip of water to clear your throat after the meal is fine. 
* 5 minor scars.

Prior story/and lightly-edited journal:

#Previous attempts and journey
I was always heavy, as early back as first grade.  I would run around, play some sports, but ultimately enjoyed sitting and reading or geeking on the computer more.  While I did not particularly eat unhealthy foods (e.g. soda was a rarity in my house), I simply enjoyed food.  Even if the food I was eating was 'meh', I couldn't stand the sight of not having an empty plate. (An interesting psychological note possibly, as my parents were not constantly telling me to finish my plate. I'm wondering if it simply came from being a standard statement on TV/kids shows and movies.) 

As I got older and actually attempted to lose weight, I noticed my big hurdle: I was always freaking hungry.  It didn't matter if I had salad or steak for supper.  Within an hour, I could eat the whole meal again.  As long as I wasn't stuffed, I could, and felt I should, eat.  Eventually I managed to get myself to mostly only eat at mealtimes.  But once I had an 'excuse' to be with food (i.e. eat a proper meal) I would be eating as much as possible, trying to push off hunger pains as much as possible.

Through high school and a couple years of college I had tried various diets and exercise. (Low Carb and Atkins come to mind).  They all did jack for one main reason - I was always hungry, and eventually I couldn't take it anymore. The most I lost by regular dieting (which was almost a year of mostly soup, salad and fish with at least some daily walking) was about 30 pounds.

Exercise was another issue.  You always walk around tired.  It doesn't matter what exercise you do, if even walking up a flight of stairs make you feel like you need to take a nap.  I also genetically have an issue with my feet that pretty much guarantees my feel will get sore easily.  The weight obviously makes it worse.

Both exercise and hunger being a hurdle for me made motivation from /r/loseit not last long.  It was a constant fight, and for me personally, I could not juggle it and life at the same time.

Bottom line, I felt I was done. I was too tired to exercise and was tired of the constant uphill battle to eat minimal amounts of food.  While on diets, I became grumpy and miserable from hunger pains all day, further reducing any extra exercise.  

#Spring 2015 (~375 pounds)
At this point I'm 20/21 and halfway through college. College would at least have the benefit of requiring significant amounts of walking as it's large campus.  Further, since I can't exactly walk around with a fridge I would be forced to make do with what was in my lunch bag or budget; therefore I at least saw some weight loss in college.  It was still maybe 10 pounds a semester and it would come right back in the summer.  In previous summers I worked with kids.  Some running around with them you would think I would lose weight, but sadly it was only a few hours each day - and even of that few hours there was only minimal running I could do before being totally winded.

#Summer 2015
My first proper internship. Sitting on my ass for 8 hours a day, no longer at least running around with kids outside. I realized this was it.  I'm approaching 400 pounds.  If I don't figure another method out, I'm doomed to have catastrophic health issues.  I already have feet that cause me pain and had slightly elevated blood pressure. Both my parents have diabetes and one parent has a history of heart disease in the family. Diets weren't working and I now didn't have energy OR time to exercise. (Time between the now 8 hour workday + other family obligations).

In short, I felt I was screwed.  

Finally, I asked my doctor about WLS, something he was hinting at me to do for a while already.  I had heard many mixed things about it.  I had known people who had done the lap band with many mixed results.  He said (knowing I research anyway) to read up on both the lap band and sleeve, and we would talk about it - that way I can get my questions out at once.  He also referred me to a hospital that has a whole program helping overweight people (not only surgery, diet plans and the whole nine yards).  

I read up on it, including reading probably this entire subreddit.  It sounded plausible.  I then visited the hospital.  Had a very nice sit down where they asked what I've tried doing and the like.  To be very clear - they did NOT push the surgery.  Surgery only became the sole topic once I basically said that if I tried another diet and failed I would probably totally give up. I did not have enough motivation left to continue this constant uphill battle by myself.

The next step was a seminar, given by one of the surgeons who does the surgery.  A chance to hear it straight from the 'horse's mouth'.  He told us he himself had the lap band.  He said a huge issue is the constant availability of food. If you are constantly hungry, why fight it? A couple taps on your phone and a few pies with thousands of calories show up at your door.  At this point I felt like he was talking to me - being always hungry was definitely the main issue from my personal POV.

*insert personal struggle about surgery vs. giving diets one more shot*

I decided to... heavily consider it.

#Fall 2015
I met with my Doctor and my main question (most were answered just by listening to the seminar and google) was lap band or sleeve.  Many sources say the sleeve is more successful, but is that anecdotal?  The lap band sounded safe and reversible in a worst case scenario.

He finally told me what probably finally made me go for it: With the lap band, about 50% of patients have issues with it.  While he feels most of the failures were simply probably not doing it right and following instructions (notably, the lap band requires many follow up visits to get it tightened), the simple number was that when it came to the sleeve *he didn't have single patient who failed*.  Sure it worked better for some then others. But they all lost a significant amount of weight.  

Surgery was set for January 2016.

In the interim was much paperwork with insurance and the like.  All that can be said here was I'm glad my hospital was a fairly big one - they knew all the details already, were very professional and communicative on exactly what was needed.  I also had to go to a couple other doctors to make sure previous health conditions wouldn't effect the upcoming surgery.  Finally I had to see a therapist to... I don't know. Make sure it wasn't all in my head?   (A supposed reason is lots of people have surgery for 'fun').

#2 weeks and two days prior.
Ordered a ton of fast food with a friend and stuffed our faces.

#2 weeks and one day prior.
Went to a restaurant with family and stuffed my face.

#2 weeks prior.
Diet begins mainly to shrink your liver.  Two weeks of soup, a couple cups of salad. Mostly protein shakes.  
This time period was not unbearable.  I had what to keep me busy (preparing for finals etc.) and this time period went by pretty quick. Also helpful, the protein shakes were surprisingly filling.

# D-Day January 2016 (Morning) (15 lbs lost)
""Holy crap where did the last two weeks go?  I'm really mutilating my body by choice? WTF is wrong with me? Augh I'm terrified."" 
These were mostly my inner thoughts. As they prepped me, this thought got louder. Finally being wheeled to the ER, which was freezing cold, mostly white and looked like a perfect GTA murder scene, it's a good thing they knocked me out quick - I was about 60 seconds from running away screaming.

# Night / Post Surgery
Woke up pretty groggy.  Felt pretty shit, usual post-surgery feeling. Only this time with added doubt if I did the right thing.  After about an hour or so in recovery chewing ice chips I was wheeled to my room.  Mouth was as dry as a dryer sheet.

Nurse was nice enough to retrieve my belongings - mostly being able to use my phone helped distract me from my stress.

Didn't really sleep much.  Every hour I woke up either because my heart decided to shoot up, triggering the alarm, or another patient in the room beeped for some reason.

Once I felt strong enough I asked the nurse to please let me go for a walk. Getting your legs moving right away was stressed, but mostly knowing they were working would help me feel relaxed - my head really was spinning at this point. She asked if she could take care of one patient first for a few minutes - no problem.  Once I finally walked down the hall and could feel everything else in place (also letting out a reassuring fart - really a good way to convince yourself your wiring is intact) I felt myself calm down.  Climbed back in bed.

# Next Day
Wasn't released until late afternoon.  As before, couldn't really sleep. Anxiety built up again, I just wanted my own damn bed.  I was thirsty, but strictly forbidden to gulp water as I was accustomed to. I could only very slowly sip water out of a shot glass (medicine cup).  Well that doesn't satisfy anything.  May as well not drink.  

Same when chicken soup came -- a couple of light spoons.  The speed at which you are allowed to drink was too slow for what I was used to and was driving me crazy.

Finally doctor said I have to commit to drinking enough or I couldn't be released.  Finally gave me some perspective on just how little I was drinking.

Anyway, finally drank enough, discharged, my own damn bed and teddy bear. I finally had a good sleep.

# Days 1-14
I'm not going to lie - I was pretty fucking miserable.  I had typical post-surgery doubt (seems pretty normal among many elective surgeries and definitely this one. I was ready for it but damn, your mind hates you sometimes).

Thin liquid diet. A little water.  A little chicken broth / tomato soup.  More health shakes.  

As before, it's not really *what* I was allowed to eat that bothered, so much as the speed.  Taking sips at a time was just never in my skill set and it honestly drove me crazy to get used to it.  Thankfully my mother is a pretty stubborn lady herself. (I don't know what I would've done without her).  To give an idea of the speed: Finishing 8 ounces of liquid should take you almost an hour in the beginning.

I really just didn't feel like eating.  It just didn't pay to eat - I wasn't that hungry and it was annoying to eat so slowly. Again, thanks mom.

I had some pain during this period. As long as I was occupied it wasn't really noticeable. Only at night when I was trying to fall asleep did it really bother me. But they give you decent painkiller and it knocks you right out. I've definitely had worse.

# Day 7
Post op check up. Stitches removed.  Nothing too exciting.

# Weeks 3-4
Pureed food, and can no longer eat and drink at same time.  Mostly had baby food, yogurt and more health shakes (also tuna, eggs, applesauce). Now that I was able to eat at a more normal speed (even now I still can't devour like I used to - which is a good thing) I really started to feel better and more like myself.

No pain at this point. I'm taking some walks albeit slower than normal.  Just taking it easy.

# Weeks 5-6 (30 pounds lost)
Soft solid food. Had chicken bits. Tasted like fucking heaven to be able to chew something.

(Soft veggies, meat, fish, pasta, thin turkey)

Was back to college now, I felt pretty 'tender' but took my sweet time getting around. Was a little challenging but overall doable.  I ended up dropping a class just feeling that I shouldn't be overworking myself at this point. Considering what I heard the workload of that class became, probably the smartest choice of this whole thing.

# Week 7
Honeydew! Crackers! God damn its good to be alive!

First throw up here was with salmon.  Just ate it too damn fast. (Hey - you don't eat salmon for 2.5 months and see if you don't devour it).  This sounds weird, but it actually feels... kind of nice to throw up.  When you eat to much/fast you feel like you can't breathe.  When you finally cough it up, you gasp air. Its a different kind of throw up from eating something funny. It's more like immediately throwing off a pokeball.

# 2 Months
Felt most of my strength back. Navigating college at normal speed. Eating my pathetic lunches in between class. Complaining about Professors to friends.  Yep, getting back to normal.

# 3 Months (65 pounds lost)
Took an 8-hour drive with some friends to visit another friend.  Felt good to be back behind the wheel.  Had homemade pizza, definitely felt like heaven. Chicken was still better though.

# 4 Months 
Salad! Yep, seriously.  This long for salad.  You would think I missed it, but not really. OK, maybe a little.

This is the point where I would say I felt completely back to normal.  The only thing I really couldn't have normally was carbonated drinks, so drinking only water and diet snapple took some getting used to.  I was approaching my finals for the semester, had upcoming internships and interviews to worry about it.  

Life was definitely moving on.

# 6 Months / Summer 2016 (Dropped to under 300!)
Pretty much all food is back on the menu at this point.  

# 7 Months: 100 POUNDS LOST!

I haven't had any throw up besides the time mentioned above.  Definitely came close a few times - it takes getting used to eating at the slower speed.  But a sip of water and slow breathing is generally enough to help clear blockage.

Further loss numbers:
9 Months: 111 pounds.
11 Months: 115 pounds.
1 Year: 125 pounds.

I've constantly been told to try and look for internships during the summer but to be honest I feel like I'm not really good enough to get through the interviews, but I'll give it a shot. I'm trying to get into Lockheed Martin this summer so if anyone that has been there before how deep do the interview questions get? What resources did you use to practice your coding? I'm currently in CS2 if that helps...so I'm familiar with some of the basic data structures from CS1 and the few sorting algorithms taught there, but I'm not sure what else I need to know. This is all assuming I can even get the interview(s), haha. Thank you for any help."

I took a lot of courses over the Summer at my community college as well as maxing out my credits each quarter. A big reason I'd like to graduate early is to save my parents money. They're paying for all my schooling and while they're willing to pay for all 4 years, they work really hard to send me to college (I'm the only person in my family that has gone to college), and the 35k saved would definitely take a load off their shoulders.

But at the same time, that means I have to make this Summer really count with an internship. I've already been rejected by 3 of the big 4, while I have a referral from Amazon and I'm waiting on  their response. I'm currently interviewing with a few other companies. My only experience on my resume is an IT internship for a big networking company that I've had throughout my freshman year, and a ""Software Engineer Internship"" at a local startup which pretty much was a ""get me coffee"" internship, but I guess I get the title. 

I'd really like to graduate early but if I don't get an internship this Summer, that means I'm going to be set back compared to the new grads that have 2 or even 3 SWE internships under their belt. 

I'm not sure what to do, other than if I get an Amazon internship I'll for sure graduate in 3 years.

Edit: I'd like to add that I'm looking at this purely from a practical point of view. That is, I'm not factoring in my ""missing out"" on college experience/friends at all. To be honest, I don't particularly enjoy being at this university, nor the people here, which is also a reason I load myself with course work to occupy my time. "
5qu4ry,1,2017-01-29,[Help needed] Studying film/tv in Canada,reagan918,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/5qu4ry/help_needed_studying_filmtv_in_canada/,"Hi there! I’m a 27 HongKonger who is interested in film and television. I am working as a website content writer in Hong Kong, but planning to have a career change. I want to be a screenwriter/director/producer. I’m thinking about moving to Canada, studying film/tv there, and hopefully get a job after my graduation.
 
For those who are inside the Canada film/tv industry, teachers / crew / production company etc, I hope you can help me with the following questions:


1/ Can you recommend a good film/tv school or program?
(I heard quite a lot of good things about “BCIT: Television and Video Diploma” and “Capilano University: Bachelor of Motion Picture Arts”. Is that true? Do I have a great chance to get into the industry after graduating from these schools? Is there any other good schools you would recommend?)
 

2/ Should I go for a diploma or a bachelor?
(I’m concerned about the years of study. Diploma takes 2 years while Bachelor takes 4 years. I thought that I should gain as much working experience as possible during my study, eg placement, internship, part-time job , in order to increase my chance to get into the industry after my graduation. I will need a working visa to stay in Canada after graduation, so I need to work really hard to build my network and prove to the employers that I’m better off than the local fresh grad….. and I need time to improve my English since it is not my first language. But Bachelor is way more expensive and time-consuming than Diploma. What do you think?)
 

3/ How is the film/tv industry doing in Canada? Is it hard for a foreigner like me to get a job there?
 

4/ Is there anything particular I should consider before going to Canada?
 

Some background information about me:

Age: 27

Language: Chinese and English (English is not my first language, but I have already taken IELTS and scored 7.5)

Credential: Bachelor degree, major in Chinese Language and Literature; Associate degree in bilingual studies; Certificate in Digital filmmaking

Film related experience: Started filming in 2012. Made a few shorts and entered some competitions, no award received though.

5qun6s,1,2017-01-29,How to get an internship with with my not so amazing set of skills in the Middle East?,jayrmh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qun6s/how_to_get_an_internship_with_with_my_not_so/,"Greetings All! I recently heard from a few friends (UK and US-based) about this subreddit and how it helped them for their internships and such, and upon reading a lot of them, I think you guys here are really awesome. I was not able to put together a lot of things (my incompetence I suppose), so I decided to ask my doubts here. 

I'm a Junior doing Computer Engineering at American University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates with a cgpa of 3.45, and so far all I know is a fair amount of C++, some assembly, some C associated with micro controllers, and CCNA networking academy course material. I had switched majors right before Sophomore year (From Interior Design), so I was not very much into this field for a years before this. In High School I loved computers, but my procrastination and lack of drive didn't get me any useful skills. I'm doing stuff in my free time, but I'm not sure what I should focus on to get Internships during this summer. I'm interested in Microsoft, then again any company really at this point because I want to know things but I couldn't find many opportunities in my region, mostly because I think I dont know where to look. 

That's all really, I'm not sure what I should be doing, I feel lost, but I'm willing to learn and apply myself now. I hope I'm not late to the party and look forward to taking any advice from you guys. Thanks!"
5qupa4,3,2017-01-29,A change of direction.,Reaper_of_Souls,YoureDoingItRight,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoureDoingItRight/comments/5qupa4/a_change_of_direction/,"So, first off: I just had another sleepless night and am currently running on a combination of coffee, cigarettes, Adderall, and Wellbutrin... but I *think* I've finally figured out how to use AutoModerator to set up the weekly thread. It was a lot easier than it seemed to be at first! Anyway, let's all hang in here until tomorrow and see how that goes, haha.

But I was so determined to figure this out on my own that I wasn't going to ask for help from anyone. When I went back to college two years ago, I was going for a minor in web design. I was a computer geek who knew nothing about computers, and an artist who had no inspiration to do art. It seemed like the right idea at the time? That was, of course, until I straight panicked one night and had to go to the university hospital for emergency Ativan. My anxiety was ten times worse when I attempted to take advanced web design online (and withdrew, then tried again the next summer, then withdrew again...) It didn't help that my GPA was a literal 1.99 and I had to bring it up to a 2.0 if I wanted to graduate...

But the crazy part is that even though I still haven't graduated, I completed my psychology major *four years ago*. And in the time since then, I've realized that while the majority of my Redditing is spent in some sort of emotional support position, I don't want to make a career out of it. I want something intellectually stimulating. Also something that will allow me to pay off the massive amounts of student loan debt I've incurred? Maybe I can do it?

So basically, I've been thinking instead of taking a last class, I should try and get some kind of CS internship for course credit. I don't quite have the academic background for it, but in the months before this summer before I could *get* that internship, there are certification exams I could take that would give me a leg up. This is something that could give me *real world career experience* that doesn't require a bajillion years of school. And I really want to do it.

Do any of you guys know anything about getting certified in A+, or other IT certifications? If so, which ones should I go for?"

Verification: http://imgur.com/JYp1Zws

I recently started producing music in August of 2016 after my internship. I used all the money I earned there to build a studio in the bedroom of my grandmothers house. I built my own PC and purchased a MIDI keyboard along with Ableton Live 9 as my DAW. It took while getting use to Ableton and learning how to  record in it. Since then, I have come quite familiar with the software but I know there is still a lot to learn. 

My musical background consists of self-taught guitar, piano, and small bit of drums(basic pocket stuff, like 3 drum lessons deep). I've played the guitar for about 7 years and piano for about 1 now.

****Personal Background stuff that might bore you**
****
I spent most my early adolescence with my grandmother and my middle school to mid high school with my mother. Dad, I just started getting to know. I have 2 brothers and a sister. Most the time I spent with my mother, we lived in a section 8 home. I remember hearing about Obama's win in 2008 and going home that night to no electricity and cold showers. We didn't always live like that, there were periods though where my mother might not have made enough to cover all the bills for that month. My step-father was a great man who unfortunately relied on alcohol after my step-brothers death. He passed back in 2014. I started college in 2012 majoring in Computer Science and I am in my last semester now with a job lined up in the upcoming fall. 
****
I will soon be having a significant increase in income and want to upgrade my laboratory(that's what I like to call it). So any advice on what I should get would be great. Now to let you know what I currently have:

A. Komplete Kontrol S25 MIDI Keyboard.
&gt;Which came with Komplete Select for free which includes Massive, Kontakt 5, and a bunch of other instruments. My friend suggest that I get Komplete 5 or 6, which I'll most likely do.

B. Custom Built PC.
&gt;I know there's some hate on PC's when it comes with producing, I get the same shit with my CS buddies and coworkers. I don't mind Windows and the issues that come about, as I can usually resolve them. Also can game on it :)

C. Sweet ass Fender Telecaster. link: http://imgur.com/STiCdrF
&gt;The first guitar I had I pulled out of a dumpster. I don't ever want to put this thing in a dumpster. My favorite piece of my lab.

D. Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Gen. 2
&gt;The first one I got conked out and they sent me another! Should I eventually upgrade this?

E. Ableton Live 9
&gt;I fell in love with this software and what it can do, I don't care that the interface is ugly, I think its beautiful.

That's about all I have used so far to create the music I have been making. I have made about 35-40 different things, thrown away most and kept 4 so far...lol

I have a friend who is going to mix and master these who currently produces EDM dance tracks. I have listened to his work and he is good at it. I plan on making more of a Rage Against the Machine, Cage the Elephant, Black Keys, guitar sounds with other midi instruments along with it. Should there be some things that he should learn when mixing and mastering guitars?(Don't really know much about those topics but learning) 

I am also a huge hip hop fan so I am trying to make something that sounds good that doesn't sound like a 2006 remake of a linkin park track. But I have been happy with the results so far! 

&gt;I am also working on a story script to go along with the project, so that I can include some parallels to my life in a way that is interesting haha. 

I am about 30% done I'd say and would like to know if should start doing something differently or should wait until I can purchase something. Until then, I'm still making art! Thanks for any help or assistance! I will post my final work here for anyone who is interested."

Having international experiences is a very crucial step to getting started in the work field. Here is my motivational letter, hope someone can correct it or give his/her opinion on it. Sorry if it is the wrong sub!

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to explore whether an opportunity might exist to join the internships program at the University of [Name University], England. The implied program would be the eight months’ internship starting in September 2017 until April 2018. My ambition to apply for the IT Network progamm is driven by the increasing importance of digital technology in a hyper-connected world. I strongly believe when given the opportunity to join the intense program the university offers, I will be able to gain an extensive knowledge base in the IT-field and enhance my English which is needed in this globalized world where borders are fading by technological advancements.

I am [My Name], I am in my final year of my studies Media Technology at the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, in The Netherlands.  During my studies I have had the pleasure to gain knowledge in the area of IT networking, IT security, server management, documentation and communication. These fields have been subjected to a lot of changes over the past years, which have given me the ability to tune very quickly into new challenges and adapt quickly to new surroundings and situations. I feel comfortable working both within a team environment as on individually basis. My focus is an international environment with several IT related projects. The program offered via this internship gives a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge in addition to the theoretical knowledge I will be gaining and already obtained during my studies. 

My ambition is to work in an environment that fuses together different perspectives to develop integrated solutions. Hence, the program the University of [Name University] offers would help me obtain various methods and creative techniques to better the IT-field. Finally, and maybe most importantly, I can see myself delivering significant value and results because of my commitment to achieve both personal as professional improvements which I will be doing with great perseverance 

Currently, the requirements for a successful completion of my internship would imply that I have to work every workday (Monday until Friday) and I would be needing a suitable working place at the University with a supervisor.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the possibility of entering the Internship program and look forward to hearing from you. Attached you will find my Curriculum Vitae for your viewing.

Yours faithfully,
[My Name],

Having international experiences is a very crucial step to getting started in the work field. Here is my motivational letter, hope someone can correct it or give his/her opinion on it. 

By the way, does anybody have a site where I can rent places for normal prices with furniture and not looking crap. And a good site where I can find internships?



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to explore whether an opportunity might exist to join the internships program at the University of [Name University], England. The implied program would be the eight months’ internship starting in September 2017 until April 2018. My ambition to apply for the IT Network progamm is driven by the increasing importance of digital technology in a hyper-connected world. I strongly believe when given the opportunity to join the intense program the university offers, I will be able to gain an extensive knowledge base in the IT-field and enhance my English which is needed in this globalized world where borders are fading by technological advancements.

I am [My Name], I am in my final year of my studies Media Technology at the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, in The Netherlands.  During my studies I have had the pleasure to gain knowledge in the area of IT networking, IT security, server management, documentation and communication. These fields have been subjected to a lot of changes over the past years, which have given me the ability to tune very quickly into new challenges and adapt quickly to new surroundings and situations. I feel comfortable working both within a team environment as on individually basis. My focus is an international environment with several IT related projects. The program offered via this internship gives a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge in addition to the theoretical knowledge I will be gaining and already obtained during my studies. 

My ambition is to work in an environment that fuses together different perspectives to develop integrated solutions. Hence, the program the University of [Name University] offers would help me obtain various methods and creative techniques to better the IT-field. Finally, and maybe most importantly, I can see myself delivering significant value and results because of my commitment to achieve both personal as professional improvements which I will be doing with great perseverance 

Currently, the requirements for a successful completion of my internship would imply that I have to work every workday (Monday until Friday) and I would be needing a suitable working place at the University with a supervisor.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the possibility of entering the Internship program and look forward to hearing from you. Attached you will find my Curriculum Vitae for your viewing.

Yours faithfully,
[My Name],

5qvfyi,43,2017-01-29,[NeedAdvice] I feel like i've wasted too much time and there's no way to make up for it. Can you help?,Rifferz,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5qvfyi/needadvice_i_feel_like_ive_wasted_too_much_time/,"  First, this may be a long read, but I will try to sum it up as much as possible. Second, this is my first ever post on reddit, so if there are any mistakes, please point them out and I will promptly change them.

  A bit of background: I live in Brazil, went to the USA at the age of 2, and grew up in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Had a very happy childhood, parents were great and supportive, always considered an excellent student, A's and B's. Studied up until the 4th grade, but then my mom came to brazil, dragged me and my brother with her, and everything went to hell. Divorced parents, emotional abuse, depression, and constant moving. I moved nine times in 3 years. My grades plummeted, never was able to keep up with the subjects being taught in class because of all the different school schedules, and I was severely depressed. At one moment I just didn't care anymore, I'd skip classes, not even bother to try to understand anything and stopped trying altogether. 


  My dad eventually came to Brazil to try to save what was left of his marriage but that was also terrible because he lost everything he was able to achieve in the USA. After a while he was able to make a steady income, and, because of his english, landed a job at GE in Belo Horizonte. When his financial situation was better, in early 2012, he told me to live with him because where he lived was better (Belo Horizonte, the city i still live in), more schools, more opportunities and all that. So i went, and started studying in a new school, but this time, i started when classes started and managed to stay a whole year in the same school! The problem was/is, that i had already screwed up in the earlier years. I didn't understand anything in Math/Physics/Chem, because of the huge gap created by leaving the US and the constant school transfers here. So i barely made it past the 8th grade (year 9). In high school, my dad put me in a school that also gave me a certificate in IT (we call it colegio técnico, for anyone wanting to search about it(i have no idea what it's called in english)), and i barely made it (was even held back in the 2nd year). I was able to make some money with an internship, but my contract ended in December.


  So, as of right now, I'm 18 years old, my dad travels constantly because of the company, and I stay alone playing videogames and eating poorly. I enrolled in some online classes but was never able to finish any of them, the main reason being videogames. I have nothing against playing videogames, I enjoy it, but it has a time and a place, not everytime and everywhere. All my friends are going to college and i'm the odd one out, with no prospects or goals in life, just living one day after the other. My brother is back in the USA, living with my grandparents, (he is a citizen by birth, 3 years younger than me) killing it in school, getting good grades and making connections, learning what i didn't. I feel really depressed, alone, and I know I waste time. I think to myself ""if only you could trade all those hours playing League of Legends for hours of studying, you'd be making it right now"". The problem is, I continue playing and procrastinating because I don't have any direction. For clarity, here in brazil we have the ENEM, which is the national high school exam. You do the test, and, depending on your score, you can choose what you want to major in and which federal or private university you will pursue that major. I did it once, flunked, and now I'm planning to do it again this year so I can finally get on with my life. The problem is, I need to study, and I have NO IDEA where to begin, which is one of the main reasons I don't start.
 

  So, after this rant, does anyone have any advice for what I should be doing? Which online classes should I take and where should I begin? Is there a way to go back to the USA? I've researched some visas but not thoroughly, so if anyone has some info on that, it'd be very welcome. Thanks in advance, everyone.

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"

5qwcci,17,2017-01-29,Need Advice on Career Path,ChemE_Throwaway,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/5qwcci/need_advice_on_career_path/,"I graduated in May 2015 with my B.S. (~3.65 GPA with 3 internships). I immediately started working for a large specialty chemicals company after graduation in a production/process engineer role. At this point I hate my job; but I'm essentially stuck for 3 years here, when my 401k will go from 0% to 100% vested. That means I'm over 50% through my stint in this role; the problem is that I don't know what I want to do next, and I'm terrified of starting another job I despise. If I can get an idea of my future career plans, I can start to focus on certain things at work to build a focused resume. I'm looking for advice from more senior engineers who have held and experienced multiple roles in industry, who can help point me in the right direction based on my interests.

Right now my role is sort of a hybrid production/process engineer role - I'm responsible for the day-to-day manufacturing and all that entails. Writing notes for operators every day, updating our OP's, providing 24/7 support, troubleshooting issues, participating in safety reviews (MOC, PHA, etc.). These are the tasks I hate, because they are not mentally stimulating and it feels like a non-engineer could do the job. It's also incredibly stressful and full of responsibility. The other half of my role is improving my processes. This is the part I enjoy, but it takes a back seat to the daily production obligations unfortunately. I love doing things like improving make rates (my favorite!), reducing costs, decreasing quality problems, etc. For example, we had a key growth product being produced in a 500 gallon reactor that we could not produce fast enough, and I increased the make rate by over 100% with zero investment (it actually made variable costs of the process cheaper and decreased quality issues). I started a capital project to improve it another 50%+. This earned us millions in extra sales and avoided having to toll the material! If I came to work every day and could be 100% focused on process optimization, I think I'd be happy.  

I have some lean training under my belt, and I use lean tools to improve my processes. I enjoy having experience to a wide variety of tools for process improvement, and enjoy reading books like *The Toyota Way*. I'm also the 5S leader for my department, which is so-so, but I don't think it should be an engineer's responsibility. I'm part of the way through my green belt project, so I don't know how I feel about six sigma compared to lean. All in all, I would be willing to consider a black belt type role.

The monotony and simplicity of many parts of my job makes me miss the mental stimulation of school, although I was never in love with being a student prior to graduation. I'd be open to getting advanced degrees if a company pays for it. I don't think a chemE PhD is in my future though...I don't like chemistry enough, and it seems very chemistry-oriented (the more chemistry classes I took, the less I liked it). The parts of school I loved were classes like junior lab and senior design. Even though I was only in the top 1/3 of my chemE class, I was hands-down one of the best at project type work (I have good technical writing/presenting skills which helped).

As far as industry goes, I don't feel fulfilled working in specialty chemicals. I don't see how it makes a very positive impact on society. Something like alternative energy, biopharm (I was interested in this particularly in college), pharma, etc. would probably be more rewarding to me. I want to know that I'm working toward making the world a better place, whether it is fighting global warming or preventing diseases.

My biggest fear right now is winding up at another job I hate. I want to be confident when choosing my next role, because I can't imagine continuing my 20's working in jobs and for companies I can't stand. Right now it seems like I might be happy moving to a process engineer or black belt role; but maybe they would both be terrible fits. Something like a pilot plant engineer or similar role that works on scaling up products or testing new processes could also be fun (I interned in a pilot plant). I'm sorry for the short novel, but if anyone could help point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it. I know that at the end of the day it's up to me to figure out where to go, but there may be jobs or industries I'm not aware of that I would fit into."
5qwsef,3,2017-01-29,Free Fall,Archwizard_Drake,SupersRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/5qwsef/free_fall/,"*[Quinn](https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/5m5f25/quinn_carnahan_aka_fathom/) always hated the feeling of falling.*

*The sheer terror setting in before any other reaction or conscious consideration of why. That powerlessness as your body sinks, while your intestines rise weightlessly in a desperate, pointless attempt to turn back time, still dragged down with the net your skin creates. The atmosphere rapidly becoming cold and sharp, as slight particles in the wind form obstacles against you, enough to knock the wind out of you yet not enough to slow you down. The instinctive flailing to grab something,* anything, *to stop yourself, but only grasping empty air.* 

*In a way, it was just like his anxiety attacks, except in physical terms, very* **real.** 

*It started out like any other bout of ‘heroics’. A walk through the Commercial District looking for an internship opening. An elderly woman’s purse gets snatched. Hood up, goggles on.*  
‘*Standard strategy 1: Portal to solid surface, portal in front of thief. Crash, collect, return.*’  

*Today’s thief, however, was a speedster. Less standard, especially when he’s quick enough to dodge the broad side of a building… or run up its side without losing traction.*  
‘*Modified strategy 2: Chain the tunnels to ascend the building internally several floors at a time, meet thief on the roof, repeat 1. Caution: Avoid workers.*’  

*The building in question was easily 30 stories, probably more; took a few tunnels to get up, and Fathom wasn’t really counting. He beat the thief up by stretching his tunnels as far as he could, although he was somewhat short of breath when he got there. He tried to lift the floor out from under the thief, but he simply side-stepped the portal. Then came the rush – Fathom wasn’t much of a fighter, but the thief charged straight for him, and the studs on that purse would have made it an effective flail.*   
*Quinn had always heard that adrenaline made you feel like time was slowing down around you, although he’d never heard about that faraway ticking sound. Still, he didn’t need to be faster than his attacker to dodge, if he could see him coming. He dipped back, opening a portal to catch him.*

*That feeling again. It seemed to last forever, but so did everything else; he couldn't even force himself to breathe in that time. While his head was still clear, he knew he would be right-side up in just a moment.*

*He deposited himself behind his assailant, hoping to catch him by surprise. What he* hadn’t *counted on was his attacker spin-attacking, like a cheap video game character. What he didn’t* consider *was that the thief had just come up the roof, and was still very near the edge.*

*He had just enough time to grab the purse as it hit him square in the face. He tumbled over the side of the building. The attacker was stronger than he looked; the purse straps were not.*

*Silver lining, he retrieved the purse.*

*He had considered a scenario like this before, probably a year back now. Standard strategy: One tunnel to send him back up, using the acceleration of gravity to counter his upward momentum; another to catch him at the top of his arc and deposit him safely nearby. It should have been easy.*   
*When the moment came to it though… shock set in, and his mind blanked. Whatever 'adrenaline rush' he'd been using had burned out; even if he'd remembered his escape plan, he was moving too fast to put it in motion. He had a few moments to glimpse around, spotting no other rooftops in range, his senses overwhelmed as the world moved around him so quickly. Vertigo.*

*And that feeling again. He subconsciously hoped it really would last forever – because the pavement below looked quite coarse and he was not looking forward to meeting it.*  
*He covered his face with his arms, squeezing the purse. He wasn't even sure he had time to scream aloud.*

*No snarky comments this time, just a* ‘*FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-*’ *as he accepted this was the end.*

*Does someone care to prove him wrong?*"
5qwt4s,5,2017-01-29,My husband's [27M] relationship with his coworker [25F] makes me [26F] uncomfortable. Should it?,auroraboracuda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qwt4s/my_husbands_27m_relationship_with_his_coworker/,"Hi Reddit,

My husband (I'll use John) and I have been married for two years. When we were engaged, he was still in a grueling grad school program that took up a lot of his time. He was also a member of a professional club where he met a girl that we will call Anne.

With about 4 months to go until our wedding, John was spending a lot of time at school studying, but he was also spending time with people from this professional group. One day I noticed that he was frequently getting tagged in pictures with Anne, just the two of them.

I didn't know this girl. So... I snooped. His facebook was signed in, and I found messages between him and Anne where John talked about giving her a back massage (or getting one? I can't remember now), but it seemed inappropriate to me. I confessed to John that I had looked at the messages after seeing pictures of the two of them. I have a hard time remembering, but I think he changed the subject, and I didn't want to push.

After this conversation, he removed the pictures of the two of them. Unfortunately, I kept snooping and found that he was also deleting all of their text messages. They would text probably three times a week, but I never knew what they were about and didn't want to say anything because I shouldn't have been looking.

We got married. Several months later I did confess to looking at his texts and asked why all of his texts with Anne were deleted. He said that he knew I didn't like her and deleted them so I wouldn't be upset. I said, ""I'm upset that the texts are deleted. If they weren't, would I still be upset?"" He maintained that he only deleted them because he knew I didn't like her and didn't want me to know that they texted. 

After this conversation I didn't bring it up again, even though I felt it was very unresolved and that there must be something I don't know for sure. I checked his phone occasionally, and it seemed that their communication was becoming more infrequent, but he still deleted the messages.

John now has a job at a hospital near the school that he graduated from. He went in to his office to do some work this weekend, and I tagged along. Apparently, Anne got an internship at the same hospital because John and I were both working on our computers when I heard a, ""Hey, what's up?"" I turned around to see who it was, and saw Anne. 

She looked surprised that it was me instead of John's office mate, but she offered a, ""Hey, how are you?"" and I replied, ""Good. How are you?""

Keep in mind that we've never actually been introduced, and we also were not introduced then.

She ducked out pretty fast, but then John asked her a question about what shift she was working. She she popped back into view. To me it appeared like she was seriously blushing. John appeared normal. 

So after that, I felt upset because I didn't know she worked there, and it seems that they have a close enough relationship that she would just pop by his office. I doubt that anything is happening now, but I have this nagging feeling that something did happen in the past. 

Should I bring this up again to my husband? Should I just accept it and not say anything since it seems to be in the past for John? Should I say something to Anne? I am planning to try to forget about it, but I just have a bad feeling.

  ---   
  tl;dr My husband tried to hide the friendship (but maybe more) that he has with his coworker. Should I ask him about it, or am I being paranoid?"

So here are my questions:

Will my lack of experience prevent me from getting an internship? 

Should I email companies/apply for internships that are out of my state? I'm in Chicago so there arent that many game developers here.  If I were to get an internship out of state,  would I have to pay for my own rent and food? 

Lastly,  if I have no games to show and little programming experience, how do I convince companies to take me on as an intern?

While many of the faculty received doctorates from very prestigious schools, few of them have ever held a job as a day-to-day programmer or data scientist and have spent their entire adult lives in academia. 

I am now a junior and I feel like I'm doing all the right things. I have a good internship, I do side projects, but I often feel I am incapable of talking to my professors in any meaningful way. I feel this is somewhat related to the fact that I am an older student coming back for a degree and approach the topic more as a tradesman then an academic. 

Whenever I ask about the practical application of an algorithm/data structure/(CS Topic), I am often greeted with a blank look or told that self-research would be better suited to finding this out. (To be clear, I generally ask this after the end of class in an attempt not to derail the discussion or plan for the class.)

These people are highly educated, but I feel there is some sort of knack to understanding and communicating with them that I do not have. Does anyone have any tips or advice for communicating with highly educated academics?"

I am also versed in Python, Java and Ruby, and working on my skills in C++. I hope to land another internship this coming summer, and I also have a couple of projects as well as coursework on my Github. I am also relatively well versed in personal computer hardware as I have built many PCs and done basic repairs.

I am thinking I may try to work in the US for a few years after school to save money and try to pay off by student debt a bit before attempting to move. My aim would be to bring over $10,000 USD with me into Canada, bare minimum.

I am a native English speaker, but speak no other language fluently, only beginner-level Spanish. I know I would most likely have to learn French, especially if I end up in Quebec. This would ideally be a permanent move.

I'm an undergraduate computer science student and I'm attending my first job fair this upcoming month in hopes to get an internship. At first I was really excited seeing all the companies that will be attending the job fair until the shock hit me; I don't have a resume!

If you search my post history you'll see I've been in retail management for the same company for 3 1/2 years now well I attend college. I do have my associates degree from the local community college (my GPA was only a 2.9 I believe) which seems to have put me ahead of my class a little bit at my new college. None if this really helps me stand out on my resume though! I have zero professional programming experience and figured an internship was the point in starting that experience!

I can't help but worry I'll be overlooked by anyone and everyone around me! This is my first semester learning things like git and working with external APIs in a school environment. I have done some silly side projects myself but nothing to write on a resume! 

Well typing this is figured I should put some of my programming knowledge so here it goes. I've worked in c++ for both years in community college so I have a strong grasp on that, I learned MIPS Assembly using the Mars simulator in community college for our hardware class.

Didn't look at the assignment until just now and It's due tonight. All of the other assignments were doable on my own and short. When I was thinking of how I could accomplish this assignment without lying the only thing I could think of was a forum somewhere and then it hit me. Reddit. Also after reviewing the rules of this page I think it fits under the survey section rule meaning to share the results.

I've applied to about 125 places in the past month and have only really heard back (in a good way) from 2 places (1 of which only feels like a legit company). I currently go to a reputable school in the southeast, but have family close to NYC so I'd like to move there if possible. Everyone says to go to tech meetups, however that's not really an option for me since I live nowhere near NYC at the moment. I have internship experience and plenty of side projects, plus leadership experience in CS related clubs if that helps."

5qyb2p,0,2017-01-29,apple store employees - current and former - what are your experiences?,evaxuate,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5qyb2p/apple_store_employees_current_and_former_what_are/,"i am about to be a freshman in college and most of the schools i've applied to have an apple store very near to the campus. i am hoping to work at one, as i am very passionate about apple as a whole. 

for the past four years i haves worked for a small business called the Mac Ranch, which is basically a tech support/troubleshooting/repair shop - essentially like a mini apple store without the retail sales. i am the only employee; my boss is a longtime friend and mentor of mine. over the years i have learned much about tech support, including how to teach people the works of their devices, assistance both over the phone and in person, fixing various hardware issues in apple computers (such as faulty displays, failing hard drives, etc.) and working out software bugs in iOS/macOS as well. i take some coding classes at my high school but am more interested in the hardware/repair type stuff rather than writing programs. i am paid, not an intern, but it's based on hours spent on a project instead of hours at work every day. 

i consider myself to be well-versed in apple support; i have helped many people with their issues over the years and also made countless upgrades and repairs to devices of my own. overall i'd say hay as a high school student id be qualified to work at a store from the experience standpoint at the very least. i still have a lot to learn of course, but i have a great understanding of the basics and some other more advanced parts of apple products and service. anyways, i have some questions: 

•what is apple's minimum hiring age? i am seventeen now and will turn eighteen in september. 

•are hours known to be relatively flexible? as a college student i won't have *all* the time in the world but would love to work a pretty good amount. 

•does it pay well, or should i say well enough for a low-income freshman in college? i'm not looking for a huge salary or anything and would honestly be content with anything that is enough to get by. 

•did you/do you enjoy working there, and are there any experiences that stick out? 

•any advice for interviews, and general tips on how to get started with all this? 

as a sidenote i will be potentially majoring in some type of computer engineering so this will fit my career nicely. 

**tl;dr:** i'm an incoming college freshman with a good deal of experience with apple repairs and troubleshooting and am hoping to work at an apple store. anything i should know about it beforehand, and is it a good idea at all?
 
i browse this subreddit daily and i would also love to hear some feedback from you guys. thanks in advance! :)

Now that I'm getting more into the back-end and programmy side of things, I'd like to understand what this all means since it seems like basic knowledge to some. 

Can someone recommend a good MOOC (something on coursera, edx, any of those) that will provide me with this knowledge?"

What would be the best country to aim for in the areas mentioned in the title for truly immersing oneself in learning a new language and culture, but without significantly diminishing one's career? Are there countries, or areas of countries, I should avoid looking into in the first place because of potential tension (even if unwarranted) between natives and immigrants (including legal)? Should I seriously consider taking a small trip to a country or two in Europe or Asia before really even making serious efforts to consider moving, let alone plan?**

A bit of **academic and work background**:

* current undergraduate student nearing his final year of college in electrical engineering and computer engineering. 
* My primary concentration is in embedded systems design/IC design in particular. I go to a pretty awesome state school in Raleigh, NC that, fortunately, has a decent study abroad program. Unfortunately, I have never participated in it and it's arguably too late for me to participate in it (the program is mostly designed for rising sophomores and juniors). 
* I've only worked an internship in my field of study at a well-known electronics company that calls the RTP area its home.

A bit of **personal background**: 

* Naturalized U.S. citizen (along with the rest of my immediate family). 

* First-generation immigrant, I believe, having originally been born in India and also a holder of OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) due to India not allowing dual citizenship constitutionally.
* Fully fluent in English (my ""first"" language) with working proficiency in French, Telugu, and Hindi. 
* Also, a pretty hard worker, but there's probably plenty of folks like that.


It should be noted that, given certain mentions in my personal background such as the OCI or some fluency in French, I do not necessarily want to go to France, French-speaking Belgium, etc. Also, I do not really need advice on going to India or potentially settling down in India as I have plans already to at least revisit the country once in awhile to catch up with my grandparents. 


**My objective?** It seems simple in my mind, but maybe it's far from simple in reality. Go to a country where I can find a job suitable to my skillset, or perhaps has a university with streams of study suitable to expanding my skillset, and truly immerse myself in the language and culture of that country.


**Why?** I love learning languages, or at least the idea of learning languages, and probably need a change of environment after living in the same part of the continental U.S. for the past decade or so. Even better if I can expand my career as a result of moving, though from what I understand that's unlikely (I don't mind as long as I can maintain my career at the least). 

**Budget?** I have approximately $7K in savings and could easily increase that to at least $10K or more within the next year. Also, I would be very surprised if my parents would not be willing to help me financially (temporarily).

**Specific countries?** Denmark (I have a pen pal here who I hope to speak to soon for some advice), France, Germany (two good friends here who previously attended the same university as me but returned home), the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland (If I were to be honest, I don't even have a single friend on the Internet from here compared to the aforementioned countries), Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Nepal (probably very, very hard to find something relevant to my skillset here), and Thailand. 

**So, any advice?** 


If I were to be honest, I haven't done much investigation into actual visa policies (outside tourist visas) or whether it would be better to seek a job at an international company with some operations in the U.S. and then request a transfer. I should also repeat that the study abroad program my university provides is really not tailored for me at this point, and arguably would hinder my four year graduation or be useless towards academic progress if I were to do it after I graduate (I also don't think I would be eligible at that point).


Thanks for any help or nudges towards resources.

EDIT: Reformatted a bit. Also, **please** note that my reasons for wanting to move have little to nothing to do with the now past U.S. Presidential Election, escaping debt, or anything of that sort. I have a plan figured out already to pay off the relatively small student loans I will have after graduating, on the latter note. I simply want a much different change in environment, particularly one that I could immerse myself in to learn a language."
5qyi6j,1,2017-01-29,sexist parents and no recognition for my hard work,pin3appl3ba3,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5qyi6j/sexist_parents_and_no_recognition_for_my_hard_work/,"To start, I’ll just say that I'm an eighteen-year-old female from a South Asian country.
My parents are super traditional. From when I was a toddler, my dad has been telling me that I should have been killed when I was born. I distinctly remember him getting drunk and beating me often. Once I asked him if I could sleep over at another girl’s house. I started crying saying it was unfair that my brother could do so but I couldn’t. He flipped me over on the marble kitchen floor and started punching and kicking me. Along with that, I was never allowed to hang out with other children in general. I would go weeks and months without seeing or playing with another kid my age. My parents told me that they didn’t have friends so neither did I. I now have trouble communicating and with my self-confidence. Moving aside from that, my dad has followed my mother to work (to make sure she wasn’t with another man), slapped her so hard that she had to go to the ER because she couldn’t hear out of one ear, and held up knives/thrown shot glasses at her. She now has an incurable neurological condition and sometimes I wonder if it was caused by trauma from getting slapped. And obviously, she condones all this because of the sick society that we come from. It’s wrong for her to leave him and I totally understand that because they’re afraid of being judged. Neither of them are open to change. Due to this, I never get to hang out with friends. I got molested by a family friend when I was a kid, but I never told my parents because I knew they would blame me. I was suicidal AF because I felt like I did something wrong, but my parents are just assholes. When I joined an extracurricular activity for the first time, my dad claimed that I was just being a slut at school. I’m not allowed to wear shorts or dresses or skirts. I’m eighteen and they still won’t let me go to dances. My parents always claim that I’ll run away with a black/white guy and get pregnant. He’s racist too, my dad is a Trump supporter, but that’s another issue. I’m secretly dating a guy right now, but I’ll get into that later. I’m probably going to be forced into an arranged marriage or something. I don’t even know. I can’t process this all. I’ve seen family members back in the homeland get murdered for marrying guys they truly loved though. The parents gladly will go to jail because their daughter destroyed their honor or something ridiculous. My parents praise these people. 
I've always been a good student. The thing is, I did it without anyone ever telling me that I needed to do it. In elementary school, my English wasn’t too great (I can speak four languages now). I struggled at first. I think I somehow used competitivity to fuel me and get past my home life. Getting awards and recognition kind of made up for my mom calling me fat and ugly and my dad calling me useless and stupid. This changed in middle school where a few of my teachers started grading me based off favoritism and I started to get bad at math (I’m currently taking calculus, but I was getting F’s on tests so I was underperforming compared to my classmates who were understanding the content more quickly than I was). I never got anything lower than a B, but I would often get C’s on assignments just because I was a quiet girl. This crushed my confidence even more. Meanwhile, I was in a shitty school district. I found out about a top school that was not too far away and applied for an interview and crap. Another kid plagiarized my essays along the way, but I still got in, in the end. I thought going to the top school in the state would change everything for me. I was wrong. I was so sad about life at home that I started dating a senior as a freshman. He was fine before he got abusive after his mom died while we were dating. I did drugs, had sex, all that crap. My parents never found out. And again, I never got anything below a B, but my GPA was destroyed by the end of that year. My genius friend died unexpectedly at the end of the year and he would always tell me to get my life together, come and study with him before school, work past everything, etc. He was the true MVP, but I ignored him throughout the year. After he died, I was super crushed so I ended up following his advice. I got involved in extracurricular activities, raised myself up to the top 15th percentile of my class, took up internships, took a bunch of AP classes, and stuff. I rarely got sleep and I worked my ass off. Except I never got recognition. I never raise my hand in class, I’m not confident enough. Until I was told how my GPA compared to other kids, I thought I was behind. I still feel dumb because I failed some of those AP exams… yeah. My excuse is that I didn’t get enough sleep and I was traveling to competitions the week before, but it’s probably because I’m a useless piece of trash. I doubt I’ll get into a good school. I don’t think it matters because my dad might not let me leave the house. I’ll never get senior student of the month because I’m dumb I guess. I’ll never become an engineer because I’m dumb. I think my teachers hate me. I cried about who to ask for a letter of recommendation for hours because I’ve never gotten any award so they must think I’m not good enough. I don’t know. I’ve missed over twenty days of school this year and I just don’t feel like going back. I feel like the twelve-hour days of school that I put in weren’t worth it. But they prevented me from going home so that was okay... I don’t even know. I have a clear career path that I want to pursue, but I doubt I’ll get enough money or admission to a good school out of state so I can get away from my family. They prevent me from going to the doctor’s too (I have health problems). I don’t know how I can fix that, I’ve asked counselors, but they don’t give me specifics and no one has ever taught me anything about insurance and stuff. I feel overwhelmed. My dad says I probably won’t get through college anyway. I’m lost.
This is kind of turning into a sad train wreck of words. My mom makes six figures and my dad doesn’t make shit so I don’t even understand my family. My mom claims to love me and says that I don’t spend time with her, but I’m sick of getting insulted every second of the day. I don’t know how to deal with anything. I have a boyfriend who’s white and he doesn’t understand why his parents can’t meet mine. I’m afraid his parents will judge me. They probably don’t want their son dating a piece of scum like me. People at school treat me like I’m dumb and my mom says I’m ugly even though I’m not. I had an eating disorder and there’s more crap that I could’ve mentioned, but I can’t even think straight right now. I don’t know if everyone lives like this or if I’m just being overdramatic. Although I’m sure most eighth graders don’t write their mom’s resumes and crap. I’m pretty sick of life. Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh. I just hope I can get into college with scholarship money. That’s all I can depend on right now and it’s killing me. I don’t know how to get away from my family. I don’t even talk to my dad anymore. I haven’t seen his face in weeks. I don’t want to talk to anyone. I just can’t stand living like this, being treated like crap for being born a certain way.  "

A little background:

I am 22 years old and I graduated with a BA in Biological Sciences with a Spanish minor. I decided that I hated biology, but graduated with the degree. I took a recruiter job with a staffing agency back in June 2016 and hate everything about it. Now, I am back in an online program for a BS Computer Science degree. It's supposed to take about 2 years to complete (flexible to complete, but this this makes the most sense for me). I'm only in the intro course now (C++ / Intro to Computer Science). I have 3 more terms for this year, and then it starts again with 4 more terms the following year.

So, 

* What is your advice on getting internships/jobs prior (and post) graduation? 
* What things can I be doing now in order to amp up my resume/portfolio for future reference?
* What can I be doing on the side to even make a couple extra dollars now/near future?
* What do companies look for in CS interns? Is it specific?

Thanks for any advice! I'm really trying to take this seriously and get the best advantage I possibly can now and post-graduation.

In these parallels, people have lived their lives completely normally, not questioning the possibility of other worlds just like their own. These stories are from one such world-One where the enigmatic ""Facility"" is nothing to the people of Hawkridge, Washington, but a rumor. A myth. A story passed from person to person to scare each other. To dare to imagine the fantastical and terrifying could exist right under their noses. Little did these people know how right they were...*


***THE FACILITY-1983***

***CHAPTER FIVE-DOWN UNDER.***

...

**NOVEMBER 6TH, 1983. 12:36 PM.**

*The town of Hawkridge has changed. As the darkness maintained its icy grip upon the town, various residents have started to uncover some of the secrets hidden just underground. It seems that a much more sinister plot has been brewing in the town, with something far deeper and…stranger than just a simple murder. The storm that had been brewing over the past few days climbs past the shore at last, blanketing the town with a heavy rain.*

****

**The Facility.**

*Agent Blake Carter walked down the twisting hallways, speaking into a walkie-talkie.*

Phil. I’m done fucking around, alright? I’m making the call. Those brats made their way in here somehow.

…

How am **I** supposed to know!? I know I sent them back. They…must be from another timeline or something…that’s the only possibility I can think of. This has gotten far out of our control, Phil. We need the big guns. I’ll meet you at the office in 10. Be there.

…

Oh, it is? Got it. I’ll avoid the train, then. Oh, and do something about those Brothers, alright? I think they both know too much. Better bring them in. See you.

*He clicks off the walkie, and boards an elevator.*

God, I hate this job.

****

*Rick has entered the Facility, taking an Intern in the elevator he found as his hostage. As the two step out into the bustling area, Rick would feel compelled to look around. It looked a bit like an airport terminal, with people in lab coats everywhere walking around and talking to other people. Occasionally a few sharply dressed people could be seen too, talking to others in the distance. However, the strangest thing about all of it is that physically, this looked impossible. There's no way that this could exist structurally under the town...Yet, here they were.*

** **

*Rita and David would find themselves in a similar situation, after taking the elevator they found in the woods where Rick was. As the doors open in front of them, they too would also be wowed by the sights. After gaining their surroundings, David looks to Rita.*

Well, what should we do now?

** **
*Jack would find himself backed up against a chain link fence in his attempt to escape the beast that was chasing him. With nowhere left to turn, he would have no choice but to brace for another attack. To his surprise, a blinding light would come out from in front of him, behind the beast. The beast stops their attack, howling in pain as it runs off. Before Jack could say thanks to the person who saved them, He would be knocked out by the butt of a Rifle.*

*Brandon would later find a note by his bedside. It had a picture of his brother knocked unconscious and bloodied, and read:*

**If you ever want to see your brother alive again, come to Mercury Park at 12:00. Come alone.**

*When he arrived there, he would hear the clicks of countless guns from all around him. A woman’s voice calls out from the shadows. By her tone, it was obvious that they weren’t messing around with him.*

Hands up. You’re coming with us.

** **

*Lindsy and Digis would find themselves following the man who ran away from them, without many other options to pursue. Eventually, they would reach a Cave. For some reason, cool air was emanating out of the entrance…*"

I had a meeting with the owner of a very small engineering company today, regarding an internship opportunity for myself, and this is what he wants me to do. He doesn't like the idea of spreadsheets given how easy it is for them to be manipulated and how tedious it can be to input large equations and actually read them within excel. He suggests that I look towards some form of programming to be able to provide solutions to relatively basic mechanical engineering problems (i.e. the loads acting on ships etc). I don't have a massive amount of programming experience other than some basic C++ and MATLAB. So, given the above, what would you guys recommend that I look into? Ideally I would like something which isn't over complicated.

Thanks in advance! 

edit: Thanks so much for the great responses guys! You have helped me a lot!! Given the company I would be interning for is quite small, I presume they would want to minimise licencing costs, and so I am currently leaning towards python. "
5qzos1,1,2017-01-30,M4M/M4T/M4Futa - the Alpha Apocalypse,Subboytoy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5qzos1/m4mm4tm4futa_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you. 

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people. 

I should be getting ready for work or school.  Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. *Holy fuck, its true!*

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha? 

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks: 

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured. 
 
 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug. 

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down. 

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg. 

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

For all of 2016, I worked night shift at a hotel full time 11pm-7am while also doing full-time school and an internship. The fluctuating hours and lack of sleep killed my social life and mental/physical health. Only sleeping a couple hours at a time made me irritable and depressed. I never spent time with friends because if I was awake I was working or doing schoolwork.

About a month and a half ago, I quit this job because I thought I found a new opportunity where I would be able to work during the day that would fit in with my schedule. A local restaurant would be opening a new location right on campus and would be able to work around my school/ internship schedule while giving me sufficient hours to live. However, due to construction being delayed, I am getting so few hours that I needed another job until March. 

I convinced my old job to hire me back on part time, but now I am going to be juggling 4 different schedules. Tonight I am working 11-7, then sleeping an hour, then working 9-2, then going to school at 3. Next day I have internship hours and then school again. I know this is only temporary, but I just don't know how I am going to survive the next 2-3 months, especially because I was so miserable last year. 

Any advice as to how I can make the best of these next couple months?"
5r02mo,202,2017-01-30,Gendernomics: A Woman's Resume,Blacklabellogics,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5r02mo/gendernomics_a_womans_resume/,"About twice a year I have the questionable pleasure of having a stack of resumes land on my desk courtesy of the HR department. Over the years I've developed an approach to getting this task over with as fast as possible, and saving myself from having to read letters of motivation that are written in a Buzzfeed style of prose. You can tell a lot about a personality from their resume, how did they organize their information? What did they leave off and what are they highlighting? The random information such as hobbies, date of birth, marital status, often adds more information about the personality and their perspective.

Usually people try to hide gaps in their resume, for instance by leaving off months so that it does not say in black and white that they had a 6 month gap between engagements. They add tasks or responsibilities that they did not have, or they may attempt to gloss over the fact that they never finished their degree. What was different this year is that as the pile landed on my desk I was mulling over some future Gendernomics articles that I was considering, and it dawned on me that the manner in which I examine and judge resumes could be very useful when looking for plates or a long-term partner.

After all, when one is in the information gathering phase of a relationship with a new woman it is in your best interest to find all the relevant information and unearth all the red flags that are inevitably well hidden or spun as early as possible. A man must keep in mind that women are consummate propagandists and will always spin information so that they appear beyond reproach. Men spend their entire lives fighting to get credit for their virtuous behavior, women spend theirs fighting to avoid punishment for their depraved behaviors.

**Section 1: Personal Information**

The first section is generally the contact information for the candidate and while there is limited information to be acquired here, there are a few things to look for. Is the email address they are using appropriate? Everyone has a few emails floating around with nicknames or pseudonyms, however using these when dating, or applying for a job is a bit of a red flag. It reveals that the person does not understand what is an appropriate context for a joke email, and in terms of dating can reveal a degree of immaturity. If her email is in a different name than her own, this may be an indication that she is using an alias for some reason. If you catch a woman using 2 or more last names, multiple abbreviations of her first name, different combinations of first name, middle name and last name, this is a major red flag, as it could be a technique to prevent information gathering.

The remaining personal info can be somewhat useful, knowing a person's age is always a good idea when reviewing information in the rest of the resume, as experience and education are dependent variables of age. Relationship status is another major point, for instance if I can figure out that an applicant is recently married and in the age range 25 - 35 without children, an assumption can be made that either children or a divorce will be incoming in 3 - 5 years.

This information will not in and of itself offer you much but it does help you interpret the information in the rest of the resume in context.

**Section 2: Education**

Education in a Gendernomics context deals with the perspective a person is likely to have on relationships. When reviewing a resume, the institution that granted the degrees is always an important factor to review, and in the same manner the source of her relationship education is important to establish. Humans grow up looking at their immediate family and peer group for how to conduct relationships, romantic and otherwise. They also look to their same sex parent for how to behave, and their relationship with the parent of the opposing sex is influential to how they interact with members of the opposing sex. The goal here is to determine who were her relationship role-models growing up, and the nature of the environment in which she grew up.

A woman's relationship with her father throughout her childhood is a very important determinant of what patterns the woman may manifest as she grows older. An absent father may drive her to seek approval and validation from other men to an above average degree, which may lead to her hypergamy being more extreme than normal. This makes her more prone to branch swinging and seeking out affairs. A woman who grew up with a father who regularly betrayed her trust in a significant way, may be inherently mistrusting of men, which may manifest in multiple ways but often do in the form of control issues.

What is the sexual strategy of her mother? Domineering or submissive nurturing or a battle-axe, did she gain significant weight or let her looks go as soon as that ring went on? A woman's mother is her first role-model for femininity, and it is no coincidence that a recommendation for men who are thinking about marriage is to find out what their prospective wife's mother is like. Some things tend to run in families, such as borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. In addition, the mother is the source of her daughters behavioral schema, meaning that if the daughter grew up watching her mother hen-peck her father, she is probably going to engage in this same behavior. This is no different from how a male who grew up with a domineering mother is likely to be a submissive doormat.

Finally, how was/is the relationship between her parents? Are they still together happily after 30 years or are they more on and off than a North Korean power grid? Did they split while she was young and go through series of relationships after, with more children and multiple additional divorces, leading her to lack stability during childhood? Humans tend to base their parenting style and relationship expectations somewhat on that of their parents. If their prospective partner is a career girl type, it is probable that her mother instilled this need in her either through overt or covert communication.

Her early life experiences of her parents and their relationship often shape much of her personality. For instance if she grew up in constant high drama situations, she is likely to share the temperament that causes this, even though she may hide it. If she comes from a family of domineering women, she most likely inherited this trait. If her father was a weak man who was crushed and dominated by her mother, odds are she will end up wanting to replay this pattern. Learning about both of her parents and  their relationship is thus, a predictor of what she will be like in a similar situation. This is not to say that it is entirely deterministic, however humans are perhaps the most influenced by their parents and other family members. Those behavioral patterns and circumstances we experienced first, are often the ones that are embedded deeply within our psyche.

**Section 3: Experience**

This is where one gets into the meat and potatoes of a resume. Her education may be stellar or below par, but this is when some her own personal patterns can be observed and considered in order to make a well reasoned decision as to how and whether one should proceed.

A major red flag when reviewing a person's experience is the duration of their various engagements. If a person has many short-term assignments that were by definition short-term such as internships, the duration is of less importance, however one should consider why few if any of these shorter term engagements resulted in a longer term position. However, if the person only seems to stay with an employer a year or two at most this is a red flag, because odds are they are only going to stay with you for about that time. You may not be able to discern whether they quit or were fired, however odds are that if there are gaps between the jobs they got fired.

The same way, if the woman keeps telling you about the 7 different men she's cohabited with at age 24, this demonstrates a predilection for playing house, but it also indicates that she tends to move very quickly in relationships. Another aspect is that if she consistently moved into their apartments, she is most likely running a side-business of girlfriend experience in exchange for room and board.

If she talks about various men in her life but never mentions any past relationships, or a low number of past relationships for her age, such as woman in her late twenties that only mentions one or two relationships, this is a sign that she should be asked to provide follow-up information. If she has multiple long-term relationships with no cohabitation, marriage or children, this tends to indicate a relationship where she was a side-chick as it is very rare for 3 - 5 year relationships not to end at the very least with cohabitation. If she lets it slip that she left because the guy didn't want to get married, this is a massive red flag, it likely means that she is on the marriage path after her plan A failed. It also means that her Plan A, after knowing her for a long time was damn sure he did not to be with her for the long term.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/5qqdlv/loving_it_but_wayyyyy_too_many_pop_culture/)
Here we go!

&gt; “Of My Internship? The Toni Morrison book release party I organized, by far.” - Betty

Toni Morrison is a famous novelist. (ok this one was kinda obvious but I surprised at the time because I didn’t know they were going to include real world stuff)

&gt; “Are you familiar with the works of Truman Capote? I’m *Breakfast at Tiffany’s* but this place is strictly *In Cold Blood*.” - Veronica

Truman Capote is another famous author. Two of his most famous works are are *Breakfast at Tiffany’s* and *In Cold Blood*. The first follows Holly, a sophisticated socialite from the Upper East Side (and became a classic movie starring Audrey Hepburn). The second is a true crime novel about a quadruple murder in rural Kansas.

&gt; “I feel like I’m wandering through the lost epilogue of *Our Town*.” - Veronica

*Our Town* is a play from 1938 which ends with a dude in a small town crying over his wife’s grave. Pretty depressing. Style-wise, the play also has a narrator, like Riverdale, and is pretty meta, which Riverdale shares a little of (ex. The “gay best friend” line by Cheryl at lunch which is both a comment about Kevin in the story, but also his archetype as a character).

&gt; “Wonderful! Ten minutes in and I’m already the *Blue Jasmine* of Riverdale High.” - Veronica

*Blue Jasmine* is a 2013 Woody Allen movie about a woman who loses her wealth and lifestyle and and has to move when her husband is revealed to be a fraudster. (This line is also delivered at 10:33 cause Veronica is meta as heck.)

&gt; “Read my glossed lips, Justin Gingerlake. Not. Gonna. Happen.” - Josie

Like Justin Timberlake, but like, redheaded

&gt; “There’s the hottie you were with last night, the red-headed Ansel Elgort. Is he your boyfriend?” - Veronica

Ansel Elgort was the male lead of *The Fault in Our Stars* movie and is Caleb in *Divergent*. He’s pretty freaking handsome.

&gt; “So what are you hens gossiping about? Archie’s Efron-esque emergence from the chrysalis of puberty?” - Chreyl

Zac Efron, the actor from *High School Musical* back in the day, and *Neighbors* more recently, got REALLY HOT seemingly overnight when he hit puberty

&gt; “At Spence I sat at the top of the Elites pyramid. I’m in” - Veronica

The Spence School in Manhattan is a famous all-girls private school. It’s expensive and elite and represents a certain social class.

&gt;""OK, go ahead and hate on cheerleading, but if hipster Prince Harry” - Veronica

Prince Harry is another handsome redhead, best known for BEING ROYALTY.

&gt; “Too Season 5 Betty Draper, it was a great line... But not at all true.” - Kevin
+ **Later:** “Perfect! Very Betty Draper Season 1” - Veronica

These are references to the show *Mad Men*, where Betty Draper is this gorgeous Manhattan wife in the first season, and struggles with her weight in the fifth.

&gt; ""As hot and as smart as you are, you should be the Queen Bey of this drab hive."" - Veronica

Queen Bey = Beyonce. She’s the best.

&gt; “You went to Juilliard, Ms. Grundy!  There is no one else I can take lessons from, I’ve looked.” - Archie

The Juilliard school is most famous music school in the world, and is known for the high quality of its education. It’s like the Harvard of music.

&gt; “Check your sell-by date ladies. Faux-Lesbian kissing hasn’t been taboo since 1994” - Cheryl

Ok so this one is a stretch because Cheryl picking 1994 was probably not purposeful, but if it was, it is probably a reference to the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” episode of *Roseanne*, one of the first TV episodes with a lesbian kiss, which was a big pop culture moment for LGBT representation on screen.

&gt; ""Hi, teen *Outlander*."" - Veronica

*Outlander* is a show (based on books) with a super hunky main character, who (as u/AobaSona pointed out), is also a redhead (Jamie Fraser). (Choosing to reference a show that features time travel might be a nod to the contrasting aesthetics that Riverdale has as well.)

&gt; “Well, it’s not the Met Ball.” - Veronica
+ **Later:** “I mean it’s not the Met Ball or anything.” - Veronica

The Met Ball is possibly New York’s premier social event. Put on and directed in part by Anna Wintour, it features the rich and famous of New York as well as Film, Music, etc., wearing some of the year’s greatest fashions to help fundraise for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s (also known as The Met) Costume Institute. It is the height of glamour, and of the Manhattan set we assume to Lodge family is familiar with. (thank you to u/envi for the correction, originally called The Met a different art museum, the MoMA, in the brackets)

&gt; “Guys, can’t we just liberate ourselves from the tired dichotomy of, jock, artist. Can’t we, in this post-James Franco world, be all things at once?” - Veronica

A reference to James Franco, who became known as an actor (see, *Pineapple Express*, *127 Hours*) he has also done directing work, poetry, music and visual art. He is able to do all the things he wants to do and doesn’t have to fit into just one mould.

Bonus: Rockland County is mentioned as the home of Riverdale, and there’s only one Rockland County in the States, which is just above New York City on the east side.

Hope y’all enjoyed, I’d love to hear any feedback/thoughts or about anything you noticed!

5r0cdz,2,2017-01-30,Analysis of today’s economics from a Marxist perspective.,offenhouse,falc,https://www.reddit.com/r/falc/comments/5r0cdz/analysis_of_todays_economics_from_a_marxist/,"How do today’s world looks like? What laws can we use to describe it? Are GDP growth indexes the right answer? I do not think so. Try strolling through random streets, looking at them through freely available maps and photographs. Is that something that we see in all of those commercials that most of the people are forced to watch? After all, there are only 100 million Adblock Plus users. Of course there are other solutions, but number of people mindlessly watching television commercials must be much higher than of those using ad blocking solutions. And what are corporations going to do with this army of customers, wanting things they could not even imagine a month ago? Profit driven institutions will not sell anything for those whom they fired, when they replaced their work with industrial automation. And automation is real. In 1970 US manufacturing sector employed 25% of workers, now it is 7%. Vladimir Lenin Steelworks in Kraków, Poland needed 6,000 workers to produce 1 million tons of steel annually in the 70’s, in 2010 producing the same amount of steel required only 2,700 workers. Places like Ruhr Valley or cities in Rust Belt really do exist.

That is the intrinsic problem embodied in capitalism, system based on wage labour, system in which large part of population is forced to sell labour in order to earn wages and survive. Factory owners do not feel responsible for communities in  which they conduct their business. That is the reason for worker movements and creation of a welfare state. But corporate greed and influence of business over government resulted in tax cuts for the rich, reduced spending on the poor. So we are buying stuff that is both overpriced and useless, paying for it with money earned by producing, distributing and selling the same products. And on every step of this process of producing and consuming, some portion of the product value is skimmed by people whose life goal is accumulation of capital. To make matters even worse, system of debt and credit makes sure that those who are in possession of large amounts of capital will enlarge their capital further and further, while also making sure, that those who are poor will stay poor and pay interests on their debts, interest on the money they do not have. So we end up in situation where constant improvements of technology, exponential growth of computing power, is making majority of population poorer and poorer. And this has consequences for the whole society. We try to promote entrepreneurship, we expect that people who work hard and have fascinating ideas succeed. Succeed at what? Taking money from people who can barely afford food, renting a shelter and heating in the winter? This kind of race to the bottom, with ever improving technology, on a finite planet, must end up in one disaster or another

Yes, our planet is finite. Before First Industrial Revolution there were about 1 billion humans living on the surface of the Earth, now we have 7.5 billion of them. Automobile manufacturers would love to sell every one of them a new car every few years. But why would we do that? If we divide surface area of Earth landmasses by the number of people living on them, we will get only 5 acres of land for every person. We must also take under our consideration, that in 2013 one third of that surface was already used for agriculture, rest is occupied by deserts, mountains and forests (which we need to absorb CO2 and pollution). And air pollution is a problem. In Great Smog of London 4,000 people had died as a direct result of the smog and 100,000 more were made ill by its effects. And now, in XXI century, when one worker of Gigafactory will be able, on average, to produce one car and 20 sets of 3.5 kW solar panels, 5 kWh batteries (every one of those sets should be able to produce enough electricity for average person, not including transportation and heating) per week, we allow CEO of corporations that make profit out of selling fossil fuels, decide about policy. That is insanity. When rise of global temperatures will catch up with rise of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (before First Industrial Revolution it was 260 ppm, now it is over 400 ppm), droughts will reduce area of arable land in many parts of the world, taking from people that already are in desperate situation, ability to produce food, destabilizing destabilized places even further.

So we should be trying to replace fossil fuels with alternatives, that not only provide people with ability to live without hurting others, but even right now, when mass produced, are simply cheaper. But no. Neoliberalism transformed into simple plutocracy. Administration of President Donald Trump consist mostly of representatives of various corporations. Lying about saving jobs that can not be saved is now enough to take one of the most important offices in the world. That is correct, many jobs can not be saved. Change to renewable sources of energy will make people who work for oil companies, coal mines and power plants simply redundant. Autonomous vehicles will replace drivers. Unless we will create completely new sectors, able to employ masses of people and pay them wages, unemployment will grow. And with growing unemployment, reduced wages will surely come, so less people will be able to buy products, those who will be able to buy them will buy less. Owners of the means of production will respond to that with investments in machinery and reductions in employment. In that situation, in that mad cycle, we should see increase in incomes that some corporations get from other corporations, as spending on machinery and implementations of new technologies increases, so GDP statistics will not be falling dramatically. Businesses will also turn for the state for welfare, so they can become so feared leeches, employing interns instead of regular workers, financing new investments out of subsidies, demanding tax cuts and so on. Should we be allowing that? Creating socialism for companies, while peoples standard of living decreases, just out of a fear of loosing jobs?

That is a state capitalism, my dear reader. An economic system of today’s China and of Nineteen Eighty-Four superstates. Middle class, a group of people who were useful to the state (institution to which few powerful monopolies outsourced task of controlling and providing for the mass of people), is always shrinking in that particular economic model. Companies work in capitalist mode of production, so efficiency is always a priority. And people, who through a hard work and years of training were able to lift themselves out of poverty, petite bourgeoisie, are being brutally replaced by newer, more efficient machinery. They are being forced to compete with the rest of the proletariat for few new jobs that are still being created. Middle class, the petty bourgeoisies incomes drop, proletariat incomes drop. At the end of that process most of the population is left with no money, the little green pieces of paper that create misery (but even in perfect system we will most likely still need to track consumption of resources and human labour, so some kind of currency will be essential for many years to come). Sometimes, in situations like that, companies resort to using their power over the government to increase state military spending. Other countries are forced to do the same thing. It all was nice and dandy during the Great Depression in the 30’s, technology was only so advanced, to only allow to mass produce machine guns, tanks, bombers and bombs. But after inevitable war for resources, we had many new technologies. We were able to built thousands of ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. Mutually assured destruction preserved peace.

But now that system fails once again. New jobs that were created during introduction of computers to the general audience are being lost. During the 90’s, many people were employed in distribution of information stored in physical form. CDs, DVDs, games, books, newspapers. Now all of that work can be performed by a server connected to the Internet. Even if somebody buys physical copy of a media, his or her order is very likely processed by automated warehouse, at least at some point. So economy, in which most of the workforce is employed in service sector is also impossible, when computers are so advanced as ours, when we can cheaply mass produce low power microprocessors that are able to run computer vision algorithms in real time. And what now, I ask. Should we all really be preparing to a war, to fight for family values, like low wages, housing conditions comparable to those from XIX century and long working hours?

I say no. We should embrace technology, we should celebrate our ability to produce enormous amount of luxury goods without destruction of environment in which we and our children live. When economy is still alive and kicking, we should demand that reasonable taxes are put in place, and wealth is redistributed much more equally. Universal Basic Income seems to be good policy to implement. It should be able to take care of people whose job has been automated, it will allow people who hate their jobs to negotiate better conditions. Economic stability will increase consumption, companies will be able to rely on selling products to customers for revenue, instead of welfare. I would even say, with redistribution of wealth forced onto companies by democratically controlled state, free markets might finally be able to self-regulate, at least to some extent.

That is correct, I think Universal Basic Income should basis of modern communism. I think that best way to achieve real communism is freeing people from forced labour. That is what stands at the core of Marxist ideology. Technology changes modes of production, modes of production change societies. Slaves in ancient times were forced to work because they were propriety, serfs in feudalism were forced to work because they were renting land, proletarians in capitalism are forced to work because they need to purchase commodities necessary to survive. “Communism” that was implemented in USSR, did not differ much from state capitalism. Everyone was provided with a job, you could change it if you did not like your current position, state financed construction of residential buildings, hospitals, universities. If you compare it to the modern US, it looks almost like paradise, but it is not communism quite yet.

Technology is always disruptive, when deployed in society which requires everyone to earn their living by providing their labour to somebody else. Rapid improvements in computers during the Third Industrial Revolution, for example, made use of CNC machines in manufacturing possible. It drastically reduced time needed to produce many commodities. But old Soviet system using old production lines and giving special status to the workers working on them was not able to embrace this new technology, in the end collapsing and giving rise to a Russian oligarchy. And it seems the same fate is waiting for US and the rest of the countries that follow their neoliberal lead. Fourth Industrial Revolution will disrupt this outdated economic system in the same way. Many supermarket workers already lost their jobs to self-checkouts, fast food workers lost their jobs to automated kiosks. And this is only beginning, hardware needed to automate more factories and warehouses, to replace more tellers and cashiers, to replace drivers and many other professions is being mass produced right now. Corporations assume that markets are infinite, that their actions do not change those markets. But it is simply incorrect.

People in power must learn how to control themselves, how to cooperate. Otherwise we will end up with another Great Depression, people will be starving when enormous amounts of food are being harvested by autonomous machinery. New Hitlers will try to tell us that we need to eliminate one arbitrary defined group or the other in order to make things better. Jews, Muslims, immigrants, people with black skin, white skin or any other color of any other part of their body. Just do not look at redistribution of the wealth closely, be a good patriot.

We need a alternative. I think UBI is a good compromise. We increase standard of living of many people, slow down further destabilization. At the same time we reduce bureaucracy, eliminate old means tested forms of welfare, possibly making it simply cheaper than current welfare programs. Bu this should only be a start, our goal should be Star Trek like utopia, a Fully Automated Luxury Communism. Otherwise I am afraid, our current world leaders will be remembered as worst tyrants that walked the face of the Earth. Legacy worth living for, right?"

You have been warned. If you do decide to read, I am grateful for your time.

**Background**

Hey guys, I am a junior student at a pretty big university who just switched major into Computer Science. I am currently in my second semester of CS, taking discrete math, intro to programming 2 with C++, (I took Java last semester) and two not important classes that still require a sizable chunk of my time. 

Switching into CS was the best decision I've ever made. I love the community, the impact, the projects, pretty much everything, but I am not satisfied with my learning. Discrete math is the only class that I genuinely enjoy. The programming class has fun projects, but is completely self-taught as the professor is almost universally regarded as useless by pretty much every CS student here. Other two classes won't contribute much to my future career, but I will have do them anyway.

**Problem**

I was rejected by many internships I applied to due to my lack of algorithm knowledge/course work, and I don't feel that the courses I am taking is doing much to contribute to my future as a software engineer (that's my plan, for now). I am simply not satisfied with the pace and diversity of learning, and my lack of portfolio. 

In summary, I am looking to learn more languages/skills that can help me build up my portfolio. Things like Git, building my own website, PHP, etc. Only thing is that I hope I can still complete/learn them on top of being a full time college student. Don't worry, I will take care of myself as to not neglect my social life and health as many have done before me.

**Possible Solution??**

I have heard of things like the Odin Project for Web Development, and it looks promising. I want to know of more resources that this sub universally love, and the steps I should take to prevent my formal education from holding back my life long education."

The mission of /r/Askhistorians is to provide high-quality historical answers to a wide audience. We usually work online, through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [our Tumblr account](http://askhistorians.tumblr.com/), and here, but that's not all we do. [We talk to historians and bring them here for AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/amas). We have (with your help) [presented at historical conferences](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2016/have-a-question-about-the-past-askhistorians). We also advocate: for good history, for civil discussion, and for keeping historical research going.

That's what we're doing today, and we need your help. 

We don't get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view. We get political when good history matters. **If you're American, we're asking you to call your Congressmen and Congresswomen to support funding for the NEA and NEH.**

The federal budget process isn't fast, and it isn't straightforward, but it *is* changeable. Each February, when the president submits his or her budget to Congress, there's a better chance of a cow getting through a slaughterhouse untouched than that budget staying in the same form. That's why your calls matter: Congress catches a lot of flak, but it does do work, particularly in the details of the budget.

And we say *call*, not email, because calls matter. It's easy to ignore an email; you probably do it a few times on any given day. It's a lot harder to ignore a phone call. [Call your Senators and Congresswoman](https://www.govtrack.us/). You won't talk to them directly; you'll talk to a staffer or an intern answering phones. They've been getting a lot of calls lately. Chances are, they'll have a local office as well as their DC office. If you can't get through to one, try the other.

Don't call other Congressmen than your own. It's a waste of time. Don't follow a script; those tend to get ignored. Just say who you are, where you're calling from (city/zip code, if you don't want to give your address), and what you're calling about.

Repetition helps. Put the numbers in your cellphone and give 'em a call when you're headed to work or have a spare minute or two. It doesn't take a lot of time, but it can make a world of good.

Why are you calling?

The National Endowment for the Humanities funds a lot of good things. If you've seen Ken Burns' documentary *The Civil War,* you've seen some of its work. If you've read *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45*, you've seen some of its work. If you've visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.

There's something else important: **NEH funding indirectly supports what you're reading right now.**

Many of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. [The *Discovering America* digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/)

The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That's just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you'd be spending $1.20.

For all the NEH does, that's a good deal.

In addition, share with us the academic, extracurricular, or research opportunities you would take advantage of as a student. If applicable, provide details of any circumstance that could have had an impact on your academic performance and/or extracurricular involvement. (650 words)

Here is my essay: 

“American dream” is a popular term among international school students in Vietnam. Like most of the others at my school,  I desire to reap countless learning opportunities and meaningful experience there, and University of Wisconsin - Madison adapt more than my expectations. I would not only be able to apply my knowledge acquired from the textbooks into hands-on projects in the laboratories and internship programs but also have a chance to compete in engineering team projects and develop my passionate hobby of board gaming. 	
Industrialism and environmentalism are two contradicting trends in the world: either with prosperous companies yet polluted environment or with mediocre companies yet healthy environment. Unfortunately, nowadays their desire for improving standard of living drives them toward industrialism, consequently causing the issue of climate change that have lasted for several decades. Thoughtful scientists and engineers have strengthened renewable energy, a clean but yet effective method, to change people’s direction toward environmentalism. Since then, I was inspired to follow the scientists and engineers’ side to diminish global pollution and strengthen carbon sequestration process. Through my past experience of Regional Math Championship and World Scholar’s Cup during the last three years, my competitiveness with surrounding opponents have grown stronger. What makes me feel even more ambitious is WisWind, a team competition established with the aim of designing an optimal wind turbine system in technical, economical and social aspects. In 2016, University of Wisconsin - Madison also sent a team of 15 students to compete in Collegiate Wind Competition offered by US Department of Energy. This will not only allow me to participate in an engineering project for the first time of my life but also magnify my willingness of making a greener community here and winning against the threats of climate change. 
People often say: “Do what you love”. Except for my desire to protect the environment, my love of playing and designing board games is also satisfied with Madison Board Gamers. I have developed my passion of board games for one year through spreading the world of board games to my friends and nearby people and playtesting my own game with a group of local game designers to publish it in the future. There was even some days when I spent three hours designing the game mechanics and printing the game components to try with my friends or I dreamt about a new board games ideas and wrote that into my notebook right after I woke up. With my passion and experience in board gaming, Joining Madison Board Gamers would allow me to expand this immense world within the community and inspire some members to follow the aspiration of designing a board game the way my local designers strengthened my desire of developing and publishing my own game. 
	Along with rigorous undergraduate curriculum, Co-operative internship program and several meaningful activities and organizations, University of Wisconsin - Madison would surely make a long-term companion on my academic and career pathways in the future. (491 words)

5r1ybb,4,2017-01-30,Workplace woes,8bit802,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/5r1ybb/workplace_woes/,"I started working as an intern with a fairly large software company in August of 2016. I have worked my butt off and they offered me a promotion for me when I graduated in January. Not given an offer letter or anything I told them I was interested and they had me move desks and started having me shadow someone from that department.

However, I just recently had a meeting with my boss and was told that LEGALLY they could not promote me because of my internship contract. I would have to continue earning my intern wages until that contract ran out but I could start working in the new position before that, just not a pay raise. I was then told that I could get the raise sooner, if I had an outside offer from another company looking to hire me, they would then push through the paperwork for my promotion. 

Is this something they can do? I have two interviews lined up for prospective jobs, but I don't know if I should take this as an insult and take something else if offered or if this is just standard practice. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm going to be living in Chicago this summer for an internship and I don't want my training to suffer. I'm looking for a good gym, preferably as close by public transport to the River North area as possible. I've looked at Quads and it seems to be one of the better options. I've also been to B&amp;W gym before and it was pretty nice, but it's further away. What do you guys recommend? Where do you train? "

Ive taken my data structures and algorithms some advanced topics classes like datamining and stuff, and just landed my first summer internship with FAST. Im really excited for the opportunity to finally get experience. But I dont really know what to expect or what ill be doing, so Im kind of worried Im not ready or I wont know what Im doing.

Even though I do well in school, I feel very unsure of my abilities in real life workplace. How can I prepare better or am I just being paranoid?"

Sorry in advance for the long post, I'll try to make it brief. 

**BACKGROUND:**
I have a friend, we'll call him Fred. Fred and I have known each other for seven years. We met when he did an exchange program at my school, and he was assigned to one of my friends. At the time that I met Fred, and for the majority of our friendship, I was dating other people. Fred and I became pen pals after the exchange program was up, and the following year I did the same exchange program and saw him again when I was visiting his home country with my school. 

We kept up communication over the years, not speaking to each other very often but also acting as if no time had passed between conversations. We would talk about normal things - music, movies, interests. I enjoyed talking to Fred so much because I'm an amateur linguist and he would always help me practice different languages. He would send me music in his native language that he thought I would enjoy, and I helped teach him idioms since that's what he struggled with the most in English. We would Skype occasionally while we were doing homework, again with normal conversations.

Until this year, I only saw Fred in person one other time, when we happened to be vacationing in the same city four years ago (with our friends) and decided to meet up for coffee one day. I went to meet him along with my boyfriend, and Fred came to meet us with two of his friends. Both of them were girls, and I had a sense that he was dating or would soon be dating one of them based on their interactions.

**PRESENT DAY:**
Last summer, Fred informed me that he obtained an internship in my city and would be living in the area from October to February. I was obviously excited to be able to see more of my friend, and the apartment he chose happened to be only a few blocks from where I work part-time (unbeknownst to him). Because of that, I saw Fred maybe once or twice a week when he was here, but with some weeks where I didn't see him at all. 

I currently live with my boyfriend Mike (25M), the same one that I was with when I met Fred on vacation. We have been dating 3.5 years and have been living together for 2. He has met Fred a few times as Fred has even come over to our apartment once. However, Mike does not speak Fred's language and doesn't have much in common with him. I've invited him a few times to hang out with us, but he politely bows out every time. 

After he was here for only a couple weeks and we already had spent a few days together, he joked that his apartment (which he shared with two other girls in the program) was like my second home, and asked me to carry the spare set of keys in case one of them lost theirs, but also so that I could get in easier as their doorbell was broken. The girls knew about this and had no problem with it. I accepted.

One day I had plans to meet Fred at his apartment after work to get dinner, and it was raining out. I had forgotten my umbrella at home, and wasn't looking forward to the walk. I didn't tell Fred this, only that I was clocking out soon. When I walked out the door, Fred was waiting with an umbrella. He said he knew I would forget, and this way the walk wouldn't be so miserable.

After about a month Fred and I started watching a Netflix show together, as it gets very cold in the winter where I live and we didn't feel like going out. Since the TV is to one side of the couch, we both sat with our feet up and facing to the side. After a while Fred grabbed a pillow and used my knees as a back support. I thought this was weird but harmless, so I didn't say anything. 

At this point, my coworkers, who had already seen him with the umbrella and heard about the keys, and met him the few times that he come to my work, told me that Fred probably has feelings for me. I said that was preposterous because he's never acted out of the ordinary before. He has several friends who are girls, and he and his best friend (whom he talks to every day) speak to each other very affectionately and it isn't weird, it's just how he (and his culture) is. They looked at the posts and pointed out that only she speaks to him that way, indicating that she probably has feelings for him but not the other way around. They argued that since I've been ""off the market"" this whole time, he's probably just playing the long game and not wanting to say anything until I'm single, and I haven't been. At this point I became worried: if they were wrong, it would disrupt my friendship with Fred and also cause a lot of stress with my boyfriend over nothing. My boyfriend Mike might even request that I stop seeing Fred or end the friendship, although I don't really think he would do that. My coworkers assured me that I probably didn't need to say anything unless Fred did something inappropriate. 

Last Friday was Fred and his roommates going away party, as they are leaving this Thursday. They had a big party at their apartment with all the friends they had made, most of whom I knew from spending so much time with them these past few months. Mike did not come because he doesn't like parties, and also all the people there spoke Fred's language. At parties, I have a general rule that I never do shots as I'm a pretty small person and they hit me very hard. Fred asked me to do one because it was a special occasion and I agreed. The shot compounded with the other drinks I had got me very drunk and I only remember bits and pieces for the rest of the night. 

I remember we all got into taxis and went to a nearby nightclub. Fred bought me a beer and we danced - separately. I went downstairs to use the bathroom and then sat in the hallway for a bit before going back up. Fred found me there and I think we talked about how he was leaving soon, he asked if I was going to miss him. I think I started crying at this point, mostly because I'm an emotional person and I really was going to miss him. His running joke was that he was never returning to the States again, he had already visited me twice and I haven't returned to his home country once. So I think I was crying because of this, but I'm not sure. At this point I am pretty sure that he kissed me on the lips in a way that was more than just a peck, and said something like ""I'm joking, of course I'm going to visit you, I love you."" 

After this I don't remember anything - I don't even remember what I said in return. I woke up in my own bed, hungover. Mike told me that Fred had ridden in the taxi with me from the club, then took a taxi back to his apartment. I've spoken to Fred on Messenger since and he's acting like nothing happened. I haven't said anything to him yet since I'm not sure if I'm misremembering or not.

Fred is leaving in a couple days, and we probably won't speak as often and won't see each other again for several years. I'm not sure what to do since I'm not 100% sure what happened, and if it would be better to just forget the whole thing since he's leaving anyway. I'm seeing him tomorrow because I loaned him some stuff for his apartment and he's returning them to me. I don't know if I should say something to Fred, to Mike, to both, or to neither. If Fred does harbor feelings for me he hasn't let them affect our friendship - until the party. I only see Fred as a friend and Mike knows that and has full faith in me - and I think Fred knows that too. If he does, I don't want to complicate our friendship and hurt him by bluntly telling him what he already knows. But if I don't say anything, I feel like that's selfish of me because I don't want to lose who has become one of my closest and oldest friends. 

What should I do Reddit? Also congrats if you read the whole thing.

  **tl;dr**: An old pen pal of mine moved to my city a few months ago. Things were normal until his going away party, where I believe (but am not 100% sure) that he kissed me and told me he loves me. Either way, after the party he brought me safely home to my boyfriend's house and never mentioned it again. What should I do about this situation?"

5r43av,3,2017-01-30,Unsure of What To Do With Life,confused_scientist,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/5r43av/unsure_of_what_to_do_with_life/,"Hello,

I am not sure if this is the appropriate sub, and if it is not kindly nudge me to another. It'll be a long post.

&amp;nbsp;

I am struggling with issues on what to do with my life. A little background about me:

I graduated in 2015 with two Bachelor of Science degrees. One in Microbiology, the other in Clinical Laboratory Science (CLS). My cumulative GPA is 3.77. I absolutely hated being in school though and was excited to start working. I obtained my MLS(ASCP)CM certificate 2 weeks after graduating so I may continue working at the hospital I did my internship at as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist. The main hospital in our health system had one or two openings which my class mates quickly got before me. However, our smaller hospitals had many openings but they were all night shifts. I decided I would be a generalist at one of our smaller hospitals and took the night shift.

I worked night shift from June of 2015 to August 2016 and hated every second of it. The night shifts were 11 hours, from 2000 to 0700 (8pm to 7am). I would work 5 consecutive nights and have 3 days off unless someone called in or would need help. Majority of the time, I ended up working about 6 or 7 nights straight because we only had 2 dedicated nightshifters (including myself). During this year, I had about 2-3 hours of sleep a day as I never adjusted to the night shift. When I started out, I just repeated to myself that it is temporary. Once September came, I decided I needed to find a different shift to work and would approach my supervisor who arrives at 7 in the morning. I asked her if there is any way possible I can be moved to a days position as my physical and mental health is being affected by the lack of sleep and no contact with the girlfriend or friends. She understood my concerns, but said that people who work nights typically don't become adjusted until the 6 month mark and to give it sometime.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to trudge on to December to see if she's right. During those following months, I lost contact with friends, missed weddings as I could not ask for time off due to how short staffed we were, and was actually called in early multiple times due to evenings needing help with the work load. While helping with the evenings shift, I asked coworkers what the shift was like and they did not provide any positive feedback.

When December came, I asked again if there is any way I can be moved to a day shift as it has been 7 months and I am breaking down. She replied that there are evening shifts available, but if I switch to evenings I will still have to cover night shifts. I already knew this from talking with the evening CLSs and having to work with a different partner every night shift. I declined and asked if I may be transferred to another hospital within our health system so I may move to days as I simply cannot keep doing nights, nor a mix of nights and evenings. At this point, she said she'll be right back and excused herself from the room. After awhile, she returned with my manager and some papers I signed. At this point, it is 8:00am or so and they were going over the documents saying that I signed them under the condition that I can perform the functions necessary of the duties of a Clinical Laboratory Scientist at our hospital. If I am admitting that I am unable to perform to keep performing the responsibilities assigned then I will be terminated and will no longer be able to seek a position within our health system. As I tried to process what was being said, the supervisor followed up with that a days position will be opening in February since someone is retiring and it'll be filled and she will let me know when I can apply. When I heard that a days position will be open, I agreed I can stay until February.

From December to February, I applied to every CLS position I could find in the area that didn't call for night shifts. I never had a response back, despite emailing my updated resume to my alma mater's career services to have them look over. I was getting desperate and kept applying to other places, but ultimately started to get into computer science. I liked jailbreaking my iPod in highschool, and flashing tomato on my linksys router to control QoS for our 1.5Mbps DSL that I had as a kid. I liked building my own computers for me and my family and friends. I know tinkering with devices and computers and all of what I mentioned is not the same as computer science, but I wanted to pursue CS. I liked math and solving problems. I began to frequent [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) more as I started liking medical laboratory science less and less. I felt betrayed as I couldn't find anything other than night shifts in my area. I was unwilling to move to another city or state as my friends and family are important to me.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept trudging along, 11 hours each night, getting 3 hours of sleep. Typically working 55 or 66 hours a week. For the holiday, I made the effort to visit family with the girlfriend in January and was told that I look horrible and that I couldn't remember anything that was being said in conversation. I wasn't fun to be around...

February came around, and the CLS that was retiring decided to stay. I kept up with the job until August of 2016, while teaching myself Python and a little of discrete structures in the spare time that I had. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember a lot of what I was learning, but I knew I enjoyed the material more than I did the laboratory work. I always liked math, and I liked programming and building things. I never created anything super fantastic, but I made little CLI games and made little programs that cleaned up my desktop and others to introduce object oriented programming. I really enjoyed it, and felt like I was doing something more important than popping green and red top tubes to load onto the VITROS. 

I kept applying to jobs that were opening as a CLS, but never heard from any of the places. I kept in contact with the alma mater career services explaining my situation and asked if there was anything I can improve on my resume and job applications. They said to just keep applying.

&amp;nbsp;

In late April, I gave up. I was tired of working 66 hour nights, and all I wanted was a day shift. I started thinking how the best job I ever had was as a garbage man, working 12 hour days for a semester to save up money to return to school for the Microbiology and CLS degrees. (I continued doing that job for the remainder of college as I loved it. The boss and I got along great). I would love to be a garbage man back home over working in a lab, shoveling tubes through instruments and being yelled at by nurses over things like me cancelling UCGs on male patients in the ER. I decided I'm leaving this field for something else and in May 2016 I enrolled in a nearby college to try to get a Master's of Science in Computer Science. I told my girlfriend, family, and friends this and was met with overwhelming support in my decision.

&amp;nbsp;

July 2016 arrived and I approached my supervisor at the end of my shift to hand in my resignation letter. I provided 4 weeks notice, telling her I will stay until August 12 as class started August 22. I knew that there was no possible way to fill my position in 4 weeks, let alone 2. (As a matter of fact, they still have 3 night shift positions). My supervisor just mentioned that if that's what I want to do then she can't stop me. She thanked me for the work that I did and if I decided to change my mind I can come back to work nights.

Because I worked 66 hours a week in a year, I built a nestegg of $26,000 while also lowering my current student loans down to $27,000 from $33,000. At that point in August, I could practically pay off my student loans, but I wanted to keep the large amount of money I had to pay towards school. I knew I wasn't going to get an internship for CS right away and will be needing money to live off. My bills are only $500 a month as I spend time on the computer or utilize the city libraries for renting books, movies, and music. I hangout with friends attending free events, or have board game nights, or we go cycling. I never was much of a big spender on things.

On August 22, 2016 I started my first day of classes. I have to get the deficiency courses out of the way before proper enrollment for the Masters of course. At the end of the first week, I felt like I have made the biggest mistake of my life. I still feel that way, in fact. I feel like a failure for returning to school, for not being able to stick out nightshifts. I feel like I am whining over something as trivial as having to work nights, and that I decided to return to school to escape the real world. My girlfriend suggested that I make an appointment with counseling services at the school to discuss with someone how I'm feeling. The sessions didn't really help me and I stopped going. I know it's not their job to tell me what to do, but all we did was talk about how nightshifts were bad and it's good I'm not doing it anymore. I just told the counselor that I feel better now as I didn't want to hurt their feelings. I made an appointment for another session next week to talk about how I'm feeling, but I'm not too optimistic as it'll be a rehash of what we talked about the last 7 times.

My work in class is going fine. My first semester I completed all my courses with A's, including Calculus II despite not having done Calculus I in 5 years. I just don't like going to class and sitting. So far in this current semester everything is going along fine as well school wise. 

&amp;nbsp;

I love that I am spending time with my girlfriend, with my family, and with my friends. I can recall conversations I have had with people. I have been able to do activities with them. I feel like I have never had this much energy before! No more stomach pain, no more weird numbness in my extremities, and I have a proper diet now! That week off before classes started was great. I hadn't had a day off in that whole year working nights and I about cried at the opportunity to be able to see loved ones after not really seeing them for a year.

I just really hate myself now as I don't like being in school. I feel like a failure for not being part of the work force now. I just want a day shift job, but that isn't possible as a CLS in my area. I'd be happy working 60 hours a week as long as they are during the day. I absolutely hate the laboratory work though, but at least I was working and was being paid. I want to drop out of school and find a job in something as I don't feel like I'm really appreciating the opportunity I gave myself.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR;
I was working nightshifts for a year. Didn't like being a clinical laboratory scientist. Decided to pursue computer science. Don't like being in school for computer science. Just want to work a day shift job and not hate myself anymore."

I am a student majoring in Information Security and Assurance. I have nearly completed my degree with 5 courses left. My problem is I really don't feel I have gained any sufficient experience to feel like I know anything about infosec. I know this is probably mostly my own fault for not studying course material more than the required amount to finish assignments. Is there anyway to go from feeling confused to more confident regarding infosec? I am interested in obtaining an internship where I hope knowledge could be cultivated in this field. I have gone through some very basic programming on Ruby, worked in very structured virtual environments, and mostly sat through lectures regarding the field. All of this has made me feel prepped to do absolutely nothing with infosec with any confidence. Am I alone in feeling like this? Does everyone feel this uncomfortable when they are ""starting out""? I feel like I am missing something that everyone else is in on. I am interested in this field and have always gravitated towards computers but I am beginning to feel like I made a wrong choice somewhere along the way. Any thought, advice, or opinions would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

edit- I appreciate everyone's responses, I am going to study up and work on a certification path to head towards a CISSP while looking for an internship where I can get some hands-on experience. I got a little overwhelmed so thanks for everyone's patient replies."

I'm a soon to be college graduate from a top public university in the U.S. I'm looking for a career in finance (although I'm pretty open to anything else that relates to my Economics major). I'm very proud of the fact that I will be graduating after only 3 years this May with a pretty decent 3.4 GPA, but while I've had recruiters congratulate me too, it seems that many of the companies I've applied for positions with 
a) only have internships available to juniors (and although I am technically one, they stress that they are looking for individuals who have one more year of schooling to go) and
b) only have full-time positions available to those with min 3 years experience

Recently, I had an exciting interview opportunity and basically got shut down in the first minute by the recruiter *because* of the fact that I'm graduating early (He even said he would be happy to talk again if I decide to take another year of school). If anybody has gone through a similar experience or has advice regarding the matter, I would really appreciate it. 

Thanks!"

So I've applied to ~20 or so IT/ Network engineer internships around the country with some as recent as this past week, but most in late November/ early December.

Out of that lot, 8 have rejected me so far without any form of initial contact or interview. I have 5 years of experience in the field, as well as a relevant certification, but that's proving irrelevant.

I know some if not most companies view intern roles as a position suited for juniors, seniors, or recent grads. Could the fact that I'm a sophomore be an automatic DQ, or should I further tweak my resume?"
5r4pmt,4,2017-01-30,Hellbent vs Nixxiom/ Nixxiom's first day.,jamiehosier,PlanetDolan,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetDolan/comments/5r4pmt/hellbent_vs_nixxiom_nixxioms_first_day/,"It was a peaceful day at Planet Dolan,The crew was discussing what there next count down should be, the animators were getting ready for the next episode of Super Planet Dolan and Dolan was looking at reddit for interesting true stories and fan fictions.

one day outside the building Hellbent was looking at a magazine and having a smoke, when suddenly a strange figure came approaching the building he was tall, muscular, had white hair, grey skin and pointy ears. as he was standing in front of Hellbent. he said in a calm yet creepy voice, ""Do you work here?"", ""What's it to you?"" Hellbent asked ""I'm here about the job."" the figure answered. ""Oh, you the intern?, great I need my girly magazines organized, and I need you to get me more Cigarettes and a coffee CHOP, CHOP!"" Hellbent ordered. ""I'm no one's intern, I'm here for the narrating part of the job, I'm here to be a new member."" the Figure responded ""Oh! that? Tsk,Tsk,Tsk it's not that easy to be a member!"" Hellbent said ""You see you have to earn it.""
 
""How's that?"" the stranger asked. ""BY BEATING ME  IN A FIGHT!!"" Hellbent responded ""You're on!"" The stranger said as he pulled out a long sword while Hellbent pulled out his favorite gun. 

""Before we battle I must know your name"" Hellbent said ""My name is Nixxiom."" the stranger answered. ""Good, now that i know your name, LETS FIGHT!"" Hellbent yelled as he shot a couple of bullets out of his gun, but unbenounced to him Nixxiom's sword was sharp enough to cut through bullets with ease.

As Nixxiom was about to strike Hellbent grabbed his knife and stabbed him in the shoulder. while groaning in pain Hellbent approached him. ""Giving up?"" Hellbent asked. ""Not even close."" Nixxiom responded as he blasted a force of magic strong enough to push Hellbent ten feet away from him. 

While Hellbent was on the ground Nixxiom grabbed a bottle of Medicine and drank it. unlike ordinary medicine this medicine was strong enough to heal even the most stubborn wound. As Hellbent tried to make a reach for his gun, Nixxiom kicked it out of the way and grabbed a second sword and threw it down at him.

""HEY WHAT THE HELL?"" Hellbent yelled. ""If we're gonna fight dirty we should do it the old-fashioned way, NOW DRAW THAT SWORD!""  Nixxiom ordered as Hellbent got up. after getting up Hellbent grabbed the sword Nixxiom handed him and then they began to fight. As the metal from their swords were clashing, Melissa was in her office drinking coffee and responding to Dolans Email until she heard Hellbent scream.

hearing it she looked down at window of her 5th story office where she saw Hellbent bleeding, it turns out Hellbent never knew how to handle a sword and got his hand cut off by Nixxiom. as Nixxiom was pinning him down with his foot and getting ready to do the final blow, Melissa sprang into action by jumping out of her office window and gliding down to the ground with her wings, just in time to stop Nixxiom from making a HUGE mistake. 

""HEY STOP!!!"" Melissa yelled as Nixxiom turned his head to see the purple bird from the count downs and animated videos, ""What are you doing?"" Melissa asked. ""Trying to earn my spot as cast member!"" Nixxiom replied. ""Now who told you that? you already got the job a month ago."" Melissa said.

""I did?"" Nixxiom asked. ""But what about battling one of the cast members, Hellbent said th-"", ""Hellbent?"" Melissa interrupted, ""look dude, first rule here is that you never listen to what he says, I should know i work with the guy.""
""Oh! I guess i didn't have to cut his hand off to prove my dominance."" Nixxiom said awkwardly ""SOMEBODY JUST GET ME A DAMN DOCTOR!!!!"" Hellbent screamed. ""Hang on."" Melissa said as she grabbed her phone and dialed 911. after Hellbent was rushed to the E.R. Melissa decided to give Nixxiom the tour of the building. 

""And this is where we go to shoot the episodes of Super Planet Dolan."" Melissa said. ""Any questions?"", ""Yeah."" Nixxiom said ""what will my first countdown be?"" he asked. ""Lets see, your first Count down is going to be 'Nine Strangest things people tried to trade sex for'"" she answered. ""That sounds weird."" Nixxiom said with an eyebrow up. ""Don't worry at least you wont have a an awkward count down like I did on my first one."" Melissa said, giving him confidence.

A week later Hellbent came back with a cast on his arm to protect the hand he got re-attached, just in time to see Nixxiom's first count down. After recording was done everyone congratulated him on being a new member of the family, even Hellbent Gained some respect for him. ""Well Hellbent I hope you learned it's not always smart to pick on the new guy."" Melissa said. ""Yep."" Hellbent answered, ""Next time we have a new member I'm gonna make sure he's shorter than me. ""I guess you never learn."" Melissa groaned as everyone accepted Nixxiom as not only a new Character, but a new friend.

Here is what I currently have going for me:

* Competent in: Java, MATLAB, Python (through Coursera courses), R, C.
* Am currently learning (this semester): Scheme, Haskell, Stata and SQL (through Stanford Lagunita).
* Completed one semester-long class project with R that implements ggplot2 and single-variable regression. 
* Will begin a second semester-long class project in R that introduces multivariate regression. 
* Will also begin a semester-long class project with Stata that is similar to those two described above.
* Coursework in: multivariate calculus, combinatorics, linear algebra and basic statistics.
* Currently enrolled in: declarative programming (Scheme, Haskell), numerical computing (MATLAB). 
* Strong with public speaking/communication (working on an advanced manual in my Toastmasters club and have even won speaking competitions in my city). 

I know it is not much, I still have miles to go and am not even qualified for an internship. After graduation, I plan to take an extra semester for the purpose of taking two courses at my university: *data mining techniques and big data*. 

In the meantime, what is the next step I should take to gain more experience/skills?

I enjoy biology (especially microbiology and molecular biology), and understand that coding can be extremely valuable in such a scientific setting, but I'm not biology is something I'd like to do for a living. Unfortunately, I know exactly one language; I taught myself Java at age 11 from reading decompiled game code and Googling things I wasn't able to figure out on my own. I'd prefer not to stick with Java; my brief affairs with C# have been wonderful and I'm keen to learn other things.

I have an AAS in Information Systems Security, which I suppose is better than nothing, and I would be happy to work on that side of things as well if anyone knows a good place to start there.

**Things I'd like to know:**

* Languages, frameworks and libraries to learn. What should I focus on? C#/.NET undoubtedly due to its ubiquity, but what else would be good to learn? SQL and relevant libraries? HTML5/CSS? I'm happy doing pretty much anything except games, can't afford to be too picky about this right now anyway.

* Building a portfolio. Should I just reinvent the wheel and put sample projects up on Gitlab or similar simply to demonstrate that I have the ability to code? Are there any good open-source projects I could look into contributing to?

* Internships - any places I should look besides government? I don't think I'm going to get this one with the DHS, but other government internships seem to accept only an AAS with no experience, which gives me some hope. Are there any other types places that look good on future resumes?

I'm (hopefully) heading to university this fall where I'll be majoring in CS and preferably attending job fairs and such to network, but I've still got zero experience with anything at the moment and would like to know what I can do on my own.

Anything that integrates CS/cybersecurity or networks in general would be neat as well.

I just graduated this May and started my full time job in July. I worked the same position last summer (2015) as an intern and was quite excited to come back full time. I'm a test engineer and work with a wide variety of people. I'm a very friendly person and get along with a lot of the people work on the floor as well as other engineers.

I had the opportunity to travel for work where I knew a bunch of the guys already out there. I was the only female there, whatever, honestly not a big deal to me. While I already knew some of the people there, I didn't know all of them. At this point, I had recently started dating my boyfriend and I informed my friends there of it. 

Cue, meeting that ""weird guy"" at work. The guys I know told me he's kinda creepy, just would walk up behind you and not say anything. And it wasn't like he had something to ask and was waiting, he'd just stand there, staring. Now, I have a degree in social work in addition to my engineering degree. This guy didn't come off as weird to me, just a shy guy. So I started talking to him and bringing him over to the group of guys and getting everyone to interact. The guys had tried a few times but to no avail.

Now, I made it clear a multiple points that I had a boyfriend. A new relationship and I was excited, so the ""weird guy"" knew about it from the start. But as I was there, he started to hang out more, open up a little bit, but still kinda shy. I left to go back to the main hub of operations with his number (to contact him when we were going out and our general plans).

We texted here and there, as I do with the rest of my coworkers. I checked with the guys back on travel and they assured me I did not treat him differently than anyone else there. But we all joked that he was smitten with me. I brushed it off, he knew I had a boyfriend and he was literally on the opposite coast from me.

Eventually he ended up coming back to the main hub on home leave for a few weeks. He would stop by my cube to talk about things, ask me out for lunch, and if that didn't work he asked me to dinner. Now, every time he came by I mentioned my boyfriend. Like how I just went to spend the weekend with him (long distance), or how we talked about this or him that. Literally every conversation.

Well, one week I had a truly awful week and it was just before Christmas. He ended up buying me a box of chocolates and giving me a fancy Christmas card. I thought that he was teetering on a line and not understanding that I had a boyfriend. I told him that while he's a nice guy, that nothing was going to happen, I love my boyfriend and that was that. He took a few days and said he still wanted to talk and that he understood. That was a lie.

I ended up having to go back on travel for a few days. He was to go out for a few days and fly back to the main hub. Once he heard I was going and that there wouldn't be any overlap, he was suddenly staying four extra days leaving the day after I was. I then heard from a close friend of mine there that the ""weird guy"" told him to ask me for drinks/dinner and then to tell the ""weird guy"" where we were and he was going to meet up with us.

Then more came out. He had counted the number of times we texted each other one month and apparently the number ""had to mean something"" that we couldn't text that much without it meaning something. He was worried about all of us hanging out as a group because then I wouldn't pay enough attention to him. And that when I spent the weekend with my boyfriend I suddenly stopped texting him and why would I do that. The guys had a talk with him and told him he needed to cut it out. Again this is AFTER I told him no and re-iterated that nothing would happen.

After I heard all of this I stopped texting and engaging with him in any conversation that did not involve work related items. Anytime he came out with us (as a group) he would come super drunk, drink more, sulk and not say a word and leave without warning. One night we went out drinking and apparently he was counting the amount of drinks I was having. Thankfully he did what he normally does and left without warning. He sent me a text asking ""how he can stop being so weird"" to which I didn't respond. We lied to him about a day trip the rest of us made because we knew he would throw off the whole thing. And when we went out to dinner the next night (couldn't lie, my team was playing in the playoffs, he knew I'd be there) he followed me out of the restaurant to say if there was anything he could do to make ""this"" not weird anymore, to let him know.

I later found out he had freaked out on a male coworker yelling at him in a restaurant. He lied about a mean text the same coworker ""apparently"" sent him (I knew because I watched my coworker send him this message). Now this guy is a really good worker and I don't want to destroy his life so I was hoping that the guys talking to him would knock some sense into him.

But it all came to a head when I got back to the main hub and was group messaging with some of the guys back on travel. One of them made a joke about the situation (as we do with a lot of things) but I thought that the joke was real and freaked out. Once we couldn't joke about it I realized the severity of the issue. Especially when he followed me out of a room to trying to talk to me when it was not work related.

Now I've gone to his manager about the situation who said they were going to use it as a learning experience for him and that for the time being we are to remain on opposite coasts. If I need to go on travel, I need to let her know and he will be coming back to the main hub.

The big problem I see with this is I'm miserable at work. This was before this situation happened, but travel made me happy, it made me feel home when I was there. I made a huge move for this job and I'm not loving the environment. A higher up manager talked about putting me on extended travel for this location and even more travel for when we move to our second location. He wants to find a place to make me happy and once I do that, help me find a job within the company there.

I told the ""weird guys"" other manager (there are like three layers of management, benefit of big corporations) and he said ""oh, I hope your not going out there during __, ___ and ___ times"" (basically the biggest reasons I would be out there and when there really would be any work out there). I felt entire demeaned by the situation. Why send out the new person who doesn't have an intimacy with the part when they could have someone else out there who knows it? Now just to clarify, we have two different positions and there are other people who can come out to support. But just the fact he's spent so long with this part, I understand but it makes me even more miserable. The one ray of hope I had feels like its been utterly destroyed.

Now, I don't know if he's spoken with his manager yet, so I don't know how he's going to react. I couldn't sleep last night because I had nightmares about it. Do I think I'm in immediate danger? No. But is it something I worry about? Definitely. I just don't know where to go to from here. My usual mentor is out on maternity leave and I have no one else in the workplace I feel comfortable enough talking to about this. Even if he's kicked off the project, he's still at the main hubs location most likely so it doesn't ease my mind, and would only make it worse.

I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. This is my FIRST full time job and I have zero idea how to handle this. At this point I've applied to two other positions outside of the company but I don't know if anything will come of those. Plus if I leave before a year I have to pay back my moving stipend. I'm sorry this is so long, I think part of it I just needed to get off of my chest. Any advice would be appreciated.


**TL;DR** ""Weird Guy"" at work started somewhat stalking me and became slightly obsessed with me despite telling him no. Went to his top management who was helpful, went to his second level management who was extremely demeaning. Miserable at job, this made it 100x worse. Need advice."

2.- I predict The presence will do an appearance, AT LEAST in a dream or a memory, we need to know why he sent Mum to hell, it could be a pretty strong reason.
3.-  Azrael: We saw Uriel and Azrael's blade again, Probably a hint to prepare us for her appearance, Also if I were her, I will come down to recover my toy back. I'm excited about that! what if she is Death from the endless. it would be AWESOME. 
4.- Michael.- Ok, I won't let my intern fanboy take over, but Michael can be a great villain in Season 3.
5.- I don't want to think negative, but Chloe and Lucifer relationship won't happen soon, why? Chloe will get mad at him for disappearing like that, and Lucifer, Knowing that she was made for him by his dad, will simply reject her or be confused for a long time.
6.- I really want to know more about Ella and Dr Linda, Ella is a super cool character and quickly became a fan favourite, and is like, the second time they instigate that Dr Linda has a dark past, so it will be totally cool to know more about them

I would like to first apologize if I picked the wrong tag, I was confused on which one to pick. 

Okay, time to get right into it: 
I first gained a lot of weight when I was around 11 years old. I never really noticed how much I weighed because all I cared about at the time was video games, toys, and well, food. I became obese and had risk of diabetes and heart disease. 
Fast forward a few years and i'm 21 years old, a senior in college and now more ashamed of how I look than I ever was. College has taught me three things so far and although these are cliches, they speak louder to me than anything else.
1.) If you don't ""hang out"" often, you seem to lack a sense of social aptitude.
2.) By now, 90% of people are non-virgins and have been in a relationship before, if you haven't, you're a minority and a little odd.
3.) If you have bad grades, a bad GPA, and haven't done internships, say goodbye to your career.

I admit that my first two years of uni were not praiseworthy, in fact, terrible. But I got my act together and i'm learning to do better. However, I seek guidance on the other things. The idea of being a virgin at 21 isn't really bothering me, but the act that i've never even been in a relationship before. It eats me up everyday and I would much rather focus that attention to other things, but it's harder than I thought it was. I've come to the conclusion that losing weight should be my #1 priority alongside graduation, however, something is holding me back, and I don't know what it is. For some reason, i'm so very afraid of losing weight to the point i'd rather die than try at all. It seems silly, but I don't know what's holding me back.

5r6uyk,3,2017-01-31,Am I going to be okay after graduation?,vinojpm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5r6uyk/am_i_going_to_be_okay_after_graduation/,"Hello,

I am in my 4th year of my undergraduate degree in Computing Science and am currently set to graduate within a 4 year time span (from entering post-secondary immediately out of high school). Currently, I'm extremely worried about my chances of acquiring a professional job and kickstarting my career, perhaps because of external factors such as my peers who are in the co-op (internship) program at my school. Going into school, I contemplated internships but was reluctant due to the fee required plus the delay on my graduation -- my plan was (and is) to complete school in 4 years, and I have worked years-long (fall, winter, and summer semesters) consecutively in order to do this, while looking after my family &amp; working a part-time job (20+ hours weekly).

On the note of my part-time, I have unrelated experience at a job I have had since 17 (coming up on 5 years there). I do some very minor software tasks to manage systems, but primarily act as a shift supervisor; my job is to ensure that tasks are being fulfilled and customers are satisfied.

I feel a heavy burden on my shoulders that because I haven't 'networked' or had relevant job experience,  and therefore that my chances of getting into an organization and making real impacts is weaker than my fellow peers. I pride myself on being a self-starter and quick learner of technology, having stuck to my educational goals,  and always completing programming assignments (and receiving good grades on them) -- and I really am eager to start my career. Virtually all of the opportunities in my area are full-time (of course), and the possibility of a part-time programming gig appearing is highly unlikely.

I have read on this subreddit of people that have been in my situation and managed to make it happen, and for this reason I am hopeful. I have been meticulously browsing job sites to look at the qualifications/desired skill-sets to understand what employers want, and I feel that I have (from an overhead view) what they require. At the current time, having school, part-time work, and looking after my family while also working on my own projects on any spare time that I can gather, I haven't had much time to 'professionalize' myself in terms of an up-to-date resume and portfolio. 

It seems a lot of organizations are currently seeking applicants to start in the summer semester (May 2017) til the end of December 2017 right now. Is it worth working hard to get my resume &amp; portfolio up to date and start looking for an internship ASAP, or should I continue on my current trajectory and finish off the remaining 2 semesters I have to get my degree, and fully commit myself to the working world?

I appreciate all the insights and advice given, and just the general feeling of explaining myself to other individuals who are in my field and may have been in my situation (for better or for worse)."

Here's a little background info. I currently work at Costco (Work in the food court) and I've been there for about 2 years. I haven't had any tech related jobs in the past and don't have much professional experience. I'm in my last semester of community college and will graduate with an AAS in IT and an AAS in Cisco Networking. Currently have my A+ cert, and will be taking my CCNA soon. I was recommended to try and apply for an IT internship program that my company holds over the summer. It sounded super interesting and sounded like a great opportunity for me. It's a paid internship, but travel expenses and living expenses will not be covered :/ (There might be an AirBnB, not exactly sure yet) Anyways, the internship is in Seattle, and I'm located in Arizona. So yeah, not exactly down the street. I really REALLY want to get my ass out of retail, and start an entry level help desk job, tech support, networking, or anything tech related. I know I can land a job, if I just tried and applied for stuff, but I'm not sure. Should I stay with the company for a little bit longer until the summer? Or should I just try and find another job right now? Would having an IT internship on my resume open the door to more job opportunities in the future? I know that I will be much happier in the IT field, but I don't want to blow an opportunity like this either. Any advice or thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I've been racking my brain for months. "

5r8zfm,1,2017-01-31,Wumba and Chaperon rush to a meeting on Amelia Nova. /WritingPrompts,the_divine_broochs,SimplyDivine,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplyDivine/comments/5r8zfm/wumba_and_chaperon_rush_to_a_meeting_on_amelia/,"######[](#dropcap)

Wumba Lange straightened his silk tie as his gaze drifted up the intricate and extravagant workings of the massive archway which stood before him. To the right stood a pillar three times his two meter height held three golden figures of boys, each nude and brandishing silver torches with bronze flames, encircled by a silver scarf which hinted at the genitalia hidden beneath. To the left was a pillar topped by a proud and stalwart statue of a bronze woman in a flowing silver toga, a golden spear in one hand and golden laurels in the other, her bronze wings spread wide as the golden eagle atop her silver helmet glittered as though designed to ensure every eye was drawn to her. 

“The Goddess Nike, Ambassador-Friend,” A polite synthetic voice came from behind Wumba. “Famous as the Greek Goddess of Victory, the Latins coopted the deity millennia ago. This interpretation is quickly overtaking the more traditional, less warlike visage.”

“Thank you, Chaperon,” Wumba turned as he spoke and smiled at the pleasant but blank face of his automaton companion. “I was having trouble placing which God of theirs it was.”

“This interpretation is much more like the traditional visage of Athena or Minerva.”

“The Wise Goddess,” Wumba frowned up at the glimmering statue. “And the Goddess of Wise War.”

“A loose definition, but not entirely inaccurate,” Chaperon’s pleasant tone betrayed no judgment.

Wumba’s frown deepened as his eyes rose up the extravagant archway. Gold, bronze, silver, copper, marble and gems, countless and unimaginably expensive rose further and further toward the purple clouds above. Centered immediately above the archway was the shining face of Sol, the Sun God which the Latins trumpeted as a conqueror of all inferior cultures and peoples. The shining light which would always lead the Latins to victory and prosperity, the dawn which would always come after the dark of night. Up, and up, and up, and up the arch continued. Small rooms were built into the structure, identifiable by the intricate and gleaming stained glass windows, and many flanked by gold, silver, and bronze statues of Gods, Goddesses, and countless other divine figures.

As scribes, interns, guards, and only the Gods know what other professions came and went through this towering example of Latin power, passing by Wumba and his slender automaton companion without much more than a cursory glance, the Ambassador could not help but feel repulsed by the whole display.

“How much blood was poured into the foundation of this monument to sin?” Wumba scoffed as he scrunched his face and sniffed, “You can almost smell the suffering.”

“Three-thousand-six-hundred-and-seventy-two worker deaths were recorded during construction,” Chaperon replied in his usual pleasant cadence, soliciting a sigh from Wumba.

“Thank you, Chaperon.”

“Would you like to know anything else, Ambassador-Friend?”

“No, Chaperon, that will be all,” Wumba removed his square-rimmed glasses while at the same time withdrawing a microfiber cloth from the breast pocket of his blazer and began to clean the thin glass lenses, staring beyond the massive arch to the now blurred structures and trees beyond. In the pleasant orange light of this planet’s star, the deep green of the trees contrasted against the faint vermillion reflection of a building in the distance reminded him of a hillside on Terra, long, long ago.

“Ambassador-Friend Wumba,” Chaperon’s voice brought Wumba back from his escape. “Our meeting with Prima Dux Thetis is in one half hour. We are approximately twenty minutes from the meeting location in the Capitol Building. I must recommend we proceed with haste.”

“Of course,” Wumba replaced the glasses on his nose and the microfiber cloth to his pocket before waving the automaton forward. “By all means, lead the way.”

Chaperon’s feet moved with a swiftness that would surprise the casual onlooker as he stepped past the Ambassador and tread up the marble stairs with little more than a gentle click to accompany each step. Despite the automaton’s surprising speed, Wumba was a step behind him as though a human shadow to the humanoid automaton. As the pair glided between two large groups of bickering and irritated sounding men Wumba smiled, amused as one of the men complained, “And with that barbaric embassy expected at any minute I have been made to run around like some sort of slave boy! Carry messages between departments just to keep them off the intranet! The nerve of Aulus! The nerve of Thetis!”

‘*Even so far from Terra the Latins think of us as barbarians,*’ Wumba shook his head as the groups faded with distance. ‘*After so many centuries they still think so little of Germans.*’

And so Wumba fumed as he followed Chaperon through the marble pathways of the Capitol Complex, stepping between and behind groups of people which sometimes muttered about their bothersome duties in the wake of an impending embassy and sometimes muttered about their disenchantment with all facets of life in the gray bureaucracy of the planet. It was not unexpected when Chaperon came to an abrupt stop before the shining white marble steps which lead up to another towering and glittering structure, obscured from the bottom of the stairs by a larger-than-life sized statue of Jupiter brandishing two lightning bolts like spears pointed down toward those which would walk toward him.

“Our destination is at the top of these stairs, Ambassador-Friend,” Chaperon tilted his head as he looked up at the intimidating statue, a peculiar motion which Wumba had come to know meant the automaton was perplexed by some facet of the world or culture he observed. “This statue is not in the records of the Amelia Nova Capitol Complex. Nor do I have any record of it being chartered by Prima Dux Thetis.”

“Does that really surprise you, Chaperon?”

The automaton’s head tilted just a bit further to the left before snapping upright with a click, “Official meeting time is in five minutes. We must return to this matter at a later time.”

“Of course,” Chaperon began to click up the stairs and Wumba grinned as he followed. His grin diminished with each step as the massive statue loomed ever nearer, the hard face seeming to glare down at him with violent intention. 

‘*This is not the wise father of the Gods which is often touted by the Latins,*’ Wumba drew a deep breath as they topped the stairs and were less than a meter from the huge base of the angry statue. ‘*This is Jupiter Optimus Maximus.*’

“The Best and Greatest,” Chaperon’s pleasant voice startled Wumba who caught the slight tilt of the automaton’s head before a booming voice drew both their attention to one side of the statue.

“Ah, the storied Ambassador Wumba and his automaton companion,” A rotund man in shimmering green boots and generous black robes started toward the pair with arms outstretched. “I was worried you might have become lost! Welcome to Amelia Nova, I am Oculum Veri Nonus Seppius. Let us make haste, slowly, to Thetis.”

It is an application that will use gps to create zones of interest on my university's campus map. Each zone of interest will have a little mini game that should serve as a learning aid to new students. This tool could go hand-in-hand with the university's orientation process.

I hope that by making that process more enjoyable and more 21st century-like, that the university will have higher retention rates.

The games are aimed to help students learn about: 

1. internship opportunities 

2. campus dining 

3. advising 

4. financial aid etc.

So my goal is to create this application that a new student could get on their phone, and during their first year, complete the challenges/games in the quest to become a model student.
So anyways, i'm getting ready to start the implementation process and decided to stop by this subreddit to see if anyone had any recommendations on how to tackle this. Any programs that you would recommend to start programming this.

I have knowledge of C++, Java, a bit of python, SQL

Rent in college city: $500/mo (no utilities)

Utilities in internship city: ~$100/mo

Food: ~$400 a month

Income: ~$1,000/mo

I'm in this internship from January to mid-April. We were told that we would be paid $5,200 total. I foolishly assumed this was after taxes and rented my (very expensive) place based on that. We get paid around $500 every two weeks, or $4,000 for the whole internship. I still pay rent on my place in my college town because I planned on going back on weekends. But I might have to find someone to rent it in the short-term.

During my previous semesters, I'd pay off a majority of my loan during the semester. When planning for this internship, I was okay with actually using my loan. But given what I just found out about my income, I'm panicking a little. If my math is correct, I can end up with $4,000 in the bank and $8,500 in loans, which is upsetting given I ended last year with $6,000 in the bank and $5,500 in loans.

5r983c,70,2017-01-31,Isaiah Thomas and Imagination at Work™,shnts07,bostonceltics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/5r983c/isaiah_thomas_and_imagination_at_work/,"The Celtics are one of the hottest teams in basketball in the month of January, and nobody has gotten hotter than Isaiah Thomas. **Thomas is as hot as a quality General Electric Wall Oven with spacious dual opening doors for cramped kitchens and incredible convection patterns that cook your food to perfection.** He's on an incredible run in 4th quarters and coming into last nights game, the Celtics offense was an incredible 1.249 PPP in the 4th quarter with him on the floor. For context, that would be a little less than 137 points over the course of a full pace-adjusted game.

Isaiah is an All-Star and he's got a shot at an All-NBA selection. He's the tiny soul of this team. For my money, there's no one more fun to watch in the NBA, and I'm incredibly proud that he developed the way he did here in Boston. He feels like a homegrown talent rather than a dude we traded Marcus Thornton for in hopes we could get a Jamal Crawford-ish sixth man. I guess my point here is that I love Isaiah Thomas. I love him so much and [trading for him](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/4ej3t1/the_luck_of_the_irish_part_ii/) is what pulled the Celtics out of the [trajectory for multiple lottery appearances](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/3o5ulq/the_rebuild_is_over/). 

There's a strong case to be made that if Isaiah Thomas never comes to town, there's no playoff games at the Garden in that Earth 2. The Celtics would be chasing the eight seed this year, and Al would be in Washington, dressing in black for a big showdown game against the Pacers to determine the 5th seed.

So, before I launch into the crux of what will be an emotion-stirring argument, Let's remember these over-arching truths that I agree with.

1. Isaiah Thomas is great and I'm very happy and lucky to have him on my team. In a vacuum where we don't have big cap plans, he's absolutely been worth a max contract these past two years. 

2. The Celtics are probably still in the lottery if Isaiah Thomas never comes to town, this by extension means Al Horford has never come to town and maybe Avery Bradley has been shipped for picks at this point.

3. Isaiah Thomas is a multi-time All-Star and the real soul of this team. At a certain point, sports have a to be about people and personalities you form attachments to, rather than cheering for laundry. If you can't find joy in what Isaiah Thomas is doing right now, well, I've got bad news about you enjoying basketball going forward.

**It never seems like IT bites off more than he can chew, and he takes really big bites. Fortunately, for the rest of us, there's GE Capital's affordable lending for consumer products. When things make me sad, nothing makes me feel better than buying a nice, quality product from one of my favorite brands. Unfortunately, two of my three jobs are unpaid internships for dog food and drone strike start-ups, so I don't really have the cash to get fine products like General Electric's Cafe Series™ Electric Cook Top, Energy-Star certified dishwashers, or compact Profile™ brand microwaves. Fortunately, GE Capital is here to ensure that I can get all my favorite products whenever I want. With an affordable 17% interest rate, I can have these products in my home today! Wow!** 

#####The King in the Fourth(?)

I'm going to start this by looking at 4th quarter scoring. Something important to know is that PPP means *points per possession*, or how many points the Celtics or their opponent score each time they have the ball. For context, the average PPP for the Celtics this year is 1.093 and the average PPP for Celtic's opponents is 1.062. This should help provide an anchor for when you read PPP totals to know what you are looking for. 

Over 1.093 from team offense = good offense

Under 1.062 from opposing team offense = good defense

Under 1.093 from team offense = bad offense

Over 1.062 from opposing team offense = good defense

So let's talk about Isaiah Thomas and his 4th quarters when he's on the floor.

*All numbers are courtest of nbawowy.com &amp; don't include last night's Detroit game because it took me forever to run them and I have a day job. Please find it in your heart to forgive me.*


| It On the Floor  | Poss | Celtics PPP  | Opp PPP | Net PPP |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Isaiah Thomas | 666 | 1.254 | 1.240 | 0.014

So as you can see, when IT is on the floor in 4th quarters, the Celtics offense goes Super Saiyan. As we touched on before, that's a pace adjusted scoring margin of about 137 when pace adjusted for an entire game. What might be a little bit surprising is when take a peek at the defensive numbers and see that the Celtics are getting walloped almost as bad in terms of opponent 4th quarter scoring.

That's troubling, but hardly a new narrative. We've see the Celtics struggle with complex defensive issues this year such as ""screens"" and I think I've actually seen Weakside Help for Dummies underneath Gerald's cocoa cup a couple of games ago. The good news is that when the Celtics struggle this mightily in the 4th quarter. They have Isaiah Thomas to fix things and keep them afloat. In fact, let's check out how bad the numbers are for the Celtics when Isaiah Thomas *isn't* on the floor.

| It Off the Floor  | Poss | Celtics PPP  | Opp PPP | Net PPP |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Isaiah Thomas | 427 | 1.143 | 0.981 | 0.162

Huh, that's weird, but, again, probably pretty explainable. Rare are the fourth quarter minutes that Isaiah Thomas doesn't play, but they are mostly against opposing bench units. Despite the grumbling and groaning about Kelly Olynyk, the Celtics have one of the most potent benches in the league, so to see them ether opponents at the end of games isn't that shocking. It's a little weird that this logic doesn't extend to those games (like yesterday) when Thomas plays a full 4th quarter and gets minutes against those tender bench units, but whatever, it's pretty easy to come up with some plausible reasons for this. Thomas plays some 4th quarter minutes with the worst members of the Celtics. In fact, let's look at Thomas's most common teammates in the 4th quarters.

IT 4th quarter Teammate | # of Poss
:--: | :--:
Marcus Smart | 421
Al Horford | 356
Jae Crowder | 350
Avery Bradley | 336
Jonas Jerebko | 262
Kelly Olynyk | 211
Terry Rozier | 198
Amir Johnson | 184
Jaylen Brown | 159

Hmm, it still looks like it's mostly the crunch time guys that Thomas plays with. However, that doesn't mean much. There's still a pretty plausible rotation explanation that would explain where Thomas gets unfairly hammered for dopey teammates and tough opposing match-ups. So let's take a look at the full array of 4th quarter minutes complete with on/off differential for each rotation player who's played over 400 minutes.

| 4th Quarter Poss | Poss On | Net PP On | Poss Off | Nef PPP Off | Net On/Off Diff |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Marcus Smart  | 700     | 0.093     | 393      | 0.033       | 0.060           |
| Isaiah Thomas | 666     | 0.014     | 427      | 0.162       | -0.148          |
| Avery Bradley | 550     | 0.077     | 543      | 0.066       | 0.011           |
| Al Horford    | 528     | 0.016     | 565      | 0.113       | -0.097          |
| Terry Rozier  | 526     | 0.095     | 567      | 0.049       | 0.046           |
| Jae Crowder   | 505     | 0.088     | 508      | 0.058       | 0.030           |
| Jonas Jerebko | 451     | 0.096     | 642      | 0.054       | 0.042           |

*I realized after I finished this I should have but Amir, KO, and Jaylen in here, but went back for the numbers nbawowy wasn't working, I'll comment below with them when they come up, but I had ran them before and know that Jaylen and Amir were also quite positive while Kelly was about half as negative as Al is.*

So here is where we hit the crux of things. There's a way to explain away the Celtics pedestrian 4th quarter differential with Thomas. The problem is that for that to hold water you need to have someone in the rotation who is actually worse. 

**The other thing that holds water is GE's extensive line of Energy-Star approved washers and dryers. I can't tell you how often I come home and the last thing I want to do is head out to the laundromat. Luckily, thanks to GE Capital's incredible financing and helpful installation coordination, I have my own GE, double load sized washer in my home that handles all my biggest loads of laundry! Like all GE products they are so affordable and high quality.**

The next closest in terms of having a bad showing is Al Horford, and his numbers are only about 2/3rds as bad. Al is one of the Celtics three most important players, so don't mistake this as me saying he's not earning his money. He's been incredible for the Celtics, too. However, that kind of makes since given what we've seen from Horford in some 4th quarters. Al has had some well-documented struggles down the stretch of several games and he got hammered by the Felgers of the world for it. 

The fact that Isaiah Thomas can do what he does for the Celtics every 4th quarter night in and night out and still end up with the worst Net On/Off differential by far isn't just weird, it should be downright impossible.  You can look around and squint for other things to pin this on, but at a certain point, Occum's Razor has to come into effect and the conclusion needs to be that the Celtics are giving back almost all of their 4th quarter points because of how bad having Isaiah Thomas on the floor makes the defense.

#####IT's Defense, Unsalvagable?

No. 

The Celtics were a perfectly fine defensive team with Isaiah Thomas on the floor last year. In fact all of these things I'm hammering IT for now, like Net Rating and On/Off differential, all swung the other way last year. The Celtics were great with Thomas on the floor and had big scoring margins and fell apart when Thomas left the floor. 

This probably means that something about this team makes it much less easy to cover up IT's deficiencies than last year's team did. I'm willing to bet that that thing is rebounding and turnover differential. You can have a good defense with Isaiah Thomas in it. You can have a good defense when you don't rebound that well. Surviving both is probably a bit of a bridge too far.

You could also make the case that this sample size isn't that big. This probably amounts to about a 10 game sample size in terms of regular minutes. While that's a pretty small sample size, it's also a single-digit denominator fraction of the season, which isn't that small either. It would be foolish to just take this numbers as fact at this point, but likewise, this is enough of a trend that to discount them would be silly also.

#####What Does It Mean?

I guess it depends on what you see the path forward for this team being. This is a problem for the team. Is the fact that Marcus Smart has been more important to the Celtics outscoring opponents than Isaiah Thomas an indicator of a fatal flaw in Thomas or a damning indictment of the front office not putting the guys they need around their superstar?

Is the fact that Al Horford can't help the team cover for IT as well as Jared Sullinger a misscalculation by Danny or throwing the limitations of Thomas into a sharper relief?

If you're old school, you can just chaulk it up to the Celtic's ""not competing"" or ""eye test"" or whatever and say that they just don't try as hard on defense. I disagree, but we can follow that line of logic. That would be great because it would mean the Celtics have just been coasting this whole time and will be able to turn it on in the playoffs.

Whatever you think, the Celtics have a defense problem when Isaiah Thomas is on the floor and it compounds when he's at his most potent in the 4th quarters. 

That's a fact.

He's playing out of his mind right now and the Celtics have continued to win because he's done enough to keep the Celtics outscoring their opponents with this other-wordly outbursts, but what's going to happen when (or if) he comes back to earth?

No matter what you think the problem is, if this trend holds up, the consequences will materialize hard and fast in the playoffs, where weaknesses are targeted. It might not matter, because a championship this year is probably no what this team was built for (Markelle Fultz... Hello), but this is the kind of thing that can bring the good times screeching to a halt come playoff time.

#####TL;DR

The Celtics have been very bad on defense in 4th quarters with Isaiah Thomas on the floor.

This could mean:

1. The Celtics aren't trying hard, eye test, everybody loves their shot, etc.

2. There's a 'lower than perceived' ceiling on how much Isaiah Thomas can contribute to winning

3. The personnel on this team aren't capable of adequately hiding the deficiencies of our superstar.

Also, advertising sucks."

I also purposely don't use any names in it.
As this is so far my best sexual experience, I try to cover as many details as possible.
I know that this is very long, but I couldn't really find a way to split it, without loosing the tension. I marked the places when things started to get serious, just in case if you're only interested in that.

There are always some people, you just can't get along with. I had to work with somebody like that for some time and he was simply a total jerk.
He always wanted all eyes on him and be the center of every conversation. At first he may look very handsome, but he was just a fake from top to bottom. I have to give it to him: He could really impress people with his confident behaviour and speak, but there was nothing behind it.
Whenever he was with us, he was always speaking about the same: New sports cars he wanted to buy, money and how successful he was with women. We were both around 20 years old and I had already grown out of this childish stuff. 
We actually never met in private, but since we were the same age and lived in the same area, we sometimes met randomly at a party.

It was at one of these parties I've met his then-girlfriend for the first time. I had to give it to him: He had scored nicely !
She was maybe one or two years younger, about 5'2', had shoulder long, dark brown hair that she wore as a pony, brown eyes and she was wearing something to die for. I don't know how many pieces her outfit had, but it was a black, shinny fabric and was classy and totally indicent at the same time.
The top part looked a bit like a swimsuit, two stripes of fabric came from her shoulders, crossed over her boobs and went to the back. Her cleavage was absolutely gorgeous, a nice handful that looked round and firm. You could even see a slight bump of her nipples in the stripes that covered them.
She had a flat, fit belly. almost a littlebit of a sixpack, with a nice little piercing in her bellyutton. The dress ended up in very tight pants that revealed her firm thighs, with a little gap between the legs. On the back you could see very much skin and her ass was maybe a bit wide, but nicely round and very well packed in that dress.
I have to say: I was totally jealous and just wanted to touch every part of that nice, sexy girl. But it wasn't (yet) to be.

I don't think I haven't seen her until what happend next, but I sometimes had to think about her.
One day my coworker showed up and said that I had to do him a favour. At first I wasn't interested in doing anything for him, but curious as I was I asked what this was about ? He said that he wanted revenge on his ex !
He explained that she had left him (good girl) and this was something that his ego couldn't deal with. So he had set up a fake online identity and was chatting with her for a while now. The plan was that I should take over, meet and fuck her then reveal, that this was arranged by him... what ?!
This wasn't right, what the hell was he thinking ? Didn't he had any moral at all ? I was really curious about that and didn't really wanted to let it happen, so I agreed, not knowing what to do about it. So he handed me all the details and now I was part of his game.
I have to say: The idea of banging her really turned me on, but the plan itself didn't really, I had to figure out how to handle this.

The same evening I changed the password of the account he had given me and started to text with the girl. She seemed a bit light hearted and naive but we had some really nice chats. We talked about sex but didn't really went into detail.
As it happened, she wanted me to call her after a while, just to figure things out before we maybe go on a date. It took me two days before I was ready for this, but she pushed onwards and so I called her... She sounded so happy and was talking very fast and with a very high pitch. I didn't wanted to harm that girl in any way, it wasn't right.
So I told her to sit down, because I would have to explain something. She was worried and her tone dropped immediately. I revealed as nicely as I could what this was all about and she was lost for words for a moment or two, but didn't start crying or anything. I knew that this might be over by now, but it luckily wasn't.
After a few seconds she got herself together and simply answered, that she doesn't mind and would really like to meet me, even more since I seem to be a very honest, carrying person. So we arranged to meet in the city for something to drink and have a chat.
My heart dropped again as I saw her for the second time: Her hair was a bit messy, like she came straight out of the bed, but this gave her such a cute touch. As it was winter she was wearing a sweatshirt and some wide trousers. But it fitted her so well and I just wanted to cuddle with that girl.
We had a couple of coffees, a really nice talk and I figured out, that she wasn't really lucky with the men she had chosen so far. I brought her back to her place, she gave my a kiss on my cheeks and that was it for the moment. Altought nothing more happened, I was happy that everything came out alright.

We had a few chats afterwards and I had the impression, that nothing more was going to happen.
Then one friday she said, that she would be at her parents house over the weekend and her they wouldn't be home at saturday. She wanted to give me a gift for what I had done for her and so I went there on saturday morning.
She opened the door with her cutest smile and let me in. She was wearing tight jeans and a sweatshirt, nothing too revealing and I was a bit reliefed that this went totally normal so far. She offered me something to drink and we sat on her bed but not really close to each other, listening to music and chatting. 
We talked a few minutes before she said it was time for my gift. I already felt that its not going to be sex and it wasn't: She handed me something she crafted herself using a glass cube. It was nicely painted and simply a decor to look at. I liked it very much and still have it. I gave her a kiss on her cheek and said thanky you.

----ROUND ONE, PART ONE: THE BLOWJOB----

But then things turned in a good way. She grabbed my hand an asked if I could do her another favour. My heart started to beat faster, the look she gave me went straight trough me, this was next level sexy and she just did it with her eyes only. ""I just want a kiss, the most passionate one you can offer"".
I grabbed her head with both hands, came close to her and could smell her natural odor for the first time, it was really inviting. She had smooth, silky lips and I started to kiss her with our mouths shut at first. This kiss seemed to go on forever and after some time, we slightly open our mouths and our tongues touched each other for the first time.
She knew what she was doing. She massaged my tongue with hers in a very pleasing way, I couldn't get enough of that. I started to kiss her neck, her skin was just so clean and tight, this girl was just absolutely gorgeous in any way.
She moaned a littlebit and I slightly grabbed her ass with my hands, it felt so damn good even trough the jeans she was wearing. She pushed me back a littlebit, looked me in the eyes and took off her sweatshirt, she was wearing a red satin bra and I could see her firm, round, really nice boobs again. I took of my sweater and shirt and started to kiss her again.

We pressed our half naked bodies against each other as hard as we could, we were both completely on fire. My kisses went down again, on her neck in her cleavage and over her still covered boobs. As firm as they looked, they were pumping hot and as I touched them they were totally soft. But I didn't want to rush it, this girl was just the next level.
I turned her around, again starting with the kisses at her neck and then down her spine, that was clearly visible on her back. There was not a single part of her body that was not astonishingly fit and firm. My hands went up and down on her sides, this was better than I've ever imagined before.
I ended up above her jeans, but again: I didn't wanted to rush this ! I turned her around again, kissed upwards from her bellybutton until we were kissing eachother again, I felt our bodies pumping as we pressed them against each other.
I grabbed her hair, her ass, touched her sides, I just wanted to touch every inch of her hot body over and over again. She went trough my hair, along my sides, also grabbed my ass and even scrachted a littlebit my back, that was so damn hot.

This went on for minutes, we just kissed like there's no tommorow, still kneeling on her bed. And then she opened up my trousers, just the button and the zipper. Her warm hand went straight into my shorts, she went along my hard, pulsating dick, squeezed it a bit and took her hand out again, my god: I could explode right now as he whispered in my ear ""It feels good"".
She started to kiss my neck, went down over my chest while her hands went along my sides, and then she pulled down my trousers. My shorts were already soaking with precum, she smiled and giggled. She told me to lay down on her bed, and took my shorts off as I did so, my stone hard boner was right in front of her face.
For s slight moment I wasn't sure if my average 6.5"" long, but above average thick (about the same number), partly cut dick was enough for this gorgeous girl, but she immediately pushed that tought away as she said ""You're the first cut one I've ever had and I already love it"". She touched it with the inside of her open hand and went along it, this was unbelievably hot, my entire body shaked. I was so happy that I had shaved and showered before.
She started liking my balls and went upwards my shaft, while one hand still gently massaged my balls. Her lips touched my glans and she slowly took it all in while holding my dick with the other hand. She just said ""Just let it go, it's alright"" and then moved her mouth and my skin slowly up and down while sucking slightly. I've almost faded away, I was so in heaven.
It only took a minute or two before she had a massive load in her mouth, my entire body shaked, every muscle was as tight as it could get and I moved up and down with every load that came out. She took it all in, swallowed it and cleaned my dick with her lips and tongue. Now it was my turn: I just wanted to eat that girl out and give her the same pleasure she had just given me.

---ROUND ONE, PART TWO: EATING HER OUT----

I grabbed her by the side, pushed her onto the bed and pulled the jeans down, revealing the matching red satin slip to her bra. The slip was soaking wet and as I took it off, she immediately spreaded her legs and there was her nice, juicy, hot and wet pussy. She had a little landing stripe over her vulva, which was really nicely trimmed and I loved every single thing about what I saw.
Her outter lips were just the right size, the inner ones really short and firm, the mouth was slightly open and her clit was looking at me as it had its own eyes. I couldn't resist a single moment. My tongue started to lick and push that clit, my fingers went in one after the other. She moaned and her body started to shake.
She smelled really nice down there and I wanted to lick and touch every single bit of her. My tongue went inside her, I wished it was longer so I could explore more of her inside. My fingers went up and down the outside of her lips while still keeping care of her clit.
I liked her hole, massaged her butthole and simply licked everything I could get my tongue on, this was incredible, she was incredible. I just wanted to get her off as much as possible and she did. Her fit, tight body shaked up and down, she started to roll from side to side, moaning and almost screaming. Her body was pumping, every part of her was tightend up.
I touched her everywhere, didn't stop to work on her clit and my tongue was still in full motion, I didn't want her to stop going off. This was maybe the longest climax I've ever seen on a woman and it was so nice to give it to her, even now thinking and writing about it makes me horny as hell.

---ROUND ONE, PART THREE: THE TITTYFUCK----

Eventually it was over and she started to giggle, I went up on her and we kissed each other, I already had a boner again. I opened her bra and took it off. My god: Her boobs totally matched the rest of her. They were firm and soft at the same time, a nice handful with small nipples that pointed a bit outwards, they were rock hard.
I've started to massage them, kissing and licking them, her boobs alone were a thing to die for and I couldn't get enough of them. After a while she laughed and offered me to have a seperate date alone with her boobs, my god that girl was simply gorgeous. Then she had that look again, without saying anything she turned me around and slightly touched my dick with her hands.
As she felt that it was already rock solid, she put it between her boobs, squeezed them together and started moving up and down. I never had a tittyfuck before and maybe her boobs were a littlebit to small for this, but it felt really good and I loved watching her moving up and down.

---ROUND ONE, FINAL PART----

Eventually I leant toward her, grabbed her hair again and pulled her back, we started to kiss each other again for minutes or so while pleasing each other with our hands. Then without me doing anything she reached over to a bedside table, grabbed a rubber and pulled it over my dick.
She started to rub her clit on my glans, it was hot and wet and I couldn't wait to be inside her, but she was in charge now and I wanted her to have the maximum pleasure. And then she let it slip in... we both moaned together. My dick was a perfect fit, I could feel every bit of her, even wearing a rubber.
As she started moving up and down I wanted to get in touch with her clit, but she took my hand away and ment, my dick was in charge of that and it was doing it nicely, I was in heaven and closed my eyes, grabbed her sides and moved up and down with her. We were breathing and moving together, our eyes shut, just feeling each other.
As I had gone off before, I was able to withstand that for a far bit of time and I was so happy as she came shortly before me. We smiled at each other, kissed, cuddled and were just really happy. This may have been the best sex I've ever had in my life so far.

---ROUND TWO----

We just lay in bet for an hour or so, giggled, cuddled and just enjoyed the moment. Then she offered me a shower. I tought that this would be it, so she handed me a towel and I went off to the bathroom. She didn't join at first, but it didn't took very long... As I was cleaning myself up, I heard her open the door and walking towards me. She pulled back the curtain and joined in.
This was the first time I saw her standing completely naked in front of me. I still can see that picture and it makes me so happy that I met that girl. At first we just started to clean each other up, but I was so horny again. It was again her who took the lead, so she turned off the water, took a towel and just rubbed my boner dry.
She took my hands and we went back to her bed. She again put a condom on and we simply went for the good old missionary position. This was so nice. It was nothing compared to our long sexual journey we had before but this time, I saw her boobs shaking forth and back, her lovely smile and her eyes. This time I came before her and had to finish her with my hands.
We kissed some more, but were both totally exhausted. Our bodies became extremely sensitive and we just touched each other slightly, just enjoying what had happened so far.
Then it was time for a proper shower and this time, nothing more happened. So we met again in her kitchen as she offered to make us a small snack.

---ROUND THREE---

She was wearing a white t-shirt, no bra and some bright green panties. She even looked very nice in that casual dressing. We couldn't really talk much when we sat next to each other, since we both giggled and were still totally exhausted. I was so fascinated by her lovely smile and everytime she leant forward I could see her nice boobs in her t-shirt. I couldn't believe it, but I got horny again...
As we finished our sandwiches, she was about to clean the kitchen. I wanted to help her, but instead I went into her bedroom and grabbed another condom. She didn't seem to notice that and maybe tought that I went to the toilet. As I came back, I already took my trousers off. I grabbed her sides from the back, pushed my crotch against her ass and my hands went up under her shirt.
She seemed a bit shocked, but let it happen. She was so exhausted that I had to take the lead and I didn't wanted to ruin this, so I went really slowly. We were standing in front of the sink. I was holding her sides under her t-shirt and my hands went slowly upwards. I kissed her neck and her hair, it was still slightly wet and smelled really nice.

When I reached the side of her boobs, I just gently grabbed them from underneath, slowly and gently massaging them. We still were both very sensitive and by now means did I wanted to hurt her. She started moaning a bit, but we didn't say a single word and she even started to giggle again, I loved that so much.
I reached down and pulled off her panties, but dind't wanted to put it in just yet, I had to be gentle. She slightly spread her legs, just enough for me to kiss her clit and her pussy. She was hot and a bit wet again. I started fingering her, but only with one single finger, still doing everything very carefully.
She moaned and opened up a bit more. When the juice almost started to run down her leg, I stood up, pulled down my shorts and slowly went into her. She reacted exactly the right way. I pulled of her t-shirt, kissing her neck and spine as I slowly moved up and down.
I was able to do that for quite some time. Her breathing got heavier and heavier and as I bought her to climax, her knees even got a bit weak. I came almost instantly after her. It wasn't the best climax of this day, but it was still amazing. We kissed each other once again and then it was time to leave.
I remember that driving home wasn't an easy thing, since my car back then had no power steering and my entire body was low on energy. Sadly I couldn't met her on sunday since her parents were back home.

One of the next days she texted me, that she had to move to another city for an internship at a hospital. We've never spoken about a relationship or so, but this broke my heart a littlebit.
Before she left, we wanted to meet at a party close to were she lived. Sadly she was there with some friends and I couldn't really get her for me, it was a disappointing.
I so hardly wanted her to stay, and I just wanted her ! She was wearing a really nice, dark blue, long one piece dress with a nice, but not too big cleavage. It had a nice cutout on the back, so one could see her lovely back. I so wanted to kiss that, I wanted to kiss her... everywhere.
I almost wanted to say goodbye when she came to me and said, that we should leave and just go somewhere private. We couldn't go to her place, since she was living together with two other girls and since I was studying part-time I was still with my parents, so my place was no option either.

---FINAL ROUND---

We finally ended up in the storageroom of the company I was working for. Not really romantic, but it was warm and there was no one around, I also knew that there were no cameras on the inside and I had a key for this place that was officially given to me, so this was okay.
We started kissing again, passionately but with a bit of tension, we both knew that this was maybe the last time for long, or even for ever.
As she stood in front of me, I pulled her dress over her shoulders and it felt to the floor. I couldn't believe what I saw ! She was wearing one of these bras that just holds everything in place from underneath, but exposes her breasts completely ! She had some sort of stickers over her nipples but underneath they were already hard.
I gently peeled them off, trying not to hurt her and started kissing and sucking her hard nipples. She moaned, smiled and bit into my ear, no girl had ever done this before and it was sexy.

I could feel her, smell her, touch and kiss her again, it was so good ! She took her bra off and I dove into her breasts, my hands went up between her legs and touched her black slip she was wearing along side stockings, but no girther ring. It looked so damn sexy on her thighs. I went on and I started to finger her. But then she simply couldn't hold it back any longer.
I was pushed back, she pulled of all my clothes and was already about to open a condom, gladly it was on after a couple of seconds. She layed herself on a table, looked me in the eyes and said ""this time, I need it hard"". These eyes, that filthy smile, that juicy wet pussy, simply everthing. Her legs were spread wide open...
I wished my cock was twice as long as I entered her hot, soaking pussy. I wanted to do it as hard and deep as possible. I moved as fast as I could, sometimes my dick flipped out and everytime I put it back in, it was simply heaven. The table and everyting around it was shaking, soon after our bodies were too. I had a really hard time holding it back, but managed to bring her to climax, she
screamed as she reach it and I went off like a rocket. I had to sit down next to her, my knees were weak and I felt like all my energy was gone trough my penis into her. We smiled at each other, kissed and then put our clothes back on. This couldn't get any better and we were both completely exhausted.
I brought her home, without anything further happening. At the doorstep we once again kissed each other passionately, interestingly we both said ""Thank you"" almost at the same time and this was it... she left two or three days afterwards and I've only seen her once at a shop by accident, when she was visiting her parents (she was in a relationship at this time).

Writing this, I feel that I really miss her and oh boy do I miss that body. This was by far the hottest sexual experience I've ever had and to be honest: It was the only one were I could stand four times in a row.
The only thing I know about her, since we lost contact after a while, is that she is now married. Lucky bastard...
Ah by the way: I told my coworker that it didn't worked out and she wasn't interested in me... he had no idea !"

There's a lot of background, so I hope you'll bear with me. TLDR at end.

I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables (perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I'd expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke, and some other things; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make. My coworker constantly make me feel inadequate, and I felt like I had nothing to contribute to what was meant to be one of the most important tasks of my career. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving my well-being and the quality of my life.

---

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and out of more than 60 applications so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications and no interviews (I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all applicable jobs in them.

For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family has being pretty supportive of my decision to leave grad school, my choices of where I want to go and what I want to do, and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture basically about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

The day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that if it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser (this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items. I’d only told a few very close friends because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad, and I only found out about it because my sister confronted me afterwards. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

My mom called me a few days later. She basically ignored the job posting and acted as if nothing had happened; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s talked about to others, truthfully or otherwise. I’ve trying to decide if I should keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family."
5r9scs,1,2017-01-31,Anyone have advice about Engineering internships for freshmen?,gordoa40,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/5r9scs/anyone_have_advice_about_engineering_internships/,"Hello everyone, I'm currently a freshman majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Plan II, and I'm looking into attempting to get an internship for this upcoming summer. I'm not sure how often freshmen are able to get internships, but I would like to try in order to get valuable work experience and possible future job opportunities.

Problem is, I don't really have much experience in the field as it's only my first year and my classes haven't really delved that deeply into actual engineering topics yet. I've hardly even had any lab experience yet, aside from my AP classes in high school and the lab that I'm currently in right now for BME303L. I'm a quick learner, and I feel that I could actually be helpful in a lab environment even if I'm simply doing grunt work, but it seems like you need experience to get internships and work, but you need internships and work to get experience, so I'm not exactly sure how to go about it. My resume is somewhat lacking in that there really isn't much on there that would stand out to these biomedical companies (in my opinion).

One idea I had was to research Biomedical/Pharma companies that interest me in the Austin area and attempt to contact their higher-ups and invite them out to lunch, and simply talk with them about what they did to get to the point where they are now. Not necessarily in an attempt to actually land an internship with them, just to find out what steps I can take to guide my career in the direction that I want to. Might be a bit -- I don't know -- ambitious?, but I feel like, if they accepted and I made a good impression and seemed interested enough, I could learn valuable information and expand my network and, even if I don't land an internship for this summer, it could be helpful in landing one next year. 

I'm not opposed to pursing research on campus either, but I feel that that goal is even more far fetched considering my lack of experience and the fact that there are many other student's (with more experience) trying to get into the same labs.

What do you guys think? What kind of resources are there on campus that may be able to guide me in the right direction? I'm considering going to ECAC, but I figured I'd make this post first and see what you have to say.

This got pretty long, so I apologize for that, but thanks for reading and I look forward to seeing if there's anyone in the same boat or who may have been in the past that can give me a little bit of advice."

I interned at this company over the summer in their Enterprise Department working with a software called Team City.

The plan was for me to get hired on after graduating but the company is going through issues with layoffs and what nuts and was told they're not hiring any employees right now in the department. So  my team lead extended my contract as a full time contractor now until March. Not too sure if what exactly will happen in March but hoping for an employee hire. My problem here is not the contract situation but I'm being paid as the same way I was when I was a student. Is this legal? I meet with my lead for lunch on Thursday to just speak my mind to her and wtf is goi g on with me and this job. I have a bachelors degree in IT.

A local community college has two associate degree options that seem like they would be a good first step towards being a sysadmin, but I'm not sure which to choose.  One is called [System Administration Specialist](https://madisoncollege.edu/program/systems-administration-specialist) and the other is [Network Security Specialist](https://madisoncollege.edu/program/network-security-specialist) .  Outside of the obvious benefit of one having System Administration in its title, the security one looks a bit more interesting to me.  Will there be a tangible difference in which one would look better to employers?  Both can be used to transfer to a 4 year to work towards a BS, an option I'm considering, and both involve an internship.  Any advice would be appreciated."

I have a job with a fixed period of employment so I won't just be getting there and looking for work, Im just looking for some insight on the town.  I've done a bit of due diligence and see my best bet for housing would be TradeMe or Easyrommate for a room, or dun cannon, koanui, or copper beech for a hostel.

What is the best route to get to Blenheim?  I was thinking to fly to Wellington and then take the ferry to Picton, then (train or bus????) down to Blenheim.  Would Christchurch be better given the road situation?

Anyways, working in wine has been my life the past ten years and It will be interesting to see another region.

Any help would be appreciated, if you have a room to let maybe I'll take it!

We certainly take international interns here in Northern California and I no doubt respect them a bit more for the leap of faith they take.

I failed the exam right after NYE and then we've had an overly long 4-week semester-break and two days ago we had to start up again. I have the most intense anxiety and because of that I couldn't bring myself to go yesterday and today I stayed home too.

There's a re-examination later in spring, but I gotta be honest and I've not learned a thing almost. Somehow I managed to get through the first two semesters by leaning on my knowledge with theory but I have zero skills when it comes to practicing it and that's where I failed. I also failed because I am avoidant and I just don't work well with people and they constantly require me to figure out groups myself and time upon time again I have been put into the last possible group because I'm too shy. I had some aquintances but they're way gone now. I'm afraid to show up because people know me now but don't care for me and I just failed and everything feels like a failure.

Fuck it. Nothing works and i feel like this is not worth pursuing. The only reason I hadn't already quit is because I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can't pay my bills without the supplement and I'm not going back to my parents because... well, things aren't really that good between me and them and I feel incredibly alone.

I've tried to think rationally the entire day but I can't. I've thought about going to the student counseling tomorrow but every time I think about it I get anxious and start sweating, and honestly I can't decide what I want to do. They expect us to be finding internship for summer which has a deadline soon and with my failed exam everything feels like it's collapsing, and without anyone I care about or vice versa but only people I'm scared of, I just don't wanna be here anymore.

Worst thing is my family. Everyone at home and my sister haven't been doing well themselves lately. I think they're all depressed or something and I feel too much pressure doing this, which I was never sure of in the first place. I just don't wanna bring any bad news but I feel like I can't take care of myself right now and I'm just in a bind.

It's driving me crazy. What will I do?"

Surely there must be something that gives edge to these students due to their tougher course?**

I feel really demoralised thinking about this stuff. I am wary that one advantage is of being surrounded by like minded peers; in my university, hardly anyone's interested in the CS stuff I am interested in - most people from my uni end up going into consulting or IT.

* **4) Careers fair in my place sucks! Do I really need to have a referral in order to have even the slightest chance to land an internship at the Big 4 companies because online application probably already get lost or filtered out by university?**

* **5) Also I am a UK student, and I would prefer to have internship in the US at a decent company as software intern in my sophomore year. I would like to be able to shift to US after my 3 year BSc program... any tips or things I should be looking out for?**

* **6) I have also heard that the first job is very important. Any advice for mid-tier students to get a really good paying job similar to top-tier students?**

* **7) What knowledge from CS program is required for internships at the big 4 that mid tier CS programs don't cover but top-tier ones do?**

PS: Perhaps my questions are very biased, however, for a long time I have been feeling like I am cut-off from reality and that there seems to be a barrier between top-tier students and the rest of us.

I'm too caring and it always leads to me being hurt. I can't help it. I guess i'm just too naive. I got bullied brutally when i was in school. I got beaten up 3-4 times a day by ""kids"" that were 8 years older than me. I didn't even do anything to deserve it. I was just shy and alone on the new school. The perfect victim, i guess. I was in 5th grade, they were in 13th grade, yet they still beat me up. At home, my stepdad had fun torturing me. He even broke my arm once. The scars never really healed and it fucked up my life. I was lonely, depressed and scared of people for the last 10 years. I barely have anyone. My anxieties fucked up my school. I dropped out and abused drugs for 2 years, sometimes working and kinda trying not to be a loser. Now i tried to finish school. 2 Days of school a week, 3 days of internship. After a few weeks, my workplace lots its biggest customer and they had to fire the internees. I didn't find a new place since then and i will have to redo the 11th grade. I don't know how i'm supposed to continue like this. Before, i fucked up stuff myself. Because i was scared of people. But this time i forced myself. I started smoking to get over the anxiety and it kind of helped. And just when i tried everything i could, it all fails again. I don't want to continue. I want to kill myself every evening. I cry myself to sleep, imagining how i'm finally putting a bullet through my brain. Every. Single. Night. I'm alone. I have noone. It never got any better, no matter how much i tried. Now i'm turning 20 and i'm still a loser. If there wasn't someone i got to know recently, who made me feel better, i would probably kill myself. I want to end everything but i guess i won't do it for her. I wish i could end it tho."

I'll be finishing up my undergrad degree after this semester and currently have an internship at a small CPA firm near my school. I've mainly been processing payroll and doing bank recs for small companies in the area along with some simple tax returns. I'll most likely get offered a job here where one of the partners has already said I would focus on tax. They don't do much auditing and the ones they have are very small clients. 

The pay here would be much more competitive than I would have thought and it is hourly which means I would do very well during tax season but have a Friday off every now and then and work mostly around 40 hours the rest of the year. The plus here would be that I could use the downtime to get the CPA exam out of the way quickly. After this I plan on getting a Master's degree, most likely in Information Technology. 

I have two questions really. First off how difficult would it be transitioning into forensics after I get my Masters if I start out in tax? 

Second how helpful would the IT Master's degree be? I feel like something that develops computer skills and knowledge would be beneficial but is there another related degree that might be a better fit?

Would love to hear from you guys, especially if you have experience in the forensics area. Thanks for taking the time to help me out.

Can you share some wisdom if you were in a similar situation?",blasetoys,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5rby6o/lost_boy_wrong_degree_disappointing_his_parents/,"I'm a recent graduate and received a degree in Biological Sciences with a 3.6 GPA. From my 3rd year onwards, I've been working towards becoming a dentist. I was even able to land a 99th percentile on the Dental Admissions Test. Things changed when I started applying for schools. I started questioning on whether I had a passion in the field from my internships, let alone if I was prepared to face the 500k+ accumulated debt from the unreasonably high costs of dental school. I subconsciously found myself browsing the internet for other career paths. I scrolled through forums for pharmacy, optometry, medicine, PT, and even clinical lab sciences, but to be frank, I could not imagine myself in any of those fields. 

Nothing about their daily lives sparks an interest in me, and I could not imagine doing something like that for the rest of my life. Now, I feel a certain sense of agony for being so lost in life. I'm itching to get my life started; I just need a sense of direction.

Though my parents don't directly state it, I feel as if their patience for my indecisiveness is running thin. I feel as if I'm wasting their time and resources, as it's been 6 months since my graduation and I haven't quite made a firm decision yet. I haven't been able to find a job yet and so they're still supporting me. I can't help but feel angry at myself that I wasted 4 years of my life pursuing something I wasn't quite sure about, and guilty for wasting my parents' time and resources.

For those of you who were in a similar problem, how did you deal with uncertainty, and how did you get yourself to move towards a different direction, despite how hard you've worked? For you, personally, after the switch, was the grass truly greener on the other side?

The things that I look for in a career: 
- Sense of purpose (this is where dentistry fails for me) 
- Values diligence 
- A good living (75k+), but TBH, I wouldn't mind starting from something much lower AND AN EDUCATION/TRAINING PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T INSTILL CRIPPLING DEBT 
- Interaction with people (but not too much interaction) 
- Setting would be in a city or building 
- Adequate vacation time for family, and a work day that still allows time for hobbies 
- Team setting mixed with personal duties

I weighed my options and considered accounting, finance, computer science, and CLS. Any personal anecdotes on your opinion on these careers, or any other career suggestions would also be deeply appreciated."
