c0ftf,1,2010-05-05,When 'education' becomes exploitation.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/c0ftf/when_education_becomes_exploitation/,"Reposted from Digg, but I thought it was a relevant topic. I have to say that I've seen this while working as an intern for some companies. 

At one point I was getting paid $13/hr to do most of the tasks that a web firm had previously taken care of ($90/hr) as well as playing the role of IT consultant/advisor ($120/hr) as well as my own duties, such as managing the computer networks, repairing systems, performing website updates, etc. When, after working their over a year, I asked them for a raise (from $13/hr to $16/hr) they said they couldn't afford it, and I quit. I also happened to know that the actual workers their were making between 80 andd 100K, to give me work to do that they didn't want to do themselves. In otherwords, absolutely useless, for the most part. Incidently, they hired a new intern. Finally, to add insult to injury, when I put in my notice (in a very nice and polite manner) they expected me to hang around indefinitely until they found an intern, initially putting that task on me as well. WTF?

To me, this was absolutely an exploitation of labor, and services. I felt many times like I was absolutely being used, but I also felt like this is what an internship was suppose to be like and didn't think it would be any different anywhere else. I'm glad I was wrong, but I think that if this kind of practice is not stemmed, one day it will be like this everywhere else.

Need ideas/inspiration/thoughts on a logo/branding. Below is a full description of the fund.

==========================================

The Smiley Child Education Fund is aimed at assisting children in developing worlds to achieve a brighter, happier future through education. With compassion, philanthropy and dedication, the founder, Salifu Kamara, has been given the opportunity to receive education at Clark University in Worcester, MA. Originally from Sierra Leone, Mr. Kamara experienced civil war first-hand as a child and lost his family including siblings. In spite of the hardships, death of parent and siblings, Mr. Kamara has remained optimistic, determined, and reverent. The ability to receive an education has brought him much happiness and joy and has restored strong hope to him.

“When I am in class, I can’t help but smile,” Mr. Kamara said, “I want all children to be happy like I am.”

With his bright smile, warm personality, and inspiring story, Mr. Kamara has become a celebrity around the campus. Also, he wants to use his story for good, helping to create a better world for the millions of children living in poverty and lack of formal education in developing countries. 

Mr. Kamara’s vision for the Smiley Child Education Fund is to offer scholarships for children in developing nations to acquire sound education up to post-secondary institutions. Additionally, he would like to create and raise awareness of the struggles that these millions of children face every day such as lack of formal education, lack of portable water, hunger, diseases and exploitation by sex traffickers has led young female potential leaders to become commercial sex bandit. 

The Smiley Child Education Fund (SCEF) hopes to train teachers in these developing countries through volunteering network of professionals on seasonal basis, empowering teachers with professional know-how of passing on the materials to their students in their respective countries.  SCEF will also partners with other NGO’s to supply educational material to tutors including materials for  students use. There will also be a forum to engage international students in internship opportunities among the targeted countries. Another concern for SCEF is in the area of computer education which entails basic use of computers, internet and e-mail. Creation of Pen Pal type of communication program between students and the international community will be another goal of Smiley Child Education Fund. 

Mr. Kamara strongly believes that creating a connective world is an integral part to achieve high yield of development, growth and a peaceful environment while the voiceless will easily be heard.

_______________________________________________________

This semester has been a nightmare for me. I'll admit that I did way too much partying and not much of attending class. I have always been somewhat of an intelligent guy, never needing to listen in class and still able to easily obtain a 3.5 GPA. I never expected myself to be in this situation, ever. I just hit a road block this year, without even realizing, I was no longer able to score high on Exams. Well, now after this semester, I know that I have to attend classes now, and actively listen.

I earned under a 1.5 semester GPA this semester, it was my second semester of my Junior year, and my parents have cut me off. I'm not sure as to what actions to take. I want to continue school and retake my classes, but being cut off doesn't quite help the cause.

Oh yeah, I did have a few internship interviews that will give back to me within a week. Hopefully I get one, as that would help my financial situation.

What should I do? Any advice?

I was fortunate (lucky) enough to land a 16/mo internship at IBM doing software development. First, let me say... I'm a finance major, who has taken some CS classes and had some IT jobs in the past. I'm nowhere near as experienced as pretty much everyone on my team who is some kind of engineer/cs major and have never worked on a 'large-scale' project in my life. Started on Thursday and I'm overwhelmed to say the least...


In terms of the actual job, it's mostly php and databases, which I am familiar with.. but once again, on a small scale. During the first few days I pretty much did a lot of nodding and didn't really understand anything that was going on. When I used php before it was mostly for adding OO functionality to the sites I worked on to reduce redudundant coding... my IBM projects are much more complicated.


I'm kind of scared because I really want to do well and learn a lot but I feel that I won't be able to get up to speed with all the technology and start contributing for a LOOONG time. I guess the ONE good thing I can say is pretty much everyone I've talked to feels overwhelmed. Any advice on learning as much as possible as fast as possible besides going through these .php files line by line until I understand what's going on?"

About 2 years ago, I made up my mind and just started doing it. I am now about 9 months into my first real development job. 

I've worked hard to get here, I moved my family a thousand miles to take an internship for very little money, and it has seemed to pay off so far.

The thing is, now I am worried I cannot go back to what i was doing before, I simply can't. I love this far too much. The problem however, is that the company I've been working with is a small startup. 

We use python/django/twisted/MySql. I've learned a lot, and have some very sharp developers showing me the ways. These guys are obsessive about maintainability, code reviews, and general cleanliness.

I'd like to think that I am now *in* but even though the talent is top notch (as far as I can tell) The survival of my company is not guaranteed. 

Lets assume for arguments sake that I know django inside and out, python pretty well, and i feel like i can do  pretty much do anything in javascript.. If my company shuts the doors tomorrow...am I screwed?

Will i be ok on these not so popular technologies? I will do whatever it takes, code is code. I will learn php if i have to (not my first choice)
I will never be satisfied with what I know, but do you think I am employable? If not...then what should i go after? ASP? .NET? C#? PHP?

I have been working with C, C++ in my spare time, but I don't think that that is any good to an employer (Sure you can hack on our low level code! If you can do project euler you can do anything!)

I don't think i could search all over the country and be willing to move anywhere again. The only reason i am where i am is because i was so hungry and was willing to do anything. 

I appreciate any input you guys have. If you read this far, then thank you for your time.

c1ncx,1,2010-05-08,Reddit: have any ideas on how to teach East African's to use ultra cheap laptops?,oivaizmir,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1ncx/reddit_have_any_ideas_on_how_to_teach_east/,"Reddit, I need your creativity,

I've gotten an internship in East Africa starting in August with the NGO One Laptop Per Child (www.laptop.org). My job will be teaching children, aged 6-12, how to use the ultra-cheap XO laptop.

While OLPC is giving me tons of training, I think it would be a mistake to not make use of that constant ingenuity and inventiveness that pervades Reddit. I feel like it would be hard to find a community that has benefited from the internet revolution more than Redditor's, and that it would be a worthwhile task to actually see what sort of ideas we can come up with.

I'm really looking for any ideas that will work to educate these kids on how to use these computers, and to stimulate their curiosity. My ambition is to give these kids every tool I can think of to develop their intellectual curiosity. 

So far, my lesson plans consist of things like scavenger hunts across the internet. I'm sure the Reddit community can do a lot better than that. I am bringing things like a projector, movie camera, movies, etc, to let the kids in on a window of what else there is in the world. If you can think of any novel ways to use things like this, or other things I should bring, I'm all ears.

Any ideas would be more then appreciated; if I make use of anyone's idea I'll definitely give a full report back on how it went. I feel like there is no greater learning tool then the internet, and sincerely believe that it could work to liberate these children from the physical and educational poverty that they are immersed in. To do this, I don't want these kids to be limited by my sub-par teaching skills, or inadequate instruments, but rather only their own curiosity and creativity.

I need a hand Reddit!

c1t2a,1,2010-05-09,"RA, I need help coping with a confusing situation and possibly my first rejection...",IneedRA,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1t2a/ra_i_need_help_coping_with_a_confusing_situation/,"Obvious throwaway, addicted redditor for over a year. I'm hoping for some clarity on an odd situation, and I'm thinking that posting here is probably better than moping around the house all day trying not to cry. So here's my story.

I am a 24 year old female unhappily married to a 27 year old, we've been together for 7+ years. We separated last year, but have been muddling along ever since trying to make it work, and basically a divorce is on the way. I'm hesitant to file the papers for a variety of reasons, but I don't think the details on this are terribly relevant because the trouble arises from another guy.

I met this guy in Fall of 2008 when I was observing his class (he's a high school teacher), we had a good time, but since I was in a relationship it never went anywhere and we didn't really keep in touch. Then, as luck would have it, when I was assigned to my year-long internship for my master's program last fall, I was assigned to the same school teaching in the same magnet program as he does. We've hung out throughout the year and grown a little closer. We share a lot of things with each other, hang out during planning periods, flirt a little, etc. Definitely some strong chemistry and attraction there. I had no trouble openly telling him that I really like him.

A few weeks ago he asked me if I wanted to stick around after school to see our kids in a play that night, and we agreed to grab a bite to eat across the street beforehand. We had a nice dinner, during which I explained my entire relationship situation to him, he shared some of his stories, and we chatted a little about what we're looking for. Then, earlier this week I asked him if he was going to another play that our kids are in, this one down in the city instead of at our school. He said he wasn't sure, asked if I wanted to go, I said yeah, so we agreed to meet for dinner and go to the play, which was last night. I know this sounds bad, could be construed as cheating, but please keep in mind that my marriage is on the outs and that we were going out as colleagues and not on a date. I know it's wrong, but I'm lonely.

Again it was a good time, but he made a little stinging joke before the play that I was having a hard time landing him because the girls he usually dates are mixed race/exotic looking. A joke, but ouch. After the show he walked me to my car and I needed him to get it out of a tight space for me. I asked him if he really hasn't asked me out yet because I'm a plain white girl, commencing a ~20m conversation about whether or not we should date when I'm finally divorced.

This is where the possible rejection arises... I completely understand all of his concerns, but still it hurts and I would still like to go out with him when I'm single. Basically, at the core of things is a huge age gap. He's almost 43, wedging 19 years between us. He knows I was previously involved with a man 16 years my senior (don't ask), and he's dated women in their twenties before. However, he basically kept saying that he wants to, but isn't sure if we should, citing the following things:

* If we do go out, and after a few times wind up in bed together, etc, and then it doesn't work out, it would be hurtful to me for my first pursuit after the divorce
* He's never been married or even lived with someone, basically not gifted at long-term relationships... and given the age gap, my divorce, etc, it seems like it might be doomed
* We share an office (I pointed out that this is only the case for a few more weeks)
* We know each other well, it would be different than if we were just strangers going out

That's all I can remember right now, I'm sure there's more to it. But basically, he concluded that he figures we could go out, who knows what the future holds. Throughout the conversation I said a few times that if the answer is no, it's fine, just say no. He always responded by saying, ""it's not no."" Essentially I feel as though maybe he's not interested in me after all, and just doesn't want to outright reject and hurt me. But on the other hand, he's open to the idea of us going out on a date when I'm available, he just has all these thoughts, which I completely understand. 

I really, really like him and think it could go somewhere, but I realize that it may not and that's fine. I just think it's worth a shot and there's no harm in going out a few times to see. But I also feel as though if he were really into me, he wouldn't be so hesitant. Should I treat this like a light rejection and stop hanging around him at work? Or is it worth my time and energy and possible future rejection to nudge him into it?

**TL;DR**: Older man I temporarily work with may, or may not, be interested in dating me once my divorce is final. Should I take hesitance and concern over age/etc as a rejection and move on, or just snag a date and see what happens?"
c1tr8,13,2010-05-09,"Boss found out I'm looking for a new Job, HELP!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1tr8/boss_found_out_im_looking_for_a_new_job_help/,"***Preface:*** I'm an accountant and I currently work for a staffing firm doing temp work on a salaried basis. It's similar to working at an accounting or law firm minus the defined career path, network and vacation time. I also took a big pay cut (~25%) to get this job and I pay for my own health insurance (I was one of those people who got their Anthem Blue Cross Insurance raised ***over 39%*** last February)

I've been with the company for 7 months. In that time I've exceeded expectations at both clients and I just had my contract renewed with my current client for the second time (supposed to end in March). Problem is, I have no real sense of job security at the firm. They seem to be very concerned about shareholders and not so much about the people earning the profits (high turnover rate). 

For my own career's sake I need to position myself so that I don't get left behind. There is a wage freeze and at some point I need to start making the money that someone in my level of responsibility makes or I'm going to be perceived as damaged goods in the job market (most people make 30% more than I do in the same position nationally, adjusting for the regions cost of living, it's a little higher than that, source: firm's 2010 salary guide). I don't make the rules, but most employers seem to make snap judgments about a person's abilities and skills based on their pay. I made more money as an Auditor Intern in college than I do nearly 4 years out of school as a Senior Accountant. When I asked about a raise my boss mentioned that there is an indefinite wage freeze going on for the *salaried temp staff* because of the economy.

I got a phone call on Friday from my boss mentioning that my contract with the client was extended again. She also mentioned that we need to *""talk about where I see myself in the company""* and I would be meeting with the branch manager this afternoon. So I arrive at the branch after lunch and I spend 4 hours waiting for the manager to come. I asked her coworkers where she was and everyone else in the office. Apparently she was out of the office at a client. I'm only obligated (paid) to put in my 8 hours, so I left at 4:30pm.

I'm pretty sure they found my resume out there during the time I've been applying for jobs (past month or so). I'm wondering what I should do. When I do meet with the manager I plan on playing up the angle that: ""I am concern about my job security and I'm doing what I need to do to protect myself in case I do lose this job, since I'm not sure that I'd be employed after this current contract is up (was just extended recently, was going to expire at the end of May)"".

**Edit 1:** My question is, what should I do when I am confronted by the manager? What are the odds that they are going to outright try and fire me?

**Edit 2:** I just got a call from one of the places I applied to over the past month (well known company in town). They want me to come in for an interview on Thursday of this week. I feel a little better knowing that I have two potential places of employment if the staffing agency situation deteriorates (the second being the current client which is still looking for a senior accountant. The staffing agency loses out on their $20,000 referral fee if they fire me and I end up getting hired by their client). 

***Summary:***  I'm a salaried temp worker at a staffing firm with little job security and the lowest pay I've had in my professional career, with the most responsibility I've ever had. I suspect my boss found out I've been searching for jobs and wants me to meet with the branch manager to discuss my future with the firm. What should I say to the manager when she confronts me?"

My father is depressed, on medication and refuses to get counseling. His issues relate to relationship problems with his late parents, his siblings, and feeling under-appreciated in his career. He treats my mother poorly by talking down to her, complaining about her lifestyle to me and my siblings, and not believing her fibromyalgia symptoms (ie. she's often tired and/or in pain, where he says she's lazy or over-exaggerating). Despite this my mom stands by my father in everything he says and does, whether or not she agrees with him (in my opinion). She either is oblivious to his poor treatment of her, or is very, very good at ignoring it and chalking it up to his depression.

My relationship with my father has been tense for a few years now, after I spent time traveling with my boyfriend (we were both in our early 20s at the time). In my father's 1950's upbringing, a ""good girl"" wouldn't spend time alone in the company of a boy - it gives the wrong impression. I knew this was his opinion before I took my trip, however it was my hard-earned money, my vacation time, and I was no longer living with my parents so it was my decision to make. My dad didn't talk to me for 6 months following my trip.

In the 2 years since, our conversation have been superficial and both of us try to avoid any controversial topics. As such, my dad basically ignores that I am in a relationship. I have never heard him say the name of my boyfriend. If I bring my boyfriend up, my dad will remain quiet until the topic has passed. My mother tells me that I'm not to discuss this problem directly because it will ""upset my father"", and that I brought this situation on myself. I thought the relationship between my father and boyfriend would take some time to grow when my father realized how well my boyfriend treats me, and what a good person he is. This has not been the case, and it's not for lack of trying on the part of my boyfriend. This being said, my mom and siblings love my boyfriend. He's been really amazing to me, sticking by me through some pretty rough times, as well as spending time with my family in which my father basically ignores him.

I'm at the point in my life where I'm finally financially independent from my parents, I have a career on the horizon, and I'm ready to start ""real life"". My boyfriend and I are talking about our future together, but I can't see it involving a family who does not have unconditional love and support for my life choices. It's especially hurtful to me because I have been extremely successful in all other areas of my life (securing a competitive internship, getting accepted to one of the top grad schools in the country, and a prestigious fellowship). I feel that traveling with my boyfriend is such a minute ""discretion"" that it should be far outweighed by all of my other accomplishments.

My dad won't talk to me about these issues, and my mom constantly throws her support to my father even when I approach her alone for advice. I don't see things getting any better. I have the overwhelming urge to cut off ties with my parents and never go back home.

**Edit** Thanks for all of your comments. I was pretty bummed out last night after our Mother's Day get together with my parents. It was nice to wake up to some support and suggestions on how to proceed. Thank you!"

TL;DR version at the bottom.

So I'm about to finish my third year as a computer science student at a tier 2 UC. I interviewed at this company that does user verification(stuff to battle against fraud and such). I had an interview with the head of operations(a CS guy also but does more management stuff now) and he seemed to like me. After I talked to him, he brought in two of the programmers who asked me questions I had answers to. I was quite charming with the interviews as I usually am, getting chuckles out of them every now and then. They left the room and the head of operations came in saying that they really liked me and he was going to give me a little assignment to make sure I knew my stuff. He gave it to me on monday night and said to have it to him by thursday. I finished it on wednesday telling him that I really enjoyed the assignment because I got to learn(mentioning that it was the first time I had to run an apache server and code in a J2EE environment).

he said he would get back to me in a couple of days so I followed up the next monday asking if they had filled the position or not and that I was still interested.
His response to my follow up was that they haven't decided yet and are having a directors meeting the next day so they should have an answer soon.

It has been 6 days since that response and I haven't heard anything back. I'm beginning to worry that they are passing over me which would be normal except that I interviewed at a bunch(about 4-5) of internships over the year and this one felt really good(even offered them my full time over summer and part time over the year).

so my question is, should I re-follow up with them or just wait; if I re-follow up, what should I say?

TL;DR version: I followed up with a computer science internship I was very confident on about a week ago, they said they were going to have a directors meeting the next day and would have an answer soon. It's been about a week and haven't heard, should I re-follow up?"

I put up the back-up files for now but they aren't much better. The page looks like a whole bunch of html with black question marks all over it. The strange thing is, I didn't even change anything on the index file, I only looked at it. I understand why the subpages are messed up, but is there something wrong with just opening something?

Ask any clarifying questions you need, I know you guys always come through for these sorts of things.

I meet a girl.  She has a boyfriend, but I only want to be her friend anyway.  We hang out a lot, sometimes just the two of us, but often I’m a third wheel.  I’m fine with it.  She’s a fun girl.

**½ year ago:**

I’ve developed a strong crush on her, while at the same time we’ve become very close friends.  My feelings have become so overwhelming and obvious it’s comparable to an elephant sitting in the room between us.  We end up talking about it.  I never encouraged her to break up with him, or gave any opinion in regard to her current relationship.  I simply told her my feelings.  Here’s what I learned.  Their relationship isn’t that serious.  They’re not right for each other.   She doesn’t think I’m right either, though she does have some feelings for me.  She plans on staying with him until they either get in a big fight (happens a lot) or he goes far away for an internship.  She was quite firm about the latter, though she reminded me it didn’t mean she would go out with me.  She also knows quite well that I’ve never been in a relationship and never been kissed.  She said I can kiss her if I hadn’t gotten one by my birthday, which is this summer.  I don’t think she is trying to lead me on; she probably just feels sorry for how pathetic I am.  She immediately felt guilty for saying all this to me behind her boyfriend’s back, and I feel like a jerk for bringing it all up.  In the end she thought about it for a few days and fully rejected me, trying to give me some closure.  Sadly the closure didn’t work since my stupid brain is in denial of a sort.

**Now:**

After some heart pain and depression I’ve bounced back.  My friendship with her never stopped and is in fact better than it’s ever been.  My feelings for her have remained the same, while my ability to deal with it has gotten much stronger.  I’ve stayed friends with her because she’s fun to be around and is a good friend in return.  If I only wanted to date her I would have ended the friendship a while ago.  
Turns out her boyfriend is in fact going far away in a month, though I’m unsure whether she still plans on ending it.  She may want to stay with him for all I know.  She doesn’t have any other close friends than me at college so I know I’ll be seeing her a lot.  She’ll be spending more time alone and will likely start clinging to me.  I don’t expect her to have changed her mind about me though.  There is a chance, but she already rejected me before.  

**Questions:**

With things changing like this, she and I will end up talking about this stuff again.  If I ask her whether she plans on staying with him and she doesn’t, is it wrong that we’re discussing this behind his back?  …that I know they’ll break up before he does?  Should I wait until she brings it up?  Should I suggest she stop leading him on and end it if it’s not going anywhere between them, or is that my own bias talking?

Also if anyone can tell me whether I’ve done the right thing in all of this, or if I’ve just been an asshole; and whether my interpretations and guesswork seem accurate; it would be much appreciated.  I have no firsthand experience with relationships so I don’t trust my own judgment here.  I’ll take any advice.

And of course I’d like to know whether I still have a chance with her."

I work for a very small, family-owned, business in the town that I live in.  I've been doing their graphic / web design work for three years now.  Since I've been a one man operation, there's only one work station with the Adobe Creative Suite on it.  And that is the issue...

See, we've been pretty successful here lately -- so successful in fact that my boss has hired an intern.  The problem is that we're not exactly prepared for another person.  We have no problem coming up with another workstation, but getting another license for Creative Suite seems pretty far away.

I have a MacBook Pro (that I paid for last semester) that has the student edition of the creative suite on it, and that's what I've been using to accommodate for the intern.  I have voiced my concern about getting another license, but my request has gone almost completely unheard.

It's been two months now.  Do I have a right to be upset?  And.. is there any other way for me to get my workstation back?

P.S.  The intern's not a bad girl and I don't want to shatter her dreams of becoming a graphic designer.  So I'm reluctant to make her quit lol."

c76eg,8,2010-05-23,21-year-old student looking at moving to DC...have a few questions!,scootey,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/c76eg/21yearold_student_looking_at_moving_to_dchave_a/,"Hey all:

I'm looking at possibly moving to DC. I live in Oklahoma right now and would like to move elsewhere (I don't like the particular area I live in, and also feel like going on a bit of an adventure). My dad lives in the Takoma Park area and I will be able to live with him (until I get my own place). I have a few questions, though.

A little about me:

- Presently I live in Oklahoma, and I go to school here studying computer science. I've lived here for a little over half my life.

- I've been to DC a number of times in the past. I have always had family in NoVA and lived near Manassas with my family for a very short time a few years ago. (That was back when I was a lot less outgoing than I am now, so I really can't answer my own questions here.) I'm not very familiar with DC outside of the typical touristy attractions.

- Planning on taking a break from school for the next semester or two, and possibly transferring to another school. I'm not doing as well as I could be doing and need a break to focus myself. I don't like the area that I live in and am not particularly fond of the quality of education at my school either. I want to transfer to UM College Park but I'm not holding my breath.

- I'm an openly gay male; agnostic; fairly liberal politically.

- I'm somewhat nerdy (CS major, redditor...I suppose it's a little implied) but not a recluse either.

How is the DC area for (undergrad) college students in general? I've heard some say that many of the students in the DC area are working on law/medical/other professional degrees or working high-profile internships. Since these people are highly focused on their careers, it might not be the best place for undergrad college students (I'm not suggesting I want to slack off and party all the time…I simply want to find people I can get along with.) How justified is this concern?

Particularly, how good of a fit socially would DC be for someone like me? I figure that finding LGBT-friendly and liberal-minded people really won't be a problem. Will it be hard to fit in if I'm not into bars/clubs that much? I do go out on occasion but it's certainly not my world. What are the people like in DC? Are a lot of people (especially those my age) overly pretentious/snobby/preppy? I'm talking some, but not all, of the people who are attending prestigious universities, working high-profile internships/careers, hipsters, etc.

What sorts of places/activities would be good to meet cool people, especially since I probably won't be going to school for a few months? I might look at getting involved with some sort of LGBT community/activism groups, maybe going to a UU church…any more suggestions?

Also, how is the DC area for internships/jobs related to my area of study (i.e. software development jobs)? I suppose that DC isn't as great of a place for people in technical areas as it is for people in activism/public policy/etc. Certainly there are companies that do software development in the DC area, but how is the job market for CS majors? Do many companies recruit from schools in the area? Would I have a hard time finding a job/internship without a security clearance? Anything else I should know with regard to jobs/careers in my area?

Thanks in advance :)

I'm currently a second year Computer Engineering student at University.  The Academic Adviser sends out 
emails every few days for various internships at local companies, but they all seem to require mastery of 7 or more 
programming languages before one can even apply.  I currently know how to use Python and Java pretty well, but I 
feel the University only offers other courses in C and C++.  

I am worried that by the time I graduate, I still won't be prepared for various Software Development jobs because I won't be introduced to a large enough variety of languages to meet certain requirements in the workforce.  I was wondering:  Is it really necessary or expected to know so many programming languages in order to get a decent job?

tl;dr- I'm a student overwhelmed by the number of languages Development jobs seem to require.  How necessary is it to learn 7+ languages in order to be even considered for a job?"

I'm working on a special project with my parent's wireless home network.  Turns out my summer internship is close enough to my parents' place that I'm going to be living with them and saving on rent... the only problem is their dinosaur of a Linksys WRT54G they have burried in the bottom of the kitchen closet underneath what might as well be a lead bucket for all the signal strength I get in my room at the other end of the house.... 

I purchased a NETGEAR WNDR3700 at BestBuy today to play around with the possibility of using a newer, stronger, more capable and feature-rich router to piggy-back and establish a second, private wireless network in the house just for my computers.  If what I'm outlining below doesn't work, I'm just gonna return the new router and forget the whole thing, but having to wait ~20 minutes for hulu to load is ridiculous. 

NOTE: Hard-wiring is obviously not an option, and I only plan on utilizing the ""wireless-G"" 2.4 GHz capability of the new box. 

I've changed the LAN IP address of the new router to 192.168.1.99 to avoid the conflict with the default address of the dinosaur downstairs.  I also shut off the new box's DHCP server.  Is this all I should watch out for?  Besides the obvious, (modifying the SSID and security settings for the new network) I can't think of anything else that stands in my way of just plugging the new box into one of the old box's ethernet jacks via one of it's own ethernet jacks.  Am I right?

Thanks in advance!

Extra info:  (Will edit to answer questions)

I've changed the wireless channel to 1 for the new network, as the old network is currently configured to use channel 11."

I got an internship for a well known company doing software development. I got this job almost entirely through networking (basically my prof gave me an in). The thing is, I'm not a CS/SE major and my skillset doesn't even come close to my co-workers. I'm taking business with a minor in computer science, but I haven't done any programming for well over a year.


I've been there for 2 weeks and I'm really struggling with it. Since a lot of my team members are global, I have around 2 hours of meetings a day, where I pretty much just sit around twiddling my thumbs because I have no idea about anything they're talking about. I guess I could rationalize by saying this is pretty normal and all the other interns are experiencing the same thing but it feels really shitty to sit around being a mute for 2 hours.
Now my actual work, I'm coding at like snail speed. It's incredibly difficult to jump into the middle of a project that has multiple ten thousand line function lists and being productive when you're working with such knowledgeable and experienced people while I'm sitting there trying to figure out something basic like why this relative path won't work for a good two hours.


I've been trying my best to catch up and have been reading a few PHP books but when I observe some of my team members working on something it's embarrassing how much more productive they are. They are all very nice and answer all my questions, but the questions taht I really want to ask are sometimes so simple I often end up trying to figure it out on my own since I think it would be embarassing to ask. I guess the positive side is that I have an amazing company to put on my resume and I'm learning a ridiculous amount everyday in a challenging and fun environment, but it sure does feel shitty knowing that I can't effectively contribute to my team as much as I want too.


Anyone been in a similar experience? 16 month internship, btw... i want to hopefully make it through all the way without getting canned!"

I live in Texas and will have to move a few states away (2 hour plane ride, 15 hour car ride).  I am engaged to be married in February 2011 and my fiancee, who has a job here in Texas, does not want to move.  

In addition, I would have to live abroad doing an internship and language study from January - August of 2011 which corresponds directly with our wedding plans.  I have asked her to move and join me wherever I go around the world.  I figured she could save up some money in the mean time and then do ESL or some volunteer stuff she might like while I'm getting my degree.

I really just want her to be there and I'm sure we could make things work if we are together.  Her staying in Texas and me elsewhere for more than a month or two is out of the question.

I'm afraid she'll make me choose between her and the school.  I currently hate my job and know if I don't go to this school, I will be stuck in middle management for my whole life.  I won't be able to support her or a family.  

I don't think 2 years is too much to ask but she is rather resistant to change.  I'm trying to think of compromises etc. but nothing's working.  I need to make a decision by the end of next week!  I really just wish she could handle some fluctuation for 2 years and then we could settle wherever she wants.  Any advice is appreciated.

                           Edit Update.  Thanks for all those who responded.  We spent all weekend talking about this with her brothers and their SOs.  I realize I can't expect her to leave everything behind.  What I hadn't thought of is that this really is more of a lifestyle rather than just a two year inconvenience.  

Essentially, we've decided to see if I can defer for a year (something else I had not thought of) and also see if I get into the local university that has a dual degree program with the number one International Business School in the nation.  That might be an option as I can stay in Texas for a year while doing the first portion of the MBA and then we can move to Arizona for the second year while I get my Masters of Science in Global Management (MSGM).  That way, I'm putting in the same amount of time and getting two degrees.  I'm going to have to talk to someone in the business about whether or not the MSGM at a superior school along with an inferior MBA is better than an IMBA single degree at a great school.  

Just to address some issues, I did talk to her about this possible eventuality the whole time I was applying to schools.  However, we were hoping I would have more options than just this.  Unfortunately, I did not get into any other schools (so far) and that limitation has proved difficult.  I don't know what I'll do if I don't get into the local university AND there is no defer option.  I will probably take temp9876's advice (and Mr. temp9876) and tell her I'm going.  I do have the right to ask the question and she has the right to say no.  I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too.  I would really like her to be with me and supportive through this process, but I know it's asking alot.  

I will update as I get information for anyone who cares.  Thanks again for all the advice."

No idea where to go from here.,anaccounttothrowaway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c9dcj/i_believe_ive_struck_rock_bottom_no_idea_where_to/,"I'm a MSc student. The two year education ends with the presentation and open discussion of my masters thesis. The deadline is scheduled in a week, and my finishing touch to the paper version was done a week ago. Presentation will be in a month.

Since I didn't see my promotor very much and actually had to do the whole thing without advise or guidance from someone well-versed in this particular field, I went on from what I learned myself out of similar studies, books and knowledge from friends in other closely-related fields of science. I finished my dissertation on which I worked 15 months on and off. Altogether, it could be compressed into something like 6 months full-time work (as in 7 day weeks, 12 to 14 hrs per day). For months, I've done nothing but teach myself programming languages, learned how to make my own database server for in silico experimenting, and spent $1350 of my own money on equipment. The model created was backed by in silico and in vitro experiments, all of which I had to do on my own. ALthough I wasn't happy with the lone rider situation, I often messaged my family back home to happily announce my soon to be graduation. I was convinced my hard work would pay off. 

Today, I was very anxious to finally hear my promotors approval. I met with him for the fourth time in the past year, the previous 3 times he either didn't have the time to go through my findings and conclusions or he plainly skipped our meeting. I sent him the complete works (170 pages of text, 200 pages with raw data/appendices/additional methodology, three supplementary material cdroms and my lab notebook) a week earlier. All he tells me today is that he went through only half of the work and isn't happy and expected more of me. He says I will most likely get a good enough grade to pass and get my graduation. But it doesn't meet the standards he signed up for. As such, he doesn't want to sign my entry form. As this is necessary for even being read by the board of assessors, I have nothing. My name won't even be mentioned. I could've as well never existed.

My dissertation won't win a nobel prize, nor will it drop jaws, but its a scientifically correct study validating a new proposed model for future studies. I asked him to go through my lab notebook to see that I really tried a lot of methods and had to suck up to a lot of people to gain access to their lab equipment. He didn't even go over it.

He told me I could work on it for a few months extra, and help out at his department as an intern. I think he is mad at me for refusing to do a PhD at his department, since he applied and gained a grant for me a few months back (although I wasn't notified until the grant came in), which I refused because I desperately need to make back some money my studeis cost me. He is getting at me personally and I can't do this. I cant stand being around the guy or his office. I worked my ass off so I would never have to be in that position anymore. So I left with slamming doors, holding back my tears. I can't even remember when the last time was I cried, but today I did in anger.

I'm fucked. I spent my last money on a rented suit for the graduation and some food for the last weeks. I sold some textbooks and most of my furniture. I have to vacate my room in two days because my lease is up. I'll have to stay at a mate who is going to graduate and I won't. I had a job interview lined up, but a MSc is required. I have no prospects anymore. I don't even know where I'm at right now.

I can't go home to my parents. They put a mortgage on their house so I could study. They aren't living luxuriously, and neither have I because I know what a strain the paying for my eductaion is to them. I can't face my little brother. I was supposed to bring in money so he can go to college in a few years. Everyone put so much effort in me, and I have nothing in return. I haven't seen them in two years. They wouldn't even come over for my graduation in a month, just to save money for Tims college fees.

I don't know what to do. I'm angry and confused right now, so I can't get my mind round anything. My mate has gone through the regulations and claims I can't take actions towards my promotor without consequences. One of them would be that I have to do my dissertation for someone else thus start all over. I'm stuck here.

Please tell me there is something else I can do but go back and beg that asshole. I just want to give it all up, move away from here and get a real job."

Working at BestBuy seemed like the least offensive typical minimum-wage job, but they're not hiring. Giving violin lessons would require a tremendous amount of publicity to get enough students. Do you guys have any brilliant suggestions, or should I just suck it up and take a job at Kmart or McDonald's?"

I will be there until the end of June but might continue a day or so per week for the rest of the summer.

A new intern just started there working on only this one project and she's the only one working on it, so it's not like I'll get to work with her much. The office is not too many people, however. Only about 15 employees, the 2 of us an 3 other interns, who are all male.

This girl is 19 and gorgeous and I'd like it to go somewhere, but having just met her, it's hard to tell if we're always flirting or just having fun conversation.

It's difficult to think of things to invite her to outside of work because I commute North to the office about 45 minutes and she commutes East about 40 minutes, so we don't exactly live the closest to each other. Making it more difficult, I live in a big city where more interesting events happen and she lives outside, leaving less options if I were considering having to drive to her area.

What can I do to not only feel out the situation better but also to progress with her regardless of where it has been so far?

Thanks for your help, RA.

**tl;dr** New girl at work, possibly flirty, lives far away. How can I make something happen between us?

c9nlo,11,2010-05-30,"Met a girl over the Internet 7 months ago, just got back from visiting her. I'm crazy about her, like Darude Sandstorm crazy. How do I make this happen long-distance wise?",CaptainAwesomeGuy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9nlo/met_a_girl_over_the_internet_7_months_ago_just/,"Hey reddit,

I met this girl last October on Omegle. As our relationship grew, we talked on video chat, on the phone and through text message. We're both Sophomores, soon to be Juniors, in college. I left a week ago to go see her for 6 days, got back yesterday, and now it's all I can think about.

Before going out there, she and I definitely had an emotional ande a physical attraction to each other, so lots of physical things were discussed. Every night while there, I stayed in her bed. However, after showing up, she made it clear that she didn't want to engage in anything physical with any guy she wasn't in a relationship with, and she didn't want to be in a long-distance cross-country relationship with me. She was hurt about some douche taking advantage of her while she was drunk at a party. This was a bummer, but I dealt with it. The second to last night I was there, our faces ended up close to one-another, and I asked if I could kiss her. Things moved on big time from there, she took her shirt off, and I worked my magic downstairs. After she felt like things were enough for her, she said ""I'm a cock tease"" and went to bed, which is kind of a blueballsing situation. Before she went to bed, she told me that I shouldn't have expected reciprocal pleasure because it doesn't work like that. I was kind of bummed about this, but she's more experienced (more on this later) than me. She also said that she didn't want to do anything else, she didn't want to become too attached to me, so she was going to stop the next time if it seemed like it was happening.

3 hours later a very similar thing happens in the middle of the night, I'm pleasuring her, she doesn't do it for me, we go to bed. The next day, she says that while it was great, she doesn't want to become attached and that next time she'll have to say ""no"". 

While we're taking a nap, one thing leads to another, and the same thing ends up happening. I pleasure her, she doesn't do so for me, and we resume the nap. She then asserts her point again about stopping the act next time, because she doesn't want to get attached.

That night, my last night, things happen again in a very similar manner, probably the most hardcore of the times, but still no pleasure for me. When I mention it, she says ""maybe we should stop if that's where you want this to lead"". She takes me to the airport that morning.

I kind of hope that she did get attached to me while I was there. I really do.

So yes, this girl is also way more sexually experienced than me. She's slept with 7 guys and 2 girls. I've never slept with anyone, had my first kiss at 18, and was with the second girl I've ever engaged with physically or kissed just a few days ago. 

I'm fucking depressed by the entire situation. I want to be with her, but if she doesn't want to be in a relationship, it'll crush me. There is definite attraction on both an emotional and a physical level, and she kept telling me how nice of a guy I am and how great I am. Sadly, I go to a tech school on the opposite end of the country, and my home is smack dab in the middle of the US. She has lots of guys there pining for her, none of whom she's interested in, but still. There are next to no girls at my school, and it's practically impossible to find one. I know that when I was in my first relationship (freshman year of college) I just seemed to be happier, to be able to be that intimate and open with someone is a big deal to me, to be able to always have somebody to turn to or talk to. Right now I feel really alone, having just left this girl yesterday, and I don't know what to do or how to feel better. Perhaps this doesn't belong in relationship_advice, perhaps it does, I'm just hoping a smart redditor comes along and helps me with my problem(s) so I can either pursue a relationship with her, or be okay with not doing so. I work out, and I have a very exciting internship this summer, so telling me to get off my ass won't carry much weight.

Any idea reddit? "
c9smm,1,2010-05-31,How do I deal with people like this?,jetplane42,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9smm/how_do_i_deal_with_people_like_this/,"Yes, it's a throwaway.  I'm 19, just finished my first year of college, and intern for a major IT consulting company.  I absolutely love my job.  Now that it's the summer, I'm working full time and am no longer an intern.  One of our major clients is a school district, comprised of six different schools, including a high school.  Two days a week for the next few weeks, I'm on site deploying new software on all of the computers.  This involves entering each classroom during class time and touching the teacher's computer and any student computers that are in the room.
The other day, I was on site, and getting lunch at a local burger place by myself, when I saw four built, football player-type kids eating, whom I had seen earlier that day in class.  Now, I am required to dress nicely for the job.  I'm well groomed, and I dress well.  I am certainly not gay nor do I project any sort of gay vibe, to my knowledge.  This particular day was simply a fitted dress shirt and slacks.  The moment I walk in, one of the kids turns to me, and goes ""Wow, you're cute"".  I kinda look at him, and he goes ""just kidding"" and turns around to eat, while his friends snicker.  I blow it off as kids being stupid and go to order. On my way out, they say the same thing as I'm walking out the door. I keep walking.
Two days later, I'm on site again, and see the same four waiting for me outside of the school.  I walk by, and after I pass, they yell the same.  I turn around, and one of them yells ""DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, FAGGOT"".  I kept walking and ignored them again.
I'm about 5'11"" and a climber.  I'm in good shape, but not built.  I couldn't take any of these kids, assuming that confrontation is even the best option in this scenario, although it might be what my testosterone suggests...  Obviously, they're minors and I am a contractor for the school, so anything of that nature would definitely not rule in my favor.  I feel shitty ignoring these kids, it's hard to do.  I don't want to ""tell"" on anybody.  What do, reddt?"
