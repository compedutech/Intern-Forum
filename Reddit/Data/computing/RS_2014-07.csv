So I quit grad school (mech eng.) last year and went full time into software dev - big risk but it paid off with an awesome job paying $7000/month 

The past year I lived off my credit card and some savings (from an internship) - I live with my parents so thats been a huge saving grace - but I've still racked up some debt and I still have my loans to pay off. This is the first time I'm actually motivated to budget and be smart with my money - could you guys help?

My Debts:

Student Loan: $18,000 @ 5.50%	*able to get a 6 month interest free grace period and still pay it down

Sunk Tuition (after dropping out - still have to pay this off): $4,500 w/ 1.5% service charge/month	

Credit card: $7800 @ 20% (limit $8000)

Monthly Cost: ~$800 (food, gas, insurance, phone bill, etc.)

How do I go about attacking this debt? Also are there any tools that I can use to keep track of my spending or any other investments I should be making at this time? "

Maybe this post can help more than just me, but for now, I'll explain my situation.

* Currently a 4th year student - have $18,000 in student loans.
* Currently on internship making $2000 every 2 weeks after tax (May - December)
* Jan 2015 thru August 2015 (Graduation) - I will be in school
* September 2015 thru forever?  - I will ride motorcycles from North American to the tip of South America and back (&gt;5 month journey for sure)

Here is what I currently do:

* I currently have ~$0 (but working for the next 6 months I will).
* I have a TFSA with ~$50
* I have a Savings account with ~$20
* I pay everything with Visa
* I deposit all paychecks to a chequing account
* I will inherit enough money to exactly pay off student loans upon graduation.
* living expenses are currently ~$1200/month

Here is where I need advice.  Do I contribute to RRSP's?  Do I put money into my TFSA account?  Do I use my Savings account to just save up for my grad trip?  

I'm not against putting money into stocks either - they can be risky and fun (which I like!)

Any tips would be great!

Cheers.

Can't believe I'm posting a personal ad on Reddit... but I am just looking for someone special in my life. **I am not looking for a hookup/FWB situation**.

I'm Baltimore born and raised (well, suburbs), but I have one more year at my university in North Carolina. I'm working in the city for an amazing internship this summer. I will very likely be offered a full time job when I graduate in May. I'd love to be a city girl - I just studied abroad in London and fell in love with the city life. It is likely that you will look at my post history and see that I had a relationship in London. That relationship was wonderful, but ended on my return to the States. If you have any questions about that, I can definitely answer, but I wanted to make it clear. I want to find a relationship like that again.

I like to consider myself a renaissance woman. I like to sing and have performed on stage a lot whether it be singing solo/duets, choirs, or theatre. I love the NFL and am a diehard Ravens fan. I study information science and my current work revolves around master data management and analysis in the business analytics side of things. I write SQL and use programs like SQL Server, Information Steward, etc. I can make websites and do some graphic design too, but it's not my forte. This is not what I want to do forever, but it's a very solid start. IT paycheck helps pay off the student loans!

I have an unwavering thirst for adventure and see the world through wander-lusting eyes. I started developing penpal relationships with people all over the world in middle school. These continued through high school and I chose a university that had a big emphasis on its international community. I took over an international mentorship organization on campus and built it up from nothing to a group with roughly 300 members. I was able to act as lead mentor as well as International Orientation leader. I made great connections studying abroad and I hope traveling remains a big part of my life. Oh, and I don't mean staying in fancy hotels, either.

I don't have any tattoos (or piercings, so don't try to get me earrings haha), but if I did, it would look something like this: ☮♥♫  Peace, love, and music. Three things that mean the world to me. I sit down and fret about the hatred in the world. I wish everyone could just love one another. I strongly dislike prejudice and prideful ignorance. I try to avoid confrontation when necessary. But, I am also a strong woman. Didn't have many male figures in my life growing up, so I've got a pretty strong backbone. I've dealt with a lot of shitty men (I seem to pick the bad ones) who expect me to be a pushover and can't handle a woman with an opinion. Some people find a strong, intelligent woman intimidating. But before you make that assumption, know that in my core, I just am really nice, honestly. Nothing is more wonderful than when I feel comfortable enough with someone to let go of the reins.. although that doesn't happen often.

If you think I sound interesting, message me and we can chat. We can send face pictures too, because physical attraction is important, not going to sugar coat that. There's a lot that I don't think I covered, but this is a pretty good start.

Hope to maybe meet someone special, and if we talk and it doesn't work out, I always like friends!

**Please send a face picture and I'll return the favor?**

EDIT: I'm on the front page of R4R as of 2:30am. I am flattered, thankful, and honestly, a bit surprised! Haha :)"
29j09m,4,2014-06-30,"My area (Flint, MI) is bad for programming work, but I don't have much experience. Will moving make a difference in that case?",proginprocess,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29j09m/my_area_flint_mi_is_bad_for_programming_work_but/,"I've gone through my story here a couple times. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems close to 3 years ago. Unfortunately, I did no internships or networking while in college. I had a junior programmer job at a printing company 7 months out of college, but got laid off 10 months ago. Since then, I've been looking for work and learning languages. I have only 2 projects on Github, but I'm looking to put more up later. I've had a few interviews, but nothing panned out. 

My main issue is that I don't have enough experience. Though I'm aiming for programming positions, I only got in a year and a half at my previous job. That was in an obscure language called FoxPro. Also, my degree was CIS. I didn't appreciate the difference between CS/CIS in college. I knew fairly early I wanted to program, but after transferring from Community College, a CS degree would have taken way longer and cost way more at that point. Now that I'm trying to learn all this extra stuff on my own, I feel I should have taken that hit and switched majors. Looking at the FAQ here for how to bridge the gap is daunting, and I don't have the money to go back to college. So, yeah, that's the big thing. I'm trying to bridge the gap, but it's hard.*

The second issue is that I live in Flint, Michigan. Aside from topping ""worst crime in Michigan"" lists every year, there's not a lot here in terms of programming work that I haven't already applied to. Heck, I've been applying to places 3-10 cities over since the start of my hunt, and not getting many bites. Due to meager savings post-layoff and my closeness to my relatives, I didn't want to move at first. Now I recognize I have to at some point. I was thinking of Lansing, because I see plenty of job postings coming from there and I've had relatives who lived there before and say it's nice. Any spot in MI where entry-level programmers are in demand will do though. I'll probably find some temp jobs to save up the money.

However, there's still the main issue. I don't have much work experience in programming. I also have a 10+ month gap on my resume. These things will still be true, even if I was able to move tomorrow. So, does it matter if I move? I think I can get temp work and save money, but the cost of moving will still be huge, and I don't want to take the gamble of moving if the move is ineffective.

*Please note I don't mean to start any war between CIS and CS majors here. I just feel I should have taken the CS degree."

29je3t,9,2014-07-01,I'm a complete loner.,ryemort,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/29je3t/im_a_complete_loner/,"[Light]

I recently started an internship with an accounting firm at the beginning of June. I was nervous, but felt like I made some friendly  aquaintinces pretty quickly. It always seemed like there was someone I could approach to say hi and chat for a minute. This was truly my biggest fear, because I haven't always been the greatest at meeting friends. Because I met a few people, I figured people were more mature and open to meeting more new people, or maybe I actually got better at making friends.

The firm has put together a lot of events that make us spend some time together. Mainly, trainings and conferences that give us the nights off to do the things that college kids do. The first event went well, the second was not so great, and tonight was just awful.

At this conference this week in particular, we got together in one of the other intern's hotel rooms to hang out. I wasn't invited, per se. I could have sat down next to any one of the 10 people in the room and they would have been okay with it, but we wouldn't have anything to talk about like every other person did. If I didn't run into the group in the lobby, I wouldn't have been notified of the gathering. I kind of invited myself.

Somehow, I managed to not make any friends without realizing it. It was just tonight, with me mostly keeping to myself in the corner, did I realize I missed my opportunity to connect with this group of peers. I'm kind of discouraged, because this happened to me my first year of college which led to an awful first year and a half on campus. On the other hand, I know it's not these people's job to make sure they're friends with me. If I want to be their friend, I need to engage them myself. 

It just hurts a little to not be recognized. Everyone already has their best friend, and while I'm pretty sure they don't dislike me, it's not like they want to make sure I'm present at gatherings like this like they do with other people. I could find other interns to hang out with, but this is the group who does what I want to do too - have a couple beers and get to know eachother out of the office and training. Obviously, I'm not so good at the latter.

So for the last few times we've been together, I've just been a leach. Following them around everywhere in hopes I can tag along without actually being invited. I don't like that I do it, but there's no other way I can get invited and be at this 'events' to maybe improve my situation. I feel like it's a Catch 22/Paradox sort of thing.

Basically, I'm not good at making friends and once again had everything go over my head to leave me with nothing. I'm just discouraged. I still like these people, but they hardly notice me. I don't necessarily want to be included or brought under their wing. I just want to be happy in the situation I'm in, whether that's not hanging out, leeching, or getting better. "
29jext,1,2014-07-01,Want to invest before leaving the country,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/29jext/want_to_invest_before_leaving_the_country/,"I'm French, but currently working in the US for a few more months (around 3). After that, I'll have to leave the US for at least a year, probably less than 3.

In 3 months, I will have around $15k sitting in a banking account. It seems stupid to me to get my money back to Europe, since there is a very high probability that I'll have to move it again to the US after few years.

More informations:

* I have absolutely **no** debt in the US (or anywhere else).
* I already have a nice enough emergency fund back in my home country.
* Since I'm pursuing an internship, I'm pretty sure I can't start saving for my retirement, and I have no employer-sponsored plan.
* I probably won't need the money as soon as I'm back in the US, but I might need to get some of it out, as a safety cushion.
* Thanks to some agreements between France and the US, I'm exempt of some of the federal taxes. I think I might have access to $5k more next year, but I'm not exactly sure when, nor how I will get it back.

Currently, I've two ideas:

* Just put the money in a savings account. I know it is not the best, but it will still be better than just having it sitting here. It looks like the easy way out to me.
* Investing it in a low-cost index fund.

I think investing it might be the best idea, but I'm annoyed by the fact I'll be out of the country, and I'm not sure how the taxes will work, nor if I can do the important stuff/papers/... from France (I plan to set it up before leaving though).

Do you have any other recommendations? Did I miss something? Maybe some of you have some experience on how to invest while being out of the US?

Thanks all!"

I was a fairly quiet, productive worker while my supervisor frequently took personal calls which occupied 2+ hours of her morning. Part of this time was spent complaining about her children, but sometimes she would talk about job opportunities. 

One day I decided to ask if she knew of anything opening up because my boyfriend was looking for work, and she immediately exploded into accusations of spying on her phone conversations. Mind you, I sat about 4 feet away from her all day while she blathered on about all sorts of things I didn't want to hear, but I didn't mention anything specific from her conversations. 

I immediately apologized and resumed my duties as a paper-filing robot, but the damage was done and she was already planning ways to make things more uncomfortable for me. Apparently she also wanted to discipline her misbehaving 12 year old daughter for running away by having her work in the office. No big deal, except for the fact that we deal with incredibly sensitive information and all employees must sign contracts to ensure that we won't leak private information such as student ID numbers, SSN's, and the like. 

While this kid was working here, my supervisor frequently assigned her to tasks where she would directly access this stuff and constantly bug me with one thing or another while I was trying to work. What bothered me most was that this girl, obviously bored, would entertain herself by reading this private information OUT LOUD and criticizing former students' private personal stories and backgrounds. I know this is not your typical snotty child/entitled parent post, but what power do I have in the future to prevent bosses' hellspawn from potentially leaking private info and at the same time maintaining my employment?"

But when I try to compile the code:

    nanodbc::connection connection(dsn, user, pass);  

this wild error appear:

Initially I thought the problem could have been the compiler since I was using MinGW-w64 x86_64 so I tried with the i686 version but with the same (or pretty similar) error. I also tried with vs2013 but it gave me a error too,
though I almost never used vs (^(again too young) ) so maybe I did something wrong.
Maybe I should change approach but I can't find anything useful on google.

29jwa6,12,2014-07-01,Full-time workloads,pandable,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29jwa6/fulltime_workloads/,"Last year, I interned for a Fortune 500 company. I created a plugin for one of their products. But I was actually spending very little time working.

My day usually began with a 2-3 hour nap. I got to my cube, checked/answered my email, and promptly went to sleep (I'm not a morning person).
Follow with an hour or so of coding--probably the most work-concentrated and the most productive part of my day.
Lunch for an hour.
Another 1-2 hours of coding scattered among regular internet breaks.

At the end of the summer, I presented the plugin, and they were pleased to the point that they decided to ship it with the next version of their product. They were shocked I could make a plugin like that in a summer, saying that it was something a full-timer might accomplish.

I'd been under the impression that I was only having such a relaxed work life because I was an intern. This summer, I have a similarly light workload (at another company). Is working full-time actually like this? Is it any different at companies like Google/Amazon that give the impression that their employees are always being productive?


EDIT: When I say I have a similarly light workload this summer, it's a little different--I don't sleep at work and I'm coding more (40% of the time most days)--but it's awfully light compared to my perception of a ""full-time"" workload. I expected to be coding at least 6 out of 8 hours, but I only hit 4 even on my most productive days (usually right after something is assigned or after I have an epiphany about how to do something)."

Maggie and my old roommate Tony had only dated a few months, and only been fucking for a few weeks, when Tony left for the summer to go out to Phoenix AZ for an internship. They had been separated for a month before Maggie could go out for a long Independence Day weekend, which of course was just an enormous fuckfest. When she got back she was still sore from getting fucked by Tony, and shared some of her info with her good friend Carol, who was seriously dating me at the time. 

Since this is /r/hotpast, I don't have to tell you that I eventually married Maggie and still think about her getting fucked by Tony and his big cock. Read some of my other stories - I didn't just hear about Maggie's naughty behavior with Tony, I listened and jerked off to them going at it a fair number of times too.

...

We didn't leave for two days. Just two days of him fucking me silly. oh my
god - I'm still sore from all the action.

We got to his place from the airport and he was just kissing and pawing me
as soon as we got in the apartment. I think he was surprised how fast I went
for his cock - I really wanted it. We fell on to a couch in his living room
and made out for like only a minute, and then I unzipped his pants and
pulled him out. I pulled him and stroked him in my hand with my mouth locked
on his. i pulled away and looked down at his monster. Tony had the biggest
cock of any boy of my experience. I'd only sucked him a couple of times before so I
still wasn't used to how big he is. But I wanted to show him I could handle
him, that I wasn't afraid to take his cock whole.

I kissed him long, and then took a deep breath. I opened my mouth wide and
lowered my mouth onto his cock. It was pulsing and hot, huge in my mouth. I
bobbed up and down a few times and then withdrew, jacking his shaft and
staring at Tony's huge penis head. I looked Tony in the eyes, and I think he
knew I was about to go wild on him. And then I devoured him - sucking him as
far into my mouth as I could, deeping him, pulling his massive thing out of
my mouth and licking it all over like candy, kissing it, sucking again,
deeping again. I couldn't believe how huge he was in my mouth, how I was
eating him all up like no boy before.

I sat up and unbuttoned my blouse. Tony's hands roamed over me, unsnapping
my bra. I pulled the blouse off and shucked off my bra. Tony fell to sucking
and licking my nipples; I continued to work his slab in my hands, pulling on
the shaft with one hand while massaging his glans with the other. It was
slick and rock hard. A month away from that meat was a month too long - I
was ready for a good fucking. ""Take off your clothes.""

Tony stood up and stripped off his shirt, but his cock bobbed in front of
me. I was so close to it, I couldn't resist sucking him into my mouth. and
this time it was a sucking - i took him into my mouth and sucked like a baby
on the bottle. His huge cock did not leave my mouth as I moved my little
tongue on the head and shaft as his cut mass filled my mouth. I reached up my right hand and gently moved my fingers along his shaft stroking and tickling as he fucked my mouth. I gripped the shaft - I could get a lot of him in my mouth and have room left over to stroke and pull that long thick shaft. I let go, and, not letting that sweet penis out for a moment, I pulled his pants down around his ankles. He slowly pulled out, but I greedily sucked him hard , savoring it until the last second. Then I lay back on the couch and watched him take his pants all the way off. Tony stood before me - naked and hard, the ball head of his cock glistening.

He reached down and tore my shorts and panties off. I spread my legs wide and touched his glans to guide him in. He put that big dick up at the lips of my pussy.

Go slow, I asked him. And then - Do you care if I touch myself while you fuck me?

No . . . no . . . do it.

I lay there spreadlegged and rubbed my clit. I also held Tony's massive head against my slit and rubbed it. I let him go deeper and deeper in as I rubbed myself. Soon I was thrusting in to him to take him deeper and deeper. And then I said - ""Oh, now fuck me""

Tony began to ram me, fucking deeper and deeper into me, filling me with cock. I lifted my legs in the air and urged him to fuck me, harder and harder. And louder! Later I wouldn't believe that less than 20 minutes after setting my bags down, I would be bare assed naked, laying on the couch with my feet poked up in the air, speared with Tony's cock, talking like a whore.

What a fucking he gave me on the couch that day! And how hard I came. And Tony came so hard - come spilled out of me onto the couch and we had to clean it up naked together. And then, I just had to clean Tony's meat off with my mouth - and it all started over again, only this time I was bent over the futon in the next room and fucked like a dog.

But that's another story . . ."

A regular job would also qualify, just as long as the employer signs the appropriate papers.

I am perfectly bilingual and possess a wealth of knowledge in relation to information technology and computer science. I assure you that my expertise far extends what would be expected from my academic history. 

Programming and web development are what interest me most and I'd prefer gaining valuable experience in those fields. Sadly my prospects seem to be limited to retail work and call centers or if I'm very lucky, system administration. I've been spending the best of the previous week getting told to send resumes and not hearing anything back. 

I know turning to reddit for this is probably a bad idea, but I'm beat at this point. If anyone can use unpaid qualified labor or knows somebody who does, I'd appreciate a tip. Thank you for your time and have a nice day."
29ki9p,0,2014-07-01,Do you think I will be able to get a job at Apple?,FrameWork0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/29ki9p/do_you_think_i_will_be_able_to_get_a_job_at_apple/,"I know the answer to this may be too obvious but I'm really not sure about it. I go to college and in my area there is an Apple Store in a mall and I would love to be able to work there as a retailer. I checked their website a couple of times and it seems like there are positions but I don't know if they'll take me since they don't mention anything about the kind of qualification they are looking for. Here is why I'm questioning whether they'll take me or not, as far as qualifications on paper, I don't have that many. Never worked before, a rising sophomore in college with a computer major which arguably may or may not contribute to my job as a retailer and I'm not 18 yet but turning 18 very soon.

I would love to work in the Apple Store. It would be almost like a dream coming true. But not only is it gonna be a job that I would enjoy but also it would help me have the ""past experience"" and plus, I think it would qualify as a reason for me to move to the better summer dorm (for interns) as opposed to the summer students dorm which sucks.

I'm most likely gonna want to work on the summer, so nothing after the beginning of the Fall semester since I don't plan on working during the school year, only in summers.I would still work though if I had the opportunity and its not a loaded schedule. 

So my question is, for those of you who applied to work at Apple as a retailer (nothing higher), what was it like exactly? what are the qualifications they were seeking out for? I mean I don't see why I would really need a degree to work as a retailer there and most of the employees there don't seem to be college students just like me. 

And also, if you guys don't think this is a great idea, what would suggest to do to have some work experience and also get the benefit to moving to the intern dorms.

Thanks in advance"

29kpix,2,2014-07-01,My [20 F] sister is not on speaking terms with my parents but continues to be financially dependent on them and is abusing their trust.,belatenhet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29kpix/my_20_f_sister_is_not_on_speaking_terms_with_my/,"**Background:** Whenever my younger sister (whom I’ll call J) gets into a relationship she becomes distant with all of her friends and family. She ignores phone calls and texts unless it's her bf or his friends. J’s first relationship was during her first year of college. The relationship was extremely toxic (he was controlling and emotionally abusive), however having never been in a relationship she chalked it up to being normal and that this is what love is. This is when her relationship of trying to balance her love life and the relationship with her friends/family began to deteriorate. My sister has always had a good relationship with my family but when she was dating her first bf, she would cut ties completely and only contact them when a payment was due as my parents pay for her tuition. 

Now J is in a new relationship. She’s staying at her college for the summer b/c she has an internship. The internship is unpaid. She is working another job but the pay is very minimal (she only works 3x a week) and therefore my parents are still covering the bulk of the cost for her to stay down there. Recently, J has asked my parents for $900 to cover for her upcoming apartment bill (the one she’s living in for this upcoming year and the one she’s staying in). The problem is J has a tendency to ignore people when she’s in a relationship and it has been difficult to get a hold of her. She only will answer a call/text when it concerns money. Now I find out that the apartment my parents are paying for her to stay at-- her bf is living with her. My parents know that she has a bf but not that he’s living with her nor that they are paying for his expenses as well b/c he is living there. Her roommate that is supposed to be living with her in her current apartment will not be moving in until mid July but has stated he didn’t want other people living there. B/c my parents work hard and have odd hours (they travel a lot), they’ve asked me to get a hold of my sister and to have her break down the costs that this $900 needs to be covered for. I asked for details and to provide the bills. She has gotten defensive and ignores my texts or doesn’t answer my questions when she chooses to answer back to my texts.

She claims b/c she is working hard as a pre-med student that her deteriorating relationship with her family and friends is excusable. That any financial aspect in regards to J is none of my concern. But I am worried b/c she demands money and will make a huge fuss about it but won’t be direct with my parents about the costs. She asks for a lump sum but doesn’t provide pictures of the bills, rarely speaks on the phone or answers their texts, and now is going behind their back by having her bf live with her-- whom they’ve never properly met. J claims to be busy but has weekends off. Now I find out on those weekends she’s binge drinking and getting high. J is an adult so those are her choices to make but when she’s still financially dependent I feel she needs to show more respect and not make excuses as to why she ignores her family and her friends. J has never been good at balancing relationships with her bf and the ones she had before her bf came into the picture. In her mind one has to give and it is usually the latter. She becomes codependent on her bf (hangs out only with his friends, takes all the same classes, etc etc). They are both pre-med majors but have not taken the MCATs yet. She claimed she would be studying for them this summer but then every weekend has been out drinking/getting high/or going to music festivals. I only know this b/c of a mutual friend that J and I have. This mutual friend goes to the same university as J and is down there for the summer for her research position. None of this my parents know b/c J refuses to talk to them until she needs money from them. Am I being unreasonable by feeling an intervention is needed? This issue is between her and my parents but she rarely speaks to them and my parents work odd hours and travel a lot so as the older sister they have asked me from time to time to check in on J and to make sure everything is okay. However, I have also had difficult getting a hold of J and the last time we talked it turned into an argument in which J’s shifted the entire blame on me for trying to ruin her life. What should I do? Do I let it go or do I tell my parents what is going on since it’s obvious J will not be doing it anytime soon.


---   
**tl;dr**: Younger sister rarely speaks to my parents unless she needs money. My parents are paying for her summer class and her rent. She has convinced my parents she is working hard as a pre-med major but I find out she spends weekends wasted and high. She has moved in her bf who lives in the apartment (that my parents pay for). Is she being reasonable or is it just excuses? Is intervention needed?

29l4gx,41,2014-07-01,Evil owner rant... (wall of text),[deleted],TalesFromYourServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/29l4gx/evil_owner_rant_wall_of_text/,"I know you all are going to tell me to find another job but I love my restaurant a lot and this is truly the only downside. But the owner of my restaurant and building is soulless and inconsiderate and should not be in the position he's in.   

For context, the manager of the restaurant quit about 2 months ago, and the owner hasn't hired anyone since. So he is doing some managerial duties while the asst. manager has to do a shitton more without a pay raise.  

This is probably why I got the job at the restaurant, however, because I'm young and have no restaurant experience and he still hired me as a server. At first it was a shitshow but now I've made it through the learning curve and I consider myself to be a great server.  I work busy shifts and make great money. The assistant manager constantly compliments me on how hard I work and the other servers thank me for working so well for how young I am (19).  

I also love working here.  I love my fellow servers, and I truly love all of my customers. I love going into work every weekend. My greeting smile is always genuine. It's a dream job.  

Except for the owner.  

Two months ago, before the summer shifts, he approached me asking if I wanted to take over the Saturday night shifts. I was thrilled because, it being summer, I was looking for more shifts. It would be a double, because I already work Saturday brunch, but I was up for it and he really wanted to give me the shift because I was a good server and he wanted to reward me. It was a very popular shift and I would make a lot.  

So I started doing my permanent doubles on saturdays and really enjoyed doing so - I was never tooo burnt out from 16-hour days, and I loved getting to know the evening waitstaff. It was fun partying with my coworkers after work and the night regulars were even more fun than the brunch regulars. I was so happy and making a lot more money. Around this time I told the owner that I would be happy to take another shift because my summer internship was only going to be 2 days a week.   

Then I switched internships to one that was 3 days a week, and decided that I actually didn't want to take any more shifts. The day after the switch, I went to the restaurant to tell the owner my change in availability, but before I could speak he told me that I was scheduled for two new shifts the following wednesday and thursday (4 days later). When I explained to him that I couldn't work those shifts he got really mad and started yelling at me about how I was so unreliable and how I was a bad server because I wasn't putting the restaurant job over my internship. I tried to calmly explain to him that I would have reconsidered if he had told me earlier about this huge change in shifts, but since I had gotten no word that I was going to get more, it made sense for me to do the internship. He wasn't taking any of it and huffed away. Later that night the assistant manager told me that he had walked into the office saying ""fuck dildaux"".   

Everyone else backed me up and agreed that it was irresponsible of him to schedule me for 2 new shifts and not telling me until 4 days before they started, and they understood that because I'm a student, he shouldn't expect me to prioritize a waitressing job over a career-helping internship. I wasn't too bothered by it, until the next week...     

In the middle of my next saturday double, I got a call from the office. It was the assistant manager (the owner didn't want to handle it...) telling me that the owner was implementing a new policy where there are no longer permanent doubles and that I would have to drop one of my Saturday shifts. I was forced to decide right then and there which shift I wanted to lose. It broke my heart and I had to give up the saturday night shift. There weren't any available shifts for me to take so I was out a few thousand dollars for the summer.   

The next day I asked my friend who works doubles on Sundays if he had heard about the new policy. Of course he hadn't. It only applied to me. The owner cut one of my shifts because he was mad I wouldn't work the extra shifts. It was a petty revenge and absolutely heartless. Everyone knew I was amazing at doing the doubles and the saturday night regulars loved me.  

Now I'm stuck trying to cover shifts because I'm short money. I know I should leave but I love everything else about the restaurant and I don't know if anyone else would hire me with so little experience. Plus, once the semester starts again I won't be able to work as much anyways. I just can't believe he's so immature.  

Sry for the block of text. I didn't mean to type so much. Just needed to get it all out.  

**tl;dr: owner got mad at me for prioritizing my career over waitressing and cut one of my shifts out of petty revenge.**"

Currently I'm in a city that's my dream city. But in 2 months, I have to go back to my college town, which is closer to my Nparents. I've been trying to look for a job here while I'm here for after graduation in 6 months, so I can finally be free of my Nparents, but I really don't know what I want to do or what jobs are called here that would let me do what I'm good at. I'm good at: data entry, writing (I'm a journalism major), and enjoy programming. 

I just took an HTML/CSS class and am trying to develop my own website as a portfolio, but I want to make it look a certain way and don't know how to do that. If anyone could help me with that, it'd be great.

I want to take more technical classes and gain more skills and network, but I don't know what skills I'll need for a job after graduation. Ideally I want to build websites, so I'm taking a Photoshop class next month. If anyone else has any advice on technical classes that would fit with any job, let me know.

The lack of self confidence extends to my internship. I don't know how to network with anyone there, and I'm afraid to try to branch out and talk to someone there who does what I think would be fun as a job: social media manager. I don't even know how to approach them or what to ask. I just want to see what they do, if they like it and how they got hired for it. But I am afraid they would think I was weird and I don't know how to explain why I'd be emailing them out of the blue. I also have some ideas on stories to possibly do (it's a journalism internship), but I have no confidence they'd be taken seriously. I'm also clueless on whether or not I'll be offered a job there after the internship is done, if so, when that will happen, and I have no idea how to stand out from other people there. I always ask if anyone has any extra work to do and let people know that I'm going to do stuff without being asked to, but not sure if that's enough.

My Nparents have said that because of my age (almost 30), I won't get hired by any company because companies would rather hire someone younger. This makes it hard for me to believe that my internship or anywhere else would want to hire me.

I was abused from the age of 3 growing up and that makes it hard for me to feel comfortable and confident in interviews, as well as reach out to new people. I tend to just ""think"" about doing stuff, and rarely actually do it. Plus I know I can't tell my Nparents about the job search here because they would just discourage me, like they did with my internship. 

I feel so lost and don't even know if these technical classes or making my own portfolio website is even a good idea. I have spent nearly 30 years doing what my Nparents wanted and now I don't even know how to trust or know what I want. So frustrated and bummed out."

Met a girl off POF 3 weeks ago, it was clear she was extremely into me from the start, sending me bikini pics within the first day of knowing her through text. Biggest red flag - she dropped the L bomb on me after we had sex on our second date. 

I have already told her that I just want this to be a summer thing. At first she was disappointed because she wanted something more, but then she expressed that she realizes that I will be gone and she is fine with it being a summer thing. However, I don't really believe her as she periodically makes FB statuses about me. In addition, she is spending lots of money on me (buying me clothes, hats) and I feel bad because she does not have much income. I believe this may be her way of trying to win me over. I have also gone on a date with a girl and had a drunken makeout session with another in the time that I've known her (which I obviously have not disclosed to her) 

Basically, she's VERBALLY expressed that she's cool with our relationship being a fling but my gut tells me she wants more and I would hate to break her heart. At the same time, I want sex.

What would you do in my situation?"

It seems to be very difficult compared to something like web development which has more positions available than mobile. I have no software development internships/work experience. The state I live in is TN and I have been applying to non-local positions because there are no open Android positions where I live. I have gotten non-local interviews but never get past the engineer stage, even when there are no coding challenges. I also have my fair share of resume rejections. It seems that MOST of the job listings require 2+ years of experience, which I have, just none working for others. As a result, I've tried to look at internships even though I already graduated. I've only come across an unpaid internship where he wants me to sign a NDA with 6-month non-compete after the internship and he wants to develop an app in ""stages."" I've also tried Elance thinking it might help me get a full-time job as I can put the contract positions on my resume but that website is ridiculous for software engineers and it is very difficult for a person from USA to get a job on there. I have 4 Android applications I have done as side-projects on my resume already, 3 of which are on Google Play. They are mostly apps that I solely developed, but I have been told that companies only care if you worked for someone else (not about projects that you solely developed). As a result, I am considering on doing the unpaid one. Is this a bad decision? I wish I could get something paid on elance but it seems that most of the jobs there want iPhone as well which I don't know. I wonder if learning iOS is a necessity these days for so-called ""Android Engineer"" positions. I believe I am pretty good at what I do as I understand how Google stock applications work (ex. contacts, calendar) from reading the source code and have coded multiple applications, but no one will give me a chance. Would taking a regular back-end software engineering position help me get a job in Android development even if it is not a responsibility? What should I do?"

I was chosen from this program as national finalist and am truly truly thankful to have this opportunity given to me.

Unfortunately I come from a really poor family, my parents have no way of supporting me and even taking $50 dollars from them can put them in jeopardy of not making their bills on time. They're Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and I was their first child. Basically had to figure out life for my own here, basically had to go through religious hell growing up...

He has a terrible kidney and is on dialysis every week and leeches off of my poor working mother. I have 4 younger siblings she is trying to support and my family eats off of fucking food stamps. Even as a college student in debt I go out of my way to pay for my siblings school supplies and try to support them in any way shape or form possible.

Once I'm paid I will definitely repay whoever helps me, and we can sign a contract in writing. I'm only asking for $250 to help me make it until the 16th. After that I should be okay on my own.

I would like to eventually be able to live in one place and not have to spend a lot of time on site.

My second question is what is the process of becoming a PM/CM? Do you start out as one right out of college or do you work as project engineer for a couple years then gradually take on more responsibilities until you are capable of handling an entire project on your own. I have heard from some people that you start as a project engineer but I am not sure if this is accurate.

I recently just graduated with a bachelors of electrical engineering in Massachusetts. I got hired as an intern mid way through my final semester and got hired full time. I currently work in the power field as a distribution engineer. I can already tell that this is not the field for me, but I plan on staying for a while to gain some experience in the real world.

I was considering r and d or maybe systems engineering, but I'm not sure which one would suit me best. I love designing circuits and designs, designing anything at all, coming up with different solutions for problems, trial and error, making things from scratch etc.

On the flip side, I'm kind of like a hybrid computer/electrical engineer. I like to program as well, am very interested in cyber security, cryptography, penetration testing and that field as well. Programming can be a lot of fun. 

I don't want to be limited to only programming like a software developer, maybe a penetration tester or something along those lines would be very interesting to me though, even though those jobs are far and few to come by.

Anyone have any ideas? Maybe some alternatives other than something I listed that might work well for me? Open to all options!

Bureaucratic bullshit leaves me an internship away from obtaining my degree in Information Science &amp; Technology from a respected University. Rather than bide my time at this minimum wage job that was only supposed to last a year but turned into three years I was scoping around for new jobs that paid me what I know I'm worth.

A friend turned me onto a job that will be hiring come August a few weeks ago that pays extremely well. I decided I would stop smoking come the 15th of June but actually stopped on the 19th of June because I wanted to clear out my stash. I had not realized how much marijuana had assisted in my day-to-day life. From handling my job, to being more energetic, to enjoying things in life, and just about any other aspect.

I have not smoked in nearly two weeks now and I feel like my brain is going to crack. Throughout my early twenties, I'm in my mid-to-late-twenties now, I feel like I have developed anxiety and depression beyond what I had throughout high school. Typical things that were told to me that I found out were lies like, go to college and work hard and you'll get a job. Things will be okay once you graduate. We're here to help you. Turns out it's all lies and bullshit. Sure it may workout for some people but for the general populous you might graduate but all you have to show for it is a pile of school loan debt, a piece of paper, and a shitty job. Nobody wants to help you unless you fight them for their help. Typically, things don't seem to work out.

No matter how bad my situation got I could always find solace in marijuana. It would calm my brain. I could think rationally. I would do things I wanted to do. I would have fun. Most importantly I was able to live my life the way I wanted to. I'm finding out now that since I quit smoking that I'm severely depressed and my anxiety is through the roof. I had the absolute worst week of work last week and did not even have the comfort of knowing I could go home and unwind with a bowl and a few friends. That doesn't mean I didn't hang out with my friends but while I was hanging out with them all I could think about was how much I didn't want to wake up and do it all again the next day.

I've discussed it with my parents since I am still living in their house and my mom truly understand where I am coming from. She has her own prescribed meds that work for her and she has suggested maybe I should try and get on some of those in the meantime but what she doesn't know is that I've experimented with them in the past and do not like what they do to my psyche. I just explain that I have this thing that works for me and I'd rather not try anything else. If it's not broke don't fix it.

This is where you fine ents come in because I'm not quite sure where else to turn. I feel like I could just go pick up an eighth and smoke up until a few weeks before the interview in August and quit a few weeks before that. Unfortunately I'm about 6'2"" and 230 pounds with a not so fast metabolism. I also do not work out so I'm not quite sure that would be long enough, hence my trying to quit so far in advance. My other option is potentially to just fork over the money for a Whizzinator and some synthetic urine since most people around these parts seem to have luck with those. What's your experience in these situations?

I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm trapped at the end of a hall with no exits. If you read this I thank you.

TL;DR - *Might* get a job in August that has a pre-employment drug test. Stopped well in advance to clean up but am losing my mind to anxiety and depression. What do? What's your experience been like in similar situations?"
29m9on,6,2014-07-01,How and when do I express interest in a girl that is abroad?,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/29m9on/how_and_when_do_i_express_interest_in_a_girl_that/,"Hey /r/trp, basically there was this girl I met earlier this year, she was friends with my friends and we would all hang out. She indicated interest in my friend however, he didn't really want her. Afterwards, she was interested in me, however I didn't go for it back then because she wasn't that attractive.

When we would hang out, she would tell me about her relationships. I learned I was better looking than all the guys she has been with. Before she head out to go to India for a one year internship program I learned about her break up with the most recent guy. 

Basically, this guy only wanted anal sex, and turns out they had anal sex a lot. Now, after I heard she did butt stuff, my interest was peeked. I never fucked a girl in the ass, and all the ones I encountered are completely against it. I want to fuck her in the ass purely for the novelty aspect and to check it off my bucket list.

So how exactly do I pull it off, she comes back in 11 months. I have her skype, and facebook, and number. Should I just wait till she comes back and then take her out somewhere, or do I try to build it up? "

Really bad...",TheCarm,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29mj9o/i_m21_need_help_feeling_better_during_a_break/,"This may be a long post, please bear with me I'm way down in the dumps and would like some help, also... some stuff here may sound a lot worse than what actually happened. 

My girlfriend and I are made for each other, IMO. She is sweet, understand, not political, and avoids conflict. She is beautiful and always puts me first with everything. I am outgoing, manly (which is what she says I am and really likes, not trying to sound conceited), devoted to her, and everything I do I have her in mind and I really just love her so much. She is my dream girl. Here is the problem, which I take full responsibility for and have always felt unbelievable horrible about: 

In our relationship, we had only three problems. During the rest of the time, we were the happiest we have ever been in our lives, and during the bad, we were the saddest we have every been in our lives. It was not just medium level emotions involved. We were unbelievably living and happy 99% of the time. But I have made some mistakes that have affected her a lot and made her very sad. Here is what I did:

As a 21 year old college student, I use to tend to drink a lot. One night about 4 months into the relationship, I had a big anger trip and ended up yelling at her and making her leave my apartment. I didn't even remember it the next day. I hurt her a lot. I went to the ends of the earth to make her happy from then on and she forgave me, being the absolute amazing girl that she is. Then we went on for another six months and I got in some trouble in school that ended in a suspension (just cussing out an RA, nothing drastic), this did not affect her but I think she thought a little lower of me after. So I proved to her that I would fix myself up and I did so by getting a good job, taking classes at another school, among other things where I made myself much mroe responsible and we had no incidents until this past weekend when I visited her in New York. I got too drunk at a bar and had a minor anger trip again. Nothing even close to the first time, but she still did not deserve it. It hurt her a lot again, and I told her that I was going to prove to her that I can become a better man for her. Well low and behold I come home from New York and get a DUI that night (I drank on the train home and didn't feel drunk at all, it was honestly an unlucky situation.) Now she tells me It is impossible to trust me, which I understand on one hand and I don't on the other hand. All in all she told me this:

She wants to just have a break from each other, and she still loves me so so so much. She says that she feels like we have become far too reliant on each other for our happiness and have changed a lot since we first met. She is right, when we first met we were independent, driven, positive, and in shape individuals. Over the relationship we got a bit lazy in our fitness, became reliant on each other to be happy on a daily basis and when bad things happened in life we couldn't deal with it without each other. Even friends didn't help. 

I now have quit drinking (not a drop for at least 6 months probably longer), tobacco, everything that is holding me back from being a better man. I am getting a job despite taking classes and doing community service. I am determined to become a better person in every aspect, I cannot act like a freshman in college anymore (no offense.) The partying, the cavalier attitude, etc... it all has to go, and WILL go. She told me that when she comes back from summer she will be ecstatic to see me and if I am this person I say I am, AND if she can do that same and become an overall more driven and positive person, then we are (no guarantees) likely to be a happy couple again. But right now it is too fresh and she really just needs time. 

Here's the thing, this girl (all of my friends and family admit this openly) is very different from anyone else i've met. She is innocent (hates the thought of people having bad intentions, enjoys stuffed animals still, etc.) yet is an intelligent engineering student who works as an intern for the Department of Environmental Protection and is just incredibly mature and open minded and sweet and just so cute. So when she tells me these things, I fully believe her, she has never lied to me. So I hope you do not think she is just setting us up so a breakup is easier or anything, she honestly means all these things she said. 

I am having the worst time being away from her and I know that I deserve this and I know I'm incredibly lucky to have a girlfriend who gives me a chance to prove it to her that I love her and WILL become a better man and show her how far I have come and her comitting to do exactly the same, not just sit around and see if ""i'm good enough for her or something."" So please no cynical comments or assuming bad intentions from her, she really is too honest and caring to do that. 

So from you, if you are still reading (God bless all of you who are), how can I help myself live my life without despairing over 1. how much I've hurt her which I feel terrible about 2. Not having my rock there for me supporting me as I go through the toughest time of my life 3. push my doubts about myself, her, and US out of my mind and 4. not cry myself to sleep every night since that is the time where I have full quiet, no distractions, and nothing to do and al I do is think about this amazing, loving, beautiful, smart, dream girl that I let down and feel like death knowing so. Any help is welcome.

**tl;dr**: I hurt my girlfriend/dream girl/most perfect girl to ever live :) three times over the course of a 1 yr 3m relationship, i proved to her every time that she can trust me to not make the same mistakes again, I screw up, am going through the toughest point in my entire life, and she needs a break from me and is not contacting me until she says she is strong enough to. How can I quit all of the sad horrible thoughts and simply do what i need to do?"
29msy8,12,2014-07-02,Asking an old friend from middle school to a date,hahahelloo,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/29msy8/asking_an_old_friend_from_middle_school_to_a_date/,"So, I want to get back together with a friend of mine from middle school, and she is 2 years younger than me. I will be in my second year in college while she will be a senior in highschool.

What happened during middle school: Me and her talk for hours through IMing eachother and shared cat photos, all the normal things. We also talked in school while we can and played badminton with each other 4 days a week. Then, once when I get into highschool, she suddenly does not talk to me anymore. It might be me that caused her to stop talking to me, it might be that I did not initiate to talk to her so that she decided I have no interest in her, or it might be someone else that might have told her something (fake) about me and she decided to cut ties from me. The weirder part is that her sister (same age as me) would not look at me in the eyes, and her friends also broke ties with me as well. Christ, all of this is making my head hurt, I hate thinking about this.

Throughout highschool, I have basically ignored all of the signs of other girls flirting with me and basically did not date anyone for the 4 years I was there. Then, freshman year of college, I dated a girl for a whole week, just to notice that I have had no true feelings for the girl and I basically broke it off with her and stayed as a friend.

I decided to myself that I have to face the reality, the girl that I spoke to in middle school is the one that I really want. I feel that if she rejects me, I am going to be veeeery slightly comforted that I will have an answer to my dilemma, and if she accepts me, I will kick out my depression and get with her as soon as I can.

Now, there are some variables that I have to get past:

* The age difference, of course, but maybe if I can take her to a couple of high school dances for her senior year, I can make it a long term relationship!
* She is probably way out of my league. She can sing, cook, is amazing on the piano, is extremely smart, funny, and is a great public speaker. All I can do is play the viola (although quit for 2 years), draw, program really well (got an internship my Freshman year without connections!), and play video games.
* I am not totally sure if she is dating anyone, which would make asking her to a date awkward
* Guys obviously flirt with her all the time, posting on her facebook and taking pictures with her face on their face (trying to not seem creepy with this...)
* I do not have a driver's license due to multiple variables in my life, and even my permit expired (no time, terrible eyesight caused a problem, pretty severe motion sickness which I am trying to get past)
* I have no idea where she ""hangs out"" with other people, so approaching her directly isn't exactly an option. I can get her address since one of my friends is dating her sister, though.
* Lastly, I do not know at all what she thinks of me, since the breaking of ties was so sudden. I dont know if she hates me or thinks I am creepy, but I do not know how to approach this at all.

Overall, I am asking, should I go for it? Should I ask her?
If I should, how? I cannot just drop off at her house and knock on the door. Facebooking is a terrible idea as well.
I was thinking of drawing a picture and writing a letter to her and dropping it off at her house, but might this be a bit too direct?
Then, where should I take her for a first date if she says yes when the stars align? She is a pretty classy lady, so if anywhere, I would take her to a theater in the city, but we have to take a train if we do, or even get our parents (awkward, rather not do this), due to me not having a driver's license. 

Getting all of this off my chest is really relieving, and if she says yes, might as well strike me as the happiest person on the planet after breaking out of my years of depression.

Thank you in advance for all of your responses."
29mxns,2,2014-07-02,"My [22f] friendship with my best friend [21f] is rocky, partly due to my boyfriend who is older, but also her life choices.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29mxns/my_22f_friendship_with_my_best_friend_21f_is/,"*Some detail about me:* I am a university student in a relationship with a man 20 years older than me. We are extraordinarily happy. In fact, I could not be happier. I think he's the best thing since sliced bread and he can't wait to marry me. Our relationship is equitable, fair, and always interesting. He is my partner and best friend and I hope we have many decades of happiness, love, laughter, and joy ahead of us. Please understand this question is NOT about my relationship with my man; this is just some context.

I am not particularly interested in alcohol or drugs. I do not smoke. I value fitness, health, and I enjoy exercising with my dog and my boyfriend.

I am career-oriented, presently going to uni part time, working a job, and doing an internship.

My boyfriend is extremely educated and has a PhD. I value education a lot too

*Some detail about her:* She is a university student also, living in the dorms at the uni. She ended a long term relationship a while ago; is presently dating a young man her age who is flunking out of school (literally), who likes to get blackout drunk on a weekly basis, and enjoys drug consumption. She also drinks and smokes pot very often. I have nothing against alcohol or drugs, for the matter, as sometimes I dip into that kinda stuff too.

*The situation tonight...*: We have always been very close and gotten along despite our differing values. Tonight, we planned to meet at 7 pm (JUST THE 2 OF US - me and her) to enjoy some fireworks for Canada Day. I was with my boyfriend from 2 pm. We were just eating some lunch when I got a text message, at 3 pm, from my friend. She said she was done work early and wanted to meet up soon. I let her know I was with the boyfriend but she was free to join us. I planned to spend time with him until 7 pm, when I would see her.

They had never met until today.

so she joined us, and things were alright. But they went sour pretty fast. I think overall she was pretty bored and kept changing her mind about what she wanted to do. Me and Boyfriend were super accomodating, asking her several times what she would like to do. Finally we just sat in the shade. I wanted to see some more festivities, but she got a message from her friend asking if she wanted to hang out. I was very surprised when she told him she would indeed like to hang out. She said she may take off for a few hours but come back at 7 pm to see the fireworks with me.

I did not want to push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with, and  I could sense my age gap with my boyfriend was bugging her perhaps. So I said she should do what would make her happy.

Well, her friend wasn't particularly coordinated and they never ended up meeting. It was around 7 pm when we (me, Boyfriend, and her) went for a cold drink at a bar nearby. Boyfriend was complaining about a headache and said he was not sure if he wanted to stay to see the fireworks with us (he was never in the original plan anyway, and the ONLY way I would ever let him hang out with us all night would be if I could see she WANTED him to, 100%!). She said he should go home if he feels unwell.

Just as we paid the bill, she got a message from her friend again and she said to me, 'Let's go soon. My friends are waiting. We can see the fireworks together.' ...She absolutely did not even ASK me if I wanted to see the fireworks with her friends. She just decided she would see it with her friends, despite the fact the plan was very clearly for me and her to see it alone. 

I agreed just to be friendly, and we said goodbye to Boyfriend. The fireworks were fine. Her friends took some weed and offered me some but I said no. Walking home, she started to ask me some pretty rude, thoughtless questions about my boyfriend and our relationship. Stuff like, ""I can't imagine dating a guy that much older"" and ""do you ever get gross stares?"" and ""You must not tell people about him right? You don't want to get judged, right?""

It just felt like a personal attack, to be questioned so strangely. They didn't seem like questions designed to be thought-provoking for my benefit. They didn't seem to be particularly well thought out at all. It seemed like a concealed way for her to express disdain about the relationship, despite the fact she could see our dynamic is great together, he clearly makes me happy, etc. she's known about him for MONTHS now, and I was 100% honest with how old he is. She has always known... it was no surprise.

I would have no issue with a genuine friend coming to me in concern to ask if I have thought out my relationship choice, if this is really right for me, etc.. and perhaps to even express some concern about the age difference! Perfectly reasonable, and dare I say, respectable. She didn't take the time to reflect on her meeting him or anything. The questions were so negative.

Another issue... I have gone through a horrible time with a very close friendship with a male friend of mine recently. It hurt and was painful as hell, but I did. We still have a few loose ends to tie and she was quick to just put my feelings about him down. Like, ""oh come on, get over it"" and ""stop obsessing about him!"" when I was just trying to express how I felt in a very honest, non-obsessive way.

I don't know how to handle this behaviour. I thought the request to just randomly see her friends made no sense. I am not sure how to approach this topic with her again.

Can someone make sense of this, please?

**tl;dr**: My friend and I have some lifestyle differences, which we have always dealt with. However, the meeting of my older boyfriend seemed to make her uncomfortable and bring out the worst in her. I am not sure how to cope."

I'm studying hard in grad school but I'm a better coder than I am a researcher. I write awesome software but people have scooped me by publishing an idea with unworkable code or worse, with no open source code at all! I feel like academia is far more concerned with a nice paper than with a nice result and this is just pushing me to get out asap.

Anyways I now have a Google Summer of Code internship and I'm kicking butt; I'm making high quality committs and my feature is coming along nicely. I think I'm ready to ditch the grad school and follow my passion. That said, the next few months are going to be full of heart ache for me no matter what. Either I'll apply to many companies and get ignored and out competed by people with formal CS degrees crushing my aspirations, or I'll get a job and I'll have to say goodbye to my colleagues who I love.

Anyways it's my cake day and I just got home from visiting my friend on the Google campus (where daydream material abounds). Decent day I guess.

29n3n0,3,2014-07-02,Do you think I show symptoms of a 'disorder' or whether I'm someone who can pick myself up if I change my habits? [Warning: Long post],[deleted],depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/29n3n0/do_you_think_i_show_symptoms_of_a_disorder_or/,"For a long time now I've gone through cycles of thinking I'm clinically depressed and will never be able to cope with life's basic challenges, to thinking that this is just what I'm telling myself and that I can coach myself out of my 'issues' if I put my mind to it. I would be grateful if someone with experience of depression could comment on my situation so I can compare it with someone's genuine experiences. I know this seems self indulgent and I'll try to keep it brief.

For about 7 or 8 years I've battled against apathy to varying degrees of success. As a teenager I spent my days smoking weed and skipping school. Somehow, I miraculously got good grades and went to university. When I went, I failed two years in a row and was so scared about telling my parents that I lied and said I was still attending. This was a very shadowy part of my life that I never talk about or really even remember that well. Things were very bad at this time.

When I tried to return home after flunking, my parents kicked me out. That was the reality check that I needed but it hit me extremely hard. I began trying to turn things around, but this came at the price of intense anxiety and I came close to suicide many times.

Eventually, I got a job and studied part time to go to university again. In 2011 I got accepted to university for the second time. In the first year I struggled with the same issues as before but managed to scrape a pass grade. The second year of study I averaged a high grade, got onto the football team, made some good friends and generally participated more in life. This was a huge step forward for me but there were occasional periods of extreme apathy and laziness and one or two suicidal periods. I didn't know why these were happening at the time, but in hindsight I can see it's because I was letting apathy grip me so tightly that I felt too ashamed to live or face anyone or anything, so I would lock myself in my room for weeks, eat the bare minimum to survive and just stare at the internet and not sleep. This happened probably 4 or 5 times in the space of 10 months, so not all the time.

Finally, fast forward to the present day, I'm 23 and have finally achieved my goal of being an outwardly 'normal' person. I am an intern at a good company and am on good terms with my family. I haven't had anything close to a depressive thought for a long time and if I do feel sad I never let it spiral any more. 

The problem is though, that I still have the same extreme apathy. All I want to do is create a very small, comfortable space to exist in and be left alone by everybody I know. I haven't switched on my phone for months and I have no desire to make friends or do anything exciting. When I get invited to social things I go but am too anxious to join in with the fun and usually go home early. At work I do the bare minimum to get by without being fired and if it were not for how it looks to the people I know, I would spend all day alone playing games and watching TV. It's like I've just accepted nothingness and I have no desire to become an interesting person.

What I'd like people's opinion on is since I don't feel sadness, should I consider myself depressive or lazy? Was I ever even depressed at all? Do you think that if I keep trying to piece things together that the missing bits of my character will come naturally?

[Clicky](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/29m7ve/magic_order_machine_is_apparently_running_low_on/cimgq9f) for LtM's story.

This was back in the Small Business Server 2003 days.  It was a terrible time, I assure you.  For those that have no experience (count your blessings), SBS is a horrifying all-in-one server that attempts to encompass Exchange, AD file &amp; print, SQL, and SharePoint on one box.  It worked as not-well as you would expect.

Anyways, law firm client (LFC) uses this for their everything.  They also have a firewall handling their spam filtering, etc, all on site.  Was not uncommon for us to get the ""hey we're not getting mail from ____@thisothercompany.com"" and a quick whitelist add would get them on their way.  The firewall would show the bounces and usually a few retries, no big deal, so I'd at least be able to see that they were in fact getting bounced by the spam filter.  Usually the other company was on some crappy server that was listed at least once on spamhaus, but their wish was our command.  So be it.

So we got a message from LFC that appeared just that simple.

&gt;LFC: We are not receiving mail from ____@crappyserver.com.  Please correct.

I kick it over to our intern as a good lesson in spam filter log checking, with instructions to check for bounced messages first, and then add the domain to the whitelist and notify the client.  About half an hour goes by, and I'm curious what's taking so long.

&gt;makenosense: Hey [intern], you having any luck with that firewall?

&gt;intern: I don't think I'm looking in the right spot, I don't see any bounces.

I look over intern's shoulder and see the all-too-familiar firewall screen.  Actually, he's in exactly the correct spot.  We spend a few minutes searching together, unable to find any bounces from crappyserver.com.  I get a third pair of eyes on it and we're all in agreement.  Time to call the client and let them know they're actually not broken!

&gt;makenosense: Good afternoon LFC.  We've been checking out this request for the difficulty you've been having with crappyserver.com email.

&gt;LFC: Thank goodness!  I hate when we have email problems.

&gt;makenosense: Well, actually, the problem is not on your end.  We've been going through all the mail and firewall logs and it seems that their mail is never even getting to any of your equipment, so it's very likely the problem is on their end.  If you'd like, you may provide my contact information to your contact at crappyserver.com and as a courtesy I don't mind helping them troubleshoot.

&gt;LFC: NO.  We can't involve them in our email problems.  Just fix it.

&gt;makenosense:........

In the end, our owner had to contact the managing partner and explain, over about a fifteen minute call, how we were literally unable to fix someone else's equipment, and the original caller was told to follow my directions to help troubleshoot.

My counterpart at crappyserver.com (another contractor, and crappyserver was another law firm) didn't need our help.  They'd had some Exchange issue on their end but apparently the attorney at crappyserver attempting to send mail to LFC didn't understand that even though it was in his Outlook Sent box, it still hadn't left the mail server queue.  Fair enough.

Furthermore, I hate Exchange.  That is all.  :)

EDIT - I should be fair.  Exchange isn't really the issue.  I just dislike the model in general of businesses attempting to host their own complex applications on their own equipment and getting upset that they require maintenance and repair that cost money, but expect 100% uptime and 0 issues.

A properly configure mail server that is being maintained and monitored regularly, and is life-cycled correctly, and isn't hosting a bunch of other applications on it, is fine with me.  Sadly, my exposure to Exchange has almost entirely been: 1.  It's been installed by somebody other than me, as cheaply as possible, which means it's also not configured properly.  2.  It's running on a 7 year old server, but ""why is it so expensive to replace?""  3.  It's running a whole bunch of other applications on it too.  And on 2Gb of RAM."
29neam,3,2014-07-02,Is there a way to make the cursor move automatically to a new cell once I scan a barcode into Excel?,barnybarn,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/29neam/is_there_a_way_to_make_the_cursor_move/,"Hey guys, I need some help.

I am in no way an expert in Excel, and I have a project to do for my internship. In this project, I need to find an easy way to keep track of weekly inspections of equipment in a manufacturing plant, mostly inspections of fire extinguishers. I've come to the conclusion that using barcodes would be the simplest way to do this. We would print out a 1D barcode for each fire extinguisher and apply them, then use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of what condition they are in and when they were last inspected. I will also print out three barcodes that have a value corresponding to the condition of the fire extinguisher: good, needs repair, and needs replacement.

Now what I need help with is how can you make it to where once a barcode for each fire extinguisher is scanned, the cursor will automatically move to the next cell to be filled. For example, I want the serial number of each scanned fire extinguisher to be in column A, the condition it is in to be in column B, and the time and date it was scanned in column C. I already know how to create a time stamp for when a certain cell is changed, so I'm good on that. What I need it to do is start in A3, and automatically move to B3 for me to scan the barcode signaling its state, and then move down to A4 for the next extinguisher. 

Is there a function I can type to make this happen, or will the inspector need to press enter/tab to get to the next cell like normal?

For reference, the inspector will be driving an electrical cart with a laptop with the spreadsheet open and a USB barcode scanner."

I've built a couple programs now at about 800 lines each, both Windows Form and console based, and am really starting to get the hang of the idea behind object oriented languages.

So this is my first time posting in this subreddit, well let me get started. I just graduated college with a degree in communication studies and almost a degree in music(I didn't pass an exam and I have to retake it and take 2 more credits for me to get the second degree). In my 6 years of college and 2 degrees I racked up quite a bill with my loans paying my rent and college expenses while attending school. 

After I graduated I recently saw my bill and I ended up 75,000 dollars. I was taken back. Granted that paid for everything, my food, rent, my classes, and my other expenses because my crappy part time job wasn't giving me enough hours to support myself. Looking at this I have no idea how Im going to pay this back. Im still working the same job I was during school, luckily they gave me a full time position, but it basically covers my rent, food, and a little pocket money for the month. 

I have been searching for jobs and I haven't been getting any calls other than insurance sales jobs. Im getting so discouraged with this whole job search, I can't start off entry level because living in florida entry level, is less than what I'm making now at my current job(and my current job I'm only making around 13 an hour with no room for advancement at all.). I don't have any connections because I completed school on my own and I couldn't afford to do an internship because I didn't want my student loans to get any higher(it finally dawned on me how much I had in the last year).

I have no idea what I'm going to do, part of me thinks I can do this and ill get through it, even though it will take close to 30 years(Ill be 53 years old paying 800 dollars a month for this loan on the minimum payment). The other part of me just wants to give up on life and just end it now because its so overwhelming. I know no one will be able to help me because I did everything on my own. My parents claimed me on their taxes which they made too much for me to get grants, but made too little to afford any college expenses on my end. I feel like Im sinking and I don't know how to get out."

29nrfj,1,2014-07-02,Need advice on moving out,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/29nrfj/need_advice_on_moving_out/,"Hey Reddit. I need some advice on moving out of my parents' house. I've been on my own before at college and I know I'm capable of taking care of myself. I need to get out because it's getting to a point where I can't stand living with them anymore. I'm 24 years old and I think I'm about ready to be independent. I also kind of have to be, because I have to be out by September 1st.

The two biggest issues keeping me from moving out are transportation and my job situation. I am currently participating in an unpaid web development internship for the summer. It's been a good experience, but I wasn't told I'd be hired on after the internship. I know I can't hope for a job, so I am starting to look for work. It could happen, but I can't count on it. I also talked to Red Hat about an enterprise support position and I'll hopefully be getting some face to face time with them soon. I haven't really started my career yet. I've only had jobs in retail and a couple months assisting with a WordPress site, so I don't have as much professional experience in my field as I would like.

I can drive, but the car I use isn't mine. If I can find a decent job, then maybe I could afford to make payments on my own vehicle, but then I would still need insurance. I haven't dealt much with insurance, since I have been covered on my parents' insurance. I don't think auto insurance is typically a benefit when you're working for a company, if you get benefits at all. I might be able to get away with not having a car depending on where I have to work, but I need to have a job before I can really determine if I can go without a car.

I'm not as worried about finding a new place to live or some roommates in a new place. I know I'm capable of that and moving, I'm worried about the other requirements that come with living on your own. I haven't moved out already because I feel like I'm stuck because I don't have the resources to live on my own. I know I'm not actually stuck, but I am unsure of how to proceed in this situation aside from looking for a job, roommates/a place to live and hoping to get lucky.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."

I just turned 24 and I have been out of school for about a year.  I completed undergrad and grad school consecutively. I was working retail for a technology company part –time the first year out of school  during my job search. During that year I was unable to find a job but,  I accepted 2  - 2month unpaid volunteer / Intern positions in my field (I am a Designer with code background). It was my goal to get a full time job in my field by the first year out of school but, I live in an oversaturated area and its been difficult for me to break into my field. So, I decided to quit my job at the 1 year out of school mark and I accepted a short-term 4-month contract as design support staff at a tech incubator out of state. The contact will be over at the end of August and I’m not sure what to do now. It seems like 2 companies will take me on as a paid intern in my hometown (Bay Area). Should I take these internship opportunities or, should I hold out for a job in my field? I am concerned that I am too old to be interning. I have had design internships since I was a freshman in undergrad and I am ready for a Jr. level role. I am afraid that if I continue to take internships / short contacts it will look bad on my resume. Any Career advice would be appreciated.

29nupt,3,2014-07-02,850 USD - Video editing build with gaming secondary.,LordSpank,buildmeapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/comments/29nupt/850_usd_video_editing_build_with_gaming_secondary/,"Hello,

Any help would be appreciated with my next computer build. Some of you might remember me posting this request some time ago. But, sadly, due to some unforeseen events, I’ve had to delay the building of that build. My final college film project sucked up my time and money until the last days of school and then some of you may have seen some pictures of hail damage in Nebraska many weeks ago. Without going too far into it, that put me behind on building my machine as I had to then pay for my car with said money. Thankfully, my old editing / gaming machine has stayed alive long enough to hold me until then.

Anyway, let’s get on with it…

At the moment, I’m a freelance videographer and editor as well as a Production Intern at a local news studio. *(I got the internship I wanted. It’s paid and I actually get to work in production).* During the first few months of summer, when the hail damage occurred, I finished my college degree and am now waiting to graduate in August. With my graduation coming soon, I’d like a computer I’d be able to use at home for editing, aside from the possible work computers at my Internship. Currently, I’m running on a cobbled-together machine that at the moment isn’t exactly cutting it in terms of what I need it to do. (I’m working from an old i3 Wal-Mart computer with a few added parts if that means anything. It has served me faithfully and hey, it was free). 

So, I’ve set out to build a new computer of my own while on a budget. Basically, what I’ll need it to do is simply be able to work with some video editing as well as gaming. Although, please keep in mind that I’m not doing anything super crazy in terms of editing. I’m not making Optimus Prime slapping a robotic T-Rex on my computer or anything like that. But, I would like to be able to work with my Sony Vegas and Premiere Pro / After Effects (as well as the rest of my CS5 programs at a much better pace than I am now).

And as for gaming, I’m really not going to be running anything super intensive, but I wouldn’t mind that option if it comes with the package. I’d like to run DayZ and Skyrim (plus a few mods) if at all possible on high+ graphics. I’m sure you know how this all goes. I’m not an FPS and Ultra graphics hunter, anything above 30 FPS at 1080p is fine with me on everything as I’ve struggled through all recent games below that mark. But in the end I’d like it to be more video editing and rendering centric over gaming. Like I said, I wouldn’t mind all the benefits if they come with the package.

Anyway, I have a budget of around 800-850 USD. *(Yes, my budget has been increased since last time).* I’d like to keep it fewer than 850 at maximum. Keeping the price lower is obviously a plus, but that’s the money I’m willing to work with.

**In summary, what I need is…**

* Video Editing / Gaming PC under 850 US Dollars.
* And in contrast from when I last posted, I will be making a trip down to a city with a Microcenter, but I’ll be ordering some parts online as well.
* Something that would be mostly upgradable later on down the line. (Examples, sounds cards, extra video cards, water-cooling for overclocking, etc). 
* In addition, I’d like a small 120 or less SSD for my OS and my Adobe / Other programs in addition to a 1TB HDD.
* I do not need any extra peripherals. I have myself a nice mouse, keyboard, monitor, tactical bacon, and speaker system already. But, if able, I’d like to add a second monitor in the future to improve workflow. I do not need the second monitor now.
* I edit videos for local customers at 720p, but would like to edit above that to 1080p if at all possible. I plan on making a few short films, so any increase in quality would be fantastic. 

**Luckily, I have some parts that I can probably use from my older system that I’d be able to transfer in an effort to keep the cost low…**

* Corsair GS600 Power Supply. (It’s not modular, but hey it works and I wasn’t bad at cable management in my older case which had no areas for it). 
* LG DVD Optical Drive(s). (Frankly, I’m not sure what kind it is. In addition, I have some external ones I can use). 
* Windows 8.1 or 7 OS. (I can get these for ~16 Dollars from my college). 

*If you can fit in a new PSU with the budget, I’d sure welcome that. I’m not sure how reliable my current one is now since it’s over two years old.*

**Other notes…**

* I could really care less how it looks. It can be the most Frankenstein looking machine you’ve ever seen, but as long as it works for what I need it to I’m ok with it. Hell, it could look like Miley Cyrus at the VMAs and I could care less. If you can somehow make it look nice, banana points to you.
* I’ve tried to do some research beforehand, and have taken a look at the AMD six and eight core CPU’s. While I’m not super well versed in the performance difference between the Intel and AMD CPUs at the moment, AMD does seem like a better option at least to me because of cost in addition to the eight-cores for video editing, encoding, and rendering. Under recommendation from a friend, the AMD FX-8350 or 8320 would perhaps be a good buy due to I’ll be definitely upgrading parts later. While I fully know the i7 would be the best thing I could get, I cannot exactly fit that into my budget.
* I plan on building this machine in two - three weeks. I of course expect parts and prices to change maybe in that time and will take everything said into consideration.
* Any help would be appreciated, and I’ll be more than happy to answer questions in the comments.
* *And if you could, would you please explain to me your part choices? While I’ve built computers before, I’d be more than willing to read and learn why exactly you picked the parts you did. In addition, it’d help me for any future builds.*

Thank you all in advance.

29o2iy,1,2014-07-02,My story (Why I'm starting NoFap),_desdinova,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/29o2iy/my_story_why_im_starting_nofap/,"(note: Halfway through writing this I realize how long it is, it's information that has been affecting my entire life and I just need to get it all out.)

I'm new to reddit in general - in fact, I'm normally a citizen of 4chan, and have been since 2005.  However, I have recently realized that I am most likely addicted to masturbation, and the affects of that addiction have nearly ruined my life.  I was an excellent student in high school and even had research I conducted during a high school internship published in a peer-reviewed journal, but something changed when I went to college. 

Now, at the time I was still a virgin and had never been in a relationship, and my sexual fantasies were not really outlandish or odd at all (which is strange, considering that I had been ritually masturbating since I was ten years old).  I was once very idealistic about love at heart, and truly desired to find the sort of 'literary' romance that only exists in books.  However, when it became clear that the fantasy was unattainable at best, I sort of gave up all hope and devolved over time into watching/reading pornography that I would have once found disgusting.  

It got to the point where I viewed everyone as a potential sex partner, and indiscriminately had casual sex with women and some men - basically, anyone who wanted to have sex with me.  Fortunately, probably due to my reticent demeanor, I did not have a large number of partners; otherwise I almost definitely would have contracted an STD due to my self-destructive lack of regard for protection or safety.  There was a time period after my first surge of sexual activity where I was terrified for months that I had contracted HIV.  Luckily, I finally accumulated the courage to acknowledge the reality of my situation and get a full test, which came up clean.

Of course, as I mentioned earlier, I did not have a large number of sexual partners, and many of the ones I did were fickle, so I began to masturbate more and more.  I normally considered myself straight and relatively vanilla in terms of fetishes, but I started to watch [shemale and femdom porn](/nsfw) and read [doujinshi about incest, futanari, and BDSM](/nsfw).  I got to the point where I would masturbate up to 10 times in a day.

Now, this was obviously quite a time investment in casual sex and pornography/masturbation.  My research internships at my university were the first areas of my life to feel the repercussions of this.  I gained a reputation (perhaps a perceived one, but a deserved one nonetheless) in my department for laziness and unreliability, and ultimately failed over my entire college career to create any research results at all.  My coursework also suffered, bringing my final college GPA to a pitiful 2.85 - awful, considering I was planning to go to graduate school to pursue a PhD concerning some combination of gene expression and marine biology.  With no fruitful research aside from my high school internship, no references, and sub-par grades, I didn't even bother applying to graduate school and went home to ferment for a year.  This, as you might expect, exacerbated the issue.

After a year of staying at home and mostly working shitty jobs or laying around playing video games and fapping, I abruptly decided to and managed to enroll in a masters program for education, planning to teach biology for several years to earn some actual money and gain experience before going to pursue my PhD.  This program started recently, and my worst fears are being realized - my fapping isn't stopping, I'm letting my coursework suffer, and now that I'm living away from home again, I'm compulsively searching for and engaging in casual sex with renewed vigor.

It is at this point that I look at myself and realize I've become a pretty awful person.  The things that I once valued - love, creativity, science, writing, nature, books... all of those are now secondary at best in my mind.  Really, I only care about sex, and not the kind of sex I'd like to have.  I've had a number of sexual partners in the double digits yet I have never even held a girl's hand or kissed a girl romantically.  Any goals in my life I once had are no longer of any importance to me, and establishing new goals is almost impossible.  I still masturbate about 6-7 times a day, spending at least 6 hours of free time either watching/reading porn or searching for/engaging in casual sex.  

There is a point where this becomes an obsession, and I clearly passed that point a long time ago.  I believe accountability to a community and to myself is the first step, so, despite my misgivings and apprehensions about reddit and non-anonymous online communities in general, here I am."
29o3wv,2,2014-07-02,First internship and they want me to come up with a solution from scratch for a non-IT team,n00b_intern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29o3wv/first_internship_and_they_want_me_to_come_up_with/,"The title is not self explanatory at all, because it's such a complex problem. So, I'm at my last year on my Bc. in Information Systems and Computer Engineering (that's the official translation to english, it's pretty much Software Engineering). 

I got myself a summer intership at a large bank and finantial services company. This is their first year doing summer internships, if that's relevant.
So, I thought I would get an internship with the IT staff, but I didn't. They put me together with a team of people whose IT knowledge consists of Microsoft Office and asked me to create ""something"" that solves their problems - I'll list said problems below. 

Now, I know that people with consulting jobs to this for a living, but I have zero work experience and absolutely no clue how to handle this situation. I'm at the firm's headquarters, across town from the IT team! I have no one there to give me the support I need, tell me which technologies the company usually works with, how I should start to look at this list of requirements... So, I need to come up with the right questions to ask these people who, though lovely enough, have no idea how to explain their problems in the best way for me to deal with them. After that, I need to come up with a solution for said problem that's easy to use. I was hoping you could help me out, give me some hints.

First, let me give you the same checkpoint they gave me. These are the things I am expected to do in the next two months:

1. Processes visual mapping - create a visual process mapping by feeding an Excel file.
2. Data model for processes cartography - Create a processes catalog.
3. Create and facilitate the reporting - Create a data model to feed automatically a powerpoint document.
4. Indicators for data analysis - Create a model to analyse a set of data according to criteria.
5. Data model for delayering - Create a quarterly report for central PMO (from Directory extraction) with automatic indicators.
6. Data model for contracts maintenance - Create a database to issue contracts for the locations and other entities.
7. Data model for invoicing - Create a database to calculate the cost and detailed description of the cost according to to the operating model.

I would subdivide this into four ""categories"": 1+2, 3+4+5, 6 and 7, based on their rough explanation on the first day (tomorrow will be the second). Now I need to figure out exactly what do they want, and for that I need to ask questions, so... what questions should I ask in order for a ""client"" with no IT knowledge to give me the information I need, regarding those points?

From what they said, they work mainly with MS Excel. Their processes list is exactly that: An Excel spreadsheet with two columns, one for the process name/ID and other with its description. They also have some calculations that they need to do, with Excel formulas, and they want to me to automate that (via macro, I guess). So, this will be mostly extracting data from Excel files and treating that data. Also adding, modifying and removing stuff from those files. 

Those points are so abstract that I don't even know if doing this will require programming at all. I don't know if I should get rid of their Excel files and just build a program that interacts with some SQL databases, or if there's a way to do this using only Microsoft Office tools, such as Access or something like that - they kept mentioning Access.

So, mainly, I'm asking for guidance regarding what questions I should ask tomorrow in order to be able to start designing a solution and, from that vague list, what tools do you think I'll need to use. Do you think I'll even write a line of code or will I just take advantage of tools already available?

If this isn't the right sub to ask this question in, please indicate the ones you feel would be able to give me some guidelines. 

Also, I'm using a throwaway as a way of keeping my professional problems and my leisure separated. Thank you very much in advance."
29o5g1,23,2014-07-02,America The Beautiful,contemplative-lawyer,asheville,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/29o5g1/america_the_beautiful/,"I was outside Buncombe County Courtroom 2B today. If you are not a lawyer, or maybe even if you are, your life is not headed in a pleasant direction when you find yourself standing around the criminal courtroom.

For me, the painful turn came in the form of a little girl. She was also outside the courtroom, and she was just the most beautiful little girl you have ever seen, about 4 years old. She was singing a little song she was making up on the spot, grinning a perfect grin. She was 100% the picture of innocence and joy we make children out to be.

And then, there was her mom. I don't know whether she was victim, defendant or ""support,"" but I guarantee she was not there as a legal intern. She was scowling, lips pursed angrily. I could almost literally see the stormy dark clouds hanging over her brow. She was the very dark anti-pole to her vibrant daughter.

Next, I had a horrific glimpse into the future. I saw mom's darkness and pain extinguish her daughter's light. I gave the little girl, and her mom, the warmest, most compassionate smile I could muster, but I had to walk away and find a vacant corner of the courthouse. Had you been in the stairwell then, you would have seen a fat, middle-aged lawyer bawling. It's caught me more than once again today.

Sadder still, I saw into the past. 20 years ago, that mom was just like her little girl. 20 years from now, today's little girl will have one of her own.

I am not a blubbery kind of guy. For crissakes, part of my practice is defending very guilty criminals. But I can't visit the memory, can't write this post, without crying. The scene, the loss of light in the world, truly broke my heart.


Now, I could be misjudging the circumstance. But I am probably not, and even if I am misjudging this family, I have personally seen, with clarion relief, this narrative played out multiple times. This is just the one that evaded all my defenses. And as painful as it is to witness this reality, I am grateful to find that my heart has not become fully encrusted with cynicism.

Somehow, this reality has to change. Despite having a full opinion of myself and my ideas about how to fix things, I have no idea what to do. But hear this, Reddit, and through Reddit, the world: I am committing today to affect some change, any change, on this state of affairs. My world will be dimmer when that little girl's light goes out. I don't want that to ever happen again.

29obv0,3,2014-07-02,First internship and they want me to come up with a solution from scratch for a non-IT team (X-Post from /r/cscareerquestions),n00b_intern,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/29obv0/first_internship_and_they_want_me_to_come_up_with/,"The title is not self explanatory at all, because it's such a complex problem. So, I'm at my last year on my Bc. in Information Systems and Computer Engineering (that's the official translation to english, it's pretty much Software Engineering).

I got myself a summer intership at a large bank and finantial services company. This is their first year doing summer internships, if that's relevant. So, I thought I would get an internship with the IT staff, but I didn't. They put me together with a team of people whose IT knowledge consists of Microsoft Office and asked me to create ""something"" that solves their problems - I'll list said problems below.

Now, I know that people with consulting jobs to this for a living, but I have zero work experience and absolutely no clue how to handle this situation. I'm at the firm's headquarters, across town from the IT team! I have no one there to give me the support I need, tell me which technologies the company usually works with, how I should start to look at this list of requirements... So, I need to come up with the right questions to ask these people who, though lovely enough, have no idea how to explain their problems in the best way for me to deal with them. After that, I need to come up with a solution for said problem that's easy to use. I was hoping you could help me out, give me some hints.

First, let me give you the same checkpoint they gave me. These are the things I am expected to do in the next two months:

1. Processes visual mapping - create a visual process mapping by feeding an Excel file.
2. Data model for processes cartography - Create a processes catalog.
3. Create and facilitate the reporting - Create a data model to feed automatically a powerpoint document.
4. Indicators for data analysis - Create a model to analyse a set of data according to criteria.
5. Data model for delayering - Create a quarterly report for central PMO (from Directory extraction) with automatic indicators.
6. Data model for contracts maintenance - Create a database to issue contracts for the locations and other entities.
7. Data model for invoicing - Create a database to calculate the cost and detailed description of the cost according to to the operating model.

I would subdivide this into four ""categories"": 1+2, 3+4+5, 6 and 7, based on their rough explanation on the first day (tomorrow will be the second). Now I need to figure out exactly what do they want, and for that I need to ask questions, so... what questions should I ask in order for a ""client"" with no IT knowledge to give me the information I need, regarding those points?

From what they said, they work mainly with MS Excel. Their processes list is exactly that: An Excel spreadsheet with two columns, one for the process name/ID and other with its description. They also have some calculations that they need to do, with Excel formulas, and they want to me to automate that (via macro, I guess). So, this will be mostly extracting data from Excel files and treating that data. Also adding, modifying and removing stuff from those files.

Those points are so abstract that I don't even know if doing this will require programming at all. I don't know if I should get rid of their Excel files and just build a program that interacts with some SQL databases, or if there's a way to do this using only Microsoft Office tools, such as Access or something like that - they kept mentioning Access.

So, mainly, I'm asking for guidance regarding what questions I should ask tomorrow in order to be able to start designing a solution and, from that vague list, what tools do you think I'll need to use. Do you think I'll even write a line of code or will I just take advantage of tools already available?

If this isn't the right sub to ask this question in, please indicate the ones you feel would be able to give me some guidelines.

Also, I'm using a throwaway as a way of keeping my professional problems and my leisure separated. Thank you very much in advance.

29olg2,0,2014-07-02,I think my friend placed a curse on me,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29olg2/i_think_my_friend_placed_a_curse_on_me/,"I have this friend who has been my childhood friend for years, Kylie. She has been my friend through thick and thin and now things have really escalated...

This started about a year ago. It all started that night where we had this road trip with a bunch of friends of ours. Zack and I had just got into a relationship about 6 months before and we decided to have a nice road trip with some of our friends on an island near our city. With some connections I managed to get a whole floor for my friends and I. 

Everything was going well until the night came and Zack got drunk, which wasn't unusual. But for some reason, I had this sudden burst of anger. This sudden burst of emotions that caused me to cry and yell at him. It was our special night. We haven't had sex since he was constantly working and I was doing an intern-ship in a law firm. This was going to be the night we did 'it' and now he's lying sprawled out on the bed, drunk. It was supposed to be romantic. 

I came back down to talk to my friends, and my bestie, Kylie stared at me and asked me what's wrong. I don't know why but it self insincere but I just told them what happened. My other friend Sharon told me she has to go back to the room soon. It was 4am and even HER boyfriend is fast asleep. She told me she'd walk me back since our rooms were connected and side-by-side. She managed to stop my tears and suddenly I was alright. However the moment I entered the room, my anger began to raise again. 

Zack finally woke up, still a little drunk, but all i can remember from that night was that I was yelling and screaming at him. And next thing I knew, I was awake beside Zack as the sun laid on his face. I woke him up for breakfast and asked him to tell me what had happened the night before, but he just told me I had a psychotic breakdown and a few of my friends saw. He wouldn't say anything more.

I managed to get a hold of Sharon. She woke up even later than all of us and she had a tired look on her face. I told her I remember nothing and asked her to explain. She stared at me wide-eyed and started. 

Apparently, after she sent me back, she also had a discussion with her boyfriend and that had a small fight, but I had banged on her door screaming and her boyfriend, Ders opened the door. She told me I ran to the door connecting to her room and started yelling,

""ZACK IS DEAD. ZACK IS DEAD""


Non-stop. I couldn't remember anything... 

She then told me that after that I ran out, threw my bag against the wall, everything fell out of my bag and my phone's battery even fell out, and started crying on the carpeted floor. A few of my friends from the floor who were still awake walked out, but Sharon was there to hold me up and kept asking what happened. I cried continuously, according to them, and even fainted for a few minutes. They managed to check my pulse and my eyes were dilated. I woke up after that hugging and crying my knees still thinking Zack was dead. 

The weirdest part was when she told me Zack came out of the elevator, looked at her, and walked into the hotel room. Sharon asked Ders to check on Zack to find out what's going on but Zack just told Ders he doesn't know what to do and apparently during our fight, I ran out the hotel and had thrown my keys on the road. 

Firstly, Zack would've never left me there crying about his 'death', and I would have remembered that I walked out of a building, into the middle of traffic, throwing the hotel keys. 

Sharon looked extremely tired and took a long drag of her cigarette. I apologized to her, told her I didn't remember anything. She told me she wasn't done.

After the whole thing, Zack managed to sit beside me and tell me he's alive. I didn't believe it at first, but he managed to convince me and bring me back to the room. After that, Sharon said she heard more yelling and choking in the bathroom. A lot of banging and yelling and suddenly, I screamed in high pitched and said that Zack has fallen. I stared into Sharon's eyes, wondering if these were all lies.

She looked calm and exhausted, as if telling the story was just as stressful as the night before. 

She said the doors connecting us unlocked and they ran in (Ders and her). They found Zack on the floor. He's conscious but his eyes were darting left and right. Sharon said her hands started to freeze and she was so scared, her teeth were literally chattering that night. No one would offer her and Ders an explanation. Zack even told them it's fine and all he needs to do is calm down. Sharon and Ders left after, and she told me yet there was a weirder part.

She heard the both of us giggling after that, having sex as loud as anything. 

I have never in my entire life lost memory of an entire 3 hours of crazy events. I can't believe that after all that, we would even be having sex. What was Zack and I thinking? I apologized again and again to her. Weirdly enough, Kylie was staring at us from afar with the creepiest look on her face.

Now why I found this weird was because after that event, Kylie has been getting pretty odd and my mental state has become even worse. I just started on lithium a week ago, so I'm trying to track back as much as I can from memory and help from Sharon. I feel really tired and explain to you how weird Kylie got after the trip, what happened, and what has led me to take lithium.

But things aren't changing and I need sleep.

I still see her. 

------

Sharon here, writing this for Renee. She was pretty tired after re-living that night from a year ago. Hell, I'm pretty tired too. I had to explain to her again what happened, and at the same time write it. She wants to chronicle this before her mental state worsens. She told me if she ever loses her memory again, at least these posts will help her remember. I told her about /r/nosleep and I told her every time she told me the story, she'd give me shivers. So I figured to give you guys a few shivers of her. This is just the beginning. Trust me when I say it gets worse. I'll have to talk to her again to recall what happened the following months. I think it was something to do with her house party. But I'll get back to you guys on that soon.

Oh and just to add. Ders, me, Renee and Zack weren't the only one having a lover's spat. There was another couple that we heard a few months from then that they had fought the same night too. Part that makes me believe Renee more was the fact that Kylie had been distant with all of us, only talking to us if we were separated from our partners. And when we were together, she would just give us this creepy/angry stare that freaked all six of us out..."

At the onset of our relationship, we were teenage stoners who were simply excited at the idea of living in dorms.  

As time progressed, we started making our own money and establishing adult lives.  My friends all began taking vacations with their boyfriends--some to the beach and some overseas.  My boyfriend, while not a pot smoking kid anymore, just wants to sit around doing nothing.  We've fought numerous times because he refuses to take a day trip to the beach (1.5 hours away, I even offered to drive), won't hang out in the kitchen while I cook dinner, has only grabbed a drink with my friends once (and held it against me for months saying it was enough going out as a couple), and even refused to come to my birthday party (some of his friends were there).

He has only stayed at my place a couple times, I always have to come to his apartment...he justifies it by saying he likes to eat snacks late at night and I don't keep enough food around.

We're still together but I moved a couple states away for the summer for an internship.  I was supposed to come visit in July (even booked a flight) until he called me and told me he was going to the world cup with his friends.  

I asked him if he would ever come visit me here where I'm staying and he told me it would never happen.

I am at a total loss.  We have a really good time together, incredible chemistry, and a strong bond but I am afraid if I continue this relationship that we will never leave his apartment.  

**tl;dr** my boyfriend refuses to do anything with me but sit around and watch tv

I am extremely sorry for the long post, but I need so much advice.

I am a rising senior in high school thinking about what colleges I would be interested in applying to. I didn't really know much about RIT, but I received a scholarship called the ""RIT Computing Medal and Scholarship Award"" from my school at the end of my junior year. I'm not trying to brag or anything, but I really don't know much about it except it gives me money and waives my application fee. If anyone else received that award and could tell me anything else about it or your experiences that would be great.

So, here are my questions:

1. While I am mainly interested in a Computer Science degree, I still would like to take classes in many other subjects since I am interested in a bunch of different subjects. I have not heard of RIT outside of its CS program, so how would you rate the classes in softer subjects like economics, psychology, etc.?

2. The co-op program seems great, but I always thought it would be better for a CS major to take classes during the school year and intern during the summer. I remember seeing (though, now I can't find it) that a couple of co-ops took place during the year and it means students couldn't graduate in 4 years. For someone who would prefer to graduate in 4 years, is there any way to accomplish this? Would you not suggest it?

3. While I know I can't be completely sure right now, I think I may be interested in going to grad school, for at least a MS in CS. How are the undergraduate research opportunities at RIT? Does not graduating in four years hurt the prospect of going to grad school?

4. Overall review of the CS program and RIT in general? Don't answer this if you don't want to, as I know it has been talked about in similar past threads.

Thanks. I hope I didn't ask anything that was answered in another thread."

Can anyone review this as it obviously needs polishing, and can you explain to me the changes you did and why?


The test prompt:

&gt;You are serving an internship with the traffic court in the city where you live.  The clerks in the traffic court office want a simple application that will allow them to enter the offender's name, the actual speed limit, the speed at which the offender was travelling, and how many previous violations they have received.  The application should calculate charges and display how many miles over the speed limit the offender was travelling, the cost of the speeding ticket, and the court costs.  The program should calculate a charge of $20 per each mile per hour over the speed limit, and court costs beginning at $74.80 per each offense. The output should be the offender's name, their speed, and the cost of the ticket. 

My code:

    package moneymaker;

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Moneymaker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
                double RECORD_VIOLATION = 2;
                double SPEED_LIMIT = 25;
                double COURT_COST = (74.80);
                
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    System.out.print(""Offenders First Name: "");
	String firstname  = input.next( );
        
    System.out.print(""Offenders Last Name: "");
	String lastname  = input.next( );
        
    System.out.print(""Speed limit in Zone: "" + SPEED_LIMIT );
    System.out.println(""mph"");
        
    System.out.println(""Enter speed of offender in MPH: "");
	float offenderSpeed = input.nextFloat();
        
    double overMPH = (offenderSpeed - SPEED_LIMIT);
    double totalCost = (overMPH * 20 + COURT_COST);
    double totalCostFees = (totalCost * RECORD_VIOLATION);

    System.out.print( firstname + "" "" + lastname );
    System.out.print("", was driving: "");
    System.out.print( + offenderSpeed );
    System.out.print( ""mph"" );
    System.out.print("", that's "");
    System.out.print( + overMPH );
    System.out.println( ""mph over the speed limit."" );
    System.out.println( RECORD_VIOLATION + "" violations inluded in fees."" );
    System.out.println(""Total Cost: $"" + totalCostFees + "" USD"");
       }
     }
Output

&gt;Offenders First Name: George

&gt;Offenders Last Name: Bush

&gt;Speed limit in Zone: 25.0mph

&gt;Enter speed of offender in MPH: 

&gt;30

&gt;George Bush, was driving: 30.0mph, that's 5.0mph over the speed limit.

&gt;2.0 violations inluded in fees.

&gt;Cost: $349.6 USD

She's an ""intern"" at a Marriage and Family Therapy practice earning her hours.

Kickers: She's been at the practice for less than a year, they got ""formally"" married in August, and this boss of hers has been giving her weed and benzos under the table. On top of that the one sexual encounter she admitted to they were doing coke together. She's demanding that she stay at the practice, and has ""made the sacrifice"" of self-reporting her work schedule to her husband, and promising she'll have no contact with him. It was basically going to be swept under the rug. Fat chance considering he's responsible for mentoring her and counting her hours towards licensure. The husband is going along with it, which to me shows a lack of self-respect. The most minimum thing to expect is for her to change jobs. Not stay there with the guy she's having an affair with and doing drugs with.

I've never experienced anything like this in my life. I'm a pretty lenient guy with my own vices, but this was way too much for me. I told her we're no longer friends, and reported her and her boss to the state Board of Psychology. The patients deserve so much better than these scummy assholes.

Edit: Added some much needed clarification."
29ow4f,6,2014-07-02,[Help] My therapist doesn't seem in it for the long haul,andlife,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/29ow4f/help_my_therapist_doesnt_seem_in_it_for_the_long/,"So I started seeing a therapist two months ago. It was a really big step for me, because I've been showing symptoms of anxiety since at least seventh grade, and every major transition period in my life has led to months of depression. Sure enough, I was diagnosed with GAD.

I'm not fully financially set up for it, but my parents have agreed to pay, and are using their insurance as support. I graduated with a degree in psychology last year, and I have come to feel that while pills can be effective, I would rather try my hand at therapy first, because I've heard it can work, and I'm a little spooked by the potential side effects of drugs.

I had a session today, and my therapist and I had been working through some issues surrounding sleeping alone and some health anxiety. Lately though, we've shifted focus to talking about other anxieties in my life, including my new internship. I've actually gotten better at sleeping alone, and I'm in a spell where my health anxiety is actually not too bad. At the end of the session, after we had finished talking about how I was having difficulty being assertive in meetings, because I get overwhelmingly anxious and afraid to speak up, my therapist pointed out that we hadn't talked so much about my other stuff. I said that I seemed to be doing better in those areas, at least for the time being. 

Then my therapist said something I wasn't expecting. She said that that was really good, and that I should go home and think about whether we needed to continue the therapy sessions, as I'd achieved some of the goals I'd come to therapy with (I guess by that she meant not being anxious about sleeping alone, or about my health). She said, your goals might have transitioned, so consider if we should continue these sessions or not.

Here's why I'm shocked (and more than a little upset). I didn't enter therapy just to help me sleep alone better, or to feel better about my health (and I know these anxieties will probably return, especially since I'm anticipating a move). I entered therapy to learn and develop coping strategies and learn to manage and overcome my GAD. There are still several other aspects of my life that are overwhelmed by anxiety. I can't ride in cars without freaking out. I have very low self-esteem and can't feel relaxed at alll around people I don't know. My internship seems to be showing me that any future jobs I have are going to present a lot of anxiety. We spent a lot of time talking about strategies I could use to sleep alone, but I don't feel like I've been given the strategies to handle the anxiety of every day life. My therapist wasn't saying we *had* to stop sessions, and she suggested we could redirect to other goals. But I was shocked and little upset that she thought because I could sleep alone OK that I was ""meeting my goals,"" and would consider stopping therapy.

Has anyone else gone through therapy? Is this a normal way to approach anxiety? The worst part of being anxious and not assertive is that I don't even know how I would tell her that I was shocked. Should I consider stopping therapy for a while or seeking out a different therapist (this seems like it would be a big undertaking, since my therapist spent so many sessions getting to understand my fears, but at the same time, it feels like she was too focused on one issue)? What do y'all think?"

So, the client I'm working with had a website using GoDaddy's Web Builder. They did not like it and requested that I switch the website over to WordPress. 

In order to do this I would have had to wait a few hours in order to begin working on the site in WordPress (because I was switching the platform from one thing to another on the same domain/URL address). I wanted to get working on it right away so instead of waiting, I set up the WordPress account (through GoDaddy because that is what the client wanted) using a temporary domain. 

This is when the issues began. For some reason I couldn't switch the domain name from the temporary one to the old one we had been using with GoDaddy's Web Builder. Every time I tried I would get a 'Site Not Found' error and was unable to work on the website in WordPress. 

It wasn't until I used the whois search (I apologize if that's the incorrect way to say it) I found out that the domain was not registered with GoDaddy but with someone that no one I worked with knew. Long story short, I was finally to contact the guy and got him to direct that domain's IP address to the temporary domain's because I needed a quick fix due to the time sensitive issue. (So www.correcturl.com technically contains nothing and points to www.temporarydomain.com which has everything I need.)

I know that this was not the best/correct solution but with the problem being completely out of my realm of understanding and being pressured to get the website up ASAP, it's what I did.

**I want to know how or even if I can switch the temporary WordPress domain over to the actual company URL rather than have one direct traffic to the other.**"

I am not here to start shit. I am here to clarify few things about women's rights. Particularly those that are seen as ""radicals"" in society and those who are actually concerned about womens rights (and overall gender equality).

I come from a fairly neutral standpoint but I feel that women's rights organizations are obscuredly portrayed incorrectly in society, particularly in Reddit. It is frustrating because most women's rights organizations are legit and I don't know where or how they found these radical ones that are obviously borderline insane.

Just a little background of myself. I joined as an for a women's rights organization because I wanted to learn more about it. Truthfully, I am interested in human trafficking in my country and majority of human trafficking here are for sexual exploitation. Of course, globally there are men who are victims under this category but I have been to field and 99% of victims are women here. So, even though this is a human rights issue, this is also a women's rights issue in my country and so I decided that I needed to learn more about women's rights. Now I work for an non-gender international organization that counters human trafficking.

When I was an intern in this women's rights organization, things were a lot different from how they were portrayed in society. I have never met a single woman who was a misandrist. 90% of women working here were married and they had an extremely happy married life. 

When the organization felt that certain policy was sexist towards men, for example, women's only library. We actually submitted a complaint to the government stood side by side with men's right movement stating that reading is a universal right.

I am aware that there are some radicals. There will always be. But is like judging Islam based extremists and I think this is unfair.

I am here to answer any questions about women's rights from a man's perspective. So please write away!

However, please be respectful as I am here to clarify and answers questions about women's rights and did not post this to start shit.

Thanks"

I remember when it was different, though.  14 years ago I entered the tech industry in a very male-dominated field and endured being groped, ""teased,"" and endless sexual comments because I was terrified that if I spoke up and reported it I would be labeled a trouble maker and it would damage my career. 

There is a young woman who started at my company as an intern.  I have been mentoring her in my field.  She has grown to love it so much she changed majors and has made enormous progress.  I am immensely proud of her and her accomplishments. 

She is a single mom.  She's pretty, has large breasts, and is cripplingly shy.  I have spent a lot of time working with her to get her to express her ideas in meetings, or even speak when there are other people in the room.

For some reason, the men at the office seem to think her passivity is some sort of invitation and never pass up an opportunity to comment on her hair, clothes, body, and quietness.  Today she wore a dress and man made a big deal about her being ""all dressed up"" and kept wanting to take her around to show the other men what she was wearing.  It's not even like she was dressed seductively. It was a maxi dress that covered her arms and legs to the ankle.  I could see the look of absolute horror on her face at the thought of being paraded around so I stepped in and told him she was busy. 

We share and office and men come sniffing around all the time to try and ask her out.  I am hidden from view behind a huge monitor and men will come by to talk to her when they don't think I'm there, asking her all kinds of personal questions and I jump in with a firm ""Can I help you?"" to get them to leave.

This week yet another male coworker expressed interest in her who is old enough to be her father and THEN some. As soon as he left the room she put on a sweater and pulled it around her as tightly as possible even though it was SWELTERING in our office. 

I have asked her many times how she feels about the attention and she has admitted that she HATES it.  She gets angry with herself because she can't make herself stand up to them and tell them to leave her alone.  When they start circling her she smiles, ducks her head, and slinks away as quickly as she can, and then is upset because she wasn't more assertive. 

I have considered encouraging her to go to HR, but I am not even sure WHO she would report when there are SO MANY offenders.  I don't even think the men realize how uncomfortable she is because she smiles when she gets nervous. 

I would love to help her, but I'm not even sure how.  

Thoughts?

29pc2u,0,2014-07-02,How competitive am I currently for getting a job before graduation?,[deleted],ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/29pc2u/how_competitive_am_i_currently_for_getting_a_job/,"I'm a junior at a big state school studying ChemE(ranked 80ish) right now, with a 3.15 GPA. Here's a basic outline of work experience so far.

**Freshman summer:** Internship at a big specialty chemical company (Fortune 100), doing research. Mostly testing samples and writing reports. 

**Sophomore summer-Junior year** Undergraduate research, doing materials/mechanical testing

**This summer:** Internship at a small-mid-sized plant, about 50 employees, doing (mostly) grunt work. (junior summer) Although I've learned almost nothing technical other than how to run samples, I do feel like I've gained a lot of industrial experience and have learned a lot about day-to-day plant operations. Things like piping, flanges, hoses, various meters, PLC systems, heat exchangers, reactors, distillation columns, etc. 

Skills section includes programming (Java/Python/C), Excel, Chemcad, a long list of scientific instruments and devices I have experience with, forklift/ backhoe/manlift operation experience.

How competitive do you think I am for a decent job after graduation right now? Should I apply for some school-year internships, and delay graduation by a semester or two? I'm looking to get into the upstream oil industry as a field engineer; if that doesn't happen, then a process engineer at a plant.

29pd10,14,2014-07-02,The show Grey's Anatomy takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,ogwalt,FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/29pd10/the_show_greys_anatomy_takes_place_in_the_marvel/,"Grey’s Anatomy takes place the Marvel Cinematic Universe created by such films as Iron Man, Captain America, and the Avengers.

Thought of this while watching one of my wife's favorite shows, Grey's Anatomy. The show centers around a group of medical interns as they begin their training at a Seattle-based hospital, and follows them for a number of years. In that time they grow, change, experience traumas and overcome struggles, and ultimately take different paths through their lives and their professions. My theory is that this show takes place in a small corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
I have several reasons for this, some based on general thoughts about the series, some based on specific similarities, and some based upon real-world connections between the show and the MCU.

First, the show generally shows slightly larger-than-life characters overcoming almost supernaturally long odds. In the course of the show the team has faced mass shootings,[ a ferry crash](http://i.imgur.com/IbLeaau.jpg), [a plane crash](http://i.imgur.com/rOl20ub.jpg) (which members of the team were onboard for, and survived), massive storms, terrorist attacks, [unexpected traumas](http://i.imgur.com/6T9OQJl.jpg), and an array of other trials, all without leaving their own besieged city. While this is in part because the show is a primetime drama which continually aims to shock viewers by escalating events, the regularity with which these events occur seems extreme, to the point that characters in the show even comment on the frequency of disasters (their hospital, Seattle Grace/Mercy West quickly earns the nickname ""Mercy Death""). In a world of extremes like the MCU, catastrophes happen everyday – it is up to extraordinary characters to heroically overcome these odds and save lives. In this way, thematically, the show and the MCU are similar. In addition, Grey's Anatomy frequently showcases advancing technology – from drug trials to experimental vaccines to radical procedures and synthetic compounds – that might match up with the technologically advanced world of the MCU. This leads to a more specific similarity seen in episode 22 of the most recent season (""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"").

In this episode, Cristina Yang, a heart surgeon, is invited to a cutting-edge hospital in Zurich, which she soon realizes is run by a former dalliance of hers, Burke (who left her at the altar, but let's not get too soap-opera with this). Yang thinks that Burke is trying to offer her a job in order to lure her back romantically, only to discover that he does not want to employ her, but to retire and place her in charge of his hospital. The way this plays out, and the hospital itself, is remarkable similar to scenes and elements from Iron Man 2. First, in the hospital Burke shows off a [3D holographic modeling software](http://i.imgur.com/01T8kvF.jpg) program that maps the [human heart in real-time](http://i.imgur.com/YYIfl3f.jpg). This technology amazes Yang, and is very much like the program [Tony Stark uses in his workshop](http://i.imgur.com/FuxjyT7.jpg), right down to the [manipulable model](http://i.imgur.com/z39s5Zr.jpg). We are still a few years away from this technology in the real-world, but it has become relatively commonplace in the MCU, and real-time monitoring of critical organs even shows up in Iron Man 3 as well, in the form of a [brain mapping software](http://i.imgur.com/OleYNEA.jpg) developed by AIM. In addition to the similar technology in this episode, the conversation about Yang's job offer is extremely close, almost down to the dialog itself, to Tony's offering of a CEO position to Pepper Potts. In both cases, the party offering the job (Tony/Burke) [struggles to find the right words to say](http://i.imgur.com/gddnnKM.jpg), or even to [broach the subject](http://i.imgur.com/4iwjF72.jpg). The other party (Yang/Pepper) reacts indignantly, and misunderstands the other’s attempt as inconsiderate or inappropriate. Finally, in both cases the job offer is outright stated in an [exasperated burst](http://i.imgur.com/3d3X9Bd.jpg): Tony says “You don’t understand. I’m trying to make you CEO!;” Burke’s line is “I’m not trying to hire you to work for me, I’m trying to hire you to replace me.” In both scenes this leaves the other party [shocked](http://i.imgur.com/lQOc42c.jpg). Only later do they begin to feel some [sense of excitement](http://i.imgur.com/9QA84c0.jpg) or responsibility at the prospect of their new position.

The final piece of evidence that Grey’s could take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn’t come from the show itself, but from a real-world connection. Grey’s Anatomy is owned and broadcast by the American Broadcasting Network, or ABC. ABC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company, which just recently acquired Marvel Studios, so both the Grey’s Anatomy show and the MCU are owned by parent company Disney. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Disney 

Does this theory change anything about either the show or the MCU as a whole? Not necessarily. It might make the more extreme events of the show more explainable in a world constantly on the brink of cataclysm, but otherwise it is just an interesting connection. Will these two ever crossover or acknowledge these similarities in any way? Doubtful. But can you imagine how cool of a show a drama about a medical team responding to events like the Battle of New York could be?

TL;DR: More like Jean Grey's Anatomy."

I'm turning 35 this year and just noticing how rapidly time is flying by. It's like life is in fast forward, but not in a good way.

I've been doing a combo of work and internship which is about 55 hours a week. I think that's what is burning me out the most, since I used to do 40 hours. I leave for work at 730, work until 6, get home at 645 or so. My work is counseling and related administrative aspects so it can be pretty draining.

I find myself missing the days when I was younger and could just lounge around playing video games. I try to now, and end up wasting a Saturday playing games and then regret not organizing my files and doing laundry, or finishing some diy thing in my house.

I find myself getting miserly with my time. Like my wife wants to hang out with friends and I kinda resent it, because I want to spend my time relaxing and unplugging from stuff. It's cool when I do hang out, but even then - next thing I know it's Sunday night, I have a paper due, and work tomorrow.

4th of July is coming and I just dread that the day off will build up my workload. 

I dunno, this has just been grinding though my mind so I figured I'd dump it here."

And so far I'm highly unsatisfied.

The manager seems to be very busy with other things and hasn't given much thought to my intern project. Most of the time I'm working on some really easy task or just sitting around with nothing to do. I pretty much see him once a week. Their code base is also pretty damn messy, with the majority of it in Perl/CGI along with the some Java, C++, Ruby, etc. They insist on continuing using Perl/CGI just because that's what's already there. I am willing to learn Perl, but I kinda wish I was learning some language that would be more marketable on my resume. I also don't really respect the other software developers as engineers due to the asinine suggestions and bad design decisions they make during meetings. It's as if they were shipped in a time machine from 2004. However, I have to say that they are all really nice people and I do enjoy them as friends. The pay is average, but most of it goes towards the apartment that I had to find and rent on my own.


To summarize, I'm feeling that I'm just wasting my time and not learning much. This is my first internship, so I don't know much. Is software development always like this? What should I do?"

Would it be a stupid decision to drop out of college to pursue actual job experience over a degree?

I loved the web design and video portions of the academy. I could always come up with some creative things to do on camera and then edit them well. Web design came easily to me, I'd always be doing things a couple chapters ahead of the rest of the class because I found it fun. 

I also have a huge passion for gaming. Not sure if this could ever lead me anywhere. I play a lot of the same games, really. Just a bunch of Fallout 3 and New Vegas (RPGs/Shooters), and I absolutely relish in the lore of it all, knowing an abundance and even writing out my own situations using it whenever I have free time. Fan fictions and such.

Now I'm preparing to attend Eastern Kentucky University and major in Computer Information Systems. Beyond that, I have no clue where to go.

I'm only a Freshman with moderate familiarity with C++, some python, and I'm currently learning the QT framework. I feel like this does not qualify me at all. However I do have a lot of self-drive to learn and improve my skills. I try to practice at least one hour a day (sometimes more), and I often find myself reading at certain times throughout the day.

But on the other hand, I know most people consider internships as learning experiences (as they are), but I'm not sure that employers will feel the same way. I couldn't imagine the feeling of not being able to do something while I was interning at some company. Of course I would try my hardest to learn and fulfill requests, but it scares me.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can feel ready to take on an internship? If not, what should I learn to prepare myself by next summer?"

29pt5g,4,2014-07-03,I'm coming down on adderall and I want to bitch about who I am because I can't really do anything better at this point,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/29pt5g/im_coming_down_on_adderall_and_i_want_to_bitch/,"I was really cool and had a lot of good friends in high school. I am saying this not to brag, but to give you an idea of what has happened with me. I got into a decent, tier III college by the skin of my teeth. I was commuting from home and after only a semester I decided ""fuck this"" and I transferred to a less academically inclined college south of where I live. I made 0 friends and just hung out with my friend from high school, who also made no friends and also his mother passed away his freshman year. After two years of not really getting much accomplished, bipolar depression, lowering the bar for myself and ruining relationships that I had made (net gain of 0 new friends), I moved back in with my parents to commute to and from the very school I eschewed.

I made a best friend for two years while I was there. Before I left, I fell into a depression, claimed I ""loved her,"" made my relationship with her into a Red Pill nightmare, and then lost her. I might be too hard on myself right now, but I also forgive myself for it because as a result she is in a happy relationship with this guy who I had a problem with because he hurled racial slurs at me my first week at school but also has problems of his own... Whatever. I take the blame for my relationship with her not working out and if she is happy with him, then it is the best case scenario.

My college was extended by two years. I am now a socially crippled loser who is too emotionally damaged to even make a new friend at this point. All attempts at friend-making fail because I am weird and I try too hard, and also no one really seems to want to make new friends in their college classes. My old high school friends have all gone their own ways and many of them lead great lives i.e. do not live with their parents. I have maybe 2 or 3 real friends to my name, and they don't even live near me. I responsibly do drugs sometimes but that's about it. The only thing great I can say about myself is that I got laid a handful of times when I lived down south and I am right now working my ass off taking summer classes, working as needed, and doing an internship to make up for lost time drinking beer and trying to get laid.

I'm not going to get into what I believe to be the root cause of ADD/ADHD as I am not adequately learned on the subject to give an answer, but I have pretty much accepted that my aptitude may not strongly lie in academia. I am studying neuroscience and I want to go to grad school for neuropsychopharmacology/pharmacy school for Pharm.D, but I'd probably rather be something else, like be the lead singer for Pavement in 1996. I am doing pharmacy to make money and pharmacology for interest. If I did not have adderall, I would drop out of college. I can only do school because of adderall, yet it makes me miserable.

I am wildly emotionally stunted and I can't have a normal relationship with a normal person. In fact, I only have weird relationships with weird people, which is cool sometimes. 

I grew up as a first-generation only child in a violently abusive household, and I grew up with my father who has a mental disorder. He would mistreat both me and my mom, and my mom would mistreat me, since I was at the bottom of the ""family hierarchy"" or some shit. Last summer, my mom came to terms with her abuse and we ""found each other"" or some gay shit like that and pretty much all progress I've made over the past few years without my parents kind of collapsed or something. Lots of messy shit, policemen walking around in my kitchen and whatever. 

Recently, my dad said some scary shit to my family doctor, who gave my mom some antidepressants to put in his diabetes bag. He has been a huge burden and although I know this is ethically questionable, he was making our lives living hell, and could not even justify it by claiming that he was ""bringing in the money"" or something, because he is a leech in every single sense of the word, unfit to be a father but also he is a human being who has suffered and the best thing I could do is forgive him and move on. Now he takes it without even knowing it. It works well, it's like he's gone.

Also I might be chemically imbalanced. I used to physically harm myself but since doing shrooms and mdma in controlled environments with the express intent to psychotherapeutically rehabilitate myself, I do so no longer.

**anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is sometimes, especially when I'm feeling like this, I think about everything that sucks: how lonely I am, my traumatic childhood, my many inadequacies, etc., and I really feel stuck. Like I need to escape. I am not suicidal by any means, but I wouldn't mind just leaving everything behind. I know better people have gone through worse, but I also think that legitimizing my own problems and stop telling myself to ""man up,"" I could overcome these hurdles and maybe live an ok life with someone who is ok as well.**"

Awkward, rude, disrespectful...you get the idea; not exactly an easy guy to work with. This makes the DevOps work, which is pretty new to me really unfun. I've tried to be as positive as I could this whole month and really try to enjoy working here, but this team is just not for me. I would quit if this was a full-time job, but since this is an internship I'm going to stick it out and just build that resume at the least. I'm realizing there is another option: Request a team switch from my manager. The reason I'm hesitant to leverage this option is because I interviewed with Bob and I was meant to work on his team. Our floor has around 40 developers, and most of them are much much more tolerable than Bob, and they are also doing work I find a lot more interesting (I'm finding that I really prefer WebDevelopment work to DevOps).

29pu4e,3,2014-07-03,Are You The Cliche Of An Aspiring Screenwriter? Follow These 5 Steps To Make Sure You're Not.,ScriptReaderPro,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/29pu4e/are_you_the_cliche_of_an_aspiring_screenwriter/,"We’ve put together 5 ways to avoid just being another ""aspiring screenwriter."" 5 ways you can start to slowly make the transition from ""aspiring"" to ""professional."" Starting today! 

ONE: MAKE THE COMMITMENT

The biggest obstacle to aspiring screenwriters becoming paid writers is a lack of commitment. Once you make the commitment to be a writer, everything else falls into place. 

If you’re still working that 9 - 5, coming home from work and watching TV rather than writing, you haven’t made the commitment. 

If you’re still living in St. Louis because your on-off boy / girlfriend lives there, rather than move to LA, you haven’t made the commitment. 

Michael Arndt was working as an assistant to Mathew Broderick when he made the commitment to be a screenwriter. 

He decided that if he was going to ever become a screenwriter, he was going to have to make some changes to his life first. So he saved up a substantial amount of money and quit his job. 

Then he gave himself one year to just sit down and write. Every day for as many hours as possible. One year later, he had finished six scripts, one of which was called Little Miss Sunshine.

Below is a list of the four best ways you could change your life to refocus it on screenwriting: 

Quit Your Day Job

If you’re young and without any big time commitments, save up some money and spend all day writing. Give yourself a set amount of time. You can always get another job afterwards. 

Or move back in with your parents and write. If this is what you really want to do and you’re in your 20’s or 30’s with no real commitment to anything else, just do it. Or you may look back and regret it. 

Take An MFA In Screenwriting

Enroll on a screenwriting degree and completely immerse yourself for two or three whole years in the world of writing. This is a very good step, but also out of reach financially to many people. If you can afford it, though, great. Go for it. 

A cheaper option, of course, is to take a part time screenwriting course. 

Move to LA 

As our new reader, David DeGrow Shotwell points out in his post on how he broke into Hollywood, moving to LA is probably the single best thing you could do to further your career.

This is where it’s all happening and you’ll feel inspired just being here. Plus, you’re much more likely to meet people in the industry who can help.

Again, if you’re young enough, another option is to actually get a job in the industry as an assistant or intern. 

Okay, you’ll be working like a dog for five days a week and not feel like writing when you get home, but you’ll also be in exactly the right place to give your scripts to important people for them to take a look at.  

Now, we realize that not everyone can make these kind of decisions, but even if you’re a stay at home mom of four, or have some kind of hot shot job, you can still make a commitment to screenwriting. 

Finding the time is not impossible. All it takes is some creative planning. 

Without a commitment to screenwriting, it’s just that much harder than it already is to get anywhere in this crazy business. 

TWO: SET GOALS 

Once you’ve made the decision to actively pursue a career in scriptwriting, we strongly suggest you whip up some goals for the year. 

Firstly, start big. What’s your overall goal for the year? Where do you want to be with your writing twelve months from now? 

Write them down — an overall career goal, monthly goals and day-to-day goals. It’ll help give a sense of structure to your writing so you’re not just cranking out material “blind.”

Be specific. Aim to have written a certain amount of screenplays. Compiled a database of agents and managers. Sent out X number of query letters etc. 

A good way to help focus your goals is by setting yourself deadlines. You can use competitions as deadlines. Or book an appointment with a script doctor in X number of months. 

Give yourself day-to-day goals too. Some writers love setting themselves word and page counts while others just write until they drop. Whatever works for you, use it. And stick to it. 

There are no rules regarding daily goals. The most important thing is that you don’t go more than one day without writing.

THREE: MASTER THE CRAFT

We all know the best way to improve as a writer is by actually writing every day. But there are other things you should incorporate into your routine besides writing if you want to master the craft. 

Read Screenwriting Books

There are certain screenwriting books for which it should be a federal crime for an aspiring screenwriter not to have read, such as “Save the Cat”  by Blake Snyder, or our own “Master Screenplay Sequences.” (Just kidding.)

Some writers, such as Craig Mazin, scoff at the idea of reading books to help master the craft of screenwriting. They say “Don’t bother with books, just watch movies. And read scripts.” 
While there is obviously value in watching movies and reading scripts, what is the harm in reading a few books as well?

It’s like saying “The best way to become an architect is by watching other architects build houses and poring over building plans.” 

Okay… but if that aspiring architect then goes home at night with a copy of “Towards a New Architecture” by Le Corbusier, that’s somehow not helping? 

Don’t listen to Craig Mazin. Make a big list of screenwriting books you want to read and cross them off as you go. 

Read Screenplays

Craig Mazin and co. are right about reading scripts though. This is by far the most important thing aspiring screenwriters should do outside of writing. 

You should be reading at least one professional script a week. Otherwise you’re just attempting to do something without really mastering the craft from those who do it best.

Immerse yourself in professionally written scripts and you’ll learn a ton about characterization, structure, how to write a scene and writing style.  

Most importantly you’ll learn how to create emotion in the reader from using only words on a page. This is what screenwriters live by, and there's no better way than learning from those who obviously know how to do it. 

And read bad scripts too. You should be offering to read the script of every screenwriter you meet. You’ll probably learn just as much from these as the professional ones.

You’ll learn what not to do pretty fast, and that’ll help you no end in your own writing. 

Write Outlines

The days of just sitting down to watch a movie are over. If you’re an aspiring screenwriter and serious about breaking into the business you need to be writing outlines of films as you watch them. 

This is a great exercise, primarily in helping understand and master structure, but also helps with character and scenes as well. 

So, here’s what you do: Simply sit down with a laptop and write exactly what happens on screen as you watch. 

Each scene in a film fulfills a specific function, and it is this that you need to capture in your summary. 

Sentences should be short and to-the-point, describing only the basics of what happens and avoiding extraneous details. 

It’s a good idea to start with a location, as in “Outside the gas station” to set up the scene. Then, only the major beats need writing down. So you should never say how someone’s dressed, for example, unless it’s important. 

At the end of the movie you should end up with a four to six page long outline. The next step is to break this down into its relevant acts and sequences. And that’s it. 

Write as many outlines as you can, but it’s probably best to stick to your chosen genre at first. By breaking down dozens of movies into outlines you’ll really get a sense of how your genre works. 

File it away. Build a database of outlines and you’ll also have a great reference point for when you’re writing your own screenplays. 

FOUR: DON'T SENT OUT YOUR SCRIPT UNTIL IT'S READY!!! 

This is probably the single biggest mistake aspiring screenwriters make. 

Save yourself a ton of money, 
heartache and rejection by only sending out your screenplay when you’re sure it’s good enough. 

How do you know when it’s good enough? When you’ve sent it off to an unbiased professional screenplay consultant like ourselves for notes and got at least a “Consider” but preferably a “Recommend” on it. 

If you send your script off to a consultant or receive notes back from someone in the industry and get a “Pass” you know you need to work some more on your craft before approaching agents, managers, producers or even sending it off to competitions.

Once you’ve got one solid script that’s received favorable feedback from a working professional, you’re going to need to repeat the process with at least two more scripts. 

Never go out into the industry claiming you’re a screenwriter “with a great script” unless you have at least two other great scripts sitting on your laptop as well. People in the industry want to discover great writers, not great scripts. 

They want to see that you’re in this screenwriting thing for the long term and not living a 90’s fantasy of selling a million dollar one-off spec. 

Aim to create a portfolio showcasing your best work. We advise sticking to one genre so people know how to place you in the industry.

Positioning yourself as a Thriller Guy, or a Comedy Girl is much more beneficial than as a jack-of-all-trades with a Thriller, a Comedy, a Horror and a Reality TV show.

Most importantly, though, don’t send out a terrible screenplay into the industry.

Hollywood agencies and production companies log the scripts they receive and so by sending something to them you’re leaving a permanent reference point for them to be able to look you up as a writer and see what you’ve already submitted.

And that’s not good if it’s a script in which nothing happens until page 59. 

FIVE: ONCE IT'S READY, MARKET YOUR SCRIPT TO DEATH

Many aspiring screenwriters have done much of the above. They’ve made the commitment to write. They’ve mastered the craft of screenwriting and finished eight or nine scripts. They’ve even received positive feedback on them. 

But then they’ve just entered a few contests. Shown it to a friend of a friend who works at CAA. Maybe joined The Blacklist promotion service. And that’s it… 

Well, this may work if you’re lucky, but chances are it won’t be enough. In order to give yourself the best possible chance of going from aspiring screenwriter to working screenwriter you need to market the hell out of your screenplays and yourself as a writer. 

Now, turning into some kind of Glengarry Glen Ross type sales character is probably not the most natural thing for a screenwriter, but it’s one of the most essential. 

Everyday, writers with half of your writing ability are getting signed by agents, managers and getting their films produced. Not because they’re better writers than you, but because they’re better at selling themselves. 

Once you have a portfolio of work, you need to become just as aggressive in your marketing strategy as the less talented writers who are getting deals. 

This means actually devising a marketing strategy in the first place. Again, you need to write down your goals and organize your contacts.
Research all the places you could possibly send a script in your genre. 

Build up a spreadsheet of possible contacts to approach. Set goals and cross them off. 

Your script may be the next Pulp Fiction, but if you don’t actively get it out there (in the correct manner) who’s going to know about it? 

If you need guidance with all of this, a good place to start is hiring a screenwriting career coach such as Lee Jessup. 

*      *      *

Well, that’s our five point plan on how to avoid becoming another aspiring screenwriter cliche. We hope it’s provided some inspiration.

I've heard people say ""program something that will be useful for you"" or ""work on an existing open source project"" etc. etc. but those suggestions still seem vague to me. All the programming I've ever done is in the Netbeans environment, writing Java code to solve homework assignments.

I've been in a relationship with my SO for just over a year (I'm 21, she's 17) and the only thing that keeps getting us into arguments in how often we see each-other.
   
She misses me the second I step out the door, and vice-versa. Yet for me it's easy to find distraction and to allow it to fade away after a few days. Not for her, she doesn't have many friends and she has trouble at home. We're quite a long distance apart (about a 2 hour journey one-way) so it's not the easiest to just go round to watch a movie on weekdays or something (because of internships for college and such).
   
This will result in her asking me to come over (she doesn't have that much money, it's harder for her to come here) for every instant that we're both available, but I want to have room for other things too (such as friends, hobbies, etcetera) that don't always involve her. It hurts me to say no to her but I do it regularly so that I can have some time for myself. She gets really sad when this happens and there's nothing I can do to comfort her or deal with her missing me. She keeps saying ""it's normal for people in a relationship to want to see each-other ALL the time!"" but I disagree. How do you deal with missing your SO if you're apart, and am I perhaps being an enormous ass?

I have tried leaving her a shirt to sleep in, spraying cologne on her pillow, she felt nice because of it but it's no long-term solution.
   

Thanks,

So this is another post about OP losing motivation for studying.

I am studying mechanical/industrial engineering at a reputable university. However, as the years progressed, I found out that I enjoyed working on software(which is a completely different field) more than the courses that I get to take. So much so, that I learned coding on the side and have been consistently getting good internships in the software field.
Now, since the courses I am taking are not relevant to the field of work I want to go into, I am super de-motivated to work hard on them. My marks have been average since the beginning but more recently, I noticed that I'm studying just to pass the exam rather than understanding the material. So, I'll just cram all the material the day before the exam and get a decent grade. But, as the courses get harder, my lack of interest in the courses is reflecting on my grades as well. I am 3 semesters away from finishing my degree and I see myself giving up before I finish.

So my question to you is: How can I motivate myself to study for something that is not going to be relevant to me at all?
I have no goal to achieve. High GPA isn't lucrative to me anymore :(

- Grades don't mean anything while applying for jobs in my field(coming from personal experience + experience of a quite a few other people).

- Good grades for Masters? I only want to do masters if I find a subject that really interests me. So far, there's been nothing. And to get good jobs in software, you don't really need a masters anyway. (Again, this is coming from advice that a few highly placed individuals in tech industry gave me).

It's too late to switch into another program since I am so close to finishing mine and switching to a different program also means that I have to start from the very beginning again.


I do understand that it's better to have good grades on the transcript than bad ones, but there's not enough force that's pushing me to work for them.

Any help would be appreciated!"

I am 3 semesters away from finishing my degree and I see myself giving up before I finish.

So my question to you is: How can I motivate myself to study for something that is not going to be relevant to me at all? I have no goal to achieve. High GPA isn't lucrative to me anymore :(

- Grades don't mean anything while applying for jobs in my field(coming from personal experience + experience of a quite a few other people).

- Good grades for Masters? I only want to do masters if I find a subject that really interests me. So far, there's been nothing. And to get good jobs in software, you don't really need a masters anyway. (Again, this is coming from advice that a few highly placed individuals in tech industry gave me).

It's too late to switch into another program since I am so close to finishing mine and switching to a different program also means that I have to start from the very beginning again.

I do understand that it's better to have good grades on the transcript than bad ones, but there's not enough force that's pushing me to work for them.

Any help would be appreciated!"
29q2qv,3,2014-07-03,My gf [f/24] just dropped a huge bomb on me [m/27] and I don't know how to feel or what to do.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/29q2qv/my_gf_f24_just_dropped_a_huge_bomb_on_me_m27_and/,"I met my (I guess ex) gf of the past 2 months (I know, not long) during my final internship. We were both students and we hit it off really well and started dating.

Fast forward a couple weeks after we began to date and I decided to go on a road trip with her back to her home in another state, 1,800 miles away. The trip was about a week long and it was fantastic. We bonded even more and began to get pretty intimate with each other, both physically and emotionally.

After the road trip back to her home state, we both flew back to my home state and she spent a couple days with me before returning home. Before she went back home ""for good"", we decided that there's no way we would let that be the end of us, that we would ""make it work"" somehow.

Well, seeing as how we're both in the same field of work, that actually wasn't as unfeasible as I was initially concerned it would be.

Over the course of the next month or so, we continued to stay closely in touch via phone, text, and skype. If anything, we seemed to grow even closer together instead of further apart during this time, and I felt like this was  great sign because if our short relationship was going to be tested, it would definitely be in a situation like this.

So everything is going great, right? She finds a job in another state and gets an offer while I'm interviewing for a job in the same state. I'm ecstatic because I can't wait to get out there with her and see what the future holds for us. She keeps telling me things like ""if you want to stay in your hometown, just say so"" and ""you know you don't have to move out here, right?"" I always assumed she was just looking for some confirmation and reassurance that I was serious about moving to another state with her, and I always gave her this reassurance.

Well 3 days ago, I got a legitimate offer for my position in this state where she's moving to and I couldn't have been more excited. Things are finally coming into place and it's not going to be long before we're together again!

Little did I know that my world would be shattered the next day. During the course of one of our nightly phone calls, she starts to express some apprehension about moving (with me, specifically). 

And let me just point out that we would be living in separate apartments and working at separate facilities.

Anyways, she starts expressing some apprehension about everything and I try to reassure her. She keeps saying things like ""I don't know, I'm just really nervous"" and things like that. Eventually I say something like ""I don't really like how this feels, because it sounds like you're backing out on me."" To which she replies:

""I think I am""

In an almost emotionless voice, she continues to become more resolved in her stance that she's backing out on me. My first reaction is something like ""are you kidding me?"". The only reason she can give me is ""I just can't"" and ""I'm not ready"". ""Ready for what?"" I asked. She couldn't tell me.

What's really fucking frustrating and emotionally tormenting is that she keeps telling me that she still loves me. She told me that there's no one else involved (she hasn't even moved to this other state yet anyways), and from what I can conclude there is no known reason why she just majorly flaked out on me.

Right now I'm just pretty fucking depressed. I know that I only knew this girl for little over 2 months and that things happened quick, but it just clicked, you know? It felt so damn right, and I really believe that she felt the same way as well. That's why I was so into her, because she seemed so into me.

And now all of a sudden that it's more ""real"" (ever since I got a legitimate job offer), she suddenly just ""can't do it"", whatever the fuck that means.

After she dropped this on me, I didn't talk to her for most of the next day. At one point I tried calling her and she didn't answer. She texted me saying ""I really do want to talk"" so I said ""can we?"" and she said ""please no"" -- like what the fuck? She wants to talk to me but can't emotionally take it or something like that?

Anyways, I convince her to talk to me (holy shit, the least you can do), and it's just more of the same. I try to figure out where all of this is coming from and why it's happening, but she keeps telling me she doesn't know. She just ""FEELS"" like it's a mistake and like she ""can't do it"".

Ok so let's review here:

- she loves me


- if she was still living in the same state as me, we'd be dating (she told me this)


- she's going to be all alone in this other state

- did i say she loves me

And yet she ""can't let me move out there with her"". What in the ACTUAL FUCK is going on? I am so confused and distraught, I feel ashamed for letting myself think that we had something special together.

I just don't get it. We had so many special memories together and we clicked so well on so many levels, and she's apparently perfectly ok with throwing all of this away and for what?

I said something like ""you realize that you're essentially ending our relationship, right? are you ok with that?"" and she replied ""i have to be"". I said, ""no, i want to hear you say that you're ok with that, because that's bullshit and you don't have to be.""

Nope, she wouldn't say ""i'm ok with ending our relationship"". Just ""i have to be ok with it""

Holy fucking shit, my mind is fucked. It's like she's trying to ride the fence between not completely discarding our relationship and not wanting to pursue it either, I just don't know.

My pessimistic self thinks that she never really wanted a long-term relationship to begin with. That maybe she was just looking for someone to give her some validation and make her feel better about herself in a time frame that was convenient for her. That she wasn't ready for another commitment and wasn't ready to make herself emotionally vulnerable to someone yet.

My optimistic self thinks that she's just really scared that I'll end up hurting her because she'll be really invested in me if I move out there with her. Since I'll be like the only person she initially knows, maybe she's afraid that if things don't work out between us then she'll feel really isolated. Maybe she thinks that if she's isolated from the beginning without giving herself a chance to experience some kind of emotional letdown, it will be better. ""Safer"", perhaps.

She's always said that she didn't like feeling like I was moving out there just for her, but I couldn't lie to her and say that wasn't the case. I mean, there's literally no reason I would move to another state because I like where I'm at now. But, she's a pretty big incentive. For whatever reason, she doesn't like feeling that way. She would be more comfortable if we were just two separate people moving to this other state because we both wanted to move, not because we wanted to be with each other. Like what the fuck, wasn't that the whole point in the first place?

If I knew that the reason this was happening was because she didn't want to feel some kind of responsibility for ""letting me move out there with her"", I might actually consider moving anyways and then seeing what happens. It's possible that if I move even after she told me not to, things would be ok because she might feel free of responsibility, because she told me not to move.

On the other hand, it's entirely possible that moving out there would only make things worse, and that she would say ""i told you not to move"".

I don't know what to think anymore. Times like these make me feel like I can't trust anyone because I feel like I've been used for the past 2 months and then discarded when I was no longer convenient. I know I just need time to heal and I know people go through far worse, but it still sucks... We were both pretty serious about each other and the possibility of a future together, and she just threw that in the trash.

Furthermore, I spent the past 2 months of my life searching for jobs in the same state as she was because we wanted to be together (at least, I thought ""we"" did). I dedicated a lot of time and energy to that goal and I feel like I was working on completely false pretenses now. Like it was all for nothing. Plus, I've been under a lot of stress recently because my national board exam is coming up in a week. Oh, and to make things even better, my brother is getting married in a couple days and I'm in the wedding. I mean I'm happy for him of course, but all the wedding shit is going to make me think of this girl and how she just ripped my heart into pieces.

I just don't know anymore. I guess I need to have a question at the end of all this, so my question is what do I do now? Do I continue to pursue her? What should I say to her? Anything?

If not, how do I bounce back from this shit? I feel terrible."

I'm in college and need an internship so I suggested I could get one in his area this summer. He later suggested I could stay with him. Well eventually he told me that he didn't feel comfortable with me staying for 2 months and would be more comfortable with me coming for 2-4 weeks. So I said ok, completely understood, I mean we hadn't been dating that long. He then went to an internship in Washington DC and he became distant. He didn't talk to me much or take any type of interest in what was going in on my life. He went back to LA and we talked about it and I thought we had taken care of it. I told him that I felt like he wasn't sure if he wanted to be with me and his response was ""Yeah...idk why I feel this way"", but the next day he said he did want to be with me. So fast forward to this month. About a week ago he asked if I could come visit him in July instead of August. So I said ya! Well yesterday I was talking to him and double checking if he wanted me to still come and he told me he didn't know. I'm kind of confused on what to do here and if i'm over reacting, or if i'm expecting to much, or if i'm giving him to much leeway in how he acts."

My entire life, thus far, I have had 3 best friends and 3 girls who was more than interested in me than a friend.

Well, that wasn't as short as I had planned. Whatever, I'll leave it. Took too long to type. Maybe I'll move it to the end.

If you skipped the optional reading, basically I have only had 3 best friends and 3 girls with whom I have had a relationship with besides basic friendship.

I'm a nerdy, introverted guy with ADHD and a light sprinkling of OCD. Who DOESN'T have ADHD these days. I have a daughter and an ex with a complicated and emotional past.

Moved because it was much cheaper to live here and my mom lives 30 minutes away if I need help with something.

All I want in life are friends and a girlfriend&gt;fiance&gt;wife. I would like to have my daughter too, but that is out of my control I'm afraid. Doing the best I can to be with my little girl.

Actually, I do take something back. It seemed like living in Florida was like an alternate reality. I could make friends easily. I met a girl quite easily, although too late for a relationship. And all within a year. After I left, everything went back to the way it was before. It's like life there was a bubble with which I had lived the life I have always wanted, but never have quite found outside of that bubble. Confusing?

I mean, what girl doesn't want a guy who knows how to cook, loves to travel to experience fun things, and who doesn't mind being romantic. I'm an average 5'6"" @ 150#. What am I doing wrong?

Ask me whatever questions and I'll answer. First time at Reddit so sorry if I am not posting this in the right spot or formatting this incorrectly.

|OPTIONAL READING|
 -------------------

I'll start with my guy friends
I had a best friend next door for most of elementary school. I haven't spoken to him since I moved before 5th grade. WAY before social media or even the internet existed. Would like to locate him again. I had a friend who was older and he had a sister whom I was friends with. They lived next door and helped each other with school work. They moved before I was in 4th grade. I also had a best friend for a year while I was working for Walt Disney World doing a college internship program. He was my roommate. He's my Facebook friend, but we don't really communicate.

As for the girls
I had a friend who I met in DK. What's that, pre-kindergarden? Anyways, We met and we became so close until I moved at 5th grade. She is the only girl who ever approached me and wanted to be friends with me. One day after 5th grade, I found her contact information and contacted her. I believe we mailed each other. Or maybe it was during the young AOL days. Yeah. we started talking again and she told me if we hadn't moved we would still be together and I was the only boy she ever liked while we lived in the same city. Lots of memories.

There was also a Brazilian girl I met while working at Disney. This was in 2005 I think. She was an international college student. I met her about 2 weeks before she had to leave. I think I actually approached her and started talking to her. We went to another apartment for a little party and she got a little too drunk. Instead of leaving her there I helped her to her place which was next door to mine and we went on a date the following day. Should have I allowed myself to open up my heart to someone only 2 weeks before she had to leave? Probably not. She told me she would have been my girlfriend for sure if we had met sooner. I remember her roommates telling me she was involved with a guy who was a total jerk to her.

Girl #3
So now for the former girl. I'll try to keep it short. We met online. talked literally nearly EVERY DAY. A lot of times for HOURS. We decided to start a long distance relationship. We made it last for 2 years. Big age gap. I was 9 years older.

What happened between the time we first met and the time she moved to the state I was in I do not remember. It is cloudy for some reason. But she moved to my state and into an apartment. First time for the both of us (I don't count Disney). We became engaged to be married. Got the diamond ring and everything. Actually, I have a sprinkling of OCD and felt the diamond ring was incomplete and had to get earring, necklace, and bracelet to go with it. All diamonds of course. Anyways, I was like, ""wow, all these years with minimal friends and girl friends and I am finally catching a break""! She gets pregnant, because you know, who cares, we're getting married.

We move again. We leave because she wants to be with her family to have her baby. This place is at the corner of the country, I have family support nowhere close by, the city is tiny and in the middle of nowhere, and I barely had the money to make the trip in the first place. We end up staying at her parents house. It took longer than planned to move so the job ""her brother was holding for me"" wasn't there anymore. I don't remember what happened to the small house/apartment she said we could get.

A month in and she decides to break up with me. I had to leave the next day. I felt like I was being tossed out like yesterday's trash. Being SO confused and heart broken, I managed to get myself to a hotel and my family helped me get back home. We talked on the phone again after some months went by. At the time, my dad was paying her phone bill. The only reason was because it was super cheap and it was a way for us to stay in contact since she had my daughter. I wasn't there when she was born BTW. 

We continued to talk on and off until my daughter was 1 year old. I paid to have the both of them come to me for 2 weeks. We stayed at one of those extended stay hotels places. I got to see my daughter for the first time and for her first Christmas/birthday. We got close to getting back together during those two weeks. We continued to talk until after my dad had to drop her off the phone plan. Ever since then we never really talked.

Two years passed. I was an emotional mess with no friends to talk to or vent my hurt.

After a few months past my daughters 3rd birthday, I finally decide to get back to social media and try to make some online friends cause I'm not have ANY luck IRL.

I find out my ex had messaged me a few times on my old Facebook. I made posts to my Facebook, but I never actually logged in from the main site. It was just used to share and log into things from 3rd party phone apps. We start talking again and in the Fall she said she wanted to send my daughter to live with me for 3 months. I get to have the Holidays between mid-late September through the end of the year. Why? For one, her boyfriend with whom she left me for AND had two kids with assaulted her. That and it was alleged that he molested a girl in her family. Did I buy that story? I didn't care if it was true or not, I wanted to be with my daughter. I had almost recovered the money I had lost during the last bad part of my relationship so I could afford it.

Anyways, 3 months turned to 6 months. I hadn't been so happy since the peak of my relationship with me ex. I had forgotten what happiness felt like, it had been so long.

After the 6 months, her mom (my ex) came, spent two nights with me in my spare bed, and left. We continued to talk and we were going to just stay friends because she was still getting over her ex whom she took to court and lost somewhat. Why do I still want to get back with her? I'll clear that up later.

Things continued to improve between us until one day she seemed to just decide to be angry with me. One day we were talking and the next she is pissed. Something about being mad that our daughter doesn't clean her room and she always cleaned it before she stayed with me. I seems to be the one whose to blame for my little girl being a little girl. I mean, what child constantly cleans his/her room? There's probably more to it though that she is not telling me.

What do y'all think? Does this sound like an N, fleas, possible sadist,etc.?",Chewy2000,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/29qnrf/realizing_that_even_generation_has_been_tainted/,"I have known since I was 16 that I wasn't being treated right by my N mom thanks to social worker's intervention. I was a SG, dad was dead, mom diagnosed w/bipolar and an N.

When I was 20 I was making $70,000 a year and took a life insurance policy on myself for my little cousin Sandra who this post is about...I loved her a lot and I still care about her but I'm kind of sad because I think she isn't capapble of regular human emotions anymore.


I have known since 22 or 23 that my entire mom's generation of aunts was near insane. My uncles on the other hand are just chronically depressed. I have been raised to be close with my cousins because its part of our culture but also because I'm an only child (have half siblings on fathers side).

Aunt Lana is a compulsive liar according to me and everyone else in the family. She has fucked me over in the past in business but she is the most maternal person in my life right now (doesn't say much). I never thought she was an N or even abusive but her daughter/my cousin Sandra seems like a full N to me and its freaking me out. 

Sandra is 23 and I'm 25 and I always tried to be closer to her. We even once said that we have to try to be different than our parents generation in terms of being close to each other. The thing is now that I have learned about Ns more recently to get closure on my childhood...I'm seeing a lot of it in her. She usually only initiates conversation with me to brag about herself or her boyfriend. During conversations she always is ""one upping"" and lastly she is a complete know it all even when she is clearly wrong about something. She also likes to have long conversations about things she is interested in that she knows I'm not which I find to be N-like. She also has another bad habit of bringing up really gross things like what it was like to take apart a dead cat in an anatomy class and she will even show a picture of it on her phone while we are eating. She gets so excited when she talks about things like this....I don't get it but its fucking creepy.

The few times I have shared something that makes me feel vulnerable, I feel like she gets condescending with ""Oh honey...."" shes younger than me why is she calling me honey? She is also always putting on the fakest personality when anyone else is around, has no friends until recently because she has her BF and he has friends. 


Also the last few times I have been around her, she randomly brings up  negative life events of mine that happened 5+ years ago.

**Me: ""You should come to my friend Denise's 4th of July party downtown. She has views of the fireworks""**

**Sandra: ""Oh is she the one who did that thing to your roof (it was a teen party 10 years ago and the cops came, we got in trouble)""**

I never bring up the bad stories I heard about her like how the whole family thought she was insane when she used to draw graphic, violent, and gorey death scenes as as 12-15 year old...or how she has never lived outside of her mothers house or had a job her mother didn't get her.

I'm thinking, oh really bitch? Am I on your mind that much for you to remember my painful memories?

Or 


**Me(I graduated this May from a college she wanted to go to and got denied from. I'm studying for the CPA exam and have had a job lined up since November '13):""I haven't been able to study all day because the AC is broken at my house so its hard to focus""**

**Her: ""Oh do you have to study for your internship or something?""**

**Me: ""No its actually a job and I'm studying for my license exams""**

And this is why I know I'm not an N...because I have so many opportunities to play it up but I actually play everything down around her because I can feel her jealousy. I can physically feel it too. I have felt her jealousy for years and still wanted a close relationship. I play my looks down, achievements, EVERYTHING. I have felt her competing with me for years but to me it never felt like a competition. I have played myself down in an an attempt to make our relationship stronger because that is what I do constantly around my mom, aunts, and even other female cousins."

29qusu,1625,2014-07-03,21 day quarantine,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29qusu/21_day_quarantine/,"I’ve just returned from Africa, Guinea to be specific. I was there interning for the CDC in cooperation with the WHO. If you haven’t heard what’s going on in West Africa right now…then I’ll give you the quick and dirty; there’s a massive Ebola virus outbreak. I worked as a tech assisting with incredibly ill patients. Most of them didn’t make it where I worked. The few that did survive were in bad shape and would probably carry traces of their struggles with them for the remainder of their lives. It wasn’t pretty.

I have a degree in biology and microbiology and have been working towards a masters in epidemiology. I plan on eventually getting my doctorate…but that’s neither here nor there right now. One of my professors invited us to apply for a summer internship with the CDC working with the WHO in an attempt to find a vaccine for the Ebola virus outbreak that’s been ravaging West Africa. I put my resume in the mix and was rewarded with a spot on the trip. There were four of us in total and we all went to separate “hospitals.” They weren’t really hospitals…it was a series of tents set up to hold the ill until they either got better or died. I know it sounds harsh, but when someone’s veins have deteriorated to the point that a nurse can’t even get a needle into them without them catastrophically failing then the chances are they aren’t going to make it.

The reason this disease has been spreading so quickly in the area is quite simple; the method the indigenous peoples use to bury their dead. They insist on washing the corpses before they put them in the ground. This puts them in direct contact with bodily fluids contaminated with a virus that has at least an 80% mortality rate and can remain dormant for up to twenty-one days. Someone could basically be dead on their feet for three weeks before symptoms begin to manifest. Death from internal bleeding comes quickly to those who it decides to take mercy on. Others linger for weeks.

I’ve been quarantined for the last three weeks to ensure that I was safe to return home. It was standard procedure; anyone who was leaving the facility that had been in any sort of contact with the patients, even while wearing hazmat suits, had to wait a minimum of three weeks before leaving. No exceptions. One of the other assistants, a local man, was informed that his wife had succumbed to an unrelated illness and that he was required to stay for three more weeks before going to be with his family. It was strictly enforced. We planned our trip accordingly and collected our data and samples in May, having last been in contact with the patients or samples a little over three weeks ago so that we could return at the beginning of July.

The doctor I was working with was a somewhat local one who seemed to have delusions of grandeur…not to mention a death wish. He was originally from southeast Nigera, he didn’t act like the rest of the doctors, and seemed to have his own bizarre agenda the entire time I spent with him. He behaved like a normal enough person, but he would frequently disregard the strict safety rules and, on occasion, nearly expose himself to the virus. I watched in horror one afternoon as he removed the helmet to his mask to wipe a bead of sweat from his face. There was no earthly power that could’ve convinced me to remove my mask in such a situation; if someone sneezed from across the room the microscopic beads of water could travel at upwards of thirty miles per hour infecting him before he even had a chance to get his mask back on. We were burning bed sheets to prevent the spread of this horrible virus while he’s removing his mask in patient’s room because he’s uncomfortable. It amazed me that he hadn’t taken ill yet. I reported him to the WHO rep onsite. The WHO rep promptly told me that no one in their right mind would do that and I received a verbal reprimand, but otherwise nothing happened.

If he didn’t care that he got infected that was one thing, but I had no such desire; I took great care to avoid this man outside of the ward. He lived on the other side of the city, and kept mostly to himself when at the ward outside of patient’s rooms. It wasn’t hard. I had to have one interaction with him that I can remember. He was required, as part of our assessment of the working conditions of the healthcare providers in the facility, to give us a cheek swab. I took this swab with the utmost care, and made sure to wear a full hazmat suit. I treated him as if he were a patient. I had an excuse all prepared in case he asked; “this was my standard procedure, the suit’s clean, and I don’t like taking risks,” but he didn’t…he simply smiled and stared at me with eyes that seemed to look right through me. His eyes seemed off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I never got a really close look at them. I burned the suit like the rest after decontamination. His sample was checked under a video microscope and placed under observation like the rest.

Finally, over three weeks ago, my group had our final decontamination. We stayed quarantined in our respective facilities and studied the data, tapes, and recordings. The data was going to make a fine thesis that would probably help me greatly in the pursuit of my doctorate. Each of the four students had to provide a sample as well, and as we were nearing the end of the three weeks, all had been deemed clean showing zero signs of infection. Everyone was healthy, which, even with the precautions we’d taken, was a fantastic relief. 

The healthcare workers, for the most part, had remained unaffected by the virus. Only one of the workers became infected during our stay and that was a known accidental breach; she’d been unfortunate enough to stick herself through the suit with a contaminated needle. Mercifully, she’d actually survived her infection and lived to give us a second sample of someone who’d beaten Ebola. 

We had recorded enough data and videos of the various samples we’d taken to last for months, but we were on a time schedule, so some of it waited until we got back home. As we were leaving the facility I noticed that the WHO rep was a different one than the person who’d verbally told me to basically keep a lid on it. I questioned her and she informed me that she’d only been assigned this post that very day as the last WHO rep had been killed in a botched robbery a few days prior while in Sierra Leone. I questioned her as to what she knew about the doctor who I’d been working with and she claimed that no one under that name worked under the facility. As she flipped through the pages, she did remark that a patient under the same name had passed away very early on in the outbreak. She described him and showed me a grainy photograph of what appeared to be a man near death lying in a bed. That was him. That was the doctor. I could see it in his eyes and I figured out why they looked odd; there were small capillaries that had burst from the infection in his eyes. The man in the picture was cremated less than six hours after the picture was taken as he died before they could even try to treat him. I told her of this and she made a note…but mostly told me that I was probably seeing things as this man was long dead.

I told my professor and he seemed more worried than I; he’d had a similar experience during the Ebola outbreak in 1976. He began to ask the man’s name, but then stopped. We were sitting in a transport when he walked by. We both caught sight of him and as the transport wheeled away we could see the “doctor” board a separate one headed offsite. As part of our journey we were headed to sea for a ride to a neighboring, unaffected village before heading home.

My professor contacted the WHO rep when we arrived on our ship. She sent us his picture and my professor turned pale. He wasn’t a tan man to begin with as he was already in his sixties, but what color he had drained from his face when he saw the picture; It was the same, seemingly dead, man who’d impersonated a doctor back in 1976, he was sure of it. As best we could tell he was already long gone. We had no way of knowing where exactly, except that the transport he was on went directly to the airport.

We didn’t know what to do so we turned to analyzing the samples and the data we’d collected before our quarantine. The samples had long since been discarded, but the video recordings of the samples under a microscope still needed to be analyzed. I went directly to the mystery doctor’s sample. Doctor Akachi, as he was called. I put the recording of his sample up to analyze and started to research his name. I couldn’t find anything aside from a few mad scientist types in various anime genres. I did a search on just the surname, as that was all I had to go on, and found something interesting; his name roughly translates to “the hand of God.” When I thought of that it explained a lot about his demeanor; he would frequently refer to himself as “the one who does God’s work.” I’m not sure he was talking about healing anymore.

Suddenly my computer began to light up with alerts; the good doctor’s sample was off the charts infected. I’d sped the recording up a great deal and by the time it neared the end he went from perfectly healthy individual at day twenty to living zombie at day twenty-one. He had enough Ebola virus in his system that I thought at first someone had merely switched the samples without anyone noticing until I checked and double-checked the records; the sample dish hadn’t moved once. According to the logs, kept by aids who weren’t always medically trained, his blood PH dropped from 7.4 at day twenty to less than 5.0 by day twenty-one.

Immediately I contacted my professor who told me not to call anyone else. We reported it directly to the highest ranking person we could find at the CDC. That was our mistake. They told us that such information, if unfounded, could cause a global panic. They told us that it wasn’t possible that his blood could be acting like this and he still be walking upright, but we saw it. They told us we weren’t to contact anyone else on the matter. I returned home to find my apartment ransacked, my computers gone, everything I’d taken to the CDC was gone. I keep a hidden hard drive under my bed that stored basically everything as a backup, and even this had been fried. My email accounts had all been hacked and wiped, and I basically had to start over my master’s thesis.

I’ve done so by taking a look at cases resembling hemorrhagic fever outside of Africa. I noticed a trend in a few developed countries, mostly in Asia and Russia, but before I got too far I was shut down again when I thought I found a case in North America. It looked like a Canadian bush pilot had come down with something resembling Ebola after flying a man from a remote area in the Yukon into Yellowknife. Another bush pilot from Alaska had died in a similar manner, but he’d been in the field so no samples had been taken and the body had been unceremoniously burned to prevent spread. This was as far as I got before I was attacked by two large men and robbed at gunpoint. Again, I lost everything. I returned to my apartment to find the door kicked in and my newly purchased laptop gone. That evening I was informed via a close friend that my professor, the one I’d been working with, had died of a heart attack during an attempted robbery. I couldn’t even go to the funeral because he had no living relatives, and his body was taken by the CDC owing to his close proximity to the virus…even though that wasn’t what killed him.

I know I should stop, twice in three days I lost basically everything of value that I owned, but the man the pilots had given a ride matched the description to a “T,” right down to the blood-red eyes. The CDC and WHO are afraid of a global panic because Ebola has no cure; it’s the perfect humanity killer. If an outbreak hit the United States it could take 60-80% of the population within weeks, months at best, and even with all the healthcare we have…there’s nothing we could do to stop it. 

They don’t think it’d be possible for this disease to spread to North America…I think it’s already here.

29qwfb,20,2014-07-03,"The Gribble House Of Savannah, Ga: My Very Real and Life Changing Ghost Story",t8stemyrainb0w,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29qwfb/the_gribble_house_of_savannah_ga_my_very_real_and/,"Hello everyone. I decided to make an account today, so I can share with you an amazing experience I had while on vacation last year. Before you start reading, I'd like to say that I have always been into watching the ghost shows and reading about the paranormal, but I was about 99.9% sure that this stuff was all just for fun and in no way real. I just thought that the whole concept of ghosts was very exciting, but at the same time I never saw anything that truly convinced me this stuff was real. I felt and heard some cool things during this experience, but it all could have easily been a hoax. Except for the last 10 seconds.

I am a college student at Rutgers University and I major in finance. I even have a summer internship with a very prestigious financial group in PA. I'm not the type of person to automatically believe things without properly analyzing all other possibilities first, but I must say I am still very confused about what happened to me.

I went to visit the Gribble House Paranormal Experience in Savannah, Georgia on August 7, 2013. This attraction is literally a real life ghost investigation, with all of the same equipment as the TV shows. The violent history of this sight began in the early 1900's, because it was the scene of a triple murder. Since then, the house itself was demolished, and a large warehouse built during WW2 was built over top of it, but over a much larger area, an entire historic city block in fact. My mom and I were greeted by our guide Willie, who was very nice and explained the equipment in a very basic, but easily comprehensible manner. We received a spirit box, a laser thermometer, a flashlight, an EMF (electromagnetic field) detector, and a digital recorder. I will explain the other occurrences later on, but for now I will jump to the best part of the entire investigation.

In the last few minutes of the investigation, I was by myself in the southeast corner of the warehouse, which was swelteringly hot inside. This was to allow everybody to feel a spirit's presence much more easily, because they emit a very cold type of energy. For some reason, the spirits felt much more comfortable communicating with me at this moment. On the spirit box, I asked ""How many soldiers are here with me?"" The box replied ""3"". I asked ""Are you all confederate soldiers?"" Someone answered ""yes"". Soon after, my EMF detector began to light up, which indicated the presence of a spirit very close to me, and I remember somewhat feeling the energy from him or her, but I thought this could just be psychological so I ignored it.

I asked, ""Were you alive in the 1800s?"" The EMF detector blinked once, indicating that they were in fact alive during this time period. I asked if they were alive during the Civil War, and received no response. Then, I began to ask, ""Did you die in a major battle during the war?"" and as I said the word ""die"", the spirit immediately left my presence, allowing the EMF detector light to fade away. I asked, ""I'm sorry, was that a stupid question?"" and received an answer of yes on the spirit box. I then apologized for asking this question, and stated that I did not mean to be disrespectful.

About 10 seconds later, my EMF detector began to light up again, showing that there was in fact a spirit with me again. I asked, ""Were you a soldier during the Civil War and the light blinked once. I asked, ""Were you a confederate soldier?"" and the light blinked again. I said ""Are you standing in front of me?"" and received no response, but the EMF detector remained illuminated. I asked ""Are you standing to the right of me?"" and the meter blinked once. I turned to the right, and asked, ""Am I facing you now?"" and the EMF detector blinked once. I said ""Could you move closer to me so I can feel you?"", and on cue, this soldier literally walked right up to me and through me. I felt his cold energy all over my body, literally starting right in front of me and ending behind me.

Right after this moment, my mom came to tell me the cab was here, which followed by the honk of the cab's horn outside of the warehouse (I'm not sure why he honked when he knew we were coming; I guess it he was just in a rush or something). I tried to explain to her what had just happened, but I think I only gave a jumbled description because I was so confused with what just happened to me. I told the spirits, ""Thank you for taking the time to talk with me, I really appreciate it, but I have to go now"". A female voice replied through the spirit box ""goodbye"".

As I was walking out, my meter began to light up again, and the light remained illuminated in the briefing room. I set it, along with the spirit box, down on the table and received a spirit saying ""Enter"" through the box. I guess this indicated that he wanted me to come back and talk more, which unfortunately was not possible, because our allotted time had run out (it was 1 am).

Other odd occurrences:

Before the soldier, I was in the northeast corner of the building, and felt a presence standing behind me. I thought that someone might be there due to the cold air that was stationary behind me. Right after, my mom happened to place the meter behind me, and it lit up. I asked if this was Paul (our guide gave a few names of the supposed ghosts), and the spirit responded with one blink of the light. Right when our guide began to walk over, Paul left our presence immediately (I assumed he maybe does not like black people, or this was just a part of the hoax).

In the same area, I asked the spirits to do something for me on the count of 10. A voice in the voice box responded ""yes"". I started to count, and right after the number 6, a voice came through the box and stated ""7"". I continued to count, and received nothing at the end of the counting. I guess technically, they did do something ""on"" the count of 10.

While I was close to the southeast corner, but about 20-25 feet away my meter began to light up. I asked if there was a spirit there with me, and the light blinked once. I asked if my mom took a picture on the count of three, would they show themselves, and the voice on the voice box responded ""yes"". I began the countdown, and my mom did not take a picture on the count, but rather one too soon, and one too late. The voice on the box said ""late"", and about 3 seconds later, they stated ""very"".

These are the main highlights, aside from another couple odd things that occurred. I can understand skepticism from all who were not present, and I can honestly say that up to the last couple minutes, this could have been an elaborate hoax.

My mom decided to step out about 10 minutes before the end, and based on what she felt with me, I understand her skepticism as well. (She still does not believe I actually felt something, but rather imagined it). Unfortunately, she does not understand what actually happened to me on my own, only I do. Maybe some guys were watching with cameras and listening, and then responding to you in disguised voices. Maybe the EMF detectors were going off with the push of a button, and then responding with a blinking light by means of a person hiding on the other side of the warehouse. But I promise there is absolutely no way that the feeling of this presence walking through me was fake or imagined. I was way too far from any type of vent or window, let alone an open window, and this was not the same feeling you would receive from that type of occurrence anyways. I do not believe it was my own body, because usually when you feel cold like that (from being creeped out), you get a chill running down your body and goose bumps along with it. This cold ""energy"" was eerily similar to the presence that my mom and I felt at the Old Charleston Jail, which you can read about in my other story. The absolute only way to describe it is a cluster of chilly air moving together in one solid mass, and even this description is mediocre at best. It is something you MUST experience to 100% truly understand.

I left my house for vacation on Saturday, August 3, 2013 99.9% sure that there are no such things as ghosts. I am now almost certain that there are such beings from times all but forgotten, roaming the earth after death for reasons unknown to anyone but themselves.

Maybe human consciousness is much more complex than we currently believe it to be, and maybe you don't need your body to indeed be a conscious being. Maybe your body leaves behind a little part of you whose only objective is to reach out to others and in a way say, ""Hey, I was here. I existed, and I just want you to know"". I am still extremely baffled as to what this feeling truly was, but the only answer that I can pull from this mystery is that this was in fact the spirit of a man, a confederate soldier in fact, who for one reason or another, felt comfortable enough around me alone to give me a clear sign of his company.

If you, the reader, ever get a chance to go to Savannah, Georgia, make it an absolute priority to visit the Gribble House Paranormal Experience. There is something going on here that cannot be explained by a common haunted house prank."

29qzml,1,2014-07-03,"Help, I've been crowned queen of weeaboos.",[deleted],weeabootales,https://www.reddit.com/r/weeabootales/comments/29qzml/help_ive_been_crowned_queen_of_weeaboos/,"

When I entered high school, the girls in the weeaboo group became enamored with me. I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but they followed the ""weeaboo girls are chubby"" stereotype and they gushed about my body type. I'm tall, slender, light-complected, long-logged, and I have pitch-black straight hair cut into an A-line bob - *all*, by the way, uncommon but semi-desirable traits in my area. I also have dermatographia which is a fancy way of saying I get red as hell and you can literally write on my skin. They all think it's cute when I ""blush"", especially when they point out that I'm ""flat-chested desu."" But, I didn't want to be rude or make enemies so I humored them but kept my distance. 

My first mistake was letting them find out I could speak some Japanese. I'm not proficient, but it's enough to get them squealing in my face for me to say something cute. 

My second mistake was letting them find out I could draw. It's not anime style, but boy, it got them riled up, as I was quite skilled at drawing people. I got a bunch of requests to draw their OC's.

My third mistake was letting them know I watch Naruto. This got the boys interested in me as well. One of them developed a slight crush on me and, to win my affection, ended every single one of his sentences with *dattebayo*. He spoke no Japanese. When that didn't work, he did a complete personality flip and started acting like Sasuke and even called himself an avenger. 

My most regrettable mistake was letting them find out I was in martial arts. Not just any martial art: I was in Kyoukushin Karate. This riled up my entire school, and I had the weeaboos on one side saying I was ""sugoii"" and that I was just like a *shinobi* and the other side calling me out to fight to test me. After finding this out, they would not leave me alone and kept trying to get me to cosplay at their conventions. 

Now, my last mistake keeps me up at night. 

I work in a maid cafe. 

My mom is a single mother and I'm only 16 - many places in my area wouldn't even consider you for an internship unless you were 18 so my family struggled with money for a while. It wasn't until this shop opened up that I had a chance to help because they wanted young girls. They don't even try to keep it a secret - they hire you for your looks, and I looked just like every other girl there. They even make me wear extensions because ""Japanese men prefer longer hair"" I should've known I'd be found out sooner or later since our customer base is 80% weeaboo. I'm glad it's summer because I don't think I'd be able to act normal in school if word got around that I worked at the infamous maid cafe. 

TL;DR: Five strikes, desu. I'm one of them now. 

(P.S. I have many encounters with weeaboos, obviously, including hate-fueled jealousy stories. I just wanted to post this because I needed to admit the fact to myself.)"
29r14f,3,2014-07-03,Dating A Succubus Update 1,MKA42192,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29r14f/dating_a_succubus_update_1/,"Sooo, I have quite a story to tell about what happened to me last week. I am a recent college graduate
(guy) who went to an expensive, private four year university in the Northeast (New York to be specific), with a
degree in chemistry. I am, therefore, quite a rational, scientifically minded person. I don't believe in the
supernatural, nor the occult and whatever other crazy, ghastly things conjured up by people who wanted to be in
power over others or cause a stir in their communities...

However! I do believe in really strange occurrences, because lets face it, I have so many stories about
strange things happening to me. This is one of the strangest though!
Like so many other college guys and girls, I liked hooking up with my occasional co-ed. However, as the
years progressed, I found myself more interested in classes, for some odd reason, and less on shacking up with
“sorostitutes” and that cute library girl who always gives you a glance or two whenever you're typing a research
essay at 3 in the morning. (Quick tip and aside: if anyone has this girl in their next all-nighter session, 
JUST GO
UP TO HER!! AND ASK HER IF SHE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE STUDYING OR
WORKING ON! Even if she doesn't know anything at all and is a complete airhead, boom! You just started a
decent conversation about what you do! It works with guys too, girls.)

So when I was close to graduation, things started to lighten up. I had gotten into medical school,
senioritis was full gear, and senior week was excellent. I drank a ton with my friends, flirted hard (to no avail
other than confidence boosting), and celebrated the last few days of my undergraduate career with no regrets.
But that Thursday before I went home, I really wanted to hit it off one last time, especially before med school.
So, I spent the day hanging out at Starbucks and our college student center, desperately trying to run into old
flings or girls who I befriended, who we all knew might be on the same mission that week.

No luck, sigh... So I went last resort. I got to my apartment, and starting Tindering. Yes, that half ass
college hook-up application that I had on my tablet. About 30 minutes of “Yes” and very little “No”, I still had
no success. So that week, I graduated, no tail, but a 200k piece of paper with my name on it saying “I DID IT” in
invisible letters.
Fast forward two months, its now June. Completely forgot Tinder, been working in a medical free clinic,
reading a ton of fantasy and Lovecraft, and hanging out with my friends. I get a call to shadow a successful
neurosurgeon at a local hospital, so I decide to pull my tablet out of it's moving box, and charged it to carry
around and type notes while I shadowed. About 2 AM that night, when my tablet turned on from being fully
charged, I wake up to a ton of buzzing (Missed alarms, e-mail notifications, my tablet waking up after a two
month dormancy). After swiping off a dozen of update reminders and emails, I get to a tinder chat request!

Smiling to myself, secretly really interested to see who it was, I opened up the dating application and checked
my chats. I ended up have a few requests. One was a really cute blonde girl, the other a brunette with really deep
blue eyes. The third was this “alternative girl” (I'm really into that), who had a few well done facial piercings,
small gage earings, dirty blonde hair, and green eyes. She was like a “Suicide Girl”. Like that gorgeous!

WOWWW! I was dying in my bed that this girl sent a request, and it went “You're really cute! Do you
really metalwork and study chemistry?” (I minored in metalworking and jewelcrafting; it was really expensive,
but do it to expand your interests haha).” The brunette was a general “Heyyy whats up?” and the other blonde
was a bot, “Come check my cam!!” I dismissed that one, said “Nothing, how about you?” to the brunette (mind
me, it was two months later, I should have said something else). I caught myself with that, and replied differently
to the alt girl. “Hey! Yea, I really love art and sculpting. Oh and sorry for the long wait :( I haven't been on my
tablet for a while.” I didn't get any responses, but I didn't care. It was 2 in the morning, a random night two
months later, and undergraduate girls were away from my scope at this point.

I crashed and woke up the next day, did my routine of free clinic volunteering, working out, and playing
Dark Souls off the steam sale purchase I made (I'm stuck in Blight Town, these damn fat trolls are so hard to
kill). About 9 pm, after a heated World Cup debate with my brother and dinner with my family, I retire to my
room to watch whatever is on TV and cram in a little more Dark Souls. Buzzzzz, my tablet is vibrating and
sounding off. Tinder Chat Reply!

I check the app and find that the ALT GIRL REPLIED TO ME!!! “ha its all cool, I've been busy too and
haven't been on this in a while”. Excited, I send back “Yea, this is such a convenient and inconvenient app... so
whats up? Are you an undergrad student at ************** University,” and what do you study, etc etc (Those
are just some random symbols, it doesn't correlate to my school's name. I want to keep anonymous). Turns out
she graduated in the communications school in a media management program, we have an awesome
conversation, and she's staying in the area for an internship. I live about 30 minutes away from my school, and
my med school is close to my previous undergraduate campus, so I take a leap and try to set up plans. 

She doesn't reply :(...

I go on with my night, spend two hours in Blight Town, and crash. I spend the next couple days working,
and when the weekend comes up, I decide to meet a friend who's working on his PhD at my old University while
I check out a new apartment for med school. After checking the apartment out, I made my way back to campus
to meet my friend, and made a quick stop at Starbucks for a frap. AND THERE SHE IS! Working on her laptop,
the alternative girl was deep in her zone, and I didn't want to be a weirdo, so I gave them my name, and walked
to where I had to wait for my drink, inconveniently next to where she was sitting. I think she noticed me when I
said my name (My name isn't that common at all), and she was looking over at me every now and then while I
was waiting for my fricking frap.
Please oh Please, I was pleading to the non-existent heavens, just make it quick. But then I thought, oh
hell, and looked at her when she looked at me so obviously. She smiled and said “Hey! What are you doing
here?”

“Just visiting my friend doing his PhD here, and scoping out a new apartment for med school” I explained.

“Sit!” She urged and she gestured to the chair across from her.

I texted my friend to meet me at Starbucks, and drank my frap with this delightful and gorgeous girl. We had
such an awesome convo, and she apologized for not replying to my Tinder chat, she never got a notification (she
even pulled her Tinder up to prove it to me). My friend came in about 15 minutes into the conversation, I
introduce the two and they chat, and I give her my number.

Now all you redditors are probably like, WTF? Why is this in /nosleep... this is why.

I've been texting this girl a lot and last week, she told me about how she thinks she has a mental disorder. She
told me she thinks she's histrionic, or hypersexual, sensual, and overly charming/alluring. Okay, now this is the
creepy part. That is my take on it. What she actually told me was this 

(Let's give her the name Jade, for her eyes
and her own anonymity).

Jade: Hey, so I have something to tell you.

Me: What's up gorgeous?

Jade: :)

Jade: OK, no more play. I'm a succubus.

Me:... ?

Jade: Do you know what that is?

Me: Do you?

Jade: Really! I'm not lying or being weird, I know it sounds like I'm fucked up, but please give me the
benefit of the doubt for these few minutes.

Me: A Succubus as in the Sex Demon thing?

Jade: Yes! But it isn't just sex. Succubus demons are old old souls that live in young girls for life force. They
possess girls and women in order to experience life, and allure powerful men with the hopes of gaining equal
power.

Me: Isn't that like a gold digger? Haha

Jade: No Seriously!Gold diggers want money. A succubus wants everything!

Me: So, let's say you are a succubus... how did you come across this discovery?

Jade: When I was a teenager, I was into occult stuff and that. My friends had this wicca club, and we used to do
little rituals with each other. One night, we had this summoning, and my friends said I blacked out and woke up
that next day with no memory of what happened.

Jade: So after that, I really became reserved, did a lot to change my physical appearance to look like a little slut.
The last few years of high school, I slept around, hung out with popular girls, left my friends, and became this
little bitch.

Me: Ok, so you decide to get wild in high school, a lot of girls did that back then. I doubt your a succubus.

Jade: Well, there are times I don't remember things, like when I sleep or eat meals, or talk to my friends. I once
went through a whole week as if it was a blackout. I woke up that weekend with no memory of the last week.

Me: Jade, you need some help. This isn't healthy. It sounds like you are going through massive psychological
trauma, mixed with violent blackout experiences and personality disorders.

(Yes, I'm a pretentious medical student hahaha)

Jade: No! I thought about it, but it doesn't help. Something in my head really sways me from it, its a different
soul. But when we talk, I have more control, and I feel like this presence inside me accepts it to!

Me: So you're calling me powerful ;D

Jade: Shut up lol. I'm just saying, I feel like I'm not human, and I think its because of that demon summoning in
high school. I never told anyone about this, not even my parents... Can you just stick it out with me for a bit? I
really like talking to you and hanging out, and I'll try the psychological stuff if you can help me, Mr Doctor!

Me: haha, yeaaaa ok wierdo.

Jade: SHUT UP!

Me: :)

Jade: ;P

Sooo, Idk. It's a little weird. Well really. Obviously, this girl is histrionic. Has some personality disorder. Maybe
an STD? Lol.... What should I do? Should I stick it out with this “Succubus” or should I chuck and go to
something else. Med school's starting, I don't want a psycho girl friend, but at the same time, I feel bad about her
situations and she needs some form of support group. Other than this text convo, she is so likable and with my
friend that one day, she was really amiable and conversational when he met her. Who knows haha! Maybe cases
of “Succubus” possesions, are actually, histrionic. These texts were last week by the way, I spent Saturday with
her on campus and at the movies (no sex yet), but she's really into me. She held me at the movies, we kissed and
held hands and such walking around the mall... Just no sex.
Advice on how I should approach. Anyone been with a “Succubus?” hahaha oh god.

29r2m0,9,2014-07-03,My GF [25 F] of 4 years wants me [25 M] to move in with her next year and I'm unsure as we are having more and more issues with each other,oscarneils,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29r2m0/my_gf_25_f_of_4_years_wants_me_25_m_to_move_in/,"Ok, so a little background to my story. I'm currently still in college (it's my last year) and my girlfriend is already working (but her job is not yet stable). She lives with her parents, but because of her grandmother's illness, her parents are away almost every other week, so I live with her for that time. I live close to my college, with a roomate, whenever her parents are around.
Her parents are planning to move to her grandmother's house to take permanent care of her, sometime around next year. At that time, they plan to give her the house, as an ""engagement present"".

This has given me many sleepless nights... I'm not sure if we can actually live together and be happy! We are compatible in almost every aspect (we like/dislike the same things, for the most part, she gets along with almost all of my friends and I get along with almost all of her friends, etc). Unfortunately, I'm what most people would call a slob and she's not. I mean, my room at MY house is a mess (albeit livable and sanitary [there's no empty food containers laying around, I clean it regularly (at the very least it's vaccumed and mopped once a month), I haven't made the bed since I made the bed with fresh sheets (which I do every week), I like to stay up until 4/5am if I can, and get up at noon or 1pm, etc). She is the other way around... Even her sock drawers are organized!
Obviously, I try not to be a slob when I'm with her! We get up almost every day around the same time, but when I stay in bed after she leaves, I always make the bed (if we get up at the same time, she doesn't allow me to help her make the bed because apparently I can't do it the way she likes [no pun intended]). When I'm alone in her house I always clean up after myself, I don't walk barefoot (which I love), etc
Sometimes, I make the ocasional error and she snaps at me! For example, a couple of days ago, I was going to place my shoes on the porch and retrieve my flip-flops. I was already in my pajamas, and the only pair of slippers I have at the house are on the porch too, so I went there barefoot. She snapped at me and told me to get my flip-flops, which is what I was doing. She still insisted that I shouldn't have done it, because she didn't want me to walk barefoot. In my defense, I did so, because I use my suitcase to store my dirty clothes (it has that net thingy where you can place the dirty clothes), and because it also has my clean clothes, it's in our room. I undressed there, and then went to retrieve the flip-flops. It's less than 15m from the room to the porch (it's an inside porch).
This happens a lot, it's not an everyday occurrence but it does happen. Although I'm not offended by it, I don't like it. I've told her this before and she told me she would try to do better which, in my opinion, only lasted a couple of months.

Another thing is that she is crazy about punctuality. She hates waiting for someone. This past year, I went to pick her up from a class she took at night(every week) and, even though I made it on time most of the time, I was occasionally a couple of minutes late (never more than 10m, though). The thing is, she could have just started walking and meet me (I was also on foot), because I was traveling back to pick her up (we had to take the subway, I was already at the station, went back to pick her up (about 15m) and then we'd go back to the station)! She would be somewhat pissed when I was late (again, never more than 10m, IIRC).
These past weeks, I've managed to get out of my internship on time for us to meet up at a subway station and go home together for about half the journey. So she texts me to leave the internship (it's past the hour I should have left, anyway) and I always end up waiting for her for a good 15 to 30m. It's ok, I really don't mind waiting. My father picked me up from school every day, and he usually left me waiting for him for, in average 30m (and now I have my smartphone :) ). The only problem is that this is time I could have used studying or working on my project, etc.

We are also having a lot of issues with our sexuality... She is never EVER in the mood. I can actually count the times we've had sex in the past year (6 times). And the thing is that this is not a slump... We stopped having sex regularly for a good 2, 2 and a half years. I can actually measure this, because I still have condoms from a box of twelve I bought in 2012 (I found the receipt inside the box a couple of months ago). They are about to expire, it's that sad -.-.
I've spoken to her about this (only recently, though) and she told me that it was true, we were going through a slump, etc.
The thing that puzzles me is that every time she didn't want to have sex, she gave a couple of ridiculous excuses (like being too full after a meal, tummy aches/head aches (this is not ridiculous, unless you use this like 10 times in a month)). Once she even told me she was too stressed because she was unemployed (she spent half a year unemployed after finishing college)! I could understand this if she had financial problems, but her parents provided her with the same level of comfort.
Now she works at a job that requires her to wake up at 6:30am to be there at 9am, and she gets home at 20pm, so obviously, she is always too tired on the weekdays. The thing is that I also wake up at that time when I'm staying at her place and I get home at about the same time. And because I'm working at an internship where I'm required to work a full 8h day (and I do a couple of more hours because I get there early and leave after hours) and still want to have sex sometimes. Our work is very much alike, as in, it's mostly sitting at a desk programming, for me, and for her filling out paperwork and the occasional visit to the client's establishment to conduct inspections.
Anyway, we might have different energy levels, and that would explain this. However, sometimes, she is willing to stay out late (very very rare, but it does happen) to go out to a birthday party, to go to concerts, or to random parties. Last month she went to a summer festival, two days in a row, and got home at 12am/1am (when she's usually in bed before 10:30pm). Before that, she went to a kind of festival (on two separate days), where she got home at around 2 am. These were all in work days, and she got up at 6:30 the next morning.

I realize I might have done too much venting, but I thought this was required for you guys to analyze the situation.
At the moment, I'm not sure if we should move in together. In fact, I'm not sure if we should be together anymore. I mean, I don't want to raise a family where she can snap at me in front of our kids! This can't be good for them.
The sex issue is also pretty huge though... I mean, this is not normal for anyone I know! And, even thought she won't admit it, it must have it's origins on some other factor (like I don't appeal to her sexually, etc). We rarely even french kiss outside of sex, which kind of puzzles me sometimes.

Other than that we are the ""perfect"" couple, as our friends describe us... However, I don't know if I can/should maintain this relationship. I definitely don't feel OK when I'm at her place(at least for the most part)... At this point, it feels that we are just a couple of friends, who happen to have sex every now and then. Once she said something that got me thinking... She was talking about a mutual friend of ours and her new boyfriend. I told my gf that I didn't think it was going to last, because they lived in two different cities (around 300km apart) and she told me that it had to work because our friend wanted to have kids and that her (bio) clock was ticking, so she was going to make it work at all costs. It got me thinking if this is not the case with us, too (knowing that she wants to have, at least, 3 kids)... (Just a side note, she spoke about this like it was the most normal thing in the world. I was stunned, because I had never heard anything like this xD)

Breaking up with her is an option I don't want to consider lightly... I love her, that much is clear, and (I think) she loves me too. I put ""I think"" in parenthesis because the problems I stated before make me think this! I mean, this can't be normal, for any loving relationship!
Also, breaking up would be hell. Her parents know me well, my parents know her well. We have tons of friends in common, who have no idea we are having these problems.

What do you guys think? Can this be fixed? Should we be planning on moving in together?
Should I just break up with her (anticipating the crash and burn of our relationship), so that she can have enough time to find a suitable father to her children?

PS: I just wanted to clarify that snapping should not be interpreted as violence, but it's not the same as calmly explaining her point of view.

PPS: I've obviously talked to her about all the issues here, but it didn't seem to help much.
---   
**tl;dr**: I've been having a couple of problems with my girlfriend and I'm unsure if we should maintain the relationship. The problems are mainly related to us living together, which is a big problem if we move in together.
Also, our sex life is not the healthiest, at least for a couple of our age. We are not having regular sex for a long time, and I guess this has no end in sight. "
29r866,68,2014-07-03,"19 [F4A] An update, an apology, and a thank you",Carpal_Tunnel_Slut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/29r866/19_f4a_an_update_an_apology_and_a_thank_you/,"Hi, Carpal Tunnel Slut here. Some of you may remember me from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/28ndh4/19_f4a_as_punishment_my_master_is_making_me/) I submitted a little less than 2 weeks ago. 

First off, I'd link to thank you for making that post more popular than I ever anticipated, even if the amount of PMs I was getting started to scare the shit out of me (and made my pussy wet, of course - but let's keep that between us).

Anyways, I admit I did fall short of my promise of keeping up with *every* responder and for that I am sorry but I hope you'll understand when I explain my situation. 

I am also sorry that it took me so long to write this update but I have been very busy this last week trying to cram a whole lot of stuff into a too small amount of time and also my life is potentially about to change in a very big way and I have been preparing for that like crazy (I'll touch a bit on that towards the end).

For the sake of context and review, I think it's best I start at beginning:

I have been dating my Master for about 2 years and have been officially collared by him for about a year (he is around my age, a tad older). About 2 months ago he left for a 4 month trip abroad, trying to secure a better future for us. I am very thankful for all his hard work but I was also left at home with an over active libido and a seemingly unbearable amount of sexual frustration.

My master has been going out of his way to dirty chat with me and give me what sexual attention he can. He even bought me a rather expensive magic wand vibrator right before he left (but I don't have access to it unless he grants it - and he has a rather ingenious way of ensuring that). However, and I'm sure most girls who have been forced into a long distance situation can attest to this, there is just no replacement for the fulfillment that in person physical intimacy and, in my case, domination and discipline can provide.  For over the last month every dream I've had has been explicitly sexual in nature, and I would too often catch my mind wandering, as well as my hands. I love my toys but I'd trade them all in a instant to be fucked by my master's cock just once.

All of this frustration culminated in a bitchy, passive aggressive rant to my master the day before I posted here. I was very rude and ungrateful, saying that he owed me more attention and needed to dirty chat me more often. Now communication is very important to my master, and he is always more than happy to hear honest feedback from me, in fact he demands it. But he also demands that I show him the proper respect when doing so, and it is in that regard I failed.

All throughout my tantrum my master remained very calm and polite (which made me even angrier until I eventually settled down). The confrontation ended with my master promising me that I would soon have more than enough dirty chatting soon. Hearing him say that, I felt smug and satisfied, like my brattiness had paid off. I went to bed a smirk on my face.

Come the next day and... damn. Turns out my master was not pleased with my behavior the night before (rightly so), but he certainly did live up to his promise of making sure I had more than enough dirty chatting. He ordered me to post here as punishment, and that's what led to my first post (now would probably be a good time to read that if you haven't already). 

The experience of responding to your PMs was intense beyond compare. Being familiar with this subreddit, I knew I would swamped with PMs but I had no idea just how many - my post proved rather popular. My Master told me I would be punished for half-assed responses so I took time writing each response, but I still felt rushed. It was a constant balancing act, should I take less time on each message but risk being punished for unsatisfactory responses or should I take more time but risk not responding to everyone? As you are aware, I was ordered to be touching myself while reading your PMs, but (and I'm not sure if you know this) I was not allowed to cum without my Master's permission. However, your messages combined with the intense situation caused me to cum without permission several times. 

I recall the first such incident: I had worked my way to the last PM in the 'unread tab' of my inbox. I was pacing my pussy stroking as I felt that I was close. I had text messaged my Master asking for permission to come and kept glancing at my phone waiting for his call (he always grants me permission with his voice). The PM I was reading was particularly hot and I was barely able make my way through it without cumming. Before responding to it, I opened a new tab on my browser and clicked to reddit, wanting to check to see how my post was doing with upvotes. I was very mindlessly and very gently touching myself as reddit opened on the new tab, that is when I saw it - that my inbox had been completely filled again since the last time I had refreshed. That is when the realization of what I was in for truly set in. I was overcome by a sense of helplessness and I suddenly became very aware of the tightening of  my body and of my finger lightly flicking my clit. There was no stopping it, my body was rocked by an orgasm that transitioned into a gentle sob. I was exhausted, mentally and physically - and I knew I was far from done. I was overwhelmed by the impossibility of this task, by the certainty that I would fail, and by the knowledge that deserved it - that I had literally asked for it. I finished my reply to that last PM, thanked the user for the orgasm (and I meant it, as far as crygasms go - this one was amazing) and closed my laptop. I laid back on my bed and sobbed - I felt like I did back when I was a little girl and I had been caught doing something bad - those little kid guilty cries I'm sure you're familiar with. I was also racked with a longing for my master's embrace. I wanted and  needed him now more than ever. All the while my pussy continued it's gentle post-orgasmic throb.

At that moment my phone buzzed - it was my master calling to grant or deny me permission to cum. I answered the call and he granted me permission. I replied, in as a composed a voice as I could muster, ""Thank you sir, but I have something to confess..."" then proceeded to confess my orgasm and explain my current feelings to him. My Sir reaffirmed that I had done wrong by orgasming without his permission and that he had no choice but to punish me. He was gentle, however and chose a light punishment. He had me assume a relatively easy position (on my knees) and would have me hold that for him on video call for 30 minutes (naked, of course). To my joy, he enabled his webcam and demanded that we talk about my experiences with the punishment so far. This was exactly what I needed! My sir knows me so well. During the call I reiterated my feelings of helplessness and explained to him how impossible it seemed that I would be able to respond to every PM in time. My sir was very understanding but, as always, very firm. Yes, he said that I would still be punished for failing to meet the deadlines but he also assured me that he would consider my effort when punishing me. He told me that he had received PMs from several of the people I had chatted with, congratulating him on his punishment, on having such a good sub, and (most importantly to him) commenting on the quality of my responses. My sir told me that he was very pleased that I was making all these strangers so happy that they were PMing him to tell him. He told me how proud he was of my effort so far. My heart soared at hearing this and I was filled with a new found commitment to keep going. 

I kept responding for several more hours that night until I eventually fell asleep with computer still open next to me and my panties still around my feet.

The next 2 days were an emotional roller-coaster. The tension, dread, excitement and hormones were unbearable. I knew it was only a matter of time before my massive backlog of unread messages started crossing that 48 hour line. That sense of urgency made masturbating to all your wonderful dirty messages a much more exhilarating experience. There was one awful 8+ hour session towards the end where my master didn't so much as respond to my requests to cum (he had earlier warned me that he would shortly not be able to check my messages or contact me but I was still anxious to hear from him as my pussy was begging to cum). When I did hear from him, my request was denied.

Eventually, despite my efforts, those unreplied messages passed the deadline and my Master and I started receiving PMs informing us of my failure. I would have had another panic/hopeless cry fit except that my master ad been keeping a close eye on the time and called me to keep me calm, but also to make sure I knew of my failure. He ordered me to keep responding, especially to those who had passed over 48 hours, and to more importantly keep him updated over my emotional state while he took the next couple of hours to gauge my level of effort and failure and determine an appropriate punishment.

I did as he told me and two hours later he informed me of my fate: The next day I was to blindfold myself and handcuff myself to the bed. At first I thought he had misspoke - he had had me tie myself to the bed while he was away but never handcuff, I would be unable to undo the handcuffs by myself. He had not misspoken: I was to strip completely naked, write 'Carpal_Tunnel_Slut' on my tummy, tie my legs open to the bedposts and handcuff my hands behind me to one of the vertical poles on the headboard. I was to do this in the morning as soon as my mother left for work. I was to have him on a one way video call the entire time (he could see and hear me but I couldn't see or hear him). I asked him how I would unhandcuff myself and he told me that he would send someone by to *take care of me*. I was speechless. The phone line was silent save for a soft chuckle of his. I eventually asked him for clarification on what he meant but he wouldn't say, though he teased me with some suggestions. *Maybe* he'd have a friend come over and take pictures of me to submit to reddit. *Maybe* he'd leave me there for my mom to discover when she came home from work. *Maybe* he'd arranged for a friend to come over and be the second man ever to penetrate my pussy, or maybe the first to penetrate my ass. *Maybe* he'd arranged for me to have my first lesbian experience. *Maybe*  he'd combine several of these ideas or do something else entirely. *Maybe* he'd just have a trusted friend untie me and that'd be it.

The next day came and I did as he told. I made all the doors were locked and proceeded to my bedroom. I stripped, wrote on my tummy and video called him. He instructed me to position the laptop so he could view the bed, and to make sure it was plugged in so it wouldn't run out of battery, then told me that he loved me before disabling his audio. I tied and handcuffed myself and began to wait. I later found out that I waited for an hour but it seemed like much longer at the time. I was incredibly horny (my Master had never given my permission to cum after that 8+ hours of 'radio silence'). I started to panic about so many things. I thought maybe I had done the wrong thing by locking the doors, I hand't really thought of what I doing at the time and my master had not instructed me on the matter one way or the other. If my Master had not given his friend(s) a copy of his key to my house, then I would be doomed to remain tied here until my mother discovered my slutty, tied body. I struggled to free myself of my bonds, I wanted to unlock the door before returning to my bondage. But my Master's handcuffs proved inescapable and I actually ended up tightening the ties around my ankles. I spoke out loud, voicing my concerns to my master, hoping he could hear me on the other end of the call - I heard no answer.

I started to think of all the PMs you had sent me, more than a few of which involved tying me up. I started to flex my pussy but was unable to bring myself anywhere near the satisfaction I needed.

Eventually I did hear a car pull into the driveway and, to my combined relief, terror, and excitement, I heard the door unlock and open. I could hear a single person walking in my house. They did not come to the bedroom immediately. They instead seemed to just be walking about the house - this scared the hell out of me. What if it was my mom instead of who my Master sent? What if it was another relative who had the keys to my house - like my brother making a surprise visit? I debated trying to struggle free again but decided I didn't want to create any noise that might attract an unwanted visitor to my room. 

Eventually the footsteps did make their way to my room, and into my room. Whoever it was, they were now standing and almost certainly ogling my spread, naked form. My pussy was drenched. 

I heard the shutter sound of an iPhone. The mystery guess walked all around the room, photographing me from various angles. I was at least glad that my mask, despite keeping me in the dark to my photographers identity, at least would help keep my face concealed if these photos were made public. 

The shutter sounds stopped and the room grew quiet again. Until I heard the distinct sound of the stranger unbuckling. I felt a hand grab the the hair on the base my neck and guide my head to its side. I thumb was placed in my mouth to suck and I obliged. My hips were softly gyrating in lust. The thumb withdrew and was replaced with a bulbous flesh that I knew to be the head of a cock. A quick exploration by my tongue confirmed this. I tried to take as much of it in my mouth as I could but was prevented from reaching the base or my limit by my restraints. I asked the man to come closer but he did not answer, staying where he was. I was unable to tell how long this cock was and contented myself with pleasuring its tip. 

The cock did not remain within my mouths reach for too long and it and its owner eventually retracted. I felt the weight on the mattress shift as the stranger positioned himself on top of me. He positioned the tip of his cock at the entrance of my pussy and slowly began to enter.

""Wait,"" I whispered and the progression of the cock into me halted, its tip nuzzled just inside of me. I waited for the man to ask me what I wanted but he remained silent. I continued, ""I don't think I want to do this, my boyfriend is the only person who has been inside of me"" (to the public, my Master is simply my boyfriend). 

The stranger lifted my mask.

My master was staring down at me, love in eyes. He kissed me, and then plunged himself into me. 

To say this came as a shock to me is a bit of an understatement. He was not supposed to return for another 2 months - I had been there when he bought the tickets. My master is not particularly wealthy and I would have thought a plane ticket back to America out of the question (let alone a return ticket). He had managed however, and now here he was - fucking me senseless. 

Turns out this had been his plan from the very beginning. He had already been planning on a surprise visit and had been working extra hours to pay for the trip (that was a big part of the reason he wasn't able to chat with me as much as he wanted). My earlier bratty outburst had upset him but it also provided him the perfect excuse to give me an intense punishment to get me riled up before out meeting. 

I have almost ever hour of the last week him and it has been amazing. He also surprised me by revealing that he had been able to use some connections set me up with an interview for a chance at a paid internship that will put me on an unbelievable fast track to my dream career (seriously I can't believe he managed that).

So, that is the story of my experience. Feel free to comment of PM me with any questions or comments. I'll try to get to them when I can but I am also preparing for my interview tomorrow. If you have a more general question, please ask it in the comments below so I can avoid having to answer it multiple times with PM. Also, please PM me if you notice a spelling, grammar, or clarity error in this post and I'll try to fix it (it's a long post and they're probably in there somewhere).

Thank you so much for everything!

Is this a waste of a summer intern for comp sci?
29rcz0,4,2014-07-03,Graduating with zero experience...,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/29rcz0/graduating_with_zero_experience/,"Hello Reddit,

I could really use your help and advice. After July 30 I will be getting my degree in Business Administration with my option in Finance from a California State University, upon completion of a summer course. Between now and then I will be applying nonstop to as many places as possible hoping to land interviews. My final GPA is 3.6 (cumulative) and 3.77 (major).

My issue is that I have no relevant experience dealing with anything finance related. I haven't worked in more than a year and I admit that I've sort of dropped the ball. To be honest, I don't have any work experience that looks good on a resume really at all which puts me at a huge disadvantage. Because of this, I have struggled to even land interviews for internships and I feel like my resume gets ignored most of the time. I interviewed for a couple internships in June, but got rejected because they were looking for someone who isn't graduating.  How can I stand out and get a real entry level job with absolutely no relevant experience?

I am interested in working somewhere in corporate finance possibly becoming a financial analyst, but I know with my resume I can't be too picky. I am honestly desperate to gain any type of relevant experience I can leverage.  I'm open to career paths in anything business/finance related. My goal is to get my foot in the door somewhere and even if it's not my dream job, it will help me build my resume. I do have some student loans I’m going to have to start paying, so realistically I’m hoping to be making at least 40k in an entry level position.

So how can I get my foot in the door and break into finance with no experience? To gain an analyst or other corporate finance role, what skills should I hone? (I'm decent with excel, give me specifics to master in certain roles). How can I frame myself in an interview as someone with a decent GPA but no experience?

Thanks for your replies; any input is greatly appreciated!!

29riok,1,2014-07-03,Opportunities for an Information Technology volunteer after service?,xwhitewallsx11,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/29riok/opportunities_for_an_information_technology/,"Little information about myself.College senior, May 2015 graduation, currently an IT intern within a healthcare enterprise that has ventures internationally. I've had a strong gut feeling about the joining the Peace Corps since around this past winter. I've spoken to a recruiter and a RPCV, but I'm always looking for more insight. I could continue and solidify a career at my present job but my heart isn't in the vision of the company, and I feel I'd suffer in productivity/motivation if I were to stay.

I feel like with my background I'd be a nice potential volunteer candidate. What sort of opportunities could one in this field see themselves venture to? I've been thinking of the prospects of working within the Peace Corps/an NGO as Project Manager/Director with a specialization in Technology somewhere down the line. Is there a demand for such type of person? With not quite the knowledge needed for such a senior role right out of service/nor a graduate degree, is there still a need for someone with my background? 

I'm not particularly worried about finances after service, I've come to believe that things in my life just work out, but selling this to my family would quite rough, especially when my internship can provide a stable life. Ultimately, the decision is mine, but I would like for them to have some peace of mind about me. 

Excuse me if I jumped around in thought, I've just been trying to research a lot lately and understand the logistics of what I'm preparing to do. 

Thanks! 

**EDIT**: Maybe a better way to phrase my query is could I find myself getting into a NGO/Development group after service in some manner?

I have an interview next week for a web development internship that I don't feel super comfortable about. While I'm excited to work in the field, it's been a few years since I've been out of school and used the stuff and I feel VERY rusty. I was wondering if anyone has any tips or good books they know of to help me refresh myself. I caught on very quickly before and it shouldn't take too much for me to re-learn.

The job requirements focused on HTML, XML, CSS, PHP, as well as relational database systems like MySQL. It also pointed out knowing some stuff on SEO, Web programming, and the web application development process. Any basic interview tips would be good too ( I haven't had very many interviews in the past ).

Any help would be appreciated. I'm new to the sub and already started browsing around to help find some answers to these types of questions. A good book for these things would be great though.

Thanks!"

I am coming out of my first year as a consultant with a mid-sized IT firm. I am curious as to what has been everyone's experience with raise percentages throughout their career? I have a meeting next week with my Partner to discuss a raise coming out of my annual review (the review discussion will be had a week or two later in person). I'm aiming for a 10% increase, however I imagine that that is too generous and I should be more realistic. Does anyone have experience negotiating their annual raises, especially coming out of their first year as a consultant?

To give you some background on my performance, my firm has a four scale system for reviews, with a 1 being below expectations (worst) and a 4 being above expectations (best). I've had three interim reviews prior to this annual review. The first one was coming out of our training program and was a 3, but at the same time it was mentioned that I had the strongest performance out of the group. The second was about five months into my first engagement and was also a 3, but with a different set of criteria. My most recent review (one month ago) was a 4. I am involved on internal projects and on the more administrative side of my current client engagement. I should also mention that I have an additional year with my firm as an intern on the operations side of things.
  
  
  
Edit: Received a 10% raise. Definitely pleased with the number."

I think she might have had tears in her eyes when that thing worked again, she was so happy and relieved.
She tells me then how scared she got and that she will never ever open solitaire again, I laughed and told her its all well...

So, as the title suggests, I'm looking to be manipulated and exploited by an eloquent, preferably older gentleman. Powerplay, ageplay and bimbos are all massive turn-ons for  me and I love the idea of just being used to satisfy a man's desires, being convinced that I'm just a stupid little girl good for one thing. I have a two specific of scenarios in mind:

- Schoolgirl and Priest - You're the town pastor, ostensibly an upstanding member of the community. I'm a dumb high school girl, utterly naive and gullible with not much to show for myself apart from my tight teen body. Maybe you see me walking home at night and offer me a ride, convincing me of other ways I can be of service to the Lord.

- Senator and Intern/Secretary - You're a powerful Washington Republican who loves to emphasis ""family values"" and how Godless today's youth are. On the side though, you have me, the big-titted brainless intern, who you've promised to help as long as your, ahem, needs are satisfied.

If neither of these interest you feel free to suggest another. As long as you're creative and eloquent I'm game. I have few limits, apart from the obvious ones (incest, scat, bestiality, rape). I like the man to show a little force but nothing too heavy. Also, I really want to stress the mental belittlement aspect of this roleplay - I want to be put in my place, to be convinced that I really am a dumb bimbo who needs you.

So yeah, PM me! And please note that the longer and more eloquent the message, the more chance of a reply.

I tried applying to internships after freshman year, and it didn't work out well. I learned that no one wants a freshman intern.

But I don't want this to happen again in Summer 2015. I'm a pretty good student, with a pretty solid GPA (3.97). I've had a HS internship at Microsoft, and a web development company, and right now I'm working on a startup with an ECE professor at my home university. I mean, [here's my résumé](http://kirmani.io/files/redditresume.pdf) if you're actually interested. I've made a list of companies I want to intern at, and I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to land an internship at at least one of them. 

(In order of preference)

* NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
* SpaceX
* Google
* Facebook
* Microsoft
* MIT Lincoln Lab
* Dropbox
* Amazon
* Wolfram Research
* Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab

29ryx0,51,2014-07-03,What I would have done if I did it over again,BarProcrast,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/29ryx0/what_i_would_have_done_if_i_did_it_over_again/,"1) NOT prepare prior to 1L.  Biggest waste of time ever.  I was nervous because I had been out of school for awhile, and wanted to make sure I wouldn't get left behind.  So I read every 1L prep book I could find.  It was really helpful in getting me through the first 1.5 days of orientation, after that all the prep was useless.  My time would have been much better spent traveling, learning a second language, or watching Dumb and Dumber 57 times in a row.  

2) I would have slept with less people.  Prior to lawschool I worked in an almost exclusively male industry, and had a long time SO.  My SO broke up with me about three weeks before school started and I went on a bit of a rampage during 1L.  Fortunately most of the women with such poor decision making skills as to let me disappoint them were 3L's (and thus wasn't faced with them for the remainder two years), but I've burned a couple of bridges.  

3) I found my current SO in lawschool and am in a very happy relationship now, so I'm glad I messed around a bit.    

4) Refrain from using adderall.  That stuff is terrible for you, and snorting it in the bathroom is really sad.  Lawschool isn't as hard as it feels, and can be done without drugs.  But I'm glad I had a stash for bar brep, my health can wait.

5) Almost never worked late, and always took at least one weekend day off.  During the first two years it's really easy to overwork yourself.  For the most part I had a hard stop time of 10:30, and always took off one weekend day.  There were a couple all nighters, but not many.  

6) Exercise.  I was so confused when I got to lawschool why the 1L's looked so much better than the 3's.  Then I saw all the fit people I started school with gain 20 pounds and lose five shades of skin color from lack of exercise and poor diet.  Healthy body for a healthy mind.  I'm confident I did better as a result of vigorous exercise.

7) I wish I was better at keeping up with friends, family, and hobbies.  I kinda forgot about everyone during my first two years, I should have put my energy in into maintaining my life long friendships and familial relations.    

8) Studied my butt off 1L, but slacked 2 and 3L.  During 1L I figured the only thing I had to sell was my grades, so I worked my butt off and got some good grades.  But I figured after 1L summer nobody would ask about my grades again, and that proved to be true (I'm not going big law)

9) Didn't do law review, or moot court.  I figured that the only purpose of those two programs was to show employers you did more than the bare minimum.  So instead of those programs I always had internships.  As a result my total workload was reduced, and had a lot more real word experience to sell.  

10) Worked harder at my internships than at school.  I let my grades suffer during 2 and 3L so I could work harder at my internships.  As a result I got a good reputation among people in practice.  My internships also taught me more about the law than any class, and I took classes that mirrored what I did in my internships, it was like getting free A's.  

11) Taken bar classes.  Studying for the bar sucks.  I think I made life easier on my by taking almost all the bar classes.  We'll see how that one pans out when I get the results.  

12) Focus on a niche area of law right away.  I knew what I wanted to do before school, and was focused on it the whole way through.  When somebody asked me what I wanted to do I had an answer, and didn't give the general ""I'll do anything response.""  People like people that have a purpose.  Even if you make it up, say what you want to do with conviction.  

13) Joined a professional organization for my niche area.  I joined the organization for my area of law and subscribed to all newsletters related to it.  Keeps me up to date of what the law actually is, and good for connecting with people.  

14) Maybe everything I thought I did right was wrong, and vice versa.  Time will tell.  "
29rzsd,13,2014-07-03,How to find a therapist (part 1),calladus,RBNLifeSkills,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBNLifeSkills/comments/29rzsd/how_to_find_a_therapist_part_1/,"Therapy?  What does this even mean?  

In casual conversation terms like “counselor” or “therapist” get confused with other terms.  So first, let's discuss this.

“Therapy” is a broad term.  It is the method used to try to correct a health problem.  You could call medicine “pharmacotherapy”.  Chemotherapy is used on cancer.  Broadly speaking, mental health can be treated with psychotherapy, with medicine, and by other forms of therapy – such as psychoeducation, coaching, or counseling.

It is probably most important to remember that the people who practice mental health therapies have different levels of qualification.  Or none at all.

So let's talk about the difference between a psychologist, a psychiatrist and other forms of therapist.  Why you should choose one over another, and how to tell if they are qualified to help you.

At its most basic level, a psychotherapist is someone who offers a service to assist other people with their mental health.  

**At the lowest level of assistance are those people with few or no qualifications,** like a pastor serving his congregation or a “life coach” teaching other people about what worked for him or her.  Be wary of people like this, because many of them speak with false authority.  They can do real damage by stating a falsehood as truth, and may even believe a falsehood to be true.  They are not strictly bound by confidentiality, and may share patient information with family members resulting in harm to the patient.

People who are qualified to help you have specific training, and usually belong to professional organizations.  Some disciplines require licensing.  The level of qualification varies, and I'll talk about the lesser qualified people first.

**At the lowest *qualified* level are social workers.**  In some countries the title “Social Worker” is protected by law and indicates professional, specific training.  In other countries, a social worker is merely a person working for a community organization.  So be careful of people with this title.  There are professional organizations, like the International Federation of Social Workers, or the National Association of Social Workers, who advocate for social workers – but membership in one of these organizations does not imply training or qualification.  

It may be best to rely on social workers as a sort of “stop-gap” to get from one point to another.  They are used officially for crisis intervention (such as Child Protective Services, or domestic disputes or suicide prevention), to improve quality of life or support human rights and oppose social injustice.  But for someone seeking therapy, social workers are useful in acting as a case manager, as someone who assists you in finding a qualified therapist and helps you make your appointments and pick up medication if needed.

There are psychologists who work as social workers.  But most social workers do not have that level of education and training.

**Next, let's talk about Nurse Practitioner, or Physician's assistant.**  They can counsel a patient on behaviors that affect their overall health, and they can educate patients on how to care for themselves.  They may recommend or coordinate with other therapists.  They may be allowed to prescribe some drugs, and they can request rehabilitation therapies.  They have some ability to diagnose patients, but lack full authority to treat them.  In the United States, at a minimum, a Nurse Practitioner must have a BS degree in nursing, become a licensed, registered nurse, obtain a graduate (Masters) degree in nursing and then pass a national board certifying exam, and then apply for and pass any additional credentials needed at a state or federal level to be able to prescribe medicine or work in certain fields – such as psychiatry.

**Now we come to psychologists and psychiatrists – the heavyweights of mental health professionals.** 

**A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating mental disorders where the brain itself is not functioning correctly.** They may use psychotherapy in addition to medicine.  They may use blood testing, or imaging systems to determine mental illness, or diagnose a mental disorder by understanding its pathology.  

A psychiatrist understands that clinical depression means that the brain is physically not working correctly.  They understand that people suffering clinical depression or chronic stress actually lose brain mass!  Scary, right?  But medication and treatment can stop the process.  There are some studies that indicate the process can be reversed too.

In the USA and Canada, a psychiatrist must have a doctoral degree, and then have a residency in psychiatry for another four to five years.  They must demonstrate proficiency in several psychotherapies, and have extensive training in diagnosis, pharmacology, and other forms of medical care.  Other countries require approximately the same amount of training.  In the USA and Canada, psychiatrists are licensed medical physicians.

Psychiatrists most often treat issues of the brain or nervous system, which broadly include things like mood disorders (depression, bipolar), perception of reality (delusions, hallucinations), psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, among others), personality disorders (narcissism falls here), and impulse disorders (kleptomania for example).  

This list is not comprehensive, and you should not think that the human brain is well understood.  It was not long ago that psychiatry was no better than “witch doctoring”.  The science of the study of the brain is relatively new.  Within the last 30 years it has made some large gains in understanding how the brain really functions, but there is still a long way to go. 

**A psychologist is someone who uses psychotherapy to help people correct cognitive errors, or to help them with coping skills.** They can help you figure out and cope with those things that influence or trigger you into an unhealthy mental state.

Psychotherapy is the term used for treatment based on dialog and interaction between the treatment provider and the patient.

Like psychiatry, psychology has come a long way in the past 30 years.  Psychoanalyst techniques first pioneered by Sigmund Freud are constantly researched by academic psychologists and psychiatrists, who have found that although some of Freud's ideas are useful, there are a lot of areas where his ideas do not stand up to criticism.  

Academic research in psychotherapy is ongoing, and are providing a lot of data on which techniques work best.  However, there is a history of psychotherapy techniques that are poorly researched, but may still be in use.  

Well researched techniques include treatment such as cognitive / behavioral, or solution focused brief treatment.

Poor techniques barely qualify as psychotherapy, and are based on limited or poor research, or fads, or even pseudoscience.  These techniques include Reiki, attack therapy, and nude therapy.  

So it isn't enough to verify that a psychologist or psychiatrist is trained and licensed, you should also investigate what areas of psychotherapy they use.  When you investigate a psychologist, look for their “Treatment Orientation” or “Treatment Approach” - this is usually where they list the forms of psychotherapy that they use to treat patients.  [There are many different forms of psychotherapy, here is a broad category listing of possible psychotherapies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy#Forms).

Remember, just because a psychologist has a PhD and a license, it doesn't mean that he or she is NOT a quack!  [If they use a pseudo-scientific therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience), run away!

Also, as a patient, you should be somewhat wary of the terms “counseling” and “counselor”.  Many people misuse these terms to imply competence, or a level of training and education that may not exist.
Counseling psychology is an actual psychological specialty that focuses on assisting a person in development and growth, assisting with their interactions with others, and assists with education and career development.  **Counseling psychologists are psychologists who have taken counseling psychology training as part of their degree, or afterward.**  To be licensed as a counseling psychologist in many states a person must receive their doctorate and work at least a year in a full time internship.

Licensed counseling psychologists may offer counseling in areas of marriage, career, or military veteran counseling, among many other areas.  

If you have been referred to a “counselor”, ask about that person's license and training.  You will not be insulting a real counselor by asking for this information.

Finally, what about the stigma of seeing a therapist?  This is where **psychoeducation** comes in.
Psychoeducation is teaching about the disorder.  It is used to destigmatize the disorder and to deal with the emotions of the patient and the patient's friends / family around the disorder.  It is a way of offering assistance and promoting cooperation between mental health professionals and patients, and to give assistance and training in self-help so the patient is better able to manager their mental health.

All mental health professionals practice psychoeducation to some degree.  If you feel like you are going to have a problem explaining things to other people, or if you want your family to understand what you are going through, ask your therapist if they can help you educate them, or if they can recommend someone else for this.

Finally, I'm not a therapist, and I don't have any qualifications in any sort of therapy.  I have been a psychological patient due to depression brought on by my late wife's illness, and her later death.  Therapy allowed me to deal with grief, survivor's guilt, and depression.  

So although I've benefited from therapy, **I may be wrong about some of what I've said here.**  I am also speaking from an American perspective, and other countries may have less or more requirements for their mental health professionals.  Please do your own research!

Also, please feel free to add information from your own country or state.

So like the title says, I've relapsed, relapsed into my negative thoughts again. But I need to get better as my first day of my job is after this independence day weekend. As always if you stick to the post thank you, if not then thank you for clicking, it's a little complicated to make a tl;dr. Sorry :( 

So basically I wanted to talk about my fears about my job, relationships, friends, and fitness.


First and most important, I am starting my job this upcoming Monday. I am scared shitless because I have no idea what will go down as I never got an internship. Second, I will have to fly out of LA for training but I will make another post about that and will ask advice about what to do in that city (it'll be good I promise). About my job, I am scared that the same cycle I have gone through my life will happen again. That is, that I will not make friends or meet people and feel out of place again and continue being a loner. Also I'm scared that this depression or whatever I have may take over me in the future and cause me to be fired (which would be a death sentence since this is the best opportunity for the Beijing l beginning of my career).


Second, I don't know what the fuck is my deal with my obsession in wanting a relationship. I know I'm not ready since I know I might be clingy due to not having a large circle of friends. But then again, when will I ever be ready? I've seen in threads that you should love yourself first and that people can see desperation, etc. But it's so hard when you don't think you're the best shit ever and I think that lying to myself will make me more delusional.


I think that this is caused by the higher testosterone I might be releasing due to lifting and doing two a days at the gym. It makes me horny and desire guys more. But since I know I can't have them, I get angry, jealous, and so on. I feel like a goddamn hormonal teenager full of angst.


That's not all, I'm scared of what dating will be like as well. Aside from all the horrors I've read about, I'm just scared of talking to other guys. Insecurities come alive and I feel like I will abort mission before facing rejection. But I wanna know if I am capable of giving someone a boner and if someone actually wants me. My body wants sex but my thoughts say otherwise. 


Hopefully what I say next won't offend anyone, I'm not slut shaming, trust me I wish I could be having all the sex you are having. But I don't want my first time to be with someone who has a lot of experience. I thought I was going to meet someone like me in college and that we were going to be each other's first experience. I know it sounds delusional but I want that awkward sex. It would be a new experience for both of us, instead of just following someone's lead. But I know that with my people my age, that's like looking for a unicorn, so I have to get used to the idea that it's not going to happen that way unless I start cradle robbing (college students).


Now about friendships, I don't have many and it feels wrong. It also feels wrong that I don't have many male friends. For some reason I seem to connect more with girls than with guys. I also don't have gay friends either. I just wanna change all of this but I know that it is more difficult making friends as an adult since adults are more guarded and just civil to each other for the most part.


Finally about fitness, I am glad to say that I have improved. I gained 8 lbs of muscle in 2 months. I'm back to my original college freshman weight but this time I'm healthy. I'm still 23% bf but I'm still working on perfecting my diet. The only negative thoughts about fitness are that I feel insignificant to the sexy guys at the gym. I know comparing myself to others is wrong but they are reminders that I still have a long way to go to reverse the damage that I have done to my body and I get a little discouraged by it.


On an endnote, today was my second to last day at my university gym and I'm going to miss it. I also wore a tank and shorts. I forgot my belt but my developing bubble butt is preventing my shorts from falling. I'm feeling so hot and sexy right now and I think I had a few stares while walking around campus."
29s614,2,2014-07-03,"After 10 months of unemployment and 4 years of looking for a FULL-TIME job, I finally got an offer... but I feel so sad. (See details)",plipmaster,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/29s614/after_10_months_of_unemployment_and_4_years_of/,"Hi Reddit, 

So this is going to be a longer post, but I'll try to keep things brief.  See the tl:dr for the summary.

I'm a game audio developer.  Sound design, music, implementation, etc.  At least that's what my dream is.  Working to make video games has always been my childhood dream, and multiple career assessments and soul searching have only confirmed my passion for the career.  After being discouraged by un-supporting (and downright insulting) family members about the game industry as a career and my desire to attend Digipen (where I had my heart set on going), I spent a few years at a traditional State University before dropping out to follow my heart and attend an audio technical school.  (vocational program, fast, hands on, real job skills, internships, etc).  I had always been a musician and huge fan of music growing up so doing game audio just made sense.  Thus began my journey into the game industry.  

After school, I was fortunate to receive a game audio internship with a triple A game studio and I really thought I had made it.  I thought it would only be a matter of time before they would hire me full-time and the rest would be history.  Oh how naive I was.  To avoid going off into a whole biography of my last 4 years, it's been pretty much a constant series of layoffs, contract work, more layoffs, contract work, and other typical game industry dysfunction.  I've had gaps of unemployment unable to even find minimum wage work with employers outright telling me I was overqualified, and despite TONS ( and I do mean TONSSSSS) of effort trying to find new game industry work, just nothing has seemed to work out.  I've written so many resumes and cover letters I can probably be a career coach.  I'm networked and job faired till I was blue in the face.  I've spent countless hours learning new skills, making me portfolio and website better, and simply searching for jobs.  Despite all of this, I could simply not find a full-time audio job in the game industry.  

It's surprising really.  4 years in, I've worked a large variety of contracts for all types of games and different sized companies.  I've worked triple A, large publisher, indie, and startup.  I've worked on games on pretty much every platform, including mobile, web, and social games.  I've worked as a lead, and even in one position was essentially an audio director for our project.  All this experience, and it hasn't seemed to help much.  I'm in the same place I was 4 years ago, my life in the wind and still looking every day for new positions.  

So where am I going with all of this?  About a year ago, I started considering new career options.  I was burnt out, I tried so hard to get my full-time gig, but it just wasn't working.  I wanted to marry my girlfriend, put some roots down (did I mention I moved 5 times in the last 4 years for work?  Mostly state to state moves too!), and start a family.  With the instability of the game industry, it just wasn't happening.  So I did all the research over again and settled on pursuing project management, an area I excel in and one of the main reasons I moved into lead roles so quickly.  Most creative types in the game industry as disorganized as hell, I was the anomaly.  I have great communication, organization, and management skills and it only made sense for me to try to move into production or project management.  Those positions would open more doors in all types of industry, as well as provide better job security within the game industry.  Thus my search for project manager or producer roles began.  

After a year of learning, shifting my job hunting priority toward project management, I have my offer.  While quite a terrible lowball offer without great benefits either (it's 60% less than what I made in my last contract role), this was it, my golden opportunity to break into the field of project management. (and yes I tried to negotiate but the employer wasn't budging) There was only one catch.  It was outside of the game industry in an unrelated tech industry.

I accepted the offer, but I feel incredibly sad to be moving away from the game industry.  Not to say that I can't move back into the game industry again at some point, I feel most bad about the sole fact of just giving up.  4 years of hard work chasing my dream, never stopping my search for my full-time game job, and now I'm just letting it go.  On one hand, one might question me as to why the heck I would even want to keep working in the game industry considering how it spat me around.  (And trust me, it's dysfunctional on many levels).  At the end of the day though, this is my childhood dream, my passion in life, a field I see myself doing great things in, and most of all, bringing a great sense of fulfillment because I get to create wonderful experiences for players everywhere.  Too bad I can't find a stable job doing it though!

All and all, my heart has been burdened with the sadness of moving on from the career of my dreams, into a more stable and predictable field. I just wanted to write here to get it off my chest and perhaps feel a little bit better about taking the new job.  I start next Wednesday.  Maybe I'll find my way into the game industry again, who knows. 

tl:dr - After 4 years of chasing my childhood dream of working full-time in the game industry, I am changing careers and recently accepted a job offer outside of the game industry in a new field for better job security and life stability.  I am very sad though because it feels like I'm giving up on my dreams and just tossing them to the side after all the crazy effort I put in and wonderful experience I've obtained.  "
29saki,2,2014-07-03,18 T4F/T - Breaking In The Intern,Gorgeous_Gurl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/29saki/18_t4ft_breaking_in_the_intern/,"I always hated this time of year with a blood boiling passion. 

I worked as the editor-in-chief at the state's biggest newspaper. It was my dream job and came with a myriad of luxuries. I had my own office, my own desk, and I got to manage people on a day-to-day basis. It was heaven. Aside from the late nights there was only one other part of my job that I disliked. And that was hiring interns.

For some reason every year during the summer holidays I was tasked with hiring the new interns. I don't know how or why this job got dumped onto me but every year I had to interview these little assholes. They were always nervous wrecks that worried about making the smallest mistake. Some of them even visibly shook during the interviews. They never had what it takes to make it as a journalist and it meant that my coffee was always disgusting for a few months.

You, however, were the exception this year. Don't get me wrong; you were still a tiny pile of anxieties but there was something you possessed that the other interns didn't. You wore tiny, tight skirts. For the week that you've been here your bubbly ass has been a constant distraction for me and my crew. I've caught the men staring at your behind and even some of the women look out of curiosity or lust. Luckily, they know better. They know about my ""secret"". They know that I get first dips on any new employee.

I called you into my office on this Friday afternoon. I sat behind my large, wooden desk and motioned to the chair in front of it. I would have stood up and ushered you to your seat to get a closer look at your delectable body but my own black skirt was tenting with the lust it had for you. My large breasts, contained within a white blouse, were begging for your attention. Even at 32 they hadn't shown any signs of age.

""Before you sit down."" I begin. ""Could you pick up the pen that's rolled underneath your chair? Thank you sweetie."" I smile."

First, I've read the side bar. I've read the FAQ. I've read searches and testimonies.

My family does very well to take care of my needs: Food, shelter, taxes, insurance, they pay for nearly everything and let me use their car. What a blessing… 

I spent the past two years of College commuting. It was the best decision I’ve made yet. My school is well known and reputable, and totaled to around $10,500 a year. My parents/grandparents took care of most of the tab which I am incredibly grateful for. 

My next two years are going to be closer to $24,000/year since I will be living on Campus to attend the Business School. Between my Father and Grandfather, it sounds like I will be picking up a loan for around $3,500 for this semester, which I intend to just write a check to my dad and have him take care of tuition w/o taking out a loan. With that in consideration, I’ll have close to $12,500 left. 

Now I need a car. I was thinking a Honda Civic. 34mpg, cheap, as plentiful as dirt. Enough said! 

$5,000 on a car, leaving me with $7,500.

I was thinking of starting an IRA and maxing out the $5,500, leaving me with $2,000.

How do this sound /r/personalfinance? Wise decisions? Any critiques?

Also, Vanguard… I’m assuming you believe it would be a good idea for me to open an IRA with them, correct?

29sbip,1,2014-07-03,Do I have a chance with this girl? [text messages screenshot],SmileCasey,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/29sbip/do_i_have_a_chance_with_this_girl_text_messages/,"I met this girl 5-6 weeks ago in a job interview and we went home after exchanging digits. The very same day I asked her for a drink with my friends and she came to the bar. We talked about generic things like what she does and where she is from, and all those goodies. I found out she is Swedish and is studying fashion in a university, and I was about to launch my own small jewellery brand so we had a lot to talk about that night. She was a very sassy woman, used her body and smile like a musical instrument and I was just enchanted, and I couldn't even make a move so we talked, had few drinks, abandoned my friends (they thought we went home together) and went for pizza, and after that went home, and we did our goodbyes on a train with a kiss on the cheek. However, when we first met at the bar with my friends, I complimented straight away with ""You look extremely gorgeous right now"" and she reciprocated with, ""thanks"" and head bob to the side in a shy motion.

We texted each other a lot in the span of next week and decided to meet up again. But it never happened. Not like she didn't wanted to, but she had to fly to Sweden (verified - snapchat pics) to meet her family. So when she came back she asked me if she wanted to go to a fashion show and I said, ""yes"". Then again, she had to go back to Sweden (verified again) to meet her family, however she left the ticket for me at the reception of the apartment building she was staying. I took the ticket from the building and went to the show with a friend of mine.

Again, she wanted to catch up but I had to leave the country to go on a university trip to Africa and Europe. But I promised her before I left that I will get her something from Africa for doing a favour to me (fashion show tickets). Then, when I was in Africa I told her I got a gift for her and it was an ivory necklace. She got super excited, and since then we have been snapchatting and texting each other daily, lot more than before. When I told her I was back in the country, she texted me that she wants to catch up soon. We talk daily but not talk-talk just texting. I am not a texting person, but she does it so I'm okay with it. We snapchat a lot, most of the time its humurous and mischevious chats, but lately she's been snapchatting her full face with captions ""#creep"" with funny face ""#Going to bed now xx"" in her bed and whatnot. I compliment her quite a lot on lil thingds and she does it too.

Now, here's the deal. We have reached the point in texting where we can talk about anything atm, I make fun of her and she does the same in a friendly playful manner. We talk about life, family problems, what her ambitions and goals are, etc. We mostly talk at late evenings after she is done with her internship and Im done with my work. She's 18 and I'm 20.

I have no idea whether she sees me as a friend or a potential boyfriend/lover. Therefore, I am here hoping you guys would shed some light. I really want to make a move, but I'm afraid she will straight up deny it. We are meeting up after 5-6 weeks of not seeing each other so she might not like it. She's going to the beach on Saturday with her friends and couple guy friends, and she was telling how much of a loser her guy friends are because they take so much time to get ready and are not punctual, and tells me how punctual I am and she likes my professionalism blah blah... We tend to have lots of similarities when it comes to preference.

At this point I do not know whether this girl wants the ivory necklace and will ignore me afterwards or she really wants me to make a move. I'm meeting up with her in weeks time and I will give her the necklace on that day. She wants to go for a drink on that day so according to the text messages that we just exchanged what should I do? I think it's this day that I either make or break the relationship. Either I will remain as a friend to her or ...fill in the blanks...

[How did you become a NPR foreign correspondent? Was the position extremely competitive? Does NPR provide a good salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwna6?context=5)|I'm on the record as a 17 year old saying I wanted to be one! For me, it was a combination of work and luck. I studied Russian in high school and college, I was interested in the world, I liked asking questions. I did a bunch of news internships during college summers then worked at a community radio station. A couple years after the Soviet Union fell apart, I felt like I wasn't getting enough information about what was happening there in the newspapers (this was pre-internet). So I went there sans job and got work as a researcher for an American newspaper and did some freelance. Finally the company that I'd been bugging for a job hired me and I started doing radio and TV for lots of programs, including US public media. Eventually I came back, and a few years later got a lucky break pitching a freelance piece to NPR. I was hired as a temp on the Washington desk and applied for the Berlin position a couple years later. Voila! 
[As a female, and a professional how do you find the Middle East? Are you generally accepted everywhere you go, and have you ever been denied access based on your sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw4fp?context=5)|I've not been overtly denied access to anything based on my gender. Although when I did a story on ultra-Orthodox males in the Israeli military, the IDF press people wanted me to bring a guy because I wanted to record ambi around the base and they weren't sure that would be okay. (They brought people to interview into a certain room - and that was okay with them.) But I didn't take a guy and nobody actually on the base cared as I walked around recording. More generally: in conservative societies being female can give me better access than being male - I get to talk to the women bc I'm a woman, and to the men because they are who talk to people. Then in certain situations, I feel like as a western female reporter, I am akin to a creature from outer space. :-)
[What if anything has been the thing that has most questioned if you are in the right profession? for instance witnessing extreme cases of violence of that sort of thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw2pa?context=5)|Well - sometimes in my little room in Jerusalem talking into my mic to myself then sending audio off over the internet it feels like I'm speaking into the void. So I guess one hard part is feeling a bit disconnected from the people I'm in conversation with - you. Violence is a different subject. It can be very wearing. I used to go back to Berlin from Baghdad and look out the window driving home and think about the issues Germans were passionately debating and think: ""you people think YOU have problems???"" Like many reporters I have struggled in situations where I'm there to report, not to help. 
[How much is Israel a religious state? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvry9?context=5)|Hey that's complicated! Clearly it's religious - the rabbinate sets lots of rules about social issues (marriage, etc.) that affect any Jewish person no matter how religious they are individually. Saturday traffic is way, way, way down - more in Jerusalem than Tel Aviv, as it's the Jewish Sabbath and many people don't drive. There is a wide range of how strictly people practice their faith. And there is a strong stream of secular society. And that's just skimming the surface of the Jewish sector of society (about 75%).
[What have you noticed about the public sentiment in Israel regarding the advancement of ISIL, and do you think they expect some sort of U.S. intervention in order to quell the problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvnhv?context=5)|Hi ghawk15, I did some reporting on this a week or so ago. Generally speaking, I found that concern about the ISIL/ISIS/IS in Iraq just ramped up the general concern in Israel about turmoil in the neighborhood. There's a feeling of just keep it out of here ... but in the case of Iraq in particular, it ramps up concern in Israel about the influence of Iran, which is broadly seen as the main potential threat to Israel in the region. I don't think there is a deep expectation in Israel of US intervention, in part because of the US approach in Syria so far. 
[Will this wave of escalation cease or does it feel more like the worst has yet to come?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwvrr?context=5)|I'm not on the ground there right now, but I'll quote what an Israeli friend said to me today: ""It's tense but not out of control yet.""
 |The year I've been there has been relatively calm, but I can count a half a dozen times where at least journalism colleagues and I have wondered if ""this"" will be the trigger to a sustained flare up in violence. Most Palestinians I have talked with in the past year say they don't want a third intifada and don't feel united enough to sustain something like that. 
[Emily, much American coverage of developments in Israel seem to focus on big picture policy. Rarely do I have the opportunity to read pieces that let people speak in their own words about the realities and feelings on the ground. In your work, what do you feel are the average person's perspectives on a two-state solution, and/or the constant state of violence? Thanks in advance. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw6gn?context=5)|Whether the two-state solution is the right solution is being debated among Palestinians and Israelis. Of course, the visions of a one-state solution can look very different - many Palestinians who support one-state envision one state where everyone has equal rights. Some Israelis propose annexing parts of the West Bank that aren't Palestinian cities. Others propose a unilateral withdrawal - a different way to get to two-states than negotiating. But generally polls still show broad support for two-states as the best solution. I'll pull some of my stories that might get at what you're looking for and post them later.
[How does reporting from Jerusalem -- as opposed to, say, Ramallah or Amman or Gaza City -- affect the way you see and cover regional issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw6kt?context=5)|Well, I go to Ramallah, Gaza and Tel Aviv all the time and many other places when stories take me there. (Plus of course I go around just to hike or eat out, etc.) I like being in Jerusalem as opposed to Tel Aviv because it's really where more of the passion for place is and it's right next to the West Bank. I could walk to Bethlehem (that's in the West Bank) for example. So while anywhere you live certainly affects your basic daily experience, getting around is key.
[Big fan!!! What is the most frightening situation you have been in while reporting and how did you mentally deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvnt7?context=5)|That was back in Iraq. I was walking across a bridge outside the Green Zone - going home from an interview. I started imagining what would happen if someone drove up and shot me. (The chance of that was extremely low, by the way!) I wondered if I could survive if I jumped in the river - and then should I swim toward the Green Zone - or would US soldiers shoot? Or away, where I would emerge alone, wet, and bloody? How did I deal with it - just kept walking! 
[Hello Ms Harris. 1st time caller, long time listener. 2 part question. Firstly-do you feel actions that the Presby Church is undertaking in divesting in companies that may support illegal settlement bldg will actually have an effect, or would it be similar to giving sanctions? Secondly-I was in Jerusalem last year and negotiated with a vendor for a rug made of alpaca hair. The price was rather high, but we haggled down to a reasonable amount (60% discount!\). By the end of the 30 minutes of back-and-forth, I opted not to buy the rug as I felt it was an impulse purchase. The man was irate. Would you apologize to him for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwoaj?context=5)|Hi aintnosanityclaus - the divestment/boycott issue is one of those slow trickle things. I've interviewed one person who has been working to lay the legal groundwork for European labeling from products made in settlements, for example, for years. Although the direct economic impact appears quite minimal, I definitely hear Israelis concerned about the potential political impact and Palestinians convinced that this is their next key step in pursuit of statehood. Not sure about comparing divestment to sanctions. As far as the rug, I doubt anyone could win his forgiveness for you! Haggling is fun - but it is a relationship! And those take care anywhere. 
[Is it as violent as the media says it is? How often do you find yourself in a dangerous situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw5xi?context=5)|It can be extremely violent and deadly and much of that is very localized. Meaning if you're not there you don't know it. Some of the confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians are relatively predictable - Fridays is often a day when confrontations happen - and often in the same place, for example. So you can go find it. But other times - all bets and predications are off. 
[Are there stories about Israel and Palestine that go unreported or maybe lost in the overall narrative of the reporting that comes out of there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw9zd?context=5)|For sure there are. Here is an interesting piece I hadn't realized before I went there though. Many Israelis and Palestinians want to stick to a basic narrative they see as advancing their ""side."" So one challenge is actually getting beyond that - getting deeper in an interview - finding the cracks in their own shells of narrative threads.  
[What do you think about the situation about those three teenage boys and what do you think is the resolution to the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvsg6?context=5)|This is the first serious flare up in tensions since I moved there a year ago. One thing very interesting to me is the emotions around it; also how political agendas are folded around an event like this. I don't know what the resolution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is. Sometimes it seems really simple, other days, impossible! 
[Hi Emily! Could you speak more to the struggle reporters have with being there to tell the story rather than be a part of the story (""there to report, not to help""\)? I've always viewed public service and public media as partners in promoting a common good, and I imagine many at NPR feel the same way. Yet as a journalist you separate yourself from the story in order to report it. How do reporters deal with wanting to promote positive change, but not being able to in a direct way? Do reporters ever come in and out of public media from policy/grassroots activism positions? Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimxfpv?context=5)|Actually, I am not sure all or most or maybe even many reporters want to promote anything specific, or that they would agree on the common good. For me personally, I think the best thing about this job is the chance to try to understand and illuminate where and why people disagree on things and also where they agree (even if they may not realize that themselves.) Also explore new ideas. Some reporters do switch to advocacy work. My former colleague Sarah Chayes did that in Afghanistan after reporting on the war. 
[Are you related to Ed Harris? What flavor of ice cream is the best in Israel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw39a?context=5)|Ed Harris - maybe! There are a lot of us Harrises out there! Most interesting ice cream I've had is the chewy ice cream in Ramallah. Best topping - shredded halva. Available on any Israeli grocery shelf!
[How is the Israeli public sentiment about an offensive against Palestine right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvxst?context=5)|I'm not there right now - so I can't give you first hand reporting on that. One interesting thing about Israeli public sentiment is that it is usually split on anything.
[Ms. Harris, given the recent development of Israel importing Kurdish oil through Turkey do you see the possibility for a triangular relationship that could bring some stability to the region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwwcl?context=5)|Stability - not sure. Israel has long been supportive of Kurdish independence, which others in the region strongly do not support.  
[I know it is a basic tenant of ethical journalism, but how do you report on issues without personal? I would think this must be very difficult especially considering what you have seen and experienced firsthand.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvtdp?context=5)|My main goal is to get the voices of the people I interview heard clearly and in context. Excellent bonus to work in radio!

29scrz,1,2014-07-03,"17 inch or larger, hardcore gaming laptop, $2000 budget",downfosho_homie,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/29scrz/17_inch_or_larger_hardcore_gaming_laptop_2000/,"Hey guys, just for starters, this is my first post as I've never had an official account before. But I truly need some help here.

As stated in the title, I am looking for a strong gaming laptop that is at or above a 17 inch screen, kept within a $2000 price range. I'd like to not spend all that on a laptop but I will if there's an extraordinary good one. Now for some details.

I've always been a gamer, but as of a few months ago, I sold my MacBook in order to help pay for a new laptop, the new msi gs70-stealthpro -024. After roughly a month of use, I am finding that I am having trouble with drivers and what I believe to be the graphics card. I've gotten two errors, one with the graphics card taking a crap and the other with drivers not cooperating with each other pretty much. Also, I had ano issue with charging it the second time I turned it on and after talking with an msi rep, he suggested returnin it. After paying $1799 for this, I thought it would be everything I was looking for and more. Oh and also if anyone is wondering, the laptop is pretty nice except for these issues, and my only nit pick is that the TouchPad feels super cheap. 

Anyways, sorry for the paragraph, but I'm looking to play graphics intensive games such as watchdogs, skyrim, far cry 3, etc. Games such as those. I want a laptop because I need it for portability to friends houses and to college. I would like 16gb of ram if possible, and aside from that, I'm looking for quality and performance. I know laptops get excessively hot, but if one had a great cooling system, that would also be appreciated. 

I've heard good things about msi and this almost made me be finished with them, but if they are a suggestion, I'll try once more. 

Please only have serious answers as I am also looking myself, but I'd like to get one ASAP to be able to play and communicate with friends during my internship. 

I thank everyone in advanced! "
29sfre,1,2014-07-03,Weird sudden onset of persistent foggy feeling and headaches,Chilldude12321,medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/29sfre/weird_sudden_onset_of_persistent_foggy_feeling/,"Ima a 20 yo college male. 
Younger life was very healthy, I work out consistently, drink some beers and do well at school. 
I've had Ct scans and MRIs all come back normal.
Last summer I started an internship in a new city as a computer programmer, at the end of the first week I started having trouble with my short term memory. I would hear a name and fogey it instantly. On the Friday I could not remember the project I did on Wednesday without thinking very very hard for 20 minutes.
I went out that weekend, bumped my head minorly against a wall(no bump) that Friday night. Blacked out completely ( I remember what happened before and after the head bump just later I blacked out. Next day I was really hungover and anxious in a bad mood. Went out the next night felt alright Sunday. I'm the office the second week the memory problems turn into me being confused over relatively basic things, got into debates and realized that I agreed with the other person and just didn't understand what they were saying. Started having trouble with articulation. End of week 2 tried to memorize 3 bullet points and it took 1 hour. All of the other interns looked at me as the dumb one(I am not I have a 4 gpa at a top 10 school. Went to the hospital told I had a complex migraine, remember feeling very anxious at the hospital. Symptoms kinda of got better the next week  continued going out on weekends. Around late July I drank a lot one night and the next day I smoked weed during the day and had a panic attack that night and couldn't sleep(probably smoked a total of 2 other times that summer, used to smoke a lot with no problems). From here I stopped drinking, had one beer early august and felt pretty out of it. Diagnosed with post concussion syndrome (didn't get it because symptoms started before extremely minor head injury). Went back to school, would sleep 10+ hours a day tried to drink mid October  felt very out of it for a week. This whole time I feel some foginess and headaches that come and go but never feel sharp. Around late November I start feeling clear and normal again and it's a total relief. Do well on finals start slowly drinking again over winter break and I feel fine. After a week of heavy beer drinking I contract mono and strep late January spend a week sleeping and recovering, make a recovery hold off on drinking for the time being. Get a stomache bug early February, start throwing up and everything go to the hospital cause my abdomen hurts have a panic attack on the way, get anti naseuas and morphing and feel fine. Start drinking mid February and feel fine. Late march I bump my head on the side don't drink the next few days feel fine. Then go out for the weekend, took a Xanax one day for fun (I know it was dumb and not fun) then on Sunday start feeling the fog again. Stop drinking again (except for 2 days mid may) and generally feel foggy and have some headaches. I am sleeping a lot during this time 10+ hours a day. Go home for two relaxing weeks at home and feel foggy but not terrible  the whole time except one migraine . Move to the city for another programming internship more migraines. see a concussion neuro who tells me I never had a concussion and something else was causing my symptoms are cause by something else and my anxiety about them is exacerbating them. Drink that weekend feel miserably hungover off about 6 drinks. See an internist who gives me a blood panel of everything (mono nutrients lyme celiac) all negative only low vit d. This whole time whenever I feel foggy really bad which happens everyday at work, I also get kinda faint and lightheaded along with slight slight numbness on my rough side normally gets bad around 2 or 3 and continues. 
So at this point the internist tells me it's all in my head.
It's definitely not I feel genuinely confused and out of it for no apparent reason. My anxiousness about my health many times makes it worse I'll admit but the initial foggy faintness and head come out of ok where.
At this point I'm starting to feel pretty depressed like this will never end I'm looking for answers and can't sift through all the crap online(ironic I'm post here now ik)
I've  stopped eating gluten as a test but I have no clue what's wrong with me in general and would like to figure it out. I'm about to quit my internship because I'm so out of it most of the day I can't do the work and worry about what's wrong and just want to take a nap. Most of this time the only way for me to feel any relief is to sleep which I obviously can't do at work.
Anyone experience anything similar or have any ideas/positive ideas??
Thank you so much for reading this"
29shpj,1,2014-07-03,Quick question about clinical hours,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/29shpj/quick_question_about_clinical_hours/,"I am currently a rising junior and am planning to take the MCAT fairly soon.

However, I don't have any clinical volunteering or shadowing hours yet. I am trying to get some shadowing opportunities for this summer but don't think I will be able to do much. The problem is my schedule. I am working an unpaid internship 40hrs/week and am tutoring ~6hrs/week on the side. I am almost done with the EMT-B certification (all I need to do is take the written exam) and will hopefully be able to volunteer for the local EMS service. 

My other EC's include: 

* Research: 4 years in the same lab with 1 national award, 2 third author pubs, 1 first author pub, and coauthorship on several abstracts (my PI was very supportive and tried to get me involved in many projects in the lab). 

* Fencing

* Peer Tutor/TA for intro science courses

* IT Helpdesk/Computer center manager

* SAT/High School Tutor

* Writing for student run publications

* Non-clinical volunteering for a nonprofit at school/Student Support Network member

My aim is to apply to MD/PhD programs or research heavy schools.

Would it be better to plan a gap year so that I can get some clinical experience? I can't get shadowing/clinical volunteering during the school year as my college is around 40 mins away from the nearest hospital/clinic and I don't have reliable access to a car. A bus is avaliable, but a one way commute takes ~2 hours.

I've been dating this girl for over three years, I love her deeply, and we have been living together for most of our relationship.  We recently went through a rough patch and broke up briefly.  After we sorted out our feelings and what we wanted out of one another we got back together.  I can say with certainty that I love her, and I'm writing this with a very heavy heart.  I just don't know what to do.

I cook a lot, I do a lot of cleaning, I do the laundry and the dishes primarily.  It's just doesn't seem to matter though, she thinks she does way more than I do though.  She vacuums every day, but she says she cleans the bathroom and shower all the time, which just isn't true.  Mostly she just plays games on her phone and on the computer and then goes to work.  


She resents me because she doesn't think I pay my fair share of the rent/utilities.  I'm currently a student, with a part time job and an internship so my income is just very limited.  I give what I can, I buy groceries and pay for dinner as much as I am able, but it just doesn't seem to be enough for her.  She has told me many times she feels I'm taking advantage of her.  


She hates her body because she's overweight, I've tried to work out with her many times.  She just doesn't workout unless I'm breathing down her neck to do so.  I love helping her workout, but she shows zero initiative or interest in doing so.  Then she will get frustrated she isn't losing weight and gets mad at me for not pushing her hard enough.  It is very frustrating.  


I don't want to give the impression it's all bad.  She is very generous when she can afford to be.  We have a ton of mutual interests, we have very similar world views on the vast majority of important issues.  She's very smart even if not especially motivated.  She is a wonderful home maker, I love her sense of style.  I love our talks, I love just spending time with her.  I love our sex, and the life we have built together.  I feel like she has made me a better person, and god damn it I love the hell out of her, and I know she loves me too.  I could see spending the rest of my life with this woman, but I feel like she is just never happy with me.

**tl;dr**: Does this sound like a healthy relationship to you?  Am I over reacting or do you think my grievances are legitimate?"

My parents claim me as a dependent.  I'm going to be at the company for 15 weeks and then I will go back to school.  I don't work during school at all, so I won't have another job until next summer.  Going off my first paycheck, I should gross roughly $16500 while I'm at the position.

When I looked at my paystub, however, I noticed my taxes were incredibility high.  32% of my gross income was going to taxes.  That seemed really high to me, so I went online and found out about the W4 form.

I then went to the IRS withholding calculator, filled out all of the information, and it told me to put 10 allowances on my W4 form.  My parents are telling me that is way too high.  What should I do?  I'd like to have as much money in my pocket as possible when I go back to school, but I also don't want to withhold too little and get in trouble with the IRS."

But now after a lot of stress, phone calls, and applications, I managed to get myself a part time job. And I managed to get myself an internship offer for my major. My financial situation is looking great right now because I'll definitely have enough money to get through the week and more than enough to save up. And my career situation is looking great as well because I need these internship hours before I graduate (the pay is a nice bonus). I'm feeling great in this department. I'm progressing and making advances in my life. I'm also starting to see some noticeable results from gyming for a month straight so far. My arms are definitely more shaped, and my chest is too. I can definitely make more gains but as of now my physical condition is pretty good.

The problem is... the only thing I can't lock down is my dating life. I've been trying, I've been putting in the effort, I just can't make a break through though. These girls just don't reciprocate what I bring out. I've gone through a lot of approaches. I really want to succeed, and I'll definitely put in the effort, but why must my dating life be so hard for me to get under control?

Just a note here I don't actually know if this is the right subreddit to post this at... (it not perhaps /r/linuxadmin?) Anyway, my back story: I just started a position as an IT intern at a company and would like to learn how to use a linux server (commands and applications of a server) as well as host some games for my friends and I to play on. Here are my goals:

1. Purchase a Domain name.
2. Install a flavor of linux (stuck between CentOS, Ubuntu Server, and Debian Server). I don't actually know which flavor is better for dedicated hosting. I guess something low profile.
3. Set up two game servers that will run on the same server IP but on two different ports, then point to the dedicated servers using sub domains.

So what I really need help with is choosing one of the server flavors to run two dedicated servers and hopefully set up support for FTP and SSH. I am current unsure if you can actually run two (game) servers on one IP, each server with its own port. (The games are Minecraft and 7 Days to Die, if you were wondering).

Any help with this would be great, also would using a control panel like Webadmin or CPanel be better for remotely controlling linux commands and accessing files, rather than using SSH and FTP? Thanks for your help and please tell me if I'm in the wrong place for this kind of post!"
29srg4,3,2014-07-03,I think I want to open up a movie theater.,PRGrl718,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/29srg4/i_think_i_want_to_open_up_a_movie_theater/,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

**TL;DR:** I had an epiphany and I want to open a movie theater to fill this hole in my heart. 

I have the biggest fascination with movies. I watch movies like there's no tomorrow. It sincerely is my passion. Ever since I was around 9 or 10, I knew I wanted something to do with television and film. Since I was young, I've always wanted to pursue something in acting/directing/editing/writing/production. Those dreams have always been hindered by my mom because she didn't think I'd be able to make anything of myself or a living for that matter. When I wanted to go to a high school in the city for performing arts, I was told no. When I wanted to join the performing arts club at my school, she wouldn't let me. When I wanted to apply to film schools, she said she wouldn't pay tuition. When I wanted to originally have my major as something in TV and film, she refused and refused and refused. For the past few years I've always done small films, writing scripts and plots in notebooks, but I always ended up deleting or throwing them out because what the fuck was I gonna do with them.

I was better off with an office job or working for the government according to her. My first semester of college, I was a forensic science major. I absolutely suck at and hate math and science. I took on a load of 18 credits and I failed chemistry and biology. I went back home, ""spoke"" about my options with my mom, and she finally decided it was okay for me to look into another major - more specifically a television and film major. I hadn't officially switched majors when I got back my second semester, but I did speak with my adviser who gave me the names of professors in the department I should speak to. I met with three of them separately and they were very happy to have me join their school of communications and acknowledged me for reaching out to them about this decision. That semester, I took courses better suited for a TV and film major and aced every class.

When I came home after finals, I received letters in the mail from my university that because of how poorly I had done cumulatively, my scholarships and grants would be taken away. I had to write three separate appeals to get them back. I got one grant back in time for the fall semester, the second one would not be given to me until the spring semester if my grades were up to par, and the third would not be given to me until the fall semester of the next year. Tuition was *extremely* expensive and I was not about to take out more loans. I spent the rest of the summer in extreme stress, reapplying to other schools. One school by me had accepted me and it took a very long and unprofessional amount of time for them to get all my paperwork done. I had everything completed and handed in in the middle of July. They told me to come in a certain date so I could be registered for that fall semester. I went, security at the booth told me the school was closed on that date and to come back the next day. So I did. When I went back to register, I was told I was a day late for the fall semester and I wouldn't be able to register until spring. Of course I was livid. To make a long-story-inside-an-already-long-story short, I was able to register for the spring, but now I'm a semester behind. I took up a communications major.

During those few months (June-December), my brother had hooked me up with an internship in the city at a huge casting production company. My boss was actually my neighbor from across the street whom I haven't really spoken to in years since (because of age difference and I was never really that social with the kids on the block). It was an awesome six months and I wish I was there longer.

I have been looking for a job for close to a year. Even during my internship, I scoured my area for places hiring. I even reapplied to many of these places. I finally got a job about two weeks ago waiting tables, which I absolutely suck at and I'm still learning. I'm still applying to other places in hopes I get a better offer.

Now. For some reason last night, I don't even remember what made me think of it, but I just had this wild idea pop into my head. *""Why not open up a movie theater?""* It's not like I'd be able to pursue a career in the industry itself anymore, I'm way too late for that. I love movies and everything about them. And I think this is really what I want to do. But I just don't know how. I've been thinking about it since last night and it's so stressful. Obviously this is not something I can do on my own within the next year, but I am shooting for within the next ten years to have this up and running.

How much money would I have to save? Location? How big? What kind of movies do I show, film/digital? How much do I charge for tickets and amenities? How do I go about hiring people? And a bunch of legal things like taxes and stuff. I'm only 19. I'm still a kid in some sense. How do I even go pursuing such a thing?"
29sxtw,19,2014-07-04,Diagnosed and medicated for two years now...,DrewciferCDXX,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/29sxtw/diagnosed_and_medicated_for_two_years_now/,"Prior to my official diagnosis, I was in rough shape.  I was rapid cycling.  My emotions were completely out of control.  I would start crying for no reason.  I would become extremely angry for reasons only I could understand.  I had social anxiety.  I was incredibly paranoid.  I was convinced that there were people out to hurt me, and I was afraid ""they"" were going to hurt my daughter as a way of getting to me.  I thought my condo association was intentionally driving down property values so they could sell us out to land developers (I still think there was some validity in that, but that's neither here nor there).  Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, that was my mantra.  I was making my wife and daughter miserable with my easy irritability and wild mood swings.

I began to suspect I was bipolar, but I was uninsured, and I felt like there were no options available to me.  I heard that one of the local universities was doing a study on bipolar individuals, so I called  and poured my heart out to some poor intern for close to an hour.  She said to forget the study and get some serious help.  She gave me the number to the state's crisis and access line.  I called them and repeated my story.  They pointed me in the right direction.

It turned out there was a state-run clinic that low-income people like me could use.  It would cost me little to nothing to use.  I went in as a walk-in the next day and saw a triage nurse.  After spending an hour with her, she set me up with an appointment for a pdoc.  Due to the heavy volume of people that they see, I had to wait a month to see a pdoc.  Just knowing I had a light at the end of the tunnel kept me going during the interim.

The other thing that helped was this subreddit.  I began lurking on here and getting some of the basic terminology down.  I went to my first pdoc appointment knowing what I needed to tell him, thanks to this sub.

He diagnosed me with BPII and put me on several meds.  I can't remember what those first scripts were, but they didn't seem to help much.  I saw him a month later and a month after that, and he was finally able to come up with a cocktail that seemed to work, more or less.

I'm currently on 90mgs of Paxil, 20 mgs of Wellbutrin, 20 mgs of Zyprexa and 15mgs of Trileptal (I take that for my epilepsy--yep, I'm all kinds of brain-damaged).

These days, I'm basically feeling meh.  But I feel a lot better off than I was.  I can function in a crowd of people.  I can work without the slightest thing sending me into a breakdown.

While I don't feel ""well"", I feel functional.  The suicidal thoughts still pop up every now and again. (I was just looking at the ceiling fan in my bedroom and wondering if it could hold my weight...).  I can sleep at night now, instead of being awake stressing over everything.

I do want to thank the people on this sub for helping me understand my condition and for letting me know that I'm not alone in this struggle.  I don't post much, but I lurk almost every day.  I learn something new about the disorder every day.  I want to thank you guys for being here.  You've helped a lot.

I remember saying two years ago that if I ever were to become stable, I'd like to help others in the same boat as me.  I'm still struggling, but I'm in a lot better shape than I was.  I'm going to try to give back to this sub at least a fraction of what I've gotten out of it (and still getting).

Again, thank you for your help.  It's a constant struggle, but at least I know I'm not alone.  "
29t2bv,4,2014-07-04,Can use some help/advice regarding my potentially pregnant girlfriend,GoingToNeedHelp,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/29t2bv/can_use_some_helpadvice_regarding_my_potentially/,"So to not make this a long post, going to try to condense it as much as possible. 

Both 19 years old.

1. Had protected sex with a condom on June 13.

2. Said she was supposed to have her period around June 20th, but she tends to have irregular cycles. The entire time that we've been dating (3 years), there has never really been a truly set cycle, but then again, I am a guy so I do not know everything about periods.

3. Still has not gotten her period to this day. 

4. Looked up some factors that can delay a period and well here is some more info: not feeling stressed / eating fine / moved across the coast for an internship / with 3 other girls as roommates / sleeping fine

5. From what I kinda know, she has not really had any symptoms too alarming (I guess?). Today she mentioned some back pains and something along the lines of stomach pains. No other signs of pregnancy even though they should show up if she is pregnant (since it has been nearly 3 weeks past the last day of sex right?)

Mentioned the possibility of putting her on birth control, but have not looked too much into it. Have not discuss what we would do in the event that she is pregnant (should probably do that). Plan to wait another week for her period then get a pregnancy test (is that too long?)

Kind of worrying right now since I am not exactly there to be with her to assess and fix this situation. Anyone experience similar problems that can help?"
29t3m2,6,2014-07-04,ITP graduated FRUSTRATED here.,laursss,ASLinterpreters,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASLinterpreters/comments/29t3m2/itp_graduated_frustrated_here/,"A little background here, I graduated from a 4 year bachelors ITP in May 2012... during my time in school I took and passed the NIC written exam and completed an internship with an agency and an educational internship as well at a middle school during my coursework. Everything SEEMED like it was going as planned, and of course life got in the way, and I was unable to get license in the state I graduated (Kentucky) immediately after graduation because of some personal problems that pretty much took up my entire year of 2012. In January of 2013 I moved to Texas as had thought that I would move there- get my license and start working... but I was concerned with the fact that I had pretty much little to no interpreting practice or experience for the year of 2012. I registered to take the written portion of the BEI test (the cert test that everyone in Texas who is not NIC certified has to take to be able to work) and was put on a 3 month waiting list to take the written portion. Fast forward a bit- took the written portion of that cert in June of 2013 and waited another 60 days to receive notification that I had passed and was eligible to take the performance portion of the test. I applied for that- waited the 30-60 day window to be scheduled for a performance test appointment (at this point it is about October 2013) and I am informed that the next avaliable testing time is Feb 2014. I accept that time and wait and wait and then they tell me that the testing has been moved to March or April but they don't know yet and they will let me know ASAP. I FINALLY took the BEI performance exam on April 22, 2014. At this point I was not feeling very confident about my skills and there was very little study material available for me to go on... but I took the webinar they suggested and practiced the ONE study scenario they gave on the study guide countless times. Since it is not legal to work without this cert or national cert in Texas, I have NO experience from the entire time I have lived here. This coupled with the 30% pass rate of the performance exam.... I received my results for the test today.... I failed. Honestly not surprised. According to the BEI regulations I must wait 6 months from the test date to retake the exam. 

SO. Here I am right at two years from graduation and still have not interpreted a day in the ""real world."" I have gained no experience and my skills are frankly dropping (obviously.) I do not want to give up on being an interpreter, but I am extremely frustrated. I am thinking my next step should be trying my hand at NIC performance exam since I have already taken the written (passed in 2011 I believe... so I really need to take before 2015 to avoid having to take the written again.) I am thinking one) this BEI test is flawed in some ways, since it's pass rate is only 30% (however I do realize the NIC test pass rates aren't really any better) and two) at this rate with all the applying and waiting around for dates and then waiting to retake etc that Texas has in place it will be WELL into 2015 before I am working as an interpreter and that's IF I can pass the BEI test in six months. How is one supposed to gain experience and get feedback on skills if I am unable to work at all? There is no ""provisional"" license or anything in Texas to work with like there is in most other states. Should I move out of the state? Should I give up? Interpreting is the only profession I honestly WANT to do.... and I have a natural skill at it. I have been signing since I was 12 years old. All throughout my ITP my peers were always telling me how they wish they were as fluent as me.... all of my colleagues in my internships gave me mostly praise and everyone seems to agree that I was born to be an interpreter. BUT I feel like I am being cock blocked to the extreme. I admit, my skill is NO WHERE near what it was the day I finished my internship.... but I am running out of ideas on where to go from here. I'm confident that if I were able to work on a regular basis I would blossom. Would going ahead and shooting for the NIC be a mistake? my confidence has suffered a huge blow from the past year I have WASTED trying to get this damn BEI certification. 

Any advice? Suggestions? What would your next step be? "

29ta1e,0,2014-07-04,"How do I [M,20] make a move with this girl[F,20]? *Pics Included*",SmileCasey,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/29ta1e/how_do_i_m20_make_a_move_with_this_girlf20_pics/,"I met this girl 5-6 weeks ago in a job interview and we went home after exchanging digits. The very same day I asked her for a drink with my friends and she came to the bar. We talked about generic things like what she does and where she is from, and all those goodies. I found out she is Swedish and is studying fashion in a university, and I was about to launch my own small jewellery brand so we had a lot to talk about that night. She was a very sassy woman, used her body and smile like a musical instrument and I was just enchanted, and I couldn't even make a move so we talked, had few drinks, abandoned my friends (they thought we went home together) and went for pizza, and after that went home, and we did our goodbyes on a train with a kiss on the cheek. However, when we first met at the bar with my friends, I complimented straight away with ""You look extremely gorgeous right now"" and she reciprocated with, ""thanks"" and head bob to the side in a shy motion.

We texted each other a lot in the span of next week and decided to meet up again. But it never happened. Not like she didn't wanted to, but she had to fly to Sweden (verified - snapchat pics) to meet her family. So when she came back she asked me if she wanted to go to a fashion show and I said, ""yes"". Then again, she had to go back to Sweden (verified again) to meet her family, however she left the ticket for me at the reception of the apartment building she was staying. I took the ticket from the building and went to the show with a friend of mine.

Again, she wanted to catch up but I had to leave the country to go on a university trip to Africa and Europe. But I promised her before I left that I will get her something from Africa for doing a favour to me (fashion show tickets). Then, when I was in Africa I told her I got a gift for her and it was an ivory necklace. She got super excited, and since then we have been snapchatting and texting each other daily, lot more than before. When I told her I was back in the country, she texted me that she wants to catch up soon. We talk daily but not talk-talk just texting. I am not a texting person, but she does it so I'm okay with it. We snapchat a lot, most of the time its humurous and mischevious chats, but lately she's been snapchatting her full face with captions ""#creep"" with funny face ""#Going to bed now xx"" in her bed and whatnot. I compliment her quite a lot on lil thingds and she does it too.

Now, here's the deal. We have reached the point in texting where we can talk about anything atm, I make fun of her and she does the same in a friendly playful manner. We talk about life, family problems, what her ambitions and goals are, etc. We mostly talk at late evenings after she is done with her internship and Im done with my work. She's 18 and I'm 20.

I have no idea whether she sees me as a friend or a potential boyfriend/lover. Therefore, I am here hoping you guys would shed some light. I really want to make a move, but I'm afraid she will straight up deny it. We are meeting up after 5-6 weeks of not seeing each other so she might not like it. She's going to the beach on Saturday with her friends and couple guy friends, and she was telling how much of a loser her guy friends are because they take so much time to get ready and are not punctual, and tells me how punctual I am and she likes my professionalism blah blah... We tend to have lots of similarities when it comes to preference.

At this point I do not know whether this girl wants the ivory necklace and will ignore me afterwards or she really wants me to make a move. I'm meeting up with her in weeks time and I will give her the necklace on that day. She wants to go for a drink on that day so according to the text messages that we just exchanged what should I do? I think it's this day that I either make or break the relationship. Either I will remain as a friend to her or ...fill in the blanks...

29tcej,62,2014-07-04,"My Supervisor Had One Crazy, Unexplained Incident When She Was A Teenager.",methodwriter85,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/29tcej/my_supervisor_had_one_crazy_unexplained_incident/,"I've been working as an intern in a state park with my supervisor, Katie, for the past couple of weeks. Today, we had a discussion that turned into the paranormal, and she told me about something that happened when she was a teenager. She tries to debunk crazy things that have happened, but this is one she hasn't been able to do.

It was the summer after she graduated from high school, sometime in the second half of the 1990's. She was 18 at the time. Her friend Billy was a few years older, but still lived with his mother in their house. This was in a small city in Western Maryland, and Billy's house had just enough land that he could throw raging, day-to-night summer parties complete with bonfires. At the same time, they weren't totally isolated, and random people from the surrounding neighborhoods would show up to his parties all the time.

One day, Billy met this skater kid named Nick at a park one morning, and being a social animal guy, Billy invited him to hang out with him at his house. Billy probably also took some pity on Nick, because Nick told him he was a runaway who was living at the park. They would basically play video games, go on rides,  and party 'til late at night. Nick started showing up every day at Billy's house, knocking on the door at 7 a.m. sharp and engaging him in the morning-til-night drinking. He was about 16, with dark eyes and dark spiky hair (remember, this was the 90's), and seemed fairly normal and everything except for a couple of things. The first was that he always wore the same thing- a plain t-shirt and a pair of camo-print cargo shorts. Despite the fact that he was sleeping at a park, his clothes always looked clean. The second is that he was never seen eating or going to the bathroom, despite the fact that Nick was drinking heavily with Billy. Finally, oddly enough, no one remembers actually feeling Nick's skin- even my supervisor, who had sat next to him in a car during a road trip.

She hung out with Billy and Nick at Billy's house two times, and each time she and her friend felt like something was very ""off"" with Nick, especially when he would give off this laugh that just sounded very evil and maniacal. He also seemed to get kookier and weirder when they went on a road trip and got further away from Billy's city. Nick would also never shut up about his father's gun collection.

Finally, Billy's hospitality reached its limits- after two weeks of waking Billy up at 7 a.m. to go party, Billy snapped at Nick. He told Nick that he was waking up his mother trying to sleep, and that he's been hanging out at his house all day and night for two weeks straight and that he really just needs to come back later. Nick never showed up again.

Billy came to Katie, a little bit later, with a newspaper article. It was about Nick, who had apparently killed himself. Billy was originally upset because he felt like he must've put Nick over-the-edge when he kicked him out, until he checked the dates.

Nick had killed himself with his father's shotgun over two weeks ago, before Billy had met him. He had escaped from the mental asylum his parents had put him in that was located in Billy's town, got to his father's house and shot himself with his father's gun.

 Katie has tried to come up with logical reasons for why this happened. The most logical one was that they screwed up the dates in the newspaper and Nick had indeed killed himself right after his talk with Billy, but two weeks? That's a huge discrepancy.

What gets me about this is that I've never heard of a smart haunting that was apparently so strong that it could manifest itself as a solid human form, enough that it could fool people into thinking he was a person, for that long. I mean, I've hard of ghosts ""saying goodbye"" right after their death, but nothing that sounds like that. And there's the fact that he interacted with a a lot of people, not just my supervisor and her friend. He was acknowledged by other people who came into Billy's house, not just Billy and Katie.

Have any of you, or people you know, had a long, sustained smart haunting like that? I'd love to hear any.

Edited: I talked to my supervisor again and changed the details that I got wrong, like where this took place and the like.

Quick background, pt was paraplegic, long term colostomy and severe scoliosis of the spine. He had come in from a nursing home, sepsis of unknown origin. The consultant suspected a pressure wound, and I helped roll the patient. The consultant apparently found one on the patients sacrum. He even ordered a photographer to take a picture of it, common practice where I work if the Nursing home is suspected of neglect. Afterwards he wanted me to dress the wound. I hadnt seen the wound at this point.

I helped the photographer a little while later by once again rolling the patient. Photo taken, I went to dress the wound about ten minutes later.

I couldn't find it. All I could find was atrophied butt muscles, strange anatomy due to scoliosis, and after years of a colostomy there was a horribly degraded, loose and wound like looking...

I realised it was the guys anus and promptly told all the nurses at the nurses station who laughed their heads off. At which point the blown up A4 photo of the guys bumhole arrived to go in the notes, setting off more laughter. I then had to contact the intern to pass on the message to the consultant. I finished by writing my favorite line ever in a progress note: 

""on closer inspection it was the patients anus. Medical team informed""
 Maybe you had to be there, but it still makes me laugh.

-----

Hi, Carpal Tunnel Slut here. Some of you may remember me from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/28ndh4/19_f4a_as_punishment_my_master_is_making_me/) I submitted a little less than 2 weeks ago. 

First off, I'd link to thank you for making that post more popular than I ever anticipated, even if the amount of PMs I was getting started to scare the shit out of me (and made my pussy wet, of course - but let's keep that between us).

Anyways, I admit I did fall short of my promise of keeping up with *every* responder and for that I am sorry but I hope you'll understand when I explain my situation. 

I am also sorry that it took me so long to write this update but I have been very busy this last week trying to cram a whole lot of stuff into a too small amount of time and also my life is potentially about to change in a very big way and I have been preparing for that like crazy (I'll touch a bit on that towards the end).

For the sake of context and review, I think it's best I start at beginning:

I have been dating my Master for about 2 years and have been officially collared by him for about a year (he is around my age, a tad older). About 2 months ago he left for a 4 month trip abroad, trying to secure a better future for us. I am very thankful for all his hard work but I was also left at home with an over active libido and a seemingly unbearable amount of sexual frustration.

My master has been going out of his way to dirty chat with me and give me what sexual attention he can. He even bought me a rather expensive magic wand vibrator right before he left (but I don't have access to it unless he grants it - and he has a rather ingenious way of ensuring that). However, and I'm sure most girls who have been forced into a long distance situation can attest to this, there is just no replacement for the fulfillment that in person physical intimacy and, in my case, domination and discipline can provide.  For over the last month every dream I've had has been explicitly sexual in nature, and I would too often catch my mind wandering, as well as my hands. I love my toys but I'd trade them all in a instant to be fucked by my master's cock just once.

All of this frustration culminated in a bitchy, passive aggressive rant to my master the day before I posted here. I was very rude and ungrateful, saying that he owed me more attention and needed to dirty chat me more often. Now communication is very important to my master, and he is always more than happy to hear honest feedback from me, in fact he demands it. But he also demands that I show him the proper respect when doing so, and it is in that regard I failed.

All throughout my tantrum my master remained very calm and polite (which made me even angrier until I eventually settled down). The confrontation ended with my master promising me that I would soon have more than enough dirty chatting soon. Hearing him say that, I felt smug and satisfied, like my brattiness had paid off. I went to bed a smirk on my face.

Come the next day and... damn. Turns out my master was not pleased with my behavior the night before (rightly so), but he certainly did live up to his promise of making sure I had more than enough dirty chatting. He ordered me to post here as punishment, and that's what led to [my first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/28ndh4/19_f4a_as_punishment_my_master_is_making_me/) (now would probably be a good time to read that if you haven't already). 

The experience of responding to your PMs was intense beyond compare. Being familiar with this subreddit, I knew I would swamped with PMs but I had no idea just how many - my post proved rather popular. My Master told me I would be punished for half-assed responses so I took time writing each response, but I still felt rushed. It was a constant balancing act, should I take less time on each message but risk being punished for unsatisfactory responses or should I take more time but risk not responding to everyone? As you are aware, I was ordered to be touching myself while reading your PMs, but (and I'm not sure if you know this) I was not allowed to cum without my Master's permission. However, your messages combined with the intense situation caused me to cum without permission several times. 

I recall the first such incident: I had worked my way to the last PM in the 'unread tab' of my inbox. I was pacing my pussy stroking as I felt that I was close. I had text messaged my Master asking for permission to come and kept glancing at my phone waiting for his call (he always grants me permission with his voice). The PM I was reading was particularly hot and I was barely able make my way through it without cumming. Before responding to it, I opened a new tab on my browser and clicked to reddit, wanting to check to see how my post was doing with upvotes. I was very mindlessly and very gently touching myself as reddit opened on the new tab, that is when I saw it - that my inbox had been completely filled again since the last time I had refreshed. That is when the realization of what I was in for truly set in. I was overcome by a sense of helplessness and I suddenly became very aware of the tightening of  my body and of my finger lightly flicking my clit. There was no stopping it, my body was rocked by an orgasm that transitioned into a gentle sob. I was exhausted, mentally and physically - and I knew I was far from done. I was overwhelmed by the impossibility of this task, by the certainty that I would fail, and by the knowledge that deserved it - that I had literally asked for it. I finished my reply to that last PM, thanked the user for the orgasm (and I meant it, as far as crygasms go - this one was amazing) and closed my laptop. I laid back on my bed and sobbed - I felt like I did back when I was a little girl and I had been caught doing something bad - those little kid guilty cries I'm sure you're familiar with. I was also racked with a longing for my master's embrace. I wanted and  needed him now more than ever. All the while my pussy continued it's gentle post-orgasmic throb.

At that moment my phone buzzed - it was my master calling to grant or deny me permission to cum. I answered the call and he granted me permission. I replied, in as a composed a voice as I could muster, ""Thank you sir, but I have something to confess..."" then proceeded to confess my orgasm and explain my current feelings to him. My Sir reaffirmed that I had done wrong by orgasming without his permission and that he had no choice but to punish me. He was gentle, however and chose a light punishment. He had me assume a relatively easy position (on my knees) and would have me hold that for him on video call for 30 minutes (naked, of course). To my joy, he enabled his webcam and demanded that we talk about my experiences with the punishment so far. This was exactly what I needed! My sir knows me so well. During the call I reiterated my feelings of helplessness and explained to him how impossible it seemed that I would be able to respond to every PM in time. My sir was very understanding but, as always, very firm. Yes, he said that I would still be punished for failing to meet the deadlines but he also assured me that he would consider my effort when punishing me. He told me that he had received PMs from several of the people I had chatted with, congratulating him on his punishment, on having such a good sub, and (most importantly to him) commenting on the quality of my responses. My sir told me that he was very pleased that I was making all these strangers so happy that they were PMing him to tell him. He told me how proud he was of my effort so far. My heart soared at hearing this and I was filled with a new found commitment to keep going. 

I kept responding for several more hours that night until I eventually fell asleep with computer still open next to me and my panties still around my feet.

The next 2 days were an emotional roller-coaster. The tension, dread, excitement and hormones were unbearable. I knew it was only a matter of time before my massive backlog of unread messages started crossing that 48 hour line. That sense of urgency made masturbating to all your wonderful dirty messages a much more exhilarating experience. There was one awful 8+ hour session towards the end where my master didn't so much as respond to my requests to cum (he had earlier warned me that he would shortly not be able to check my messages or contact me but I was still anxious to hear from him as my pussy was begging to cum). When I did hear from him, my request was denied.

Eventually, despite my efforts, those unreplied messages passed the deadline and my Master and I started receiving PMs informing us of my failure. I would have had another panic/hopeless cry fit except that my master ad been keeping a close eye on the time and called me to keep me calm, but also to make sure I knew of my failure. He ordered me to keep responding, especially to those who had passed over 48 hours, and to more importantly keep him updated over my emotional state while he took the next couple of hours to gauge my level of effort and failure and determine an appropriate punishment.

I did as he told me and two hours later he informed me of my fate: The next day I was to blindfold myself and handcuff myself to the bed. At first I thought he had misspoke - he had had me tie myself to the bed while he was away but never handcuff, I would be unable to undo the handcuffs by myself. He had not misspoken: I was to strip completely naked, write 'Carpal_Tunnel_Slut' on my tummy, tie my legs open to the bedposts and handcuff my hands behind me to one of the vertical poles on the headboard. I was to do this in the morning as soon as my mother left for work. I was to have him on a one way video call the entire time (he could see and hear me but I couldn't see or hear him). I asked him how I would unhandcuff myself and he told me that he would send someone by to *take care of me*. I was speechless. The phone line was silent save for a soft chuckle of his. I eventually asked him for clarification on what he meant but he wouldn't say, though he teased me with some suggestions. *Maybe* he'd have a friend come over and take pictures of me to submit to reddit. *Maybe* he'd leave me there for my mom to discover when she came home from work. *Maybe* he'd arranged for a friend to come over and be the second man ever to penetrate my pussy, or maybe the first to penetrate my ass. *Maybe* he'd arranged for me to have my first lesbian experience. *Maybe*  he'd combine several of these ideas or do something else entirely. *Maybe* he'd just have a trusted friend untie me and that'd be it.

The next day came and I did as he told. I made all the doors were locked and proceeded to my bedroom. I stripped, wrote on my tummy and video called him. He instructed me to position the laptop so he could view the bed, and to make sure it was plugged in so it wouldn't run out of battery, then told me that he loved me before disabling his audio. I tied and handcuffed myself and began to wait. I later found out that I waited for an hour but it seemed like much longer at the time. I was incredibly horny (my Master had never given my permission to cum after that 8+ hours of 'radio silence'). I started to panic about so many things. I thought maybe I had done the wrong thing by locking the doors, I hand't really thought of what I doing at the time and my master had not instructed me on the matter one way or the other. If my Master had not given his friend(s) a copy of his key to my house, then I would be doomed to remain tied here until my mother discovered my slutty, tied body. I struggled to free myself of my bonds, I wanted to unlock the door before returning to my bondage. But my Master's handcuffs proved inescapable and I actually ended up tightening the ties around my ankles. I spoke out loud, voicing my concerns to my master, hoping he could hear me on the other end of the call - I heard no answer.

I started to think of all the PMs you had sent me, more than a few of which involved tying me up. I started to flex my pussy but was unable to bring myself anywhere near the satisfaction I needed.

Eventually I did hear a car pull into the driveway and, to my combined relief, terror, and excitement, I heard the door unlock and open. I could hear a single person walking in my house. They did not come to the bedroom immediately. They instead seemed to just be walking about the house - this scared the hell out of me. What if it was my mom instead of who my Master sent? What if it was another relative who had the keys to my house - like my brother making a surprise visit? I debated trying to struggle free again but decided I didn't want to create any noise that might attract an unwanted visitor to my room. 

Eventually the footsteps did make their way to my room, and into my room. Whoever it was, they were now standing and almost certainly ogling my spread, naked form. My pussy was drenched. 

I heard the shutter sound of an iPhone. The mystery guess walked all around the room, photographing me from various angles. I was at least glad that my mask, despite keeping me in the dark to my photographers identity, at least would help keep my face concealed if these photos were made public. 

The shutter sounds stopped and the room grew quiet again. Until I heard the distinct sound of the stranger unbuckling. I felt a hand grab the the hair on the base my neck and guide my head to its side. I thumb was placed in my mouth to suck and I obliged. My hips were softly gyrating in lust. The thumb withdrew and was replaced with a bulbous flesh that I knew to be the head of a cock. A quick exploration by my tongue confirmed this. I tried to take as much of it in my mouth as I could but was prevented from reaching the base or my limit by my restraints. I asked the man to come closer but he did not answer, staying where he was. I was unable to tell how long this cock was and contented myself with pleasuring its tip. 

The cock did not remain within my mouths reach for too long and it and its owner eventually retracted. I felt the weight on the mattress shift as the stranger positioned himself on top of me. He positioned the tip of his cock at the entrance of my pussy and slowly began to enter.

""Wait,"" I whispered and the progression of the cock into me halted, its tip nuzzled just inside of me. I waited for the man to ask me what I wanted but he remained silent. I continued, ""I don't think I want to do this, my boyfriend is the only person who has been inside of me"" (to the public, my Master is simply my boyfriend). 

The stranger lifted my mask.

My master was staring down at me, love in eyes. He kissed me, and then plunged himself into me. 

To say this came as a shock to me is a bit of an understatement. He was not supposed to return for another 2 months - I had been there when he bought the tickets. My master is not particularly wealthy and I would have thought a plane ticket back to America out of the question (let alone a return ticket). He had managed however, and now here he was - fucking me senseless. 

Turns out this had been his plan from the very beginning. He had already been planning on a surprise visit and had been working extra hours to pay for the trip (that was a big part of the reason he wasn't able to chat with me as much as he wanted). My earlier bratty outburst had upset him but it also provided him the perfect excuse to give me an intense punishment to get me riled up before out meeting. 

I have almost ever hour of the last week him and it has been amazing. He also surprised me by revealing that he had been able to use some connections set me up with an interview for a chance at a paid internship that will put me on an unbelievable fast track to my dream career (seriously I can't believe he managed that).

So, that is the story of my experience. Feel free to comment of PM me with any questions or comments. I'll try to get to them when I can but I am also preparing for my interview tomorrow. If you have a more general question, please ask it in the comments below so I can avoid having to answer it multiple times with PM. Also, please PM me if you notice a spelling, grammar, or clarity error in this post and I'll try to fix it (it's a long post and they're probably in there somewhere).

Thank you so much for everything!

29tu9s,5,2014-07-04,[REQUEST] Need material assistance to care for feral starving mother Cat and 2-3 week kitten. (NYC/5brs) (x-post from /r/Assistance),ipso_artifacto,RandomActsOfPetFood,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPetFood/comments/29tu9s/request_need_material_assistance_to_care_for/,"Hi all,
  
I recently found a mother cat with her very young kitten (2-3 weeks, before that ""curious"" stage, only about a handful sized but walking, haven't even gotten close enough to see if m/f).
  
Mother seems very hungry, she is feral and hisses if you come near her, but she will approach when I come by with food. Today she even touched my finger. I am hoping she will start trusting me more so I can take even better care of them.
  
Not asking for money right now(but maybe soon for necessary costs in care) - but I am hoping for some help with the food, flea/tick medication, or anything else you can think of. I would even accept veterinarian services if they weren't too far.
  
I only have a couple of cans of food and cannot afford to buy too many more at the moment (unpaid internship). **I would very much like to feed mother and kitten as much as possible.**
  
Any questions, feel free to send a pm.

At some point today, I'll make a wish-list on Amazon, but I will also happily accept a pet-smart e-giftcard, or whatever else you think is appropriate.

What would I have to put down when applying?  Would places even consider me?  What would I be doing?"

I currently have no college experience, live in Texas, and have had a few jobs here and there. I initially wanted to be a police officer, but have decided to aim a little higher(joke) and would like a position within the FBI(preferably, but that could easily change). I figure if I am unable to get into the FBI I could always fall back onto being a police officer or something else with the education I get.

My current plan is to go to my local community college and then transfer into a better school after I have knocked out all the prerequisite stuff. I plan on getting a degree within an IT field as I generally enjoy pretty much anything that involves looking at a monitor. I am also going to join the military as it will be very valuable for my resume(more humor). 

Now for the questions:
The biggest one right now is: when and how should I work the military into my timeline? Should I join now? Go to school first? Assume there are no conflicts outside of what's optimal.

Would a degree within IT be optimal for getting a job as an ""agent""? Is there another degree that would be more beneficial? More than anything I appreciate the flexibility of this type of education.

Are there any schools I should be looking out for in terms of getting internships with the FBI?

I appreciate any and all answers, thanks guys.

EDIT: I was using the FBI(or again, similar positions) as an ultimate goal, but it seems many people think that it is not a good one(as some believe it is unreachable for me). Taking it a back a step further, what is a reasonable aspiration? Should I reign in my goals?"
29umgi,7,2014-07-04,Berlin you're awesome / reassurance if possible?,neueneue,berlin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/29umgi/berlin_youre_awesome_reassurance_if_possible/,"(sorry for all the word!)

Guten tag Berlin, ich liebe dich.

So much in fact that after one year of dreaming and another year of really trying to make this happen, I am coming to live with you (for six months at least, hopefully more).

I am a 28/f, British and have lived/worked in London for pretty much my whole life. I have worked within the arts and publishing for the past 5 years or so - more recently digital publishing.

I have long lurked this r/berlin and similar places and read many articles about moving to Berlin/living in Berlin/non-Germans coming to Berlin and associated negative effects/naivety in this area. I have tried to really, really take this on board. Even though I did quite want to at various points over the past two year, I have not let myself just turn up to Germany with nothing planned or lined up.

So - I now have something planned. I will coming to do some editorial work at a digital arts magazine - it's an internship (they work in English and there were some existing professional links which helped) but quite loose and matches my recent background very well so I hope to really make the very best of it + I really like what they do. It does pay a little too. Not a huge amount, but I have been saving for a potential move and honestly, it will go further than in London.

I have now, gulp, taken the plunge and left my job in London. My new role is due to start in the autumn, though there is a chance it could start sooner. For now, during the weird intervening period which began this week (which I am adjusting to) I intend to attend German classes here in London and really try and improve my language skills. I have an A* at GCSE (which counts for little, I realise) but have also spent the past 6 months doing lots of German reading/listening to German radio and more recently things like duolingo. Essentially - I know everyone says you can get by with English but I don't want to be an annoying British person, I want to be able to get to know people/places and I also really like German as a language.

I'm also very aware how difficult it can be to find somewhere to live. This is sort of another reason why I wanted to finish my job now-ish so I had time before starting to try and sort this. Through family friends I may have somewhere to stay initially/use as a base to find something once I'm there. I'm aware that there is a lot of red tape involved (I'm starting now to really do my homework on this).

Leaving my job and moving to Berlin (a place I love and that suits my background in some ways) had always been a sort of dream. I know that dreams can be very divorced from reality so I'm trying to do it properly. Any words of reassurance (or even dismay) are welcomed. I realise that probably sounds like I am coming to the internet to ask it to tell me what I want to hear but it's only because I can only talk to friends about this to some degree/need to get it out somewhere/this seems as a good a place as any. (My parents are supportive and we have discussed it a lot too).

One other weird question. I am obviously aware that Berlin is a very healthy party city. I do enjoy this once in a while - in fact, last time I was in Berlin a trip to the cinema accidentally turned into bar hopping/ a gig until 5am. Which made for a great story if nothing else - but it's not really typical of me. I adore music and go to tonnes of music things in London but I also love talks/lectures/bookish things. I really love a lot of electronic music and so obviously am very excited about what Berlin can offer in this regard but I also enjoy lots of guitar music/contemporary classical/all kinds of other things. I'm happy to stay out late once in a while, enjoy festivals, do drink but I'm not a drug taker at all. No real issue with others doing it (to a certain degree. can get a bit dull to be around) but for my own reasons (eh, mental health), prefer not to. Question - will I be cast out? Surely you're not all Berghain-conquering-never-sleeping-wonderful-Berliners *all* the time? I want to make friends but I'm scared I might, er, disappoint - if that makes sense.

So! I'm really excited about this. I've been quite unhappy with my recent life during the past couple of years and this is perhaps an opportunity to really create something good but I'm trying to be sensible about it. Which means trying to be realistic about it. I would love to hear your thoughts. 

...and apologies for being quite so British."
29uncr,1,2014-07-04,I've always been the best at timing.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/29uncr/ive_always_been_the_best_at_timing/,"My internship at a radio station started a little after summer did. It's an amazing job, but it did take a lot of time. I have a great group of friends and had an amazing boyfriend. 

My workplace was near one of my beat friends' house, so I'd usually come over. I barely saw my boyfriend ever since school ended cause his work is at the other side of the city. I have no car nor license because my dad makes too many excuses. When I go over my friend, let's call her A, I have to bother someone else to give me a ride to her place because my dad also forbids me to walk to places.

I broke up with my amazing (ex) boyfriend, let's call him G, of over a year three nights ago. He'd been nothing but good to me, but I felt held down and very depressed cause I never really got to see him much. I basically felt like shit cause I was too dependent on him. G wasn't in favor, but he understood. I want him back.

Now, on weekends, my group of friends always make plans. I'm always the one who has to be spotted for money and always has to be picked up and driven home. My dad doesn't give enough shits to drop me off and pick me up, but I guess he gives enough to limit me to no more than five hours with them. I am the group burden.

I don't know where I'm exactly going with this. I feel so alone. I feel like my friends secretly hate me for being the one who always has to kill their vibe by just asking ""Who's picking me up?"" or """"Who's taking me home?"", and honestly, I wouldn't blame them. 

I broke up with my boyfriend, and now I have all this free time that I could spend with him. I can't have him back because I think I made it clear to him what I had wanted. I don't know anymore. I just feel very alone."

More info below",Jordanfr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/29ut0l/i_need_reddit_help_to_accomplish_my_dream_i_am_a/,"Hello dear fellows,

I am here today to tell you my story, and I am not hoping for anything incredible, but just some help ! Even if you can't help me, reading this message is already great, so thank you in advance.

Ever since I was a teenager, I've always dreamt of begin my professional life and career in America. My parents took me to the west coast, and I already fell in love with it, I felt ""at home"".
After this trip, I had some hard time trying to know what I really wanted to do in life : I wanted to be an actor, but it eventually didn't work out the way I thought it would, so I asked myself a very serious question :

What do I want to do with my life ?

I thought about it for weeks : the only answer I could come out with, was : I want to do everything to settle my life and future family in the USA.

So, I began searching for the best options, how could I get there since the country is really closed for foreign people. 
And I came out with this answer : If I go to college, I'll be able to do some exchange, and maybe have an exchange in the US and then stay there ! Yeepee !

So, I began college, and followed course in Economics, and Management. My first two years went well, and on my third year, I asked to go abroad : Unfortunately, students with better results already took the place (there is a ranking setting, so you can't go if you're not the best). I eventually did my Bachelor in Brazil, in São Paulo, where I learnt Brazilian Portuguese.

After this experience, I was fluent in both English/French and Brazilian Portugese and got my Bachelor degree in economics and management (yeepee x2)

Coming back in France after a year out of my country, I began a Master degree in Management-Marketing option, I did it in Aprenticeship for an American company that I'll not name here.

Then I began my last year (the actual) of Master degree, with a Communication/Marketing and new tech specialization.

I already had some results, and I am the major in both English/Marketing-Communication and Business (I am waiting for other results but I think it's gonna be more than alright !).

I am actually doing an internship, when you end college in France, you have to do a last internship (6 months). And I am doing it in a small start-up which is very different from my last experience since the previous company was a very big.

This internship will end on september the 30th, and then : I am willing to do everything I can to begin something new in America.

This is why I am on reddit today asking for your help : could you help me, by any chance, trying to find a job in the US ? It could even be an internship, I don't really-really care about money, I care about an opportunity that could result in a long term contract.
I already send between 2 and 5 resumes everyday to different companies (I use Indeed and other jobs website, I have faith in trying hard !), that's why I also try on reddit.

I am willing to give everything I have, I have a solid background and experience in Marketing/Communication and new technologies, and speaks 3 different languages (french native).

If by any chance my profile interests you, or could interests someone you know, please, let me know at jordan.malalel@yahoo.fr or on reddit by message : I'll send you my resume !

Again, for those who read, even if you can't read me, a thousand thanks.

PS : I am willing to work in ANY state, from north dakota to new mexico :)

Cheers

Au revoir !"
29uv79,6,2014-07-04,(20M) at a loss with girlfriend (19F). Need advice ASAP.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29uv79/20m_at_a_loss_with_girlfriend_19f_need_advice_asap/,"My girlfriend Chelsea (19F) and I (20M) have been dating almost a year and a month now and as stated in the title, I'm at a loss at what is happening to my relationship. Any insight/advice would be appreciated.

Chelsea and I met last summer at the restaurant we both worked at. We both admired each other from afar and were attracted to each other, but because were both initially shy people, neither of us made a move until a couple weeks later, somebody told me that she was interested in me. I struck up a conversation with her that night, offered to walk her to her car, and we talked for hours. Exchanged numbers, and left. We texted later that evening before we both went to bed and she confessed that she had recently slept with another server within the past couple of weeks and didn't want me to find out from somebody else and get the wrong idea. While not how I usually want relationships to start, I looked past it and agreed to go out on a date the next night after I got off of work. We went out, hit it off, and proceeded to go out every night after that for a week and a half before we decided to make things official. The relationship was fantastic; we hung out everyday that summer, became extremely close as she revealed to me some issues from her past that I helped her work through, and went on some amazing dates (I took her to her first baseball game, skydiving, etc.). Everything was perfect.

Chelsea had plans once the summer ended to move to another city three hours away to go to community college. It didn't really make sense to me as we both lived in one of the largest cities in the U.S. which had multiple CC's and a tier-one university, she had a stable job, a beautiful apartment, friends, and myself. Neither of us wanted her to go, so I asked her to stay. There was still time to renew her lease, register for classes, and inform her roommates she wouldn't be coming to live with them. Chelsea however turned this down, saying it was too late and I should have asked her sooner. I was hurt, but we agreed to make it work long-distance. Three hours wasn't terrible.

The fall came around and Chelsea left. I went back to school at the previously mentioned tier-one university, as a junior and Chelsea began classes at the CC as a freshman. Because she had her own apartment and I lived at home still, it was agreed I would drive down to see her every other weekend so that we could have our privacy. I agreed because I wanted to see her, but this was somewhat stressful on me as I was taking 15 hours in a very challenging program, and was working 25+ hours a week in order to afford to be able to see her, while putting in 15+ hours a week at an unpaid internship. She was taking 12 hours and not working. I sucked it up and made it work, and was pulling it off. I was stressed and tired, but making it work. Eventually though, my parents recognized I was burning out and told me I would have to cut back on going to see her. I reluctantly agreed because they had given me my car. Instead of going to see her every other weekend, I began going just once a month. This caused quite a strain on our relationship as she was very annoyed that I was listening to my parents over seeing her, and we hit a rough patch. After much groveling, we pulled things back together and got back on track.
The semester continued and we held it together. Eventually, Chelsea began coming to see me, so long as I put her up in a hotel for the weekend. A large financial stress on me, but it was worth it to see her.

Towards the end of the summer, she asked me to go to Alaska with her for Thanksgiving break. She said her mom would pay for our flights with her points as she travels frequently, and I would get to meet her family. I agreed immediately as I'd never been before, and a free trip and a chance to meet her family/spend the whole break with her seemed like a win-win situation. About a week and a half before break, we were discussing flights. I asked her if her mom needed my information to book my ticket and was told that I had misheard and that her mom would only be paying for Chelsea's flight. I was shocked. I knew what I had been told, and wouldn't have agreed so quickly to go if I had known I would be dropping $1,300 on a plane ticket, when I was already barely making ends meet. Chelsea blamed it on me mishearing and insisted I still come. I killed myself for the next week and a half working extra hours while maintaining my already stressful schedule and came up with the money. I let the whole thing go, and had a great time. I was stressed, but tried to enjoy myself.

Thanksgiving ended and we both went our separate ways to finish out the semester. The relationship was in pretty good shape and we were happy. Finals ended, and Chelsea came back for the break and was living with her cousins half the time, and in a hotel half the time. Again, financially stressful, but I didn't have to worry about school so I could work more hours. This was a catch 22 however, as Chelsea disliked me spending time at work away from her. Around this time, my parents pulled me aside and asked me to consider if this relationship was healthy for me. I had a near perfect GPA, a good job, and was on a very promising path, and they didn't like how Chelsea was treating me and wanted to make sure she didn't derail me from my personal success. I agreed with some of the points they were making, but felt like I could handle everything. They also brought up the fact that Chelsea never wanted to be around them, and they thought that was strange and somewhat hurtful, as they were trying to be supportive of us.

During winter break, these conversations became more and more frequent with them telling me Chelsea was a bad influence and that I should cut her loose. Chelsea knew my parents didn't like her, and began forcing me to choose. While Chelsea wasn't exactly being fair, she brought up some good points about how my parents hadn't always been the best; they were very distant, cold people and hadn't really ever been there for me like she had (i.e. I was a multi-sport athlete in high school and they never once went to a single game of mine). The last straw came when I spent Christmas dinner with Chelsea and her family instead of with mine. I had spent the morning with my family and opened presents and had had our Christmas meal, but they didn't like that I was spending the evening with her instead of them. I got home that evening and they told me as long as I was in a relationship with her, I was no longer welcome in their home and not a part of the family. I packed up my things, withdrew from university for the semester, and moved in with Chelsea in her city until I figured things out.

Living with Chelsea was great. Being together made our relationship stronger than ever, and we loved every minute of it. When the spring semester started, Chelsea went back to school and I was working full time as I was taking the semester off. When I wasn't working and she wasn't at school, things were great. We cooked together, watched movies, went to bed and woke up together; it was exactly what we had wanted all along. Obviously, it wasn't all prefect as we were still learning how to live together, and I was dealing with the rejection of my family, but for the most part, we had no complaints.

Which brings us to where things started going wrong. Around early April, we began arguing quite a bit. It was stupid things at first, but then real issues started to come out. I had always had a problem with how Chelsea never listened to my ideas or considered my opinions and always had to be right, but I usually let it go and chalked it up to her being stubborn. However, I began to stop seeing this as a cute quirk and grew annoyed with it. I noticed a pattern in our relationship where I would always be the one apologizing, and whenever I would bring this up, Chelsea would dismiss it and blame me for starting a fight.

As our fights grew worse, I began going out with my co-workers instead of coming home after work. This made Chelsea extremely angry as she didn't have any friends, so I was essentially leaving her alone. One night after coming home late, she addressed it and basically told me that by going out, I was hurting her. I stopped going out, and things got a little bit better, but not much. I screwed up big time when I was invited out for a close friend and co-workers birthday, and lied to Chelsea I was going to work. She showed up at the restaurant and caught me, and I came clean and told her where I was. I was in the doghouse for a while after that incident, but after many fights, we patched things up and were good.

That is, until I dropped the bombshell that I wouldn't be spending the summer in Alaska with her and her parents. We had originally planned to do so, but when all the jobs we had lined up fell through, I realized it wasn't a good decision for my future, and decided to stay in town and work so that I could make enough money to go back to school in the fall and finish my degree (Sidenote: I just recently got accepted into the university in her city, which is a fantastic school and much better than my old university. I just found out today and haven't told her yet). She lost it, told me I was betraying her, and things went back to the way they were; not good.

After more groveling, we fixed things again. We were in a great place and she was on the same page with me about why I wasn't coming to Alaska, and things were good. She left and we stayed in decent contact, we texted regularly but rarely talked on the phone which seemed strange to me but I let it go and attributed it to her settling in. About a week after she left, my savings account which had previously been unavailable to me as it was a custodial account and I couldn't access it until I turned 21, became mine as I had filed a case with a judge explaining my situation removing any holds and allowing me to access it early. I called Chelsea, telling her I would could come now, only to have her tell me she didn't want me there. I was confused and hurt and when I asked why, she said she didn't want me coming and changing my mind again and she said I needed to be on my own and not rely on her. I was shocked and completely caught off guard, but accepted her decision and stayed and decided to make things work long-distance again. I began making friends, got promoted at my job, and began exploring the city and enjoying myself while trying to keep things going via text, since we still weren't talking on the phone.

About a week and a half after she told me not to come, things fell apart. She said she didn't trust me, etc. and we ended up breaking up. This only lasted for a weekend though, as I managed to grovel and fix things and we got back together determined to work things out and fix our relationship for good. We started talking on the phone, working through issues, and getting better.

Which brings us to now. About a week ago, she invited me to come. She said her parents were asking about me and she was ready for me to come. I agreed, and we set date. A few days ago though, she changed her mind on the date and pushed it back a week and a half and revealed to me she's unhappy and feels differently about me. She says she still loves me and wants to be with me, but feels hopeless. I've booked my ticket and leave in less than a week to try to see if we can fix things in person, but I'm at a loss Reddit. I've fought for this relationship through everything, and I don't know what to do anymore.
I've considered some possibilities such as she is no longer on the pill, which she has been for years and this could be her hormones getting the better of her, or maybe she's starting to show some signs of mental disease, as her mother is bi-polar. 

TL;DR; My relationship has fallen apart over the past few months and I have no idea where it's coming from. "
29uysd,1,2014-07-04,"Me [25 M] in a brief long-term stint with my girlfriend [24 F] of about a year, the distance has made me wonder how much I'm really into the whole thing/other concerns. Seeking some advice.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29uysd/me_25_m_in_a_brief_longterm_stint_with_my/,"We are both graduate students, we met in our graduate program.  We got along wonderfully as friends in the first several months that we knew each other that way, and she made clear to me pretty early that she was interested in me as more than a friend if I was as well.  I actually resisted at first, simply because I was not sure of it, but finally I decided to give it a shot and finally made it ""official.""

We got along wonderfully for several months thereafter, no arguments to even speak of, the physical relationship worked wonderfully, etc.

Then came this summer.  For various reasons we took summer intern style positions on opposite sides of the country, and suddenly this thing became long distance.  Neither of us were too freaked out by this.  

But a couple of weeks into the summer, for no apparent reason, I started to just have these nagging thoughts that I ca't put away about how I might be not as content with this as I thought I was when she was around, in part because she tends to be/do whatever she can for me when she's around BECAUSE she's that into it.  Like I mentioned, we've never had even one fight to speak of, but I started wondering despite that if I am really compatible with her personality.  She's outgoing and sometimes almost confrontational, and even though she's very intelligent and we agree on political/other views, I found myself reading her Facebook feed and almost cringing a little bit.  I found myself asking if things had not happened the way they did, would I even consider this person for a dating or more serious long-term relationship?

And then there's the part of this that I feel the worst about for even considering... and that's her health and the shape that she's in.  Let me be clear, I'm no fitness model myself.  I'm not overweight, but I've lost some of my fitness shape that I used to be in, and the graduate school lifestyle makes it tough to eat right.

But even though I was (and I guess am?) attracted to her physically, I cannot take my mind off of the fact that the whole ordeal seems much less important to her, and I'm not sure that she would ever be as motivated as me to try to fight the influence of graduate school on diet and exercise.  We've mostly been Skyping and on the phone, but recently she sent me a candid full body shot via picture message, and I couldn't help but notice that she looks... worse.  No real way to say it more kindly.  She looks tired and also like she's maybe put on 5-10 pounds since the start of the summer.

The thing that bothers me about this is twofold.  Firstly, I don't want to sound like or be the body police or imply to her that our relationship is purely physical, but I would be lying if I didn't admit that the physical part means a lot to me, and if she completely lets herself go, I really have a hard time seeing myself attracted to her in that way, and I have a hard time seeing myself staying with her as a result.  Furthermore, besides the appearance shape that she in, the same thought extends for me to her other health.  her extended family is rife with health problems, and I have a hard time not comparing her to her mom/aunt etc., most all of whom are in a shape that I don't think and hope do not match what I want to look and act like at age 40/50 and beyond.

And though I haven't brought most of this up with her nearly this clearly, I've kind of hinted at my perspective at least by bemoaning to her on the phone my dissatisfaction with my own health and shape (which is true) and how I wanted to kick myself into the gym enough to get my body back, and she said something in reply during one of those conversations that sticks with me and bothers me a bit.  She said ""well I think wanting to stay in shape is great, but just realize that we are going to lose some of that as we get older.""

I don't remember exactly what I said in reply to her then, but that attitude has stuck with me and poisoned my thoughts this summer.

I'm terrified that when we get back together at the end of the summer I'm going to be at least internally crushed with her change in shape, and I'm not sure how I can approach that issue, either in the sense of trying to talk her into changing it, or evaluating whether we are meant to be together long-term at all.

I don't want to be some sort of masculine pig who only judges women on their appearance.  But the fact is that I'm just not sure how far my attraction to her in other ways can carry if she lets herself go even before we've talked in terms of actually having a true future together as in engagement/marriage.

So maybe I'm just going crazy this summer because of the distance thing.  I'd love some feedback or a perspective check.


---   

**tl;dr**: The most recent summer my GF and I have been doing the distance thing, and the time/space to think apart from her has me worried about everything from our general compatibility to my ability to stay with her or stay attracted to her if she continues what I see as a disregard of her health and physical shape.

29v57g,1,2014-07-04,Forgetting About Money Even When It’s Needed,vaironl,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/29v57g/forgetting_about_money_even_when_its_needed/,"Hello Everyone,

I’m currently in a very odd situation, at least for me, which I will try to explain in detail. If you would like to know more about me please let me know. Also, I’m not reddit savvy so I apologize if I didn’t find a more fitting subreddit to post this.

So I’m a computer science student on my third year at a community college and will have to do two extra years at a university (if I do everything right).  I was able to obtain an internship a couple of months ago where I rarely do programming, which is what I truly want to do, but get paid a bit better than my old retail jobs. Realistically I never had to worry about money as I’m not a social person and don’t spend a lot on myself, but recently a bunch of bad stuff happened. I have to help my mother to pay house expenses as she is temporarily out of a job, I also found out there’s no longer going to be financial help to pay for college and I’ll have to pay out of pocket.

Now before this “bad-stuff” happened I loved to code on my free time for fun and loved to design small desktop and iPhone apps. I truly did it for the sole purpose of fun and definitely thought it would help me to get a job in the future, but there was no purpose of monetary gain attached to it. Sadly the financial worries have led me to think of a second source of income and I thought I could do this through my programming skills, which appears to be very possible. However, I’ve focused on trying to release something that will yield me large amounts of income, or rather dream of developing a similar thing to compensate for my situation. It’s obvious that with my way of thinking it’s not going to happen so I wonder how should I start to think?

I’ve started to play with the idea of developing apps for other people through either freelancing or funding a small company.  The problem is that I have no idea of how I would fund a small software company and have heard bad things about freelancing. So as the title states how do I remove my focus on making money, although it’s needed, and go for what I really want to do.

The hindsight parts are what I now know transpired in the aftermath of each situation. I know it's long but would love to hear what everyone thinks. Thanks for reading...


**Backstory**

Girl and I meet in college and hit it off, she’s a great girl and we date more or less happily for about 14 months. The relationship ended about a year ago. To be clear, I thought this was it; she was the one, nothing else, and I worked my ass off for this relationship. Typical young love, I guess.

We were extremely compatible sexually and only had just one recurring issue. I tried to drive home how important it was for me to have good communication with her. That became a major point of contention for us as she never really followed through (ex: I don’t hear from her for 5 hours straight and she ends up blacked out sleeping on a friends couch). For me it showed where our relationship was on her list of priorities, for her it didn’t mean anything. She admitted to cheating on a previous boyfriend which made it more important that she follow through. (That, I admit, may be insecurity on my end. I had a similar issue with a prior ex-GF.) 

Whether it’s worth noting or not, she struggles with depression and anxiety. These had led to her feeling, and acting, suicidal in the past. I always made it a point to look past that entirely but given how things have gone it might be worth thinking about? 


tl;dr1 - #1, 3, 5 are probably the most important 

**In the past year since we broke up the following have happened**

1) (August, 2013) I get a call from GF as I’m driving home after my summer internship. GF wants to break up. I hadn’t pulled punches about wanting GF to communicate and perhaps was hard on GF. I didn’t get any truly satisfactory explanation other than “I can’t do this.”

*HINDSIGHT:* in the next 3 weeks after this call, she hooks up with 3 different people, having sex with one of them. She describes having sex “with a condom, not ‘til completion – I told him I couldn’t do it and left.” 

2) (October 2013) Shortly after breaking up, GF comes to me when I’m drunk asking for a purely sexual relationship. Given our compatibility I’m happy to do this and this goes on for a few weeks before my emotions for her get the better of me. Towards the end of it I pushed her really hard to try to get some information as to why we broke up. 

3)  (October 2013) In explosive fashion this comes out on the front lawn of my house: GF believes she was raped at a party on campus. She admits to sending the wrong signals and ended up ‘browning in and out’ throughout the night. She went up to a friends’ room and recalls waking up to said friend on top of her, having sex with her. She doesn’t remember consenting to this, but she does remember going to his room. As she wakes up, she tells him “I can’t do this,” remains in his room for the night, and stays friendly with the perpetrator until she realizes months later that she was, indeed, raped. 

As she’s explaining this I don’t know what to think. She never explicitly says that it wasn’t ME that raped her, I can’t think of anything that I did that wrong, the whole thing was so nebulous. I handled it terribly, I laughed at the thought that I had raped her. (I could've handle this way, way better.) I questioned if she was telling the truth, or making up a story to cover her ass/trying to find a way to rationalize her actions.

I don’t know if she’s drunk, I don’t know if she’s having a panic attack; I have no idea what’s going on other than that she’s screaming at the top of her lungs as I try to calm her down. I get punched in the face and she speeds off into the night. 

Not knowing what the fuck is going on -- if I was just accused of rape or if my crazy now-ex-girlfriend/ex-FWB is out driving drunk, having a panic attack, doing something potentially suicidal – I call the police. I figure I should put my statement on file just in case and make sure that she's not putting herself in danger. I do so, and the police find her car. She ends up home safe with her parents. The police tell me her family will handle things going forward and I'll be called in the future if necessary.

I have no idea if calling the police was right. As an athlete playing a sport that is often in the news for such incidents I had no fucking clue what to do.  

*HINDSIGHT:* **NOT ME** I deserved to get hit like that, and she was well within her rights to swing at me. She explains that it happened on July 15, 2013. The weekend after she visited me in New York City for my birthday. We have lots of great sex and things seem 100% hunky-dory. Months later I find she remained in contact with the perpetrator. 

4)  (November 2013 – April 2014) We don’t talk for quite a while. She hooks up with another fellow (no sex) and the two of us carry on living our lives without each other. I’m moving on, she’s moving on – great. I have a fun few months, hook up with a bunch of people, including sex, and am having a good time exploring my options.

5)  (April 2014) After being away during the winter of 2014, I get a message asking to be FWB again. I figure why not, I’m over her, it’s entirely consensual, no strings attached and I can still explore my options elsewhere. A few weeks into this she jumps ship; she wants to pursue someone else she’s interested in and does so for a few weeks. 

I walk into a party 3 weeks later. She sees me, immediately starts crying as she runs over to me and starts hooking up with me. We continue to do this FWB thing until June when I graduate.


**Now**

I’m a graduate student at the same school, she’s a senior. She wants to get back together with me and enjoy the relationship that we had prior to all the bullshit. According to her, she knows now that this is what she wants, she’s changed, and she’s willing to sacrifice to make it work.

I feel like I was treated like shit by this person. I feel hurt, slighted, and distrustful – but deep down I find a way to think that she’s a good person. We all make mistakes.  I felt coming into this relationship that due to the age gap (at an important time in life), I was going to have to be the mistake she made so that her next relationship could be it. Each relationship is a learning experience – if we’re smart we don’t make the same mistakes over again (feel stupid saying that now). 

Until recently, I never considered that I could forgive her for those mistakes and enjoy the relationship with I deserve with her as opposed to the two of us moving on to new people. 

For me, there’s still some emotional component, this is someone I cared about intensely. In my best moods, I feel like I can forgive her; in my worst, I’m furious with her for blowing an otherwise awesome relationship.

Is forgiveness absurd in this situation? I feel like people get divorced and never speak to each other for less. 

How am I supposed to feel? What would you do if you were me?


Happy to expand on anything and everything in the comments...thanks for reading!

**tl;dr**: 

Was in solid relationship for over a year, loved her, still feel something for her. 

In last year:
7/13 - GF believes she was raped at party
8/13 – breaks up with me without telling me anything
9/13 – hooks up with 3 people, has sex with 1
10/13 – wants to be FWB with me
11/13 – doesn’t, finds new person to hook up with
11/13-4/14 – no contact, I’m getting over it, hook up with a  bunch of people, having a great time
6/14 – hook up once prior to graduation, she wants to be back together with me and claims she is willing to change

Should I forgive and forget so I can be at do? wat do?

There's a customer who comes into my store that everyone hates. Like, everyone. She's older, but not old enough to justify her absolutely hands off approach to keeping track of her own medication. She's one of those who has 15 meds with refills on her profile and tells you to fill everything, refuses to take the time to go through the list, and inevitably comes back demanding a refund when she gets something she doesn't want (we now make it a point to inform her all sales are final, but she always chooses to ignore this). 

It's literally impossible to figure out what medications she's actually due for because there is no consistency in what she gets. She also goes to multiple stores within our chain so that adds an extra level of irritation since our computer system doesn't make accessing a central profile easy in regards to last fill dates. She also goes to the ER every couple of weeks and gets new meds added, old ones D/C'd, and she has no clue what she's supposed to be taking, what it's called, or what it's for. 

My first experience with her was when I was more or less brand new to my store and my tech had already left for the evening. She handed me several prescriptions she'd collected from 3 different ERs (wish I was exaggerating) over the last few weeks and huffed and puffed when I told her it would be at least 30 minutes. She didn't come back until a few minutes after close - which was about 2 hours later than the 30 minutes - and pressed the drive through call button despite the large ""CLOSED"" sign in the window. I ignored her since I had already pulled the drawers for the night, but I'll be damned if she didn't try to catch me in the parking lot and make me go back in for her prescriptions. 

So yeah, fuck this woman. 

Last Saturday she called and wanted a refill on everything. I made the intern working that day deal with her because he needed a nice dose of what retail is really like. He went through her entire profile and determined there were two prescriptions she was close to due for, but they wouldn't go through insurance until the upcoming Friday. She accepts this and we move on with our lives. 

Yesterday (Thursday), she came in and made my other intern cry because she didn't want to have to come in on Friday when insurance would allow the fill to go through. I wasn't there or I would've had a few words for her. 

Today I got a chance to share those words with her. 

I got royally screwed with a combination of stupid things happening all at once - it's a holiday, so I guess it's to be expected. A front end employee was back in the pharmacy trying to help out and had the misfortune of getting Crazy Bitch in the drive through. CB gets the two meds that had been previously discussed, but after she looks in the bags she went off.

&gt; CB: This isn't the right medicine! I wanted my heart medication. 

&gt; Front End Girl: Let me get the pharmacist for you...

Words I love to hear.

&gt; Me: So we have metoprolol and isosorbide. What other heart medication did you need?

&gt; CB: I'm supposed to have Diovan! That man I talked to said I had Diovan. 

I was sitting next to the first intern during the phone call and he made no such promise. 

&gt; Me: It looks like you haven't had Diovan filled at this pharmacy... since 2013. 

&gt; CB: I get it from you every 3 months! I'm coming in there. 

So she came in. I try to swivel the computer screen around so she can see the date we last filled Diovan for her. It was literally over a year ago. 

&gt; CB: I don't trust computers. You can make that say anything you want to say. I've got a bottle that shows I get Diovan from this store every 3 months and you're going to give it to me NOW. I spend $1500 a month here! 

Her copays are $1.20. 

&gt; Me: ... No. Are you sure it wasn't filled at a different pharmacy? It's been a year since you've had it prescribed, and that was just a week's worth from the ER.

&gt; CB: I haven't been to the ER in years! (a damn lie - she's there at least monthly) How could you not call the doctor and get me a refill for a year?

&gt; Me, losing it: How can you take so little responsibility for your medications that you don't notice you're out of something for a year? You need to stop relying 100% on us to handle this for you. 

&gt; CB: Well I know I got Diovan here a month ago. You're crazy! 

Yeah, I'm clearly the crazy one here. I'm so looking forward to the complaint that will be waiting for me next time I come in. "

29vth0,7,2014-07-05,Looking to become a freelance web developer in 10 years,vv0rm,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/29vth0/looking_to_become_a_freelance_web_developer_in_10/,"I'm graduating in a few months, at least the equivalent of graduation as I'm in a french engineering school. I first got interested in web development in high school. Since then, I did two internships and a lot of different stuff in computer sciences.

After much consideration I still want to make web development my area of expertise because of various reasons and one of the more important one to me would be the increased chances of becoming a freelancer.

1) I figured I had to gather more skills and experience till I am competent enough to handle all the facets of this way of working and living. Therefore I don't really know what choice to make for my first ""real"" work experience: startups, compagnies/agencies, multinational corporations (actually I'm pretty settled for not choosing that one), any other type of business I'm not aware of...

2) I have been entertaining the idea of moving out of France because I believe that should be easier at my age (24) ; even though I'm not planning to settle down with a house and family any time soon. Anyway, if things don't play out the way I like, I guess the possibility of going back to living in France should stay open.

In this case, I'm thinking the better options should be either Canada or the US considering french and english are the only languages I could actually use for work (my spanish is weak). I'm a big fan of nature and mountains but it's unfortunately quite incompatible with regular jobs in web development that are often located in cities... which is another reason why I want to become a freelancer. Maybe Canada is better suited for that reason but I don't want it to be the only reason I'm moving there.

3) Personal projects seem to come off as high value assets when starting with freelancing so maybe that could influence the choice of 1). I'm thinking that If I'm working 60h a week in a startup, I might not be able to develop anything on the side for instance. On the other hand, the wider variety of skills I could earn with a startup could be nicer to have rather than a couple of not so successful personal projects.

As you can see it's quite a dilemma. I'll be grateful for any advice you can throw at me, thank you!"

It's been 8 months and she hasn't given me as much as an acknowledgement. What the fuck?",cuss_mustard,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/29vtsn/27mwe_were_together_all_the_time_and_then/,"Disclaimer: This is long because the degree to which the main question I have makes no sense requires a good deal of background information.

Summer of 2012: I met her when I began my clinical internship and started working with her. We became quick friends; within a month after beginning my internship (to which I had to commute upwards of 180 miles each day), she worked to convince me (as I said ""no thanks"" the first 10 times she asked) to let me stay at her place during the week. 
We quickly became all but attached at the hip and most people assumed we were in a relationship. We were NOT to any extent, ever...tbh I thought about it for a while, but realized that she was almost the exact opposite of what I wanted sexually (based upon what she told me of her behavior/tendencies/preferences). And, just so I don't have to say it going forward there's been nothing but hugging--no kissing, no awkward-space-between-faces-after-hugging, nothing, much less fucking, much less something I would value enough to not call ""fucking.""
Anyway, she was super paranoid about people thinking we were together and got incredibly worked up anytime anyone mentioned it. She cited the fact that  it's a huge no-no in our profession (AKA, find-a-new-career bad) as the reason for her anxiety, but it was obvious to everyone we knew that it was more than just basic anxiety. Anyway, I stopped worrying about it because (A) she wouldn't calm down about it and (B) I knew it wasn't, and would never be, a problem.
So, this internship was supposed to be 300 hours, but I ended up getting hired on. So there were several times where we we preparing to say goodbye for good to each other, but then ended up not having to, at the last minute. Each time, we went out--she got super wasted both times; I was pretty drunk both times, but not to the extent of memory impairment. She became INCREDIBLY clingy--like how people act when someone they love is leaving for a long time. The first time, while walking back home, we decided to sit on a bench and take a break; she ended up falling asleep on my shoulder with her arms around me. I tried to wake her up, but, you know--alcohol. She was awkward about it for a couple days after, but life went on.
The second time, she got even more wasted. That night encompassed her describing a past friend of hers who was (supposedly) exactly like me only to tell me of her ""secret crush"" on him, etc.. I drove her back home, took care of her dog, and tried to help her get to bed without falling over. First she grabbed me from behind and started kissing the back of my neck, and as I started to try and push things in a different direction, she tried to pull me into her bedroom. I abruptly claimed to hear her dog barking and said I had to go let the dog in. When I got back she pulled me into the kitchen and provided me with what will probably remain as the most awkward few minutes of my life. Nothing happened--I kept redirecting/distracting her, so I don't need to go into detail for you to get the idea. The next morning she asked me about the night before, and some of the stuff she asked/mentioned clearly indicated she remembered the nature of her behavior, but once she realized I ALSO remembered, she began acting as though she recalled nothing.

A few months later I graduated and moved to the same city as her for my job (this was now July 2013). All was great, the friendship was even better because it was less pressured by imposed timeframes. Shortly thereafter I took a better job about 90 miles away, but stayed here because I was still consulting/working for the other position, and was in a lease here, etc.. 
Now all of my weekday time was taken up by commuting/working. We started spending less time together, and it became fairly clear in time that it wasn't because of my job. I expressed this to her a couple times and she brushed it off, telling me I was paranoid and was misconstruing her as other people that haven't treated me so well before. Nothing changed, and eventually we had our first argument (seriously, the first, ever...and the last). I told her that I was suppressing my frustration because she kept denying my worries, but there was no behavioral evidence to support it, and all of that was making me angry and I didn't want to be so angry at her. She admitted that she had been avoiding me for the past several weeks, knowingly denied it, but then somehow made it into my fault by saying my ""mood"" was at fault...even though my ""mood"" started because of her continuously ditching out on me.
This wasn't even a raised-voices fight (we honestly never had one of those) or anything...it was pretty calm. After cooling off, I called her and asked her to go out for a drink to talk about it, but she never responded. She disappeared over Thanksgiving and the end of November. After a few attempts over that time to get ahold of her, I got an email out of the blue in the middle of the day from her early December.

It had no emotion and was like it was written by a robot. It wasn't even a full paragraph, and it ended with her saying (A) she couldn't be a good friend to me anymore and (B) she will always care for me.

It was really devastating. I don't really have any family in my life (long story short: they're huge bigots), I've been moving so much because of grad school that it's hard to stay in contact with friends, and, in general, I find it hard to trust people. She and I are very similar in that way, and that's a big reason why we were so important to one another (or so I thought).

TL;DR

The last time we spoke to each other was November 2013. I've reached out several times in the last 8 months, even though, at this point, I don't know what purpose it would serve. At one point, one of the publications we'd co-authored when I first started my internship required that we communicate as a team (she, I, and our boss). I stuck to business at first, but she plugged in some stuff at the end of the email that was clearly non-work/not objectively professional. I responded to the same degree, just feeling things out, and once again, she disappeared. I haven't heard from her since.

So...what the fuck? I don't know what to think of this, and no one I know (including mutual friends) knows what to make of it. I feel like I'm either delusional or that there's a shitload of stuff I don't know about that's keeping her at bay. I realize it's not the end of the world, but too often reminders of her will pop up and more and more, as time goes on, it makes me feel more and more sick to know that I was, supposedly, so important to her, and yet she can so easily push me off the face of the earth she lives in. I mean, she would say shit like ""Knowing I've met you and have you in my life is the best comfort"" or ""The only thing you could do to make me not want you in my life is something like...killing my dog, or something I know you'd never ever do.""

So, again, ...what the fuck should I make of this? I want to try and push this out of my mind forever as much as possible, but it sucks more and more as time goes on.

The past few weeks, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and I have been considering a lot of options, mainly because I have a few left, and none of them are all too stellar. I mentioned it in a very ranting post in /r/offmychest, mainly because I was definitely running out of people to talk to in my own life. I don't want to burden my friends and family, who have their own nonsense to face, with my own, selfish, stupid issues.

Here's the thing. I'm a teacher, and because of my stupidity, I was let go by the school, and have now realized that, after various job interviews, I'm very much out of options for employment in my chosen field: education. I haven't any certification in my subject (Humanities, to make it general), and my finances are too low to get into classes. It's early July, and I have one or two prospects left, though I'm extremely nervous about them. If offered one job, I would be teaching at a boarding school. Great opportunity, decent wages, though I'm not totally thrilled about teaching at this school. Its clientele is just very different from that whom I've been teaching for the past year. Not better, not worse, just...different. I can't say whether the opportunity will be great for me, but...I don't know. The other I'll explain anon.

I am not entirely savvy in money, and I've looked at some of the posts on /r/personalfinance, and have just become incredibly confused by what I'm seeing. I know that our school matched me for a retirement fund, and, if I'm not mistaken, I have contributed 11% of my salary to a retirement fund. I don't invest (I haven't really much money to invest in anything), I don't think I have a 401(k), and the posts I'm seeing have genuinely confused me. My parents aren't necessarily the greatest advisors either, as my father has recently declared bankruptcy due to very poor spending habits and lying about them throughout our years together. Divorce payments, all that nonsense, don't help his case, either.

I use my father's financial difficulties to warn me about the dangers of spending beyond my means, but my very low income has made me resort to some pretty dumb practices, as well. I've opened a credit card for the first time (one that has an annual fee: mistake #1), and my bank charges fees **on top** of ATM fees and doesn't reimburse you (#2). I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I just seem to have no grip on my own finances. I don't spend much money on anything. Using Mint, I notice that about 55% of my income goes straight to rent (I live alone, and I prefer that, due to horrible memories of living with roommates in college and college/off-campus apartments), 30% to other bills and such (groceries, one small student loan that I need to pay back, utilities, etc.), and the remaining 15% is spending/saving money. With my income, it's chump change - so much so that the federal governments ICR plan says that my monthly payment is $0 for the next 16 months. It's a mixed bag, I guess. I have a little under 30,000 in debt from the government, ~5,000 directly from my *alma mater*, and ~500 in credit card debt. The latter debt will be paid in full in about two weeks, when I get my final paycheck from the school.

I am moving out of my apartment, but where to? I don't have prospects, so I can end up at home. That's a possibility.

However, two opportunities have arisen. Both of them will cost money, unfortunately, and I don't know what the best move is, given something that is putting everything in a pressure cooker.

I'm part of a program that stipulates that I *must* enroll in a graduate program for either an MAT or a PhD in AY2015-16. That means, for the next year, I need to find something that can help. Obviously, something that pays well is the most appealing, but the only two opportunities I have are MA programs. I applied for one of them, knowing that I'd also be applying for a job at the school that would provide housing, a modest stipend ($7,500 per semester, so $15,000 p.a.), and tuition remission for two courses per semester. I'd have to commit to the job for two years, but my MA program can be completed - if I work hard enough - within a year if I take an extra course here or there. I haven't received any word of that job, though, mainly because they couldn't consider me until I got accepted into the program. One thing's contingent upon another. I'm banging on doors just to see what the status is, explaining my situation, using my Dept. Chair's name as a reference (she has quite a bit of clout at the school, given that she was a prominent faculty member there before she left to teach high school), anything to get some kind of response. I have always believed in candor and in the mantra that if one knocks on enough doors, one will open. If no one responses, bang harder and louder. There's a difference between will and drive. If that opportunity does not happen, however, I will have to pursue the degree part-time, for three years, which I cannot afford to do. 

The other opportunity is the chance to travel to the UK to pursue a one-year degree. The problem? It's almost unfunded. I just made contact with the International Office (I sent them an e-mail explaining my situation and penchant to travel and learn abroad, particularly in the UK, where most of my topical interests meet), talked with professors and other people there about my situation, and spoke with various schools in the area to see if they would be willing to take a chance on me. It's harder for American students to get jobs abroad. I have good qualifications, however: pretty good ones, too, including prominent international awards and such. My school's alumni network isn't helping me, either, which irritates me immensely, since not many people at my *alma mater* are in my chosen field. The Career Center is also unhelpful, despite numerous appointments and conversations. The school in the UK is also very prestigious, and it can open a lot of doors not just in the States, but also elsewhere - Western Europe, Latin America, Australia, South Africa, etc. etc.

The only problem is this program. I have to matriculate into a graduate program, most likely a PhD (that was my preference) in AY2015-16. Part of me hesitates to make that commitment now, mainly because I want to explore and travel, find myself, all generic twenty-something things. However, is it worth it to pursue a dream if it will literally cost me my life? I won't be entering a lucrative profession one bit whatsoever, and I'll have to rely on the ICRP for the rest of my life. As someone who yearns to explore, however, is the one-year stint worth over twenty years of debt? I know that there is loan forgiveness for teachers, which I have considered and talked about with the federal government, but I don't know what is best financially for me.

I know this is a lot, and I sincerely apologize for any spouts of ignorance towards finances, or if what I'm mulling over is extremely stupid, because I know MA programs are moneymakers, etc. etc., but this one-year gap frustrates me. I have done work in service before, and I have absolutely **dreaded it**. I've suffered through it for many years, as both a high schooler and as a college student, and I just cannot afford to live independently on minimum wage. I don't really want to move home because I've already done the whole ""I'm-away-from-home-thus-I'm-independent"" thing for three years already; since my junior year of college, I haven't been home. I've lived in places for summer and winter internships and such all over the country. My employers there have also been very hesitant to reach out and help out, too. I'm just very stuck, and my ambitions really want me to explore myself.

But at what cost? What makes everything worse is that I need to make a decision by the last day of this month.

**tl;dr** Recent college grad struggling with ~35,000 in debt already is facing unemployment, but has been admitted into two grad programs. However, he is enrolled in a program that requires he matriculate into a PhD/MAT program in AY2015-16, so he only has one year to do this. Does he go to the prestigious program in the UK, go to a school in his local area where he has been admitted, or does he just go home, where he has not been for three years? Does he just save up, or does he take the risk and pay for the consequences, both literally and figuratively, later?"
29w0ml,6,2014-07-05,Vent Post. I'm an ACON myself but I came out of it better than my ACON fiancee. Sort of.,if0rgetpassword,RBNSpouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBNSpouses/comments/29w0ml/vent_post_im_an_acon_myself_but_i_came_out_of_it/,"I'm out of the NDad's house. Live with SO. Have me some crippling anxiety. He lets me cry on him. We've settled into a nice routine where I housewife and he earns. It's alright. He has free time, and I have a relatively terror-free life. Panic attacks are getting fewer and farther between. 


His mother hates me. I worried she was an N because when you've been raised around one you can spot that shit a mile away. 4 hours by car away even. My SO really wanted to take me up to his parents for reasons, i suppose. I bargained it down from the whole weekend to just the day on saturday because holy shit, I've met her before and she made me super nervous. 


We get there. I get a sense of mad from her. Her 3 daughters are being friendly, Edad is trying to make me feel welcome. She's like a half sentence from throwing a hissy fit the whole time. Shit talked one of her daughters for not knowing everything at her government internship (because interns at the DOT should know everything to do with hazard labels) and I think I brushed her bitchy off ""So who it really matters for are the DOT people that would need to clean it!"" It was neat. 


Was bitchy at a jigsaw because i'd been my usual and said something not very specific while pointing at a picture for my so to put some large pieces in a specific place. I was sarcastic and and self disparaging said i was just the greatest at directions. Clearly I am not. Weird little bitchy snort from her. Okay, I'm reading too much into things. Upbringing officially making me crazy. 



N.O.P.E. Went crazy on my SO in the middle of dinner over something that had no reason to become a fight. Started to put words in his mouth. I asked questions, tried to clarify points to make her feel like she was being heard. You know, stuff that makes most people calm when they feel like they aren't being listened to. SO asked her why she was so mad. Nope. She said something that SO didn't say. Said he was being brainwashed i guess? Idk, I said ""But he didn't own that feeling, he said x feels that way, not that he does."" Yells. Screams. ""You don't' have to defend him"" It clicks, SO is scapegoat. Says now she's mad, slams doors. Oldest daughter tells me she does this. I should have left then, I had been shaking when she started yelling. I only shake when around really angry people, or when I'm really angry myself. I got it around NAunt the most. 



Okay. Well. She comes back and yells at me some more for putting words in her mouth. I'm trying to get out that I was just trying to make things clear and started to tear up. She picked up a full, really heavy water glass and threw it at my chest. had a bruise from it. I began to cry for real. Apologized to the girls, I didn't mean to have her blow up on me and I didn't want them to be upset. All I could think was this is what life must be for them. All my N-senses were right. She hit me for tearing up guys. My dad would always yell at me for crying. He never. ever. ever hit me. ever.  


She asked me to leave. I thanked her. She stormed of to her bedroom like a big girl. I hugged her husband before leaving saying thank you for being welcoming. left with SO. On the 4 hour drive home there were some phone calls. So much reassuring from SO to them that his phone was dieing not that he didn't want to pick up. So much passive aggressive bullshit (i'm always warm, she said ""I just threw water on someone who was hot"" SO didn't even code it as passive aggressive bs until I told him days later I thought that was why he hung up, and thanked him.) 



He didn't call for 2 weeks. Called Nmom and she was waiting for a shoe to drop, i guess? I told him he should write her a letter, doesn't have to send it, you know. I tried to be sly about well, this place, about RBN because well. What do you say to a SG that has been talking about his family like NC would be easy? You don't' rush that shit, you don't' let it sound like /you/ were the reason any of this happened. I will be fucking damned if she gets to use me as the reason her little boy left her. Fuck, ALL that noise, so he writes a letter to her, sends it to me. It was so good guys. I was super proud of him. And! Then! he sent it to her! Called her the day after. SHE TRIED TO GET HIM ON THE BACKFOOT GUYS. ""YOU WERE ON SPEAKERPHONE AND PEOPLE WERE MADE UPSET BY WHAT YOU SAID"" this! is what the bitch has to say for herself! You need to feel bad because your sisters were upset and your father was unhappy. Like. What. 


What. You mean assaulting someone deserves an apology of 'I'm sorry I made the Family upset including i f0rgetpassword' and not a 'I'm sorry I blew the fuck off the rails and hit her' fuuuuuck thaaaat hooooly shit. 



Guys, for real. She knows i want nothing to do with her a.n.y.m.o.r.e.  Up until now I've done the 'call your sisters to go out, go up to visit your family' thing. N.e.v.e.r.a.g.a.i.n. Fuck all of that. I spent a week crying over nothing. I spent a few bursts of anxiety that i get occasionally thinking alllllllllllll about how she was punishing me for crying, just like my dad would. How my fucking NDAD would have called her a crazy bitch and noped out. my ndad! I mean really! I still cry about how SO doesn't seem to really have a grounding for normal. He and his sisters were home schooled. All of their extended family was cut off little by little until no one was left.  Something fucked up happened in their childhood and NOTHING ever came of it.  No counseling. Like. What. 


And friends/SO's of ACONS, I want to present you with these gems that just patted me on the head and told me for sure that this whole time my SO was the biggest scapegoat in the world for this woman. I knew after he told me these things that I wasn't reading into shit that wasn't there. ""Sometimes she would threaten us with putting us in normal school after a certain age, none of us really wanted to, I was really attached I had a hard time with leaving her."" ""The fighting with our dad didn't really start until I was going to school.""



I don't want advice or help or anything I guess. This is my problem, in that my SO's problems are my problems. However, I was the GC and became the SG when there was no one left that stayed with my dad.  I don't worry that my Fiancee will be brow beaten by this woman. I know that he'll lay in bed with me and tell me about things she's said that made him feel bad, That I'll give him the support he hasn't ever known. I worry for his Efather who sounds so much like my Emom. When my SO finally cuts contact (he really wants to, he's getting close to being able to suggest it without feeling guilty) his father will get it worst. When that divorce happens (pray for the man that it does) which of the girls will it be next? 



There are so many people for her to victimize. For her to browbeat. I worry so much for them. "

29w4hf,8,2014-07-05,Recent graduate advice,doctahbannah,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/29w4hf/recent_graduate_advice/,"Hi reddit. 

I'm a recent EE grad and I'm looking for some advice from those more experienced than myself.

I've been offered a 3 month internship with a small company, but I had a good second round interview with a larger company a few days ago, and the role pays more, has a longer contract, and generally seems like a position I will learn more from. However the deadline for accepting the internship i've been offered is basically immediate, and thus is before I will hear back from the larger company.

My question is this:
If I accept this internship, is it possible that the larger company, if they decide to make me an offer, would be willing to allow me to start 3 months from now so I could do the internship. 
The hiring process seems to be an ongoing thing, rather than a group hire of many grads at once. 

I really don't like the thought of accepting the internship and then quitting very shortly after if I get another offer. Burning bridges is never a good thing and they seem like a great company.
However I also would be very dissapointed if the other offer came through and I couldn't accept it.

Any advice is appreciated!"

So, I am currently in school for learning a profession and am nearing the end of graduation. I have not had a girlfriend for a long time, but wasn't looking for a new one. 

Since I started my school I have been in the same class for 3 years now with this girl that I have a (pretty big) crush on. We have always been good friends and I see her as one of my best friends. We talk about everything there is, and I am the only one she opens up to whenever she needs me and vice versa. We both have a pretty hard time talking about our feelings, but I think we notice that it's easier for the both of us to talk to eachother than to anyone else.

I have had a crush on this girl since I started my school and have always been afraid of telling her, for fear of scaring her off. This year we had an internship which lasted for quite a while and I was the only one who she kept in touch with during this period. Nearing the end of the internship we started flirting and started making up graphic sex stories. Shortly after that we decided that it was time to put our words into action. She didn't know I was still a virgin and had a crush on her, and she wasn't planning on starting a relationship anytime soon. Being the fool that I am, I didn't take my own feelings into account and we had sex, it was amazing and I had never had a feeling like that in my entire life. 

When we returned to school we kept our little fling on the quiet level because we didn't want anyone to know in our class. This because she has a past with some guys in my class, which I don't really care about One of them is still very sensitive when it comes to her dating other people, especially someone from our class, so we kept it quiet. 

We had sex a second time not very long after the first time and it was even better than the first time, we texted eachother regularly; calling eachother honey and sweetheart, blowing kisses and winking at eachother in class. It was almost as if we had a relationship, only we didn't officially. 

After we had sex for the second time she asked me if I had feelings for her, and I admitted that I had been feeling something for her since the beginning of college. She was surprised and said she'd never noticed. At the time it didn't seem like there were any consequences to me telling her this, we kept on doing our thing. But we never had sex for a third time. The only other time was where she was at my place, we didn't have time to have sex and we decided to lay in my bed and cuddle. 

Few weeks later we had a weekend project for school and some big drama event happened there involving her, which circles around the history she had in our class. After the weekend I had her on the phone, crying her eyes out because she felt betrayed that virtually the whole class was talking behind her back about how big of a slut she is. I told her that I didn't think that, and that I would never think that. 

After this the sweet talk stopped rather abruptly. I felt that I couldn't say honey or sweetheart to her anymore, let alone continue our sexual stories which she and I always enjoyed.  

Now a few months later we've virtually gone back to just being friends again, occasionaly she asks me if I still have feelings for her and I admit every time. She tells me that she does not have any feelings for me and that she appreciates me more as a friend, and does not want to 'risk' a relationship with me beacuse she thinks she may fuck it up and lose me forever, this because she says she knows herself and she doesn't love her self. 

Now to the question; I am confused, I feel like she had feelings for me. I feel like the whole event during the project and the fact that she didn't want any relationship for a period played a part in her repressing her feelings, if she had any, for me. And I am confused whether she had any feelings for me during the periode of us having sex and texting eachother like if we were a couple. Also am I confused if I should tell her exactly how I feel about her, because I do have a lot of feelings buzzing around, but I am afraid that if I do tell her that I scare her off and that I lose her forever. 

What has happened? More importantly; what should I do?

---   
TLDR; Girltrouble, had sex with my best friend. Told her I had feelings for her and after an unfortunate event involving her history with guys in my class she decided to lay off the sweettalk. I am confused if I should tell her how I feel about her even though she does not have feelings for me, or that I should let it cool off.

Thank you reddit!"

I'm a student in Ireland and I'm about to go back for my 4th year. During the summer months I've been working as an intern and being payed okay for it. So I've been saving hard and repaying my loans.

Basically my financial situation looks like this


€16000 loan @ 6.5% repayments are €85 per week
€8000/yr for college fees + living accomodation etc.


€3000 in savings come September

Now while I was in college and not working my parents would take care of the repayments for me and that was all well and good, but I felt bad about making them pay out, things are tough and all that. So my plan was to get another top up of 8000 and use my savings to pay off the repayments per week. Rather than have the parents repay the loan untill I'm back working again. 

Now the nice thing about my loan is that if I get a top up my repayments per week won't change.

So I guess what I'm asking is which of these is the better choice?

- €24,000 @ 6.5% but financial independance

- €16,000 @ 6.5% parents pay the bills.

I've been dating my SO for just over 2 and a half years, and she seriously is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I think she's incredible in every aspect, and still to this day think that she is one of the most beautiful and sexy women I've ever seen. I can't think of really too many people I've ever been sexually attracted to at the level that I am with her.

Well, lately I've been noticing that my libido is just dramatically lowering. I don't even have the desire to masturbate, which I used to do quite regularly, anymore. I don't understand why this could be, since only a few things have changed and I don't see why they would be the ones to affect it. What's changed is now I have this full-time internship where I'm awake at 5:30 every morning and not home until around 6 every single day, sometimes even later. I'm tired all the time and I can understand how this would be an issue since sex is a very energy draining process, but the two of us have had sex while dead exhausted before and it didn't stop us then. Secondly, I've found myself in the worst physical shape I've been in in my entire life recently (which is still pretty good shape, it's just not how I'm used to being). I play lacrosse and my season has been done for a few months and I just can't find the motivation to work out or do anything really. Which brings me to my next point: I'm actually noticing this lack of motivation and desire across a whole spectrum of things, not just sex. I'm losing enjoyment in a lot of things that I used to absolutely love doing and I can't seem to see what's going on or how to fix it.

I guess my question is, is there something wrong with me beyond this whole lack of sexual desire, or am I just going through a small phase where I don't want it, or any other thing that could possibly be going on with me? I love this girl to death, and she is ALWAYS wanting sex, so I really feel like I'm letting her down in a really bad way by having this immense lack of desire.

Thank you to anyone who replies, it means a lot!"

How to go about improving and becoming who I want to be.,gaslymonk,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/29wk07/help_me_become_a_man_how_to_go_about_improving/,"Hi TRP. I've been reading material for over 6 months now and am really trying to make a change. I need help, comments, criticism and support on a few things though.

Here is who I was, and who I want to be:

I have a decent (yet small) social circle, studying engineering, but I have yet to do anything in this life to get myself ahead. Really, I've been putting myself behind. Up until last week I was playing computer games up to 40 hours a week. Not studying, doing shit at uni, not making new friends or putting myself out there. I haven't improved on myself in years. I am in a massive slump.

Despite all this, I am dating a quality girl who is really into me. She's good looking and has a great job as a lawyer at a top firm in the county. She just started there as an intern about 2 months ago. On Friday night I went with her to the firm's mid-year ball. She knew only about 3 or 4 people there, and I knew no one. It was fancy. For the first hour I stood to the edge of the crowd with her and talked about: how awkward it was, how everyone else probably felt just as awkward as us, and 'should we get some more to drink?'. I felt horrible in this situation, I had no control, was out of my comfort zone, and was outclassed by every male and female around me. What should I have done in this situation? I have a bit of social anxiety, I'm quiet, and have never really cold approached someone in my life. It was the kind of setting where everyone was friendly and open to conversation, although I couldn't make decent conversation with even the 2 or 3 people that I made small talk with over the course of the night.. I really need some tips here. How do I talk to people and what do I say? 

I've been trying to get myself out of this slump. I'm going cold turkey on computer games, as they have ruled my life for the last 5 years at least. I have a massive addiction to them that I cannot control - any tips for this? I need things to do to replace the time that I would have otherwise been spending playing games. Reading, exercising..? Etc..

I want to get into running and lifting - I'm in okay shape, I just need to get into a decent routine.

My last problem is money. I'm really fucking poor. About $150 in the bank and spending more than I have income each week (from the government). I'm 4th year at university doing Civil Engineering. Should I get a part time job or try to focus on studying? What is the best way/most efficient way to make money at this age?

At 21 years old I'm a piece of shit and have massive room for improvement. My mind is open and I want to make the change. Any advice you have to offer is much appreciated.

Cheers for your support TRP."

So, I am currently in school for learning a profession and am nearing the end of graduation. I have not had a girlfriend for a long time, but wasn't looking for a new one. 

Since I started my school I have been in the same class for 3 years now with this girl that I have a (pretty big) crush on. We have always been good friends and I see her as one of my best friends. We talk about everything there is, and I am the only one she opens up to whenever she needs me and vice versa. We both have a pretty hard time talking about our feelings, but I think we notice that it's easier for the both of us to talk to eachother than to anyone else.

I have had a crush on this girl since I started my school and have always been afraid of telling her, for fear of scaring her off. This year we had an internship which lasted for quite a while and I was the only one who she kept in touch with during this period. Nearing the end of the internship we started flirting and started making up graphic sex stories. Shortly after that we decided that it was time to put our words into action. She didn't know I was still a virgin and had a crush on her, and she wasn't planning on starting a relationship anytime soon. Being the fool that I am, I didn't take my own feelings into account and we had sex, it was amazing and I had never had a feeling like that in my entire life. 

When we returned to school we kept our little fling on the quiet level because we didn't want anyone to know in our class. This because she has a past with some guys in my class, which I don't really care about. One of them is still very sensitive when it comes to her dating other people, especially someone from our class, so we kept it quiet. 

We had sex a second time not very long after the first time and it was even better than the first time, we texted eachother regularly; calling eachother honey and sweetheart, blowing kisses and winking at eachother in class. It was almost as if we had a relationship, only we didn't officially. 

After we had sex for the second time she asked me if I had feelings for her, and I admitted that I had been feeling something for her since the beginning of college. She was surprised and said she'd never noticed. At the time it didn't seem like there were any consequences to me telling her this, we kept on doing our thing. But we never had sex for a third time. The only other time was where she was at my place, we didn't have time to have sex and we decided to lay in my bed and cuddle. 

Few weeks later we had a weekend project for school and some big drama event happened there involving her, which circles around the history she had in our class. After the weekend I had her on the phone, crying her eyes out because she felt betrayed that virtually the whole class was talking behind her back about how big of a slut she is. I told her that I didn't think that, and that I would never think that. 

After this the sweet talk stopped rather abruptly. I felt that I couldn't say honey or sweetheart to her anymore, let alone continue our sexual stories which she and I always enjoyed.  

Now a few months later we've virtually gone back to just being friends again, occasionaly she asks me if I still have feelings for her and I admit every time. She tells me that she does not have any feelings for me and that she appreciates me more as a friend, and does not want to 'risk' a relationship with me beacuse she thinks she may fuck it up and lose me forever, this because she says she knows herself and she doesn't love her self. 

Now to the question; I am confused, I feel like she had feelings for me. I feel like the whole event during the project and the fact that she didn't want any relationship for a period played a part in her repressing her feelings, if she had any, for me. And I am confused whether she had any feelings for me during the periode of us having sex and texting eachother like if we were a couple. Also am I confused if I should tell her exactly how I feel about her, because I do have a lot of feelings buzzing around, but I am afraid that if I do tell her that I scare her off and that I lose her forever. 

What has happened? More importantly; what should I do?

---   
TLDR; Girltrouble, had sex with my best friend. Told her I had feelings for her and after an unfortunate event involving her history with guys in my class she decided to lay off the sweettalk. I am confused if I should tell her how I feel about her even though she does not have feelings for me, or that I should let it cool off.

I chose to go to southern California for my PhD because I wanted out so bad, and really liked everything about the campus and area that the school was located in. I have spent the past 2-3 months ready for the day that I finally would be here to start my internship. 

My flight landed at 6pm, and from the moment that I walked through the door to my new house, I have been fighting off tears. I have no friends here, no car, and for another week, I won't have any money and will be living off of credit. I feel like I have made the biggest mistake of my life.

What is hurting the most though, is that my girlfriend is still on the other side of the country. We both applied for PhDs with the understanding that we each would go to the best school that we could. My only options were a school in Florida and a school in California, and hers ended up being one in Oregon and one in New York. Originally, she was going to go to the one in Oregon to be closer to me, but I knew that it wasn't where she really wanted to be, and I've never seen her so happy as when I told her that I would be okay with her being in New York. 

I know that her and I can make it through this, but it is going to suck... Maybe I should prepare myself to transfer to her school. They denied me the first time, but as a transfer student, maybe I will get it..."

**TL;DR** (and I don't blame you, because I ramble quite a bit): I'm uncertain of career prospects and I feel shitty about this because I don't want to be wasting more time out of my life without actively furthering it in a meaningful way. I'm mostly interested in health sciences, but I'm also very good with hard numbers and financial concepts. Advice or simply personal experiences would be appreciated.

So my question is: what do you guys do, is it what you planned to do and how did you get there? How did you make these decisions after leaving school and before starting your career? Are there any useful resources / subreddits out there for just this kind of post?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So for a bit of context, I'm 18 and am currently on a (completely uneventful and perhaps wasteful) gap year after high school and before uni. I got a pretty good final mark (ATAR of 92.65) I was mostly happy with, and got into the course I was 'after' by a large margin. So next year I'm off to Melbourne to do a Bachelor of Science at Monash Uni. 

Problem is, I'm not sure at all what I want to do with my life. And I know, I know, I'm still young and most people don't know for sure either and early plans almost never work out as they're intended. But still. I'm the type of person the obsesses over details and am generally well-founded in my views. But in this utterly huge area, I'm pulling a blank. I picked a Bachelor of Science because I'm interested in health sciences primarily, because it was easily achievable for me and because it was a general degree with lots of room for maneuvering. But it's so hard to know what comes after, and what the options are - and as the person who plans a heap, I am not at all enthused by the notion of making it up as I go along, or seeing what's out there after I finish - especially considering I'll be moving to to Melbourne from my current town, which is by no means an easy or cheap option. And I've already wasted a year doing nothing, so I can't really 'afford' to push back my career much more, if you know what I mean.

The second problem is that (I've heard) such general degrees aren't really highly valued in an of themselves, and that I'd either _need_ to do Masters or Postgrad work to even be considered for the lowliest of jobs in the science field. Which provides even more variability and indecision. I was planning on switching courses to Biomedical Science as soon as possible (missed the prereqs for it in high school), which is sacrificing diversity for a more useful degree (I think).

I was originally thinking I could aim for Medicine - but it's an incredibly high-level course (naturally) that is hard to get into even if you _have_ all the necessary pre-requisites (which I didn't). At best it would take me 7 to 8 years to get through Undergrad and Postgrad study, and considering how uncertain I am, I don't know if I want to devote such a significant amount of time, energy and money into it. And that's not even considering the amount of time it'd take to specialise. Also, being a shy person with social anxiety, I'm not sure it's the best career path for me. A lecturer at Melbourne Uni (who I thought to be quite an asshole, really) made the point specifically for people like me to not even consider Medicine or Medical Research (which I was also considering). As much as I hated such a broad and absolute statement from someone who seemed to be lacking in the social skill department himself, it didn't exactly do wonders for my self-confidence.

I was also mildly considering a tangential health science like radiography or something - mainly because the course was short and there was a clinic in my town that offered very generous incentives for prospective interns. But I'm pretty sure that consideration was only being made because it was an easy way out of a hard decision.

It's just frustrating to have all this information available (yet little of the actual pathway information I need) and all these options in front of me, only to have made very little progress in my deliberations over the past 6 months. 

Thanks in advance.

29xhpa,2,2014-07-05,May have gotten caught. Need advice,MichaelYordan,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/29xhpa/may_have_gotten_caught_need_advice/,"Last night I went out with some friends to celebrate the fourth. We smoked quite a bit. I have a nike bag in which I store all of my pieces and herb and stuff, so I had to bring it with me. I came home and I had to leave the bag in the car overnight cause there was no way to sneak it back in. 

I woke up this morning and tried to sneakily clean out the truck. I sprayed febreeze to get rid of the smell, but I still had to leave the bag in there. I told my mom not to worry about the cars and that I would clean them later.

Quick note about my mom: she has no reason to be suspicious about me other than the reasons that I go out way more than my antisocial brother.

She left for work a couple of hours ago and didn't say anything out of the ordinary. Just goodbye and what not. I went outside and the cars were totally clean, even though I told my mom that I would clean them. It was the biggest ""oh fuck"" moment of my life. I checked the truck-no bag.

I know she found it. I've been smoking for a little over a year, and you wouldn't be able to tell. My grades are still great, I'm taking advanced classes, I play sports, do volunteer work, and intern. My family is very conservative, and looks down upon drugs. 

My brother is kind of weird and antisocial, and I think he may have helped my mom in her little investigation. Which is bullshit because there were many times when I could have ratted him out but I didn't.

I've never been caught doing anything else and I've always been a good kid. I'm respectful to adults, I do well in school, and I do just about every other thing to make a parent happy. I never argue with my parents, nor do I ever dare to disrespect them. I don't get why my mom felt the need to snoop around. 

I know I'll probably be confronted when my mom comes back from work. I have an idea of how I'm going to deal with it, but I would appreciate any input from those of you who have either been caught or caught someone and forgiven them. I don't want to destroy my relationship with my family. "
29xlbb,11,2014-07-05,"Want to switch specialties, what do you current docs think of IM vs FP? Current IM and FP docs care to weigh in? would you do it again?",turnsoutidontloveit,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/29xlbb/want_to_switch_specialties_what_do_you_current/,"Hey reddit,

First year intern here just turned R2 in OBGYN program.  Here's the scoop: 
When I applied to residency, I had just started dating someone (known for 4 years).  I ranked programs and specialties for myself as a single woman.  Now, a little over a year later, we are engaged and I've finished a year of OBGYN residency.  I also turned 31.  I don't love my job, and the things I do love I think I can find in other specialties.  We are also long distance by 2 hours, he just matched into EM.  

When I chose OBGYN, it was because I loved the variety of surgery medicine, clinic and hospital, and generalist with specialist.  At least I thought I did.  I also didn't have much going on in my personal life, and I had no desire to have kids.  Now I am exhausted, I don't love the OR, but I don't want to be a surgeon (I thought I would be ok with the type of stress it involves, but I've changed.)  I don't mind clinic, but I don't want the lifestyle anymore.  I have someone I love, I want a family, and now I want a job that I enjoy (don't necessarily LOVE) that affords me the personal life I want and enjoy.  My fiance is supportive of whatever I choose.

I'm considering FM vs IM, because: a) there are lots of these programs and less competitive, and b) the comparative stress level is far less, and c) the ""pay cut"" doesn't bother me.  I lean towards IM for now because if I wanted to specialize, there are more options, but honestly I'm tired.  

For those of you who are currently FM or IM docs or who recently graduated and are newly practicing, what are your thoughts?  Do you love what you do? Why did you pick IM? Why did you pick FM?  What's your daily life like?  

TLDR: finished 1 year of OBGYN residency and don't love it, turns out lifestyle is important to me, I want to change to FM or IM, want your advice"
29xly0,140,2014-07-05,"My family's making me talk to the local priest, because I'm not praying and ""losing faith."" Not sure what to do",[deleted],TrueAtheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/29xly0/my_familys_making_me_talk_to_the_local_priest/,"So I've been agnostic atheist for a long while now. Most of my life, if you count the fact that I actively practiced ""doublethink"" or ""layered thought"". I would hold my personal beliefs/perspectives that shaped the world at my core [mainly cosmology, geology, science in general] and then allow a surface layer of thoughts to mimic real belief. My family is Catholic and heavily so, but they've lived a hard life, so I recognize that their religion gives them comfort and have never tried to persuade them otherwise. But recent years have been particularly difficult, so I've been less patient about pretending to have faith for the sake of their comfort. While I have never evinced my true beliefs, I have refused to pretend to believe that my prayers [over so many others in the world, some perhaps directly contradictory] would be answered by some magical being. I go to church to keep the peace while I'm interning and living at home, but I don't bother going through the motions of all the ceremonial things. I stand there respectfully. Maybe it makes it more obvious to them that things are different for me, but I honestly don't have the energy to pretend anymore. [I'm on my second round of unpaid internships]. But I understand that it gives them comfort and I never try to convince them otherwise. 

My parents on the other hand, have become more forceful in basically shoving religion down my throat. They force me to pray with them as often as possible. Whenever I bring a concern to them, they tell me to pray harder [actually this isn't new, but it grates more as the years go by, especially when I really just want some advice from my parents rather than being told to pray harder]. The more they push, the more I've shifted from agnostic to atheist [though I still define myself as agnostic in some ways, because its the most scientifically defensible position]. 

Which brings me to today. I went to church with them, day dreamed/ planned my work schedule, when I got pulled into a discussion with the priest and my parents. Which led to my parents telling him that I was ""losing faith"", ""needed holy guidance"" etc. Anyway, I now have an appointment with him on Monday to talk over things. I'm not sure what to expect. From our responses to each other, I'm guessing he probably suspects what my actual views are. But he believes that god has made things difficult so that I may be shown the ""true path"" and that they ""caught me just in time"". Little do they know that I've been pretending for most of my life and view myself as a secular humanist scientist first and foremost. But, I am a bit nervous about this upcoming discussion. 

I was hoping that you guys could give me some advice? I've been lurking here for ages, and I've loved reading the discussion between TrueAtheism's subscribers on many occasions. Could I bother you for some advice now? What sort of discussions should I bring up? What is he likely to bring up? What should I be wary of? Should I be completely honest with him? Has anyone else here dealt with a similar scenario? 

Thanks in advance! I'm sorry if I'm slow to respond. Even if I can see some people discussing between themselves, it would be helpful, so please, if everyone could chime in, I would be most grateful. 

tl;dr: family making me talk to priest to get my faith back. I haven't had any in years. 

Also - I've studied a lot of the major religions since I was a child, since I could never stop asking why. I went through a phase where I picked out what I liked best from all the different religions. Then I tried attending different services. Finally stuck with my initial inclination that the universe was magnificent without human ornamentation [religious interpretation]. 

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that responded. I've read all your comments, and some of them were particularly helpful. I'll have to play it by ear when I actually speak with him, but I'm relieved to have received such support here and to know that others have gone through the same thing before. And to know that this community is available [with many people a lot wiser than I] and that I have an outlet, is heartening. If I had the means to gild you all, I would! But all I can say is, Thank You. "
29xmvv,2,2014-07-05,"I'm about to reach out to research groups for my master degree in EE, could use some advices.",DatEEGuy,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/29xmvv/im_about_to_reach_out_to_research_groups_for_my/,"Greetings. First of all sorry for my bad english, it isn't my main language.  I'm a 3rd year Electrical Engineering student in Canada and I'm at the point in my degree where I have to find a research group and fill the required paperwork to get a grant, which is a pre-requisite for a lot of the research groups.

I'm interested in three groups in particular. The first one does digital signal processing, machine learning and deals with neural networks. The work would be math-heavy and mostly in Matlab. 

The second group works on control theory applied to the aerospace industry. The professor would give me a project that fits my interests, which would most likely end up in robust control theory.

The last group works on scanners for the medical industry. I'd mostly implement digital signal processing in a custom IC, which means I'd learn ASIC/FPGA design. 

If I'm 100% honest with myself I believe the first two research groups interest me a bit more, but the work is mostly math heavy and pretty much theoretical. The last group also interests me but it seems like learning ASIC/FPGA design would be a big plus when it comes to being employable later.

So far I had 4 internships (I'm in a COOP program) and mostly all of them have been C/C++/Python programming. I don't hate programming but I'd prefer working on stuff more related to pure EE. 

Does there exist such a thing as ""digital signal processing guru"" or ""control theory dude"" jobs? I feel like I'd end up finding a standard programmer job if I go with either of these two research groups. 

What would you guys do in my situation? Follow your interests 100% of go for a slightly less interesting topic that would actually end up being employable later?"

29xoio,2,2014-07-05,Index lookup with autofill?,Crunchycrackers,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/29xoio/index_lookup_with_autofill/,"Hello all,

I am attempting to build a workbook for my internship that will calculate turnover costs. So far, the template is in place. The only thing that's stopping me from moving forward is a particular level of functionality I want it to have.

Specifically, I would like to have a cell where a user can input specific designated criteria such as a certain year, quarter, or month as well as a specific division, department, career level for the organization. For example, in cell 1 ""2014"" and in cell 2 ""Operations."" 

Doing so would have excel index a specific worksheet and then autofill specific cells with a turnover count that would be ""Individuals turned over in 2014 within the operations division."" 

I understand this will most likely involve some level of VBA macro, but I am wholly uninitiated with vba. I've also considered using access instead, but that's another learning process as well. Any recommendations or suggestions to tackle this functionality, or should I just make a different worksheet for each division/department and take the simple route?"

[TRIGGER WARNING],Shamedfmlthrowaway,LifeAfterNarcissism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/29xrq2/still_struggling_to_find_identity_detailed/,"Hi, very new here. But these posts and comments are almost all triggers for me for tears and panic attacks, and I do know through the limited therapy I've had that emotions are really important to face (N-mom and N-dad, as well as extended family, are all of the view that emotions are weak, bad, foolish, immature).

Please, I'm looking for any kind of helpful input on any of this: Advice on work, getting through ""The System,"" how to find emotional support - how to maybe not be terrible so that I can make better friends (I don't think the criticisms I hear are right, but I do not know what's wrong with me or what to improve)

So... Here are some highlights. Yes a lot is academics, but that's because that has been how I've defined myself my entire life.

I'm VERY very new at realizing how little I know myself. I have no idea what I'm good at, or want.  The is so much fear of everything and everyone, it seems to block me from thinking productively at all. The main praise in life has always been how nice and empathetic and forgiving I am. I do not have people in my life right now who encourage me at anything. Everything I think, I have my parents in my head and waste all my energy on the futile arguments that would theoretically occur.


**Academics**

Because my parents were awful and I realized at a very young age I couldn't believe or rely on them, I turned to teachers for approval because I have always been good in school, straight A's and prizes and extra-curricular projects.


However as I grew older, teachers were less approving, even though Iw as still getting A's. I suppose that I went through the usual female hazing where I was told that just because I was good in math and science now, that didn't mean I should pursue it, because I had 'the wrong idea about what future more advanced science classes would require,' and so I should really focus on my 'other strengths... you get A's in English, so why don't you focus on that, it'll be a lot easier on you.""  in high school, the guidance counselors (men) told me that college wasn't 'a realistic option' because it would be 'a lot more challenging than you understand.""



I moved on to community college then to university despite discouragement, thinking that finally I'd be in a place that was encouraging. No, the university environment crushed me. In math and other scientific disciplines, I still faced male professors and mostly male peers, who ignored or outright belittled me. I was so ashamed I never told anyone.



All the hard science grades were on curves, which I'd never even heard of being a practice before, and professors would number how many of us would get A's, B's, et cetera at the beginning of the terms. Yes, I did pass classes i don't think I should have, nor anyone else have (e.g. Physics I, the A's were in the high 60s, like 67% and above, and passing was something like 53%. One exam, passing grade on a 20 question, 4 multiple choices per question, was 28%. Basically randomly filling circles would pass.)


So my record is on average awful. I have either aced even advanced classes and won prizes for math, writing, and art, and made deans list for 3.5+gpa terms - or gotten 0.0 gpa terms. With that, I was not accepted into any internships, even after making it through all interviews tests and screenings - the last step is sending the transcript, and then the companies send a short message that I'm disqualified by gpas. (The uni I went to, scouts were mainly looking for 3.0+gpas - )

Now I have nothing. No job, no income, no social life. I had some major illnesses and am trying to recover, but I have no support or safety. I'm terrified every day. The last months I've eaten ramen and coffee. Today all I had was raw sugar and coffee.


I suspect I might be good at some things and useful. But there is no encouragement or even moral support. Anything upbeat I think is quickly drowned in doubt.

I think I'll just bullet the main family points, there is a lot and even more which I don't think would fit


*Parents divorced when I was 11. I do not remember anything before that. First memory was Nmom keeping me and younger sblings awake when Ndad didn't come home, then getting a call at 1am and then flipping out and screaming at me how my dad was in jail for ""fucking a hooker."" I didn't know what that was for a few years.


*Nmom used me instead of friends or a therapist to vent. She literally screamed with spittle at me about her and my father's rapes, in detail. Molestation in the family, in detail. And nothing I did stopped her. 


*I cannot remember when I stopped crying, because I know if I started to make a crying face, my Nmom would start mocking me for being a ""crybaby"" ""whiner"" and how I disgusted her.

*routine punishment was to destroy my books, tapes, toys, art, notebooks, schoolwork et cetera, in the front yard, and leave me to pick up the pieces. 



*Both parents used comparisons to the other as the worst insult, so I was always ""an asshole just like your father!"" and ""a bitch just like your mother!""



*They have never admitted, perhaps never realized, that the constant criticism and insults were bad and wrong. They still maintain they are ""concerned"" and ""afraid for"" my wellbeing. (context of, perfect grades, had employment as soon as legally able, no drug use, no illegal activity, first kiss at 16 and sex at 22). Yet even now -


*I am still lazy, disrespectful, arrogant, cold, mean, whiny, immature



*Both parents were sexist and racist. I was never encouraged academically, but always physically.


*Nmom never listened to me, so if I needed her to know something, like the dollar cost in savings per month of fixing a dripping facet, I had to have a male friend tell her: she never acknowledged my input.


*Ndad was a creep. He was raped and molested by his father and other adults. As soon as I hit puberty, he thought it was okay to make comments about my body and give suggestions on how to show off breasts.


*Nmom had constant stream of relationships with alcoholics. Mean ones, who said inappropriate things and did inappropriate things, such as having sex with mom in the same room as my 5-year old sister, and then telling me to shut the fuck up and mind my own business, when I told them to stop (from across the house I heard them), or I'd be beaten. Since guy is a male, Nmom didn't do anything


*Ndad had constant stream of renters in his house of male ""friends"" who thought it was just cute and fun to tell a 12 year old girl she'd be a great fuck in a couple years. 


*Ndad had constant stream of girlfriends who were inappropriate, such as giving me liquer when I was 15 and didn't want it. Ndad said I was being rude, so I pretended and then poured into drain.


*Ndad married a woman who encouraged his sexual creepiness and added her own: wanting to take me to VS and see me in lingerie, buying dresses without me for me that were very clingy and revealing, and then her and my dad would want to se me put them on and they'd make comments about my great breasts and legs and stuff. Then when i just couldn't keep it up, she said I was rude, obnoxious, lots of stuff, and then said she never wanted to see me again.


*Ndad followed new wife, cut off contact with family one by one by being so horrible people said stop, and then that would be the excuse to block.


*My little brother ,who is mentally disabled, started telling people at his school he wanted to die. Ndad and Nstepmom had started telling him that he was a mistake by god, and that he needed to pray and believe in all kinds of religious stuff or he would be sent to hell forever. And, for his 21st birthday, they took him to... Hooters! And got him drunk, and took photo of him with the different waitresses' chests pressed on his face. Bought him a Hooters jacket, and gave him a photo album of that day.


*another example of the Ndad and I guess Nstepmom crazy: when we were little, my siblings and i scratched our names in the bricks of the 100 year old hour dad had, with all the other resident names. One day I saw a bight spot on bricks, and when I looked, just our names had been sanded away.



*Nmom  will come over even when I tell her not to, and bang on the flat doors and scream that she's going to the apt office and the police if I don't open the door and let her in. Then when she's in, she just talks, lectures, instructs, insults, berates... I've been driven to my bedroom and blocked the door from her, just like a little kid again. She threatens calling police. And when I was an adolescent, she would, at the drop of a pin. They never took me away, but she'd lie and lie and say that I was dangerous and she was scared. And privately my parents did sent me to a mental hospital when I was under them, so that's always in the medical record.

____________________________________________________________________

**two weeks ago**

Nmom said my brother wanted to visit (she is guardian). So they came over. Nmom starts asking me about what I'm doing, how I am, but anything I start to answer she says, ""I don't want to hear that!"" She believes that *if* I had a good attitude, I would not ""feel"" sick. my roommate is in the room, the kitchen half, and my mom is screaming at me while I just keep repeating that she should go, and she starts including my roommate, who is totally stunned, with, ""You live with her! You know she's just lazy and pretending and enjoys saying she[s sick and getting all this attention, don't you!?""
(I have had a series of infections set off by massive amounts of broad-spectrum antibiotics given a couple years ago, destroying the natural, needed bacteria, and I was sick for three months before the doctors finally tested for the... things; the gut is *physically* scarred from the infections.)

======================================================


Okay. So now I'm 33, with 7 years of college and no degree. I fumbled, had no advice, the official advisor was helping sign me up for wrong classes, didn't know about financial re-budgeting, didn't know how to find low cost housing, didn't know dept don't allow sit-in or audits, didn't know tutoring was $40/hour and not covered by finaid, didn't know bad grades were permanent (a lot of classes (math and other hard sciences) the professors (all males in the depts) were belittling or sexual, and I was so ashamed I'd just stop attending. I was afraid to even drop because I had no idea if I'd have to say why).



I have no idea where to go from the here and now. Every day, all day, I'm on the phone or doing paperwork for welfare stuff. You don't just get it, theres constant additional paperwork with literally like 2-3 days to get it all in (by physical mail). I'm on and off and on and off food stamps. Usually off. The last time I applied, my case was transferred 9 times. So every tie I'd get a notice in the mail for the new case worker and call, it'd already be transferred again.


Medicaid for me started July 1. Already it's been cancelled and I've been dis-enrolled twice. Spent most of today getting coverage back on (it actually dis-enrolled me again while we were on the phone, she said, ""I've never seen this happen with a case ever before!"")


Most of the medicines I'm on, which were covered by the county I'm in, are not covered by the state's medicaid - and being on medicaid, I'm not eligible for ANY other assistance now. The phone reps for medicaid say, ""There are other drugs for your illness, so just ask your doctors to switch you,"" I respond, ""Those are different chemicals. Which affect people differently. I've tried many, and I'm on *these* because they help me recover and don't make me more sick. If any of these chemicals worked the same, we'd only need one of them produced for each illness, right?"" And the response, repeatedly, was, ""miss, if there is a particular medicine you **want**, you'll just have to pay out of pocket. If you *don't want* what we cover, then that's your only option. "" 


((btw, it turns out that in medicaid programs, the services offered are not chosen by doctors - they are chose by the legislature and insurance companies. 

So for example, 'yes, we provide total mental health coverage. But, we only pay a maximum of $30 to the provider.' So all the mental health providers available to me are residents, getting their hours in. I *tried* more than a few residents... they are at least 4 years younger, and even after a few sessions, still they say, ""Hmm... I really don't know what advice to give you. You **are** in a really tough spot, pretty impossible! Let me think about it,"" meaning, let me go ask other people what to do.))


Dear therapists: Do not tell a person in trouble that they are certainly in trouble.

&gt;What is this, the Dark Ages? 


This all seems so foolish. If I were even doing at-home work for the amount of time I spend on these 'welfare' programs, I'd be getting somewhere, contributing.

I think I could do things. Math makes sense to me, it's why I've always loved it. And programming, writing. A lot of things are interesting and I think I could learn. I have 16 years of myriad work experience. 


But more specifically, I have no idea what to do, since whenever I do  have an idea, I go to one of the few people I am in touch with, but everyone always starts saying what would be difficult for me, and how they aren't sure I could do this or that. One person said, ""I just don't think you're ever going to succeed in any kind of an office environment."" I asked, ""What do you think I should do?"" and he said, ""I have no idea."" That's the kind of stuff I have surrounding me on all sides.


I am told that I cannot do this thing I thought of, but no one has any kind of idea for what I could do.

I'm very tired. Very depressed. And alone physically, technically, emotionally, intellectually - I want to socialize, but there's no one available.


I feel like a total jerk, because I try to stay in touch will college friends, but I've started guessing in my head how many times they will talk to me before not responding anymore... Like, how many pity conversations they'll give. There is **always** the, ""That can't be how the system works!"" and ""I thought it was really easy to get food stamps/medicaid...! etc"" conversations. I know it must be frustrating for them to not have any ideas or solutions. No one likes being faced by a no-win, no-control scenario. That's okay, there's a lot of psychology and cultural reasons behind that.

They are busy, and far away, and doing really well. 


Yep, my situation is grim, and I know that no one has the resources to help, and so talking to me can be really depressing. 

Where do i even start? 

Thank you so very much for reading

**tldr: Physical and emotional abuse whole life. Relied on academic performance for identity. That failed (combined various reasons). No idea how to improve any part of life.**

29y4c4,1,2014-07-06,Why are we still together?,whathaseddone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/29y4c4/why_are_we_still_together/,"We've been in some kind of relationship for about a year and a half. We met and it was supposed to be a one night stand. We were supposed to hook up and then say goodbye. I go to school 2000 miles away and there was no chance of us being together. But we didn't say goodbye. We started talking every day. I never wanted to put a label on our relationship. I had ended up a long distance relationship a year before, and because of my own fucked up reasons I didn't want to label us. I thought it would be easier if we didn't have a title. Easier to say goodbye if we fell in love with someone else. Easier to justify seeing other people. I didn't realize until recently how much this hurt you. Thats 1. 
Neither of us hooked up with anyone until next fall. WE didn't see much of each other over the summer -- you had gotten an internship in india while I stayed in our home town. In the fall my friends introduced me to a girl. I don't know why I saw her -- I didn't particularly like her -- but I felt like it was something that I had to do. I broke up with her. I got depressed after I injured myself lifting. I was bedridden, depressed, and numb because of the Vicodin. I stopped talking to you. I stopped talking to everyone. I didn't know that you were also depressed -- your family hates you and you were depressed about college. I didn't know how much I hurt you that winter. I was supposed to be there but I just made things worse. Thats 2. 
We met up in the winter and I was disinterested. Thats 3. I was still depressed and leaving in a week to India( how funny that we both visited this country for radically different reasons). When I came back I had a new perspective on life. Seeing people who were dying of hunger, living lives devoid of even the most basic american luxuries but still able to find joy in their lives is a good way of giving you perspective. I still have this perspective and I hope that it isn't some cliched perspective that you get for a few months then quickly abandon. I came back happy. I came back healthier. I came back wanting to do better with you. I tried to make up for all I did to you. On my last day we were completely honest. I told you about the girl I saw for 2 weeks; you told me that you had had sex with countless men You told me you didn't expect me to be like this. You had started to fall in love with someone else(though you didn't say love). You were crying. I was crying. I told you to pursue a relationship with him. You deserve someone that can hold you when youre sad. I can't do that. Is that 1?
We continued to talk. I drunkenly told you I loved you. On another occasion we almost arranged for you to visit. We called southwest, gotten a quote and all we needed to do was pay. You called me the next day: I can't do that to my boyfriend. We both know it wouldn't be platonic. I told you that you should visit me this summer, I'll be at school all summer working, but at the last minute I panicked -- to this day I don't know why. I gave you bs excuses. You saw through them and ended things. Thats 4. 
I somehow mended things with you. We promised not to talk until I came back in a month. In that time the unimaginable happened: I fell for someone else. is that 5? 
WE met up in the summer for a week before I left. We made out. I forced the situation. You felt bad, I felt bad, but neither of us felt bad enough to stop. We kept on seeing each other. You saw me more than your boyfriend. You came to my birthday party and my mom loved you. I went to your speech event and your mom didn't. 
We had sex on the last day I was home. You were broken. You hated yourself and couldn't stop crying. I don't know how it happened. BS. I got us alone and slowly pushed you to do it. Thats 6. 
We continued talking. You broke up with your boyfriend -- he was going to a different college than you. We arranged for you to meet me this summer. Finally. 
Today you called me. You're getting back together with your ex. You won't be telling him about us. You wont be seeing me this summer. Thats 1 for sure. I told you that I was ready to commit. I'll graduate next year and I want to go back home -- to be close to you; to be close to my family. You want us to be together but you don't want to be whatever you'll be when I start seeing the other girl. I like her -- more than I've ever liked anyone -- but I know that I won't be able to be with her long-term. She'll be a sophomore, I'll be a senior. But I want to be with her for at least a year. Is it selfish? yeah, but I cant help how I feel. Bs. I can make a decision. I told you that I choose you, but it didn't matter.
You want us to be together. You said that I'm the man you see yourself ending up with. I want that to be true. But can it happen? I want to go back home, but I also want to join the military. But that'll separate us. I want to work here for a year, but that'll also separate us. I want us to be together, but should we even try. You want your ex right now because he will give you more attention than me. He'll love you while I'll be with someone else. Is that fucked up? yes. You'll lie to him for that slight comfort. But should we even try. Is our relationship worth it? Is there too much history? I love you but do I love you enough to put my dreams on hold for even a little bit? My heart says yes and no at the same time.
I love you. I'm willing to sacrifice a lot for you but what if I fall in love with this girl? What if you fall in love with someone else? Or choose your ex over me in a year? Maybe we should have said goodbye a year and a half ago. Maybe we're so fucked up that we deserve each other. Maybe we don't deserve anyone.

29y5wv,19,2014-07-06,"Shit is starting to crash since my aunt started living with my parents and me, but I'm keeping my shit together.",exmoose-throwaway,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/29y5wv/shit_is_starting_to_crash_since_my_aunt_started/,"I've been an ex-moose for around four years now, give or take a couple months. I'm in college now going into my second year but nowhere near ready to start a life with no financial support. A large part of that was because of my parents always encouraging me to rely on them for absolutely everything - not allowing me to work when I was finally able to by law, not letting me go to the corner store by myself (even though I'm a man and men are totally allowed to do shit like that), not letting me meet up with friends even for truly academic pursuits. I'm working on changing that mindset. In short, I still need my parents' support, and recognizing that I've been faking Islam for a while.

My parents didn't start trying to force religion - telling me **my** religion is very important to **me** - until a couple of months before I went off to my first year of college, so the last 14 or so months have been more intense than the rest of my life. I could still get away with telling them I've been keeping up with prayers, I feel connections with God, I haven't been drinking alcohol or eating pork and they'd be satisfied.

I came home for break around three months ago - spring break, lasting one week. When I told my dad I decided to major in philosophy (it's actually a hybrid philosophy/history/comparative literature major to focus on narratology and the implications of the narrative form), he was all for it. My mom did the usual ""what kind of work can you get in that?"" but she was more or less ok with it. They were fine, until my aunt said ""most philosophers I know are crazy, and a lot of philosophers believe that there is no God."" She's planted the seed in my parents.

Now she's getting my mother to force me and my siblings to watch religious films, spend nights and weekends at mosques and read quaran rather than any literature or philosophical doctrines, she's happy with my not having a summer job if it means I can spend more time reading about old Mo' and his jolly old pals.

My aunt saw me reading a really fascinating piece on the use of biblical commands to subvert Roman government which I began reading after a class on Nietzsche regarding the subversion of custom. She decided to bring it up with my mom standing near, dropping the line ""you can read about Jesus in the Quaran, too, this is all about the biblical laws, right?"" She wouldn't listen to me when I told her it wasn't really - that it was more about the subversion of custom and law, not about the propagation of Christian doctrine. Some good her Sociology degree is doing her.

My parents, their friends (that jamaa' full of people I fucking hate, who manage to be both boring and annoying, who grunt and are out of breath during taraweeh prayer because that's the only damn exercise they get), their friends' children, none of them had any suspicion of my turning away from Islam until my aunt came along and started with her holier-than-thou nonsense. Now I've got to work extra hard during these next ninety or so days I'm home to convince them I'm working as hard for my B.A. as I am for jannah. I'm talking not faking fasts or prayers, koranic memorization (even though I lost the ability to memorize when my classes actually became interesting and required more thinking than memorization), the whole nine yards.

To fix this, I'm planning on getting a job here ASAP, one with demanding and odd hours. I've already bought my ticket back to school, and once there I will work on getting (1) a job for the school year and (2) a summer job or paid internship. I joined a fraternity last year and will move into the house at the end of next year, and the job through the school year will help me make rent, the summer job and/or internship will make it so that I have an excuse to stay 800 miles away from my parents, my aunt, everyone for the three and a half months between my second and third year."

I've just heard from my team leader that they're interested in hiring me, preferably after this summer. 

The problem is that I have two years left on my programme, so taking this job would mean that I end my studies after one year. What's left on my programme is courses in cognitive science, requirements analysis, participatory design, a lot of elective courses (mostly focused on computer science because of my institution's main focus), final thesis and an internship.

The web agency isn't great at UX and the only other interaction designer that works there isn't that good - but I think that it could work out well if I take some own responsibility for my personal development. It's a nice workplace overall and they seem to care a lot about UX.

Getting a job this early would be really beneficial if it's the right thing to do - I would start my salary development and my real experience in the field earlier and save a lot of money. But maybe the remaining courses on my programme are really important? Maybe this job opportunity isn't the best to start with because of their little experience with UX? 

Do you have any thoughts on this? Should I take the job or continue my studies?"

Hello all, thanks for reading. I need a little advice.

My gf and I have been together for almost 3 years, living together for 1 year 3 months.  We graduated university together and moved to the city where we got careers at different offices. 

I jumped right into an entry level business - marketing career and she started off as a receptionist in the nonProfit sector, recently being promoted to a coordinator position (starts Monday, woohoo!).

Our jobs are vastly different. She works a set 9-5 while my job was a lot more lenient. Sometimes I work from 8-6, sometimes 10-4, depends entirely on the workload. My company is a team of 4 entrepreneurs while she works for an organization with a staff of 150+.  My company is laid back on the policies and procedures and due to the nature of our work and clients, there's a lot of shit to do for 4 people. With me being the junior and three seniors, I get a large priority list.

Now, a lot of our clients are international. So it is not unexpected for me to sit in on a call at 9pm or 6am.  With the workload, I also find myself working at home a lot and on weekends occasionally for an hour or two.

My girlfriend hates this. She gets mad at me whenever I have to work from home and throws in little comments that really stress me out sometimes.  I already work my ass off at work, and I don't want to be working at home but it's necessary sometimes. I get stressed when I know I have to now because I know she will be upset immediately. So I usually wait until late at night or early in the morning while she's asleep to get it done. This makes me very tired however.

She still gets upset. She wants me to come to bed with her, or take the subway with her in the morning (if I have to go in early I can't obviously).  Now I know these are all legitimate concerns on her part. She doesn't want me to marry my job, and ignore her.  But the thing is I don't.  I spend every waking minute with her.  I feel like i  always prioritize time with her over everything else. If I have to spend an hour after work doing something, the other 6 hours of the day are with her and our dog! On weekends, I do whatever she wants to do usually. The point is, I spend a lot of time with her and I don't think an hour out of that day is a big deal. If I told her I wanted to go to the gym for an hour on a Saturday it wouldn't be an issue. But If I replace that with an hour doing a report to send off then she gets pissed. Its very stressful.

I should note that she thinks I work every day.. For the last two months I've worked outside of the workday maybe three times..

This is a big skill set builder for me and good money for a kid straight out of school. Hell I'm lucky to even have a salary based career right now. I don't want to have to quit but I can't live with walking on eggshells to not make my girl friend upset and not get my work done to piss off my work.

We had a conversation just now where I asked her what I could do to make it better. She wants me to have a dedicated home life, and a work life separate from each other. I told her I could promise not to bring any work home and stay at work until I was totally finished for the day but I can't control if something occasionally is needed for 1 hour on a weekend or if there's something I am needed to call in to.  She didn't say anything at all.

To me, it feels like she's mad because she can't control it and doesn't agree with it because her job is 9-5. She has told me I shouldn't do as much as I do without being compensated. She has come home while I was finishing work sometimes (I get to work from home occasionally) and asks what I'm doing very sarcastically. At this particular time I was doing some intern ""do this dumb task for your boss"" task by fixing and checking his voicemail. All I get from her is a ""why are you doing that, why can't he do that himself?"".  ... This is shit I don't control. I get told to do something, I prioritize it and do it. Even if its stupid.  While i get that me working at home while she's there upsets here, I don't think she's in any place personally to judge what I do at work..that's my business and doesn't affect her one little bit.

So I am looking for some advice on what to do. I don't want to quit since its good money and good experience, but I don't want my GF to leave me either. I am sick of being stressed about either upsetting her or not getting my work done. It feels like its one or the other.  Any suggestions?

Tldr: My girlfriend hates my job but its an important career builder for me. I prioritize time with her but its still not enough. What do?"

29yv42,0,2014-07-06,My story,robodylan123,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/29yv42/my_story/,"For those that have seen my other post: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/29vdeu/must_read_kids_cant_use_computers/. I am going to give you my side of the story. First let me try and better explain the others point as some of you seem to be confused. The thing is many adult think that our generation is tech savvy. He is saying that most kids have no idea how it works, just that it works. If something were to go wrong they would be lost and get upset, unable to fix the problem and run off to there parents or a repair shop for help. A tech savvy person is someone who understands, even if vaguely, how something works. I like the authors analogy of a car, most people know how to use a car. But, most people, if the car stops working, would be absolutely clueless. The author says you have no need to know how to fix it, but be able to understand what is wrong. It's also great not to be ripped off by repair shops, this is true for computers and automobiles. Another clarification is that the author is not saying that this needs to be fixed or is a problem. he is simple saying that many people don't understand how completely clueless their child is to technology. With that said, I am going to share my own personal story. I got my first computer when I was 11, after being selected to participate in a program run by RIT(Rochester Institute of Technology). Where we participated in a variety activities including the assembly of a computer, which is incredibly easy even though some think it takes a genius, learning what each thing did and how to install it. Taking it home I of course jumped right in, downloading games and browsing the internet. I of course, like any kid at the time, bought and downloaded Minecraft. Later learning that you could mod it, I downloaded MCP and watched tutorials on how to use it. At this point there were little no tutorials on how to actually how to make the mod, so I, using Eclipse, modified clearly marked variables, playerSpeed = 1, and doing things like playerSpeed = 5. Looking at the code I had a great understaning of how a program worked and eventually, after getting a book from the library, taught myself Java. Everyday I would get mod requests from classmates that wanted their own mod. Now I wanted to make my own game. I jumped around to every language possible, never being able to find a good tutorial on how too build a game from scratch. Eventually I found Python and an amazing eBooK, http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/. I made some very simple, and looking back very badly written, games. I then went on to learn about the ludum dare. My first contest went well, I learned tons, and actually published a game. Available Here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&amp;uid=30057. One of the things that I learned was that python is great, if you have it. Most people couldn't play the game and  it was very buggy. Also, I managed to make a friend from Germany, I was streaming my warmup coding and he jumped into the chat and we chatted eventaully connecting through skype. We talked for a couple hours and later throughout the ludum dare.Now, wanting to make game that anyone could play I looked into HTML5, Javascript(Canvas), and PHP. I saved up my money and went and bought a raspberry pi. http://www.raspberrypi.org/ I then installed raspian and setup a webserver following a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgcNBjIJNYs. I then watched some tutorials and read books about HTML and began making a website. I looked very blocked and colorful at first then I brought it done to just shades with a simplified look. It looked pretty good, if I do say myself. Then going back to my original plan I started making HTML5 games. Most weren't that good. My main problem and something I couldn't quite understand was how use objects and instances of an object. So most games just had a player and one enemy. I then started talking to my German Teacher, who I am greatly thankful for. We talked about making a website. So I went home and within a week I had a complete website on my hands. I started making a place for her to upload a gallery and added a part that generated JavaScript games. Soon I lost interest in the project and changed the website to my own personal one. Later in the year we were talking about having classes in the school for programming. She talked with some people and she helped setup Project Lead The Way and STEM in our school. The programs allow kids to get college credits and get internships in High School for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. She even set it up so I could teach a class in the MS, HTML5 and Javascript. The class was after school and only for a select of students. Coming up was the ludum dare and had no idea what language I was going to use. Talking to the kid in germany I decided to learn C#, which he used. Now this was only 3 days before the contest and I needed to learn it. I looked at tutorials but to avail. eventually the kid for Germany ended up teaching me. And then we had a great idea to join up and enter the Jam as a team. With the theme of Beneath the Surface. We spent many long hours. He did most of the code as I was still learning so I only wrote about a fifth of the code. The game out quite good and we published it. http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&amp;uid=30057 . Though there was some bad feedback the game was actually something and distributable. Since then I have made more games and programs. Which you can view atleast the source of on GitHub https://github.com/robodylan. Everything from Games, to a simple AI, to a DNA Visualizer. I am currently 14 and am entering HS this year. I am hoping to make something this summer. I am seeking to enter RIT, and Not just because their food is awesome! I hope someday I will be able to make a post about how this lead to me being some success story from a small town. My view is that programming is essential, not only for a job skill but also a life skill. learning how to do things efficiently and using problem solving skills. I would have never have grasped trig if not for writing my own particle system. It's great for learning math and just about every other subject. Sorry for the long story and lack of a TL:DR but for those that read it I thank you. Bye :)"

I am a rising senior attending a reputable CS program in the US and have two internships: One with a company not known at all for its tech. and another this summer with a prestigious finance company that also happens to have a reputable tech. division as well. However, I have never really been motivated to do side projects or any programming on the side. I'm usually fairly busy during the semester and I after work this summer, I am always too tired and lazy to do any programming after work. The only time I can make for side projects are weekends and breaks during school. However, I really like spending this time relaxing and hanging out with people. At this point, with graduating next year and applying to jobs in the fall, I will not be able to put any major side projects on my resume. Will having internships be enough when applying to the large tech. companies on the West Coast, or will my severe lack of side projects hurt me?

I want a top of the line gaming (mostly for games like DayZ, Star Citizen, Revival (still in production) etc), 3D modeling, rendering, editing, watch my movies on kind of machine and I want it to be uber fast. I'm a full time art intern at a decent sized gaming studio and can finally afford a computer. Not just a computer but the computer of my dreams. I'd like to start off with just enough parts to get it working but I want those parts to be the best so I can deck this thing out super funky fresh. No SLI or water cooling right off the bat. I know certain video cards work better for gaming and some work better for doing my work. I want a balance that excels in both areas. If anyone has a spec list or some advice I'd appreciate it. The last time I did any sort of computer building was in high school 03' under the direction of my friend who the computer was for. The only thing I've had since then was a personal laptop cuz I'm from the hood and had no money so throwing in some safe ways to go about building would be extremely helpful. Please stay on topic. I know where everything goes but am ignorant to what's going to get the job done better than anything else.

29z6uj,0,2014-07-06,Apprentice to IT Tech,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/29z6uj/apprentice_to_it_tech/,"Hey there guys I understand this subreddit is more for people in higher job roles but hopefully one day I’ll get to a position where some of you are at.

Let me first explain that I’m currently on an apprenticeship (some of you may know this as an internship) I am 9 months into it (out of 12) and possibly have a job interview next week for IT Technician. I will be able to complete my apprenticeship if I am to get the job. 

The interview process requires me to submit a letter of interest for the job and I’m not sure how/what to write for it. As you may be able to tell my writing skills aren’t fantastic but I really want to impress and hopefully succeed and get the job. The application process needs to be completed in the next 2-3 days and there’s a possible 3 guys that are going to go for the job (all being apprentices like me). I applied for the same position about 4 months ago and lost out to another apprentice who is now qualified and working there full time. I really want this job, love working there and enjoy the environment a lot. But I have been working at another site for the last 8 months so I’m very new to this site so don’t know as much about this system as the other candidates so that puts me at an immediate disadvantage. 

As I am only an apprentice I am not qualified and don’t have many skills in IT but to all of my friends and family I’m known as the ‘IT guy’ and very good at trouble shooting etc. At home I have built computers and we now have a full automated Plex media server running and also a full CCTV set up running. I have good knowledge of Android OS but I know this isn’t useful at work. At work I use programs such as Active Directory a lot, veeam, PXE (imaging) and other programs.
If anyone has any tips/advice for me for my application letter or interview I’d really appreciate that.

Edit 1: I work in a school.

TL:DR - Applying for IT Tech job, currently an apprentice, need to write an application letter for the job + need advice for my interview. 

Thanks

I first got into python about two years ago after having to make a very small task automate itself in ArcGIS. I recently figured that it might be a good skill to have to further my career as many departments of my internship company are using this.

At the moment, just for fun and learning, I'm trying to build a small application using wxPython and postgresqlite to save information about cars. I previously used a SQLite file as my way of storage, but wanting to learn more complex things (allowing multiple computers in the house to get information from one database) a friend recommended I try postgresql and so far I've been able to transfer the code from the sqlite database with no trouble. I definitely see many useful tutorials out in the web and would like to know if you have found certain pages useful or have any recommendations for me?

29zc79,7,2014-07-06,The Mirror Sickness [OC],[deleted],creepy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/29zc79/the_mirror_sickness_oc/,"   The “Humble Ear Outreach Program” was the most heinous, detestable part of the four years I spent in medical school.  It operated on the premise that forcing aspiring psychiatrists to offer free talk therapy to the homeless population would prepare them for their chosen career.  I cannot imagine what sort of depraved human being would dream up such a thing. Regardless, if I wanted to be a competitive applicant for my internship of choice, I would have to participate. 


   You cannot imagine the things I heard in that dingy little office. You see these people every day, wandering the streets of New York in mud-caked clothes, muttering to themselves over a plastic bottle of vodka.  But I’ll bet you never stopped to wonder what runs through their minds all day as they stumble about in a heroine induced stupor. I’ll grant you, many of them are kind-hearted, mild-mannered human beings.  The worst of them, however, have running internal dialogues unpalatable to even the soundest of minds. They told me things. Things that would keep me awake long after my shifts were over. Things I would recall from the corner of my mind as I heaved stale whiskey into the toilet bowl at four in the morning. There are stranger things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio…


   The most villainous and vile of all the program’s patients, the one who was slowly causing ulcerations to form in the lining of my stomach, was Caroline. 


   A horrid mess of strawberry-blonde, dirt-laden curls spewed from the top of her head like fiery vomit from the mouth of an intoxicated dragon. Many heavy jackets were worn, one atop another, upon her bony frame. Her good eye was locked on my own, the lazy one turned violently to the side, twitching whenever its partner moved. 


   “My husband wanted to die of the sickness, Mr. Robles. I just knows it. I always knowed it, I think. He was happy when he went, yes he was.”  She bobbed enthusiastically as she spoke. 


   “The sickness? You have HIV, Caroline?” I mumbled, thumbing through her medical records. I had spent the last twenty four hours in the psych ward. Remembering words that had been spoken only moment earlier was proving difficult. 


   “No sir, I doesn’t…” She raised a finger, but I cut her off.

   “Hepatitis?”

   “No…I”

   “Neurosyphilis?” I arched an incredulous eyebrow. 

   “No, Mr. Robles. I got the mirror sickness.” She whispered behind a cupped hand, although we were the only two people in the room. 

   “Yeah, well. We don’t have a titer test for mirror antibodies. Sorry for the inconvenience.” I grumbled as I massaged the caffeine-born stitch in my forehead. Sleep deprivation had always made me grouchy. I needed to reign my sarcasm in. An unprofessional attitude wasn't very becoming for a would-be psychiatrist. Heaven forbid any of this got back to my adviser. 

   “It’s real, Mr. Robles. I know it is. I saw it take my husband.” She gurgled. 

   “Great. Well if you’re so sure you ought to just walk upstairs. I’m sure they’ll offer you an infusion of recombinant mirror protein and you will feel loads better.” So much for getting ahead of my sarcasm.

   “The sickness has me, Mr. Robles. They will come for me too. They will come for me soon.” Her index finger pointed at the ceiling, her lips pulled away from her brown teeth in an unholy grin. 

   “No they won’t. I cannot call the white coats on you. The program protects you from that. Even if I did, you’d just become an inpatient. Then I’d have to see you on my next shift. I can guarantee you, the white coats are not coming to get you. Cross my heart and hope to die.”

   “It’s not the white coats I’m worried about. It’s the others. The sickness took them first, now they’ll take me.” She was either entirely oblivious to the fact that I’d been a sarcastic asshat through the entire conversation or she simply didn’t give a shit.  

   “Caroline, is someone at home threatening you? Are you in danger? Do you feel safe?” I groaned. These were question I had to ask. If she were to affirm any of these things, the hospital would be forced to protect her. I went ahead and ordered some blood work as I waited for a response. It would be helpful to know which drugs she was using, and I didn’t care to try and pry the truth from her. 

   “I’m in danger, Mr. Robles, but not from a person. There’s nothing you can do.” Soft laughter shook her frame, making her exoskeleton of coats dance. 

   “Brilliant. Well that about settles that then, wouldn’t you say? If you’d be so kind as to stop by the lab, there will be blood tests waiting for you.” I sighed, extending my hand for the obligatory hand-shake. 

   Her bony fingers gripped mine with undue enthusiasm, her lazy eye jerking sideways as she laughed. 

   

   The phone rang at ten-forty in the evening, far too late for casual conversation. It was Thomas, the program director for our chapter of “Humble Ears Outreach”. His voice was laced with worry. 

   “Doctor Robles? Have you heard the news?” 

   “I’m not a Doctor yet, Thomas. Besides, Doctor Robles is my father. We know each other well enough, you ought to call me Benjamin.  But no, haven’t heard any news. No news is good news in our line of work, so I assume you have bad news for me?” 

   “ ’Fraid so, Benjamin. Your patient showed up in the ER this afternoon. Dead on arrival. They haven’t been able to determine a cause of death. Her body’s still in the morgue. They’re trying to get as much insight about her conditions as possible. You’re the closest thing she’s seen to a Doctor in years. I don’t suppose you can give me any useful information?”

   “Oh Christ, Thomas. I might have something useful. I had some blood work done a few days ago. Let me pull it up on my laptop and see if the results have posted yet.” I pulled my computer into my lap, cradling the phone with my shoulder. “Yes. Here we go. Electrolytes were normal. Metabolic panels normal. CBC normal and…woah..”

   “You’ve got something?” His voice was edged with hope. 

   “Nothing causative, I’m afraid. It’s the darndest thing though. All her drug screens came back negative. No heroine, no alcohol, no hallucinogens, not even methadone. She was right weird, Thomas. I was sure she was using. She had this lazy eye that rolled to one side. It just bothered the hell out of me.” 

   “That’s just all kinds of odd, Benjamin. I don’t know what to tell ya. I’ll give you a ring as soon as I know what did her in.” 

   “Thanks. Good luck, Thomas.” 

   It was about an hour later, and I was about half a bottle of Syrah deep, when the phone rang again. Stumbling, I made my way to the phone and swept it from the wall. 

   “Hullo?” Inebriation made itself evident in my slurred words and tone. 

“Terribly sorry to call at this hour. Is this Mr. Robles?” The voice on the other end of the line was just above a whisper. The spoken words quivered with anxiety. Probably a new student, I told myself. Third years were always phoning in, looking for advice or help from anyone and everyone.  Poor bastard.

   “This is James Henderson, the morgue technician. Mr. Robles I have your patient, Caroline, here. I know you had been very involved in the case and I was just wondering if you had dropped by this evening.” 

   “No, I don’t believe I’ve ever been down to the morgue at this hospital. Why do you ask? Did you need information regarding the case?” I felt beads of cold sweat creep down my back.

   “No sir. It’s odd, really. You know the morgue door looks from the inside since there’s always at least one of us on duty and we don’t want the local kids breaking in. I as working alone this evening, or at least I thought I was working alone, when I turned around and saw the door hanging ajar.”

   The phone tumbled from my clumsy hands. I slid to the floor. 

   How much time passed, I couldn’t tell you. The empty bottle of Syrah lay sideways on the table, dripping red liquid lazily onto the carpet. Even in a city like New York, there’s an hour where everything slows down, when many of the glittering lights are extinguished and the sounds of life below sink to a hum. What happened next took place in those hushed hours. I know that much.

   There was a deep thudding at the door, not so much a knocking as the sound a body makes when makes unintentional contact with a wall. Empty bottle held like a weapon over my shoulder, I crept into the hall. 

   The door was hanging wide open, though I had never heard it creek on its hinges. I ran forward, eager to have it closed. Behind the door was a petrified jacket, its form stiffened by layers of sweat and dirt.  I kicked it out into the hall and closed the door. 

   I caught a glance of someone in my hallway mirror.

“Caroline? Is that you, Caroline? This is extremely fucking illegal, Caroline. You cannot visit me at my apartment!” Madness spewed forth from my own, drunken lips. I knew full well that Caroline was belly up on an autopsy table.

   As I made my way into the living room, my vision split. Two slightly over-lain images of the room in front of me danced and flirted with one another. I should have never had that entire bottle of wine! I fought to focus, knocking over furniture as I stumbled to the bedroom. 

“The sickness came for me, Mr. Robles. The sickness will come for you too.” The words were hissed from the bathroom. I dropped the bottle of wine in favor of my baseball bat. Holding my breath and trembling as much as my stupor would allow, I barged into the bathroom.

As quick glance around revealed no one. I slung the shower curtain aside, but the bathtub was empty. 

“Don’t look at them, Mr.Robles.” The words circulated like humidity in the enclosed space. 

   In spite of my skewed vision, I caught sight of something off in the mirror. Turning toward it, I realized why I was seeing double.

   While my right eye looked directly at me, my left eye was rolled to the side, jerking violently as it swiveled.  And although I did not smile, a wicked grin spread across my reflection’s face.

My own lips moved as the words were spoken.

“I told you not to look, Mr. Robles.”

It's 2001/2002, I was in High School. My school had normal high school (HS) in the morning and the afternoons were dedicated to a ""technical school"" (TS) which high school students could do in parallel with HS. I did the IT TS and we used the only computer lab that the school had: a room with some 40 PCs with windows 98 at the time. This lab was used by each class (from 1st grade until the end of high school) one time per week for computer-related activities.

As part of the mandatory internship for the TS, a couple colleagues and I were responsible for the maintenance of this lab, under the supervision of an IT teacher.

One morning a 5th grade teacher comes bursting to my class (the high school class closest to the lab) asking for anyone from the IT TS:
&gt; Teacher: I need to know what the IT TS people did to break the computer!  

I immediately stand up and say that I'm from the TS and I'm one of the maintenance interns, she shouts some thing like
&gt; Teacher: COME WITH ME, you guys *misconfigured* the computers and now we can't do anything  
&gt; Me, (*to my self*): This is going to be good!

We go up the staris to the room full of clueless 5th graders.
&gt; Me: What are you trying to do and what happens when you try it?  
&gt; Teacher: We are trying to write an essay about our neighborhood and you did something with the computer that does not allow us to do.  
&gt; Me: What *happens*  when you try? Can you try in front of me?

And she opens IE, browses to some geocities-like webpage about the neighborhood and tries to copy the text. Instead, a javascript  dialog box appears saying stuff like: ""You can't copy from this webpage"".

&gt; Me: It's not us, it's the webpage author. He added a script that prevents right clicking.  
&gt; Teacher: Why did you do that?  
&gt; Me: We didn't.

Then I proceed to show the page source with the javascript code and teach her to do the left+right click trick.

When i come back to the class, everyone (specially the TS people) is looking at me with a big question mark on their faces, to which I reply with
&gt; Me: She doesn't know javascript.

Laghter ensues.

29zmp4,52,2014-07-06,Let's Talk Community,EQNChris,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/29zmp4/lets_talk_community/,"Hold onto your butts... 

So I'm starting with that cheeky statement as I'm completely aware this is going to be a point of contention yet this seems to be something rumbling in the background.

RTX has become the biggest example of this. On the one side, we have the incredible success of the indiegogo campaign and a completely sold out convention, packed panels. On the other side, the panels get swamped by people being inappropriate (heck, there's countless examples on the streams and posts on this sub-reddit) and folks just generally acting like douches.

Some folks have gone as far as saying to create a different sub-reddit on here and generally speaking about how folks don't want to go to conventions and just don't want to get involved in the community stuff.

The question is: is it worth doing something or have things got to the point now where the community is so large it's just a painful thing to accept this is where things are now?

---------------------------------------------------------------

***edit***  just want to say that thanks to folks actually having a sensible discussion on this. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
***Feedback Edit***

So I've split some of this into RTX stuff and then general community things.

What seems to be the general feedback theme though, which causes the negativity from some fans, is the lack of differentiating between fans behaving as RT do from videos in real life which is resulting in a lot of inappropriate behaviour. This then seeps into lots of the community, including fans over analysing (the irony isn't lost on me) staff behaviour and missing that it's a persona on a video. This then comes out on things like livestreams at conventions where there's a noticeable cooling in the room when the new AH hires are announced - the thought was that it was feeling of entitlement from some of the fans in the room instead of being happy for guys being hired for being great content creators.

Also, a lot of what folks posted is because they don't want RTX to become the next PAX, where it becomes so bloated that people can casually get away with this behaviour and can act like [this] (http://www.returnofkings.com/37273/a-guide-for-getting-laid-at-anime-conventions) and get away with it.

**RTX SPECIFIC ISSUES**

*Behaviour:* a lot of lowest of the low denominators out there. Live stream had inappropriate touching guy (lets be fair, if he'd done that to a woman, he would have been kicked out). PLus inappropriate gestures behind others asking questions to get a cheap laugh. Sort of fine once but then it still carried on through all the main panels because it wasn't controlled.

*Guardians:* complaints about language used by Guardians, lack of training etc. not being able to handle large groups when they get loud etc. Lazer Team call was particularily bad looking from the outside, with Matt having a lot of trouble getting the mob under control. 

*Shout Outs &amp; Requests:* was specifically brought up in the second AH panel after the first panel became a mess of them.

**Community Feedback about RTX Issues**

*Q&amp;A's:* a lot of people have been posting about how other cons pre-screen those who want to ask questions. I know this might seem counter to having the option to be open with the community, yet if you want questions and only questions, there needs to be pre-screening. Have a line inside the room (at the back, out the way) for people who want to ask questions, have an intern or guardian pre-check the question, if they deviate from it, get them off the line and move on. Those on the panel itself should not have to deal with it.

*Guardians:* so this year the guardians seemed completely swamped with numbers. The behaviour seemed to vary a lot, the language used went seriously offensive at times too. Yes, they're a volunteer workforce, yet if RTX is going to get larger, general feedback seems to be to have a trained professional team in place primarily with the volunteer numbers only complimenting them and not running things.

*Shout-Outs, Requests etc:* the AH panel handled this better second time around, having anything that fans had brought be taken by guardians after the panel and no shout outs. Autographs seemed to be a similar response, Jack worded it well in they have the booths for autographs and pics. If you really wanted either, try to get to those but there needs to be a greater awareness that they simply can't interact personally with 30,000+ fans.

If you scroll through the comments on here, you'll see further down how some members posted about not wanting to go to RTX because of how the convention comes across on the livestreams and from posts on places like here. Yes, people will probably now always pay to go to RTX because of the size of the fanbase, however don't forget out of that horde there was only 36,000 odd willing to fund a new project in Lazer Team. When it comes to people parting cash, perception of what the company stands for is a big issue.


**Other General Community Thoughts**

*YouTube:* apparently a lost cause to most who posted here, pretty much no-one bothers to read comments. Little to no community you would think, however Burnie seemed to have had more success with getting positive discussion going on recent videos because they were with his kids and he sat in chat for a while once the video was posted. Only you get to see the metrics behind the scenes to see if more of that level of interaction has any positive results but it didn't go unnoticed

*Reddit:* bunch of whiny bitches who complain ;) Heck, the RWBY sub-reddit is nice enough, what's going on here? Seems there's even a new sub-reddit made simply because some wanted to be able to have a sensible discussion about things. Becoming a sort of comment wasteland like YouTube.

I have worked retail for a number of years and nothing pisses me off more than a customer who takes my kindness for granted. Incoming story in 3..2..1...

Since it is the fourth of July weekend, we have a large influx of customers who come in to shop because of our many deals placed throughout the store. I am currently in another area that I do not manage because I had just clocked out for lunch and I wanted to exchange some items. I am near the register and in comes this middle aged woman who asks me to help her. (Just realized fuck I still had my nametag on)

Customer: ""Hello sir, could you help me find a couple pairs of levi's?""

Me: ""Of course I will, what are you looking for.."" (Noooo im hungry and i just want to exchange these clothes is what I am thinking in my head)

Customer: ""I need 505's and 511's in sizes 36/32 &amp; 34/32.""

Me: ""Sure absolutely, let me direct you to the tables and I can suggest a couple colors and we can go from there.""

Customer: ""No No No I'll stay here near the register you just pick them out since you are young and know what's good to wear.""

At this point I am a little bit agitated because i know that's she going to be picky but I do as asked. I walk all the way over to the other side to pick out what she wanted and return back.

Customer: ""No No..these are too light..don't you guys have darker colors.""

Me: ""I am sure we do so lets walk other there together so that I can get a better idea of what you are looking for..""

Customer: ""No No i'll stay here..""

This happens THREE more times, when she could have just walked over. So finally she comes over because she wanted to check out another item so we go over the jeans and she ends up picking pairs that I had already suggested and she had said no. She also asks me if her coupons will work in which I tell her that they will not work for anything Levis. 

So walking back to the register there's a man who had a pair of Levis shorts waiting to be checked out. (He will be named douchebag). 

Customer: ""Can i go in front of him because I was here first..I have a baby waiting at home?""

(Well maybe you shouldn't be here..)

Customer: ""Actually he only has one item so he can go..""

Douchebag: ""I have a coupon for my purchase""

Me: ""Im sorry sir but we aren't allowed to use any coupons on levis...""

Of course douchebag flips his shit. After ranting for five minutes while the customer I was helping previously was distracted talking on the phone. I decide to be nice.

Me: ""Okay sir, we want you to leave here happy so I will provide a courtesy coupon for you...""

I was nice enough to give him an override because we WANT to take care of our customers. Boy did I make a mistake. The douche turns to the lady I was helping earlier and says..

Douche: ""Hey the coupons works, he made an exception for me!""

Are you serious? Of course I had to override it for her too now because I didn't want her to flip her shit as well. She wanted three separate transactions with me taking $10 off them all and of I told her no and was not going to budge with that. After it was all said and done...my lunch was over. This entire ordeal lasted almost an hour so I just quickly exchanged what I had and starved. I hate how we have to bend over backwards for EVERY customer..especially the douchebags.

Tl:dr Tried to be nice by overriding a coupon, he goes and tells the annoying customer behind him that I had previously told the coupons don't work that I made an exception for him forcing me to do it for her. "

Today I got fed up with the issue (ive had it for about 3 months) and called to have a warranty process started.

1. The voice recordings are LAUGHABLE, its like they got the first poor intern they could find to make telephone prompts for a multimillion dollar corporation... 

2. The person I spoke to was nice, but it seems HTC has trained their employees to **completely brush over the issue** and not admit that its HTC's problem, there is no process in place for **the most common problem** with the HTC One M7... She told me I needed to call back in order to continue my service request and ""debug"" my phone... There have been 2 software patches for this, hell even running Cyanogenmod doesn't fix it, its in no way software related and cannot be debugged...

3. I attempted to contact them using their website but lo and behold the customer support form doesn't work and gives me this error
""Uncaught ReferenceError: __doPostBack is not defined""
awesome....

To make matters worse she must have saved my email improperly because I have no email with my ticket number 2 hours later...

This is extremely frustrating and I hate wasting my time dealing with their customer support."

Then after we were dating for about 2 months she told me she had lost that special feeling she had in the beginning,but she doesnt know what the reason is.She cried really hard while admitting that.We decided to keep on dating with the hope it would come back.I thought things were good again,she felt emotionally there the entire time,and didnt act like she missed her special feeling.Besides that,she was the one acting insecure.Constantly asking me to come over and stuff,to a point where I felt like I needed some time for myself.

5 months in,we had the big conversation again.She told me her special feeling never returned.I was so confused,considering the things I wrote above.Again we decided to give it one last try..It didnt last much longer.first week went well,but the 2 weeks that followed she was as cold as ice.Hugging her was like hugging a chair.So we decided to break up.

I desperatly wanted to get answers out of her,but untill this day she doesnt know why she lost feelings for me.I pressured her way too hard for answers,until a point where we started to fight.She told me she was sick of me not giving her time and space and thought it would be better if we dont hear or see eachother for awhile,which resulted in me getting so mad and saying the wrong things.I told her I never knew what a selfish person she is,and that I felt bad for helping her so much for school and threw her off my facebook.5 hours later,realising I was wrong,I sent her a txt message saying sorry and that shes right about taking time off and that I wish her the best.She didnt reply.
A week later I called her to ask how she was doing.Shes so mad at me for having said those things.Calls it a lack of respect.She doesnt want to hear from me for at least a month,and if I contact her after that month she will decide then if she will respond or not.

**tl;dr**: Does anyone think there is a chance of getting her back?Can a person just lose feelings without even knowing why in a good relationship?

On a side note : The first conversation we had was right after her internship for school (2 weeks of stress and alot of work,which I helped her ALOT!! with).The second time was also right after an internship,and when she was acting dead cold to me that was during her exams.Coincidence or not?

I'm looking for some advice about an internship I accepted for the Summer, and any kind of advice or perspective you guys can offer would be much appreciated.

I am a 20 year old girl, and I am bilingual, speaking Mandarin Chinese and English. I am currently a Double Major at a prestigious university in Canada who gets decent (although not perfect) grades and participates in extracurricular activities. As I am a Chinese major, I decided to look for an internship on the mainland, and with months of work I finally found one.

The internship sounded great, it was a company I was familiar with, fortune 500 and in the MedTech industry. I had even had a successful internship with them two years ago, after I graduated from high school. When they signed me they agreed to pay for my plane tickets to and from China, and a small daily stipend for food. I wasn't so happy about the pay, but I was thrilled to be working for them again and couldn't wait to be back in China practicing my Chinese in a local environment.

Then, the trouble started. On my first day of work, a date they had given to me, my supervisor seemed incredibly surprised to see me. However, I was given a task: learn all about the company's products, and I happily plodded away on my computer through both the Chinese and English versions of their website. The next week, I was told to work from home and that I would be receiving emails as to some new projects to work on, as my supervisor would be on a business trip in Macau. I was unfazed, but as the week dragged on I didn't receive a single email as to what I should be doing. When my boss got back, there was no mention of more work. I continued to browse their website, finally reading both the user and medical manuals (hundreds of pages each) for nearly every product on our line. I have completely exhausted the website. 

Since then, I have been in limbo. I have not received a new project to work on. My boss has invited me to attend 3 meetings, for which I have been asked to take minutes twice, and have only been given prior notice once. I have also booked him one set of flights for another business trip and an currently corresponding with a colleague of his in the states to set up a business dinner. This is close to 6 hours of work total since the ""research"". I have been here for over a month.

I only just received my work computer (before I was expected to bring my own on my hour and a half long subway commute) and email last week, and I still have no card to get into the building, so I have to wait for my colleagues to let me in, which makes for a large problem because only 20 people work in this office and the bathrooms are located outside. I literally have to wait for someone to let me back into the office if I wish to go out to use the restroom. I don't know what to do. I feel as though I am not being treated fairly by my manager (I have no problem with the company, they are very good at what they do and two years ago I was completely enamored with the corporate culture). I have asked him to increase my workload twice now, and each time he promises that there will be and there isn't. I am very frustrated and am starting to feel as though this won't even look good on my resume, because I don't have anything to tell future employers that I worked on. I am just trying to get the most out of my summer, but I traveled very far for this internship and am incredibly disappointed that I am living as far away from my family as is possible and having my time wasted. If I knew this internship was empty words I wouldn't have upset my mother so much by running off for the few months she gets to see me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you,

First a little background information. I come from a pretty conservative household where makeup is reserved for weddings, funerals, and the like. My mom is the type of woman who takes pride in not using makeup on a regular basis, and even brags about how she doesn't even know how to apply makeup. Now I just recently started taking makeup seriously (mostly thanks to this subreddit) and this summer I decided to tackle what I've always viewed as the hardest part of makeup: eyeshadow.

So cut to today, it's my first day at my new internship and I decided to break out my new naked palette for the first time and try my hand at blending. After an hour of looking up tutorials and painstakingly blending, I was some what satisfied, proud even, of my first attempt at eyeshadow. I was still super nervous about my look because it was nowhere near the level of what I see posted on this subreddit but I decided to suck it up and ignore the little voice in my head telling me to wash my face. I go downstairs to show my mom and ask her what she thinks...and she laughs. She lauged as if I had drawn a huge picture of male genitilia across my face. I was hurt and told her that I worked really hard on this and all she did was laugh some more. 

The result? My self confidence is a little shaken as my makeup abilities are apparently literally laughable, but I know I will live, bruised ego and all. There isn't really a point to this rant,  but I'd love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience to this. Thanks for reading :)"

I'm a Canadian studying in the US at UIUC, and hope to find a job here. I'm more than willing to go with pretty much any firm that'll take me, as I hear it's more difficult for international students to find jobs, but would like to improve my chances of starting off on a good foot as much as possible. I've only had one internship (which I'm doing right now along with summer classes), and it's unpaid at a small community health center, but the benefit is that I get to interact directly with the CFO.

As I see it, I'm pretty much deciding between two available options. 

Option 1: Throw all my resources into finding a winter internship at a slightly more reputable accounting firm and take Spring 2015 semester off. This means pushing back graduation by a semester, as I would be coming back in Fall 2015 to finish up my bachelors. Of course, this is entirely contingent on the fact that anyone wants me at all, but I just wanted to know if it's even a good idea to try. 

Option 2: Graduate on time, and if I don't get an offer once I've graduated, focus on trying to pass the CPA during summer. 

Please let me know what you guys think! My GPA's bringing me down, and I just want to try and plan out my future so it's not dependent on my grades. 

Also, I do have a quick side question: am I allowed to start taking the CPA before I graduate? The Illinois CPA website mentions provisional candidates, and I did look into it, but am still confused (as I don't see it mentioned too much - a sidebar search for the word 'provisional' didn't bring up anything).

It's both our first real relationships but I feel we are both mature, rational people who can communicate our feelings really well so I'm not concerned with our inexperience.

About a few weeks before I was going to meet my girlfriend's parents for the first time, and then she would come back with me to meet mine, my mom has dinner with me. She tells me that she really has seen a positive change in me so she, overall, likes my girlfriend but doesn't want me to leave my gf with my best friend alone at all when my gf is in town.

I asked her why and she said that ""with alcohol things can happen"" and that since my gf is naive and inexperienced, she can be talked into ""things"". She also told me that she's seen too many situations where this has happened. She continued to tell me about how our financial adviser (I'll call him John) was cheated on by his wife with his very own intern because John was always out of town and would ask his intern to check on his wife for him. 

This, of course, upset me because she was making a lot of assumptions about the kind of person my girlfriend and best friend were. I've known my best friend for eight years and I've never known him to stab me in the back even in some bad situations.

I also think it's incredibly closed minded of her to think that we have no control over our desires and emotions and that my best friend or girlfriend would put themselves in those situations where something could happen.

On the other hand, I'm not naive enough to think what my mother said has never happened before. I just want to know if I am justified in being upset with my mom for saying these things. I know she was trying to warn me about things that could go wrong, but I felt like she went too far without seeing any evidence.

I think this is incredibly insensitive given that she's never met my girlfriend or really known best friend. "

I'm currently working at Wal-Mart. 
One day, after some bullshit day at work I sat down on my bed and stared at the wall. Then it hit me, ***What the hell am I doing with my life?***
Ever since my Dad passed away almost 3 years ago, it was just one gigantic downward spiral. I was at a dead end retail job, I dropped out of college, I gained a million pounds (Okay, it was like 40 pounds.)
Hell, even my career choice wasn't even my choice, it was something my brother forced me to get into. 

My brother took me out the next day and told me that my Mom was worried about me. He asked me what I was doing, what were my plans. I cried, I always have cried easily especially when it comes to things like this. He asked me if I was still planning to be a nurse, I shook my head 'no.' He asked me if I was comfortable at Wal-mart, if i wanted to stay there. Again, no I shook my head. 
I told him i wanted to work with computers, that's what I wanted to do. He sighed and told me that he'll see what he can do.

Fast forward a couple weeks, he calls me on my cellphone, tells me to go to this address and meet his old boss. His boss took me out to dinner and looked at me. He asked me what I knew about computers.
I suddenly fell my throat close up and again, my eyes started to water. I told him, ""nothing, really..just a lot of basic stuff like cleaning viruses and doing a little hardware swaps here and there."" 
He offered me an internship at his repair shop and told me to show up the next morning. 

Again, fast forward 2 more months, I asked my boss, if I could get hired. He pulled me off to the side and said, ""I need to know if you're serious about this, i'll *only* hire you if you register for classes. 

Skip up until last week. I spoke to a counselor, went through all those loops and got my classes. I handed my boss my class schedule and he nods and says ""Go put your two weeks into Wal-Mart""

Here I am, my last day is on the 10th of this month. I'm going back to school, I got hired at a place I actually want to work at. I'm finally getting my life back in order. After my Dad passed away, everything fell apart. Everything. Now, i'm slowly piecing together my life.
Just a little bit each time. Honestly I'm a little scared  at what might happen, but I can honestly say...I'm happy.
I'm fucking happy with my life as of this moment. It's one of the greatest feelings in the world. 

Thank you for putting up with my horrendous grammar. I just wanted to share this."

Going back to that company for a full time job come August, haven't programmed Java for a while (mostly Python this year, due to a final University project that made use of it), and I have a lack of personal projects.

Just wondering if there are any resources people could point me towards for practising Java when you don't have a project of your own, mainly just to get me back into the swing of it and fully remember the syntax.

Also, does anyone have any recommendations for enterprise specific ""stuff"" to learn/books to read? I say I did fine last time I worked at this place, but there were a few things I felt out of my depth with - the way Java EE worked, design patterns didn't come particularly easily to me, and a few application specific things which obviously I can look into myself (Apache camel, blah).

It's one of those places where you can get rotated round the departments until you're settled, give you a feel for everything, but I'll likely be starting on server backend stuff, RESTful services, handling requests, events/event based stuff, all that jazz. Any resources there would be helpful too.

Obviously there's learning on the job, but I figured being a little more prepared wouldn't hurt!

I'm just so scared this wedding will be a big, expensive because nothing goes right (not worried about the marriage... FH is crazy awesome). Here is what has me shaking in my boots:

* one of my bridesmaids may not come because she's on the short list to adopt a baby 4 days before, across the country. She won't know if she can come until basically that week.  I get it. A baby is more important.  But weddings aren't something you can make up for with drinks next time I see her or next year like a birthday might.  There aren't any do-overs. So I'm feeling a little bummed, even though I'm happy for her.
* FH's sister keeps making jokes that aren't funny. She's a bridesmaid. She's made it very clear that all she really wants is to get wasted and goof off with her friend who she told us was coming (she's single... we didn't give single family members +1s and we never actually said she'd get one.... she just told us this also annoying chick is coming). So far FSIL and friend have requested Chris Brown songs, FSIL barely got her dress hemmed in time (we gave her $100 toward the $150 dress... money is not an issue), and has made jokes about wearing a wine glass on a lanyard as jewelry. The shenanigans aren't cute or funny because she's done nothing helpful. She's just being rude. FH keeps saying she knows how to act because she's been a BM three times before.  For her friends. This girl is older than I am. I'm running out of patience.  My brother who is 6 years younger is a GM and he's been just laying low. I wish she'd do the same. I'm tired of the antics. And FILs aren't much help because they find their daughter and her friend hilarious and quirky.
* FMIL keeps making comments about how I need to continue working. Never planned on quitting, but it's got me freaked out that she keeps bringing it up. She brought it up in front of my mom on one of the two occasions she has met my mom. I've got a great career... and FMIL hasn't worked in nearly 30 years. 
* FMIL keeps telling different people different things about whether or not they will help with day-of logistics (literally taking used hurricanes, candles and vases home) and I'm freaking out because I'm not sure if I have help and I need to know. 
* we have an RSVP straggler and I want to strangle him.

2a1ttg,24,2014-07-07,"Pharmacy School, Engagement, and Money",Jmcginne,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2a1ttg/pharmacy_school_engagement_and_money/,"Hi I need some advice on my situation.

I have just finished 2 years of undergrad studies with very little student loan debt. I am now going to begin a 4 year Doctor of Pharmacy program with my estimated cost of attendance each year being $35,000. With some aid I currently have, I will have about $100,000 in student loan debt when I graduate. I know my salary will be about that so I really am trying to not worry about it too much. (Its just a very large sum of money to think about owing and it worries me but I try to keep calm).

The question I have though also includes the fact that I am in a serious relationship in which I intend to propose in 2 years (and then get married after I graduate, 2 years after that). My girlfriend is my grade and will graduate in 2 years. I will need money for a ring but I will also be packing on loads of debt at the same time. Should I just let the interest accrue and tackle the payments after I graduate (I can do that with my loans) or should I put the maybe thousand or two I could afford toward my expenses?

A little about my earnings now: I had wiped out savings with undergrad but this summer I have been diligently saving $200 a week. I will have about $2,500 in savings when school starts and about $500 in checking for spending. Next summer I intend to get an internship but I probably wont get scheduled as many hours (I have friends who are pharmacy interns). So therefore I will probably be able to save about $1,500. 

I want to be able to get a nice ring (have been casually looking and it seems like the ones I like will be around $3K) but I will only have about $4,000 in savings and I don't want to be reckless and spend it all. 

---&gt;EDIT: Though thats what I want to spend on a ring, I might budget myself to about half of that. I still have quite a bit of time so I am honestly not quite sure on what I will do.
Also, just a note for everyone, we have talked about finances and how much we are making or will be making. And she is very supportive and understanding. Your advice on my situation certainly does help though!

Open for any advice or thoughts on the matter.

Due to the versatility of my course in uni (Computer Science), I've got the chance to do an industrial placement for a full year. 



I've been looking for a placement (or internship) for over 6 months now and been to quite a few interviews and they felt like they went really good but none of the companies took me on board. By saying that the interviews went good I'm meaning that it's my personal opinion plus the interviewers seemed like they were happy with my performance during the interview (that's just my personal opinion as well). 




I've been to a careers centre in my uni (they help people prepare for interviews, give you tips regarding your CV and covering letter) and the various people that I've had meetings with said that my CV looks sharp and the covering letter's great. 




Now I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong (i seem to be getting interviews so it's most likely my interview skills and not the CV or covering letter) but something has to change. 



What tips would you give that could make or break an interview?"

I'm not sure whether the Army is the right place for me, but it seemed like the reserves would be a good place to find out. I'm currently working as a web developer after finishing my first year of university studying Computer Science, and I'm confident that I would be able to land an internship after second year. I'm all for the regular commitments and affairs that the reserves involves, however I found out that after some time I would have to go do full-time training at a camp right after my second year for 2 months.   

I'm conflicted as to whether I should still join the reserves or apply for internships. If I work as an intern it would help with job prospects in the future (while you pretty much get paid to learn which is awesome). If I were to join the reserves I get to do other things I want to do, but it feels like I would be sacrificing my career potential. I can't think of places that would hire students for just two months.  

Would joining the reserves still be a good idea? Or, would my time be better spent in a software development position. I guess I'm just looking for some advice."

So I am an intern and fairly new to autocad. I was given this side assignment for when I'm not working on another project. Our cad ""specialist"" said she spent 4 hours and couldn't find a solution, so I doubt I can solve it on my own haha. But if I can fix this, I will be praised by all in the office, it's literally costing our company money.

Essentially the problem is that the title block won't stay in the dotted line in paper space when converting to a pdf. I can move it into the correct position, save, but when I convert the dwg to bluebeam, it jumps back up. The bottom left corner is set to origin (0,0). This is probably the strangest problem I've ever encountered, especially because it only occurs on some of the sheets in the project. 

If anyone has ever experienced this problem, or has any ideas at all, please drop a comment, if needed I can take a screenshot of the paper space, but I'd prefer not to since the information on the floor plan is not owned by me.

2a2gym,8,2014-07-07,"My sister has been fighting depression for years, how do I help her find meaning and direction in her life?",KabochaMajorette,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/2a2gym/my_sister_has_been_fighting_depression_for_years/,"Hi everyone. I hope my post doesn't offend anyone: I'm here to learn and listen, and I have all respect and understanding in the world for those who live with depression and other psychological illness. On the same line, I'd like to apologize in advance if I come off as rude, english is not my native language and I can't grasp all the nuances. 

So, a little context first: me and my sister are 4 years apart, me being the elder one at 27. I left my parents' home when I was 18 to go to college, and I haven't lived there since if you don't count shorter periods such as holidays. 

My sister, we'll call her Ally, was diagnosed with depression and OCD when she was 19 years old, in 2009. She didn't leave the house for about one year, and was put on heavy medication. Her doctors thought that her depression started during childhood, and honestly this makes a lot of sense. 

After she got a little better with her OCD (but NOT depression) she became incredibly interested in baking and asked to leave home to go to a renowned baking shool in another city, near to where I live. I was shocked when they let her go, but two doctors (a psychiatrist and a psychologist) allowed it, she wanted to and my parents were willing to try to let her go, so I was in no position to express my doubts. 

The year she was there was hell for both of us. She wasn't in the right mental condition to learn anything from a higher level professional training program, she had panic attacks constantly and I often had to jump on a train in the middle of the night to help her. This was also when I was working two jobs and having a lot of anxiety issues of my own. 

After the graduation she got an internship at a local bakery. Believe me, I love my sister but she was nowhere near the level of ability required for the job, not enen an intership, nor she was able to ""take it"" on a psychological level. She fought constantly with her boss over her frequent mistakes, and they ended up not letting her even wash the dishes, for fear of the mess she usually created. 

After that she tried going to another school, easier this time, in yet another city. This time we were farther apart and I couldn't go to her whenever she needed. I was also exhausted after the previous year. We drifted a little apart, we were never been really close to be honest, I always saw her as a little, clumsy, awkward girl that was my responsibility, and she probae saw me as this impossible role model. I hate that, really, I never wanted to be ""the good one"", and I obsessed for a long time over the thought that I might be the one that caused her depression. 

Anyway, back to her, another terrible year in this new school, terrified of everyone (mostly her bakery teacher, an incredibly kind man who constantly called me and my mother when she had her attacks, went to the hospital with her, helped with assignements and grades...). She came out alive, somehow, and decided she wasn't interested in baking after all.

Now she's been back at my parents' and she's been back for over a year. She does nothing all day: her depression is better, her medication is lighter, but she got incredibly fat and her confidence is still very low. She had no higher education that doesn't involve bakery, and she refuses to go near an oven. She has no interests or hobbies, her high school diploma doesn't give her any chance in the real world, and she seems to have no ambition whatsoever. 

Furthermore, I think that being back at my parents', while a necessity for a while, is now a struggle for both her and my mother. They are incredibly damaging to eachother, not in an abusive way, but they are just incompatible, unable to communicate with eachother if I'm not there.

For me going back home has turned into a nightmare, since they both turn to me to have a sparkle of happiness in their lives and I feel like I have to wear a mask all the time. When my SO recently lost his job I told my mother, then I called again to apologize because I didn't want to burden her with the news. That's the level. On top of that I worry for them constantly: they are two great women, I want to see them happy, but right now my mother lives for my sister and my sister lives for... Nothing, apparently.

Next month I'll spend two weeks at my parents', and I'd really like to find a way to communicate with Ally. To help her find something valuable in her life, something she cares about, and something (not necessarily the same thing) that she could turn into a job. She needs some indipendence.

Sorry for the long post, i'll put a TL;DR here for those not insane enough to read it all :) 

So TL;DR: my sister has depression but she's better now, however at 23 years old she has no job nor, apparently, any intention to look for one. Or any interest. How can I help her being passionate about something, or at least interested enough in a future of indipendence to turn her life into something?"

My interest in computer science is vast, but I really love artificial intelligence, and would love to be part of creating conscious artificial life (it's probably only 20 or so years away, after all!). Unfortunately, I don't have any AI or machine learning class offerings through my program. 

What do I have to do to get in to this field? At the moment I'm supplementing my education with lots of additional math, including the math behind neural networks, as well as some general neuroscience. What else should I learn?

I've been looking in to recent developments in the field and trying to keep up with it, and feel like I have a good grasp of it. But if I want to do this I feel like it would need to be research based, and I'm not sure how to go about structuring my career path towards that. I'd likely need more school, right? A graduate program and perhaps a PhD? Or can I jump in now and find some kind of related internship? 

So really what I want to know is, where do I go after my degree and what can I do now to help make this happen?

I appreciate any help that anyone can provide!"

As currently I am the only person doing IT and software development at this company, which was supposed to be an entry level job.

&amp;nbsp;


**Preface**

___

At my current job I currently have many duties ranging from whatever software development is required, to solving issues my co-workers have with their computers. 

Some time before I was hired here full-time, and even before I was a lowly intern at the company my boss decided they were going to develop some software. Along they went, hiring a contractor whom I later would work alongside on this project. The project's goal, to be an all encompassing solution to an outpatient Substance Abuse and Drug addiction center.

Over time, the constant changing of requirements,requests for new features and lack of feedback from my boss led the contractor to quit. By this time I had been working on the project for a while, and it began to seem like the project was barely held together like a house made of duct tape and twigs. Each repair done to a bug would lead to nearly 2 more tasks to be necessary.

&amp;nbsp;


___

**The Hydra Releases its Wrath**
___

Today it seems, the duct tape beast from development hell finally released  its wrath. I walk in to work this morning, immediately being called over by one of the clinicians that my boss forces to use this software while it's mid development, for work. The clinician can't access any client's chart. This being interesting, as no updates had been released as things planned for the next update were still being implemented. As well it was reproducible on multiple machines, and even the copy I had been working with on the development machine I use.

After speaking to the old contractor, as the new one my boss found, wasn't brought on to replace the old one as a senior developer (yet the deadline that was estimated to be 6 months with a new senior dev + myself, was changed to 1 month forcibly by my boss), thus they weren't of any use. I learned a bulk of the issues came from a custom binary library used for quick simple SQL queries. There seemingly no reason for this one function used all over the project to be giving issues unless being done asynchronously. So today, and continuing after I type this up, I am stuck fixing wherever the library is giving issues. Which is basically the whole project at this point.

tl;dr Project from development hell with bugs that act like a hydra releases its wrath, breaking every feature in the software.

2a32zq,3,2014-07-07,My life as I knew it came to an end a couple of years ago (Great Text Wall of China),throwaway93257,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2a32zq/my_life_as_i_knew_it_came_to_an_end_a_couple_of/,"My life pre-2012 wasn't perfect but I certainly couldn't have asked for much more. Until college I lived with my parents and 2 older brothers in California and in 2012 was on track to start my second year of college at the end of summer. I had a great group of friends and a simple, contented lifestyle. The all came to an end just a month into what I now realize was the last pure summer vacation I would ever have. 


I came home for that summer, but it was just my parents and I staying there since my oldest brother moved into his own place and my other brother was temporarily working abroad. I mostly had the house to myself since my parents worked during the day so I would see them about as often as I did the last several years while I was in high school. Back then I never had much to complain about with regards to our relationship but something was different this time around. They started talking about Islam much more often than usual. The family had been a Muslim one forever but they had never been too radical about it (I specify ""the family"" since unbeknownst to them I renounced that faith a couple of years earlier). Naturally I found the change of pace odd but brushed it off as a one-off occurrence.


Unfortunately, the probing didn't stop. They took to quizzing me daily on various religious topics and assigned me passages to read and translate from the Quran. My father began forcing me to perform nightly prayer with him and implemented a new ""discussion"" time in our daily schedule. He claimed the goal was to get a chance to talk to me since we didn't get to see each other that often - in reality, we would talk about random topics for 50% of the time while the rest was dedicated to religious lecturing. To think that he thought he could deceive me with a plan as thinly-veiled as this was simultaneously disappointing and infuriating. Clearly something was up but I couldn't just ask outright. 


Fastforward a couple of weeks to when my middle brother returns from his internship. Remember, neither he nor my oldest brother are aware that any of this is happening. Nighttime arrives, we go through our new routine, and I can tell from the look on his face that my brother is just as confused as I first was. I tell him this isn't going away anytime soon.


I finally come across the source of the problem when my oldest brother invites my middle brother and I out to lunch in the city soon thereafter. We talk about the kinds of things we normally would but eventually reach the topic of his new girlfriend. He tells us about her and she sounds like a great person. He mentions that he also told our parents about her and I figure they'd be glad to hear that he's found a nice girl. Turns out this was not the case.


He mentions that when he told them about her he mentioned off-handedly that she was Hindu. In case you didn't know, Islam does not permit marriage to Hindus and given that my parents had spent much of the last year trying to find my brother a nice Muslim girl to marry, this was a pretty big deal. Everything in my head clicks immediately but I wait to hear the rest of his story. Apparently when they heard this, a shouting match followed and he returned to his apartment in the city to cool off. In the span of the 5 minutes I spent listening that story, my heart sank to the depths as I realized that nothing was ever going to be the same. 


I was the only one among us three who had the full perspective on the situation: my middle brother was gone for most of the summer and my oldest brother didn't know of the changes in my parents' behavior. It might explain why I was the most devastated of us all. I knew there was no peaceful resolution to come of this situation. Both parties are stubborn - there was no way my parents were going to relent and accept a Muslim-Hindu marriage and there was no way my brother was going to adopt the Muslim dogma if it wasn't what he truly wanted. This was a problem that wasn't going to go away. ""Every summer is just going to get worse,"" I thought.


Every summer got worse. Somehow my parents continue to try and skirt around their attempts to indoctrinate my brother and I by disguising it as friendly discussion. It's hard enough to deal with as it is. But the worst is knowing that the worst is yet to come. I dread the day I have to make my stand; whereas my brother at least concedes that he's willing to put his kids through Muslim cultural traditions I don't want anything to do with Islam whatsoever. My extended family is significantly less tolerant that my parents so I can only imagine I'd be a complete pariah in their eyes. Friends and family in the area will probably have similar reactions. 


All this because I don't believe in their book. Never mind the kind of work I do, the kind of person I am - this is really what matters to them.  The distress this has caused my over the last year has been tangible. Like I said, my life was great until this point; no drama to even speak of. All of a sudden I'm burdened by a family breaking apart at its foundations in addition to all the problems at school: tough classes, the loss of a best friend (a story unto itself), and no one to tell all this too. I turned to alcohol and anti-depressants to just get me through the days and as shameful as it is, it worked to a degree. I don't plan on doing any of that anymore but the black mark it leaves on my personal history is one that I won't be forgetting any time soon. 


Given how few problems I've had in my past I doubt I possess the perspective to tell if this is even that big of a deal - my money is on no given the kind of stories I've read here. Also, I wish I could have made this shorter but I'm an uncontrollably long-winded person. For any of you who made it through the whole thing, you have my kudos. You also have my gratitude; people come to me with their problems all the time tell me how thankful they are that I'm a good listener. I've never been on the other side of that window, both due to a lack of problems and a lack of people to talk to. For you people to be there for guys like me warrants at least a thanks on my part."
2a33lp,2,2014-07-07,To my older brother: get your shit together.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2a33lp/to_my_older_brother_get_your_shit_together/,"""Hey, I'll be gone for the next 3 weeks.""

That's all you texted me when I came home from work one day last week.  You were already gone.  No warning, no indication, no heads-up.  I had to call our mom to find out what the deal was.  Apparently, you went halfway across to the country with your church group to help at homeless shelters.  It's a noble cause, there's no question about that.  And I've met your friends/church group.  They're good people, they really embody that good will that Christianity promotes.

The problem is that you're completely neglecting your life outside of this group.

Moving in with you was a bad idea.  I was against it from the beginning.  Mom wanted us to look out for each other, but it's very one sided.  You don't clean, and you don't help out around the apartment.  I take care of all the expenses (groceries, toiletries, bills...) because you don't have a job.  YOU SPENT 6 YEARS IN COLLEGE TO GETTING A MASTER'S DEGREE IN ENGINEERING, and you didn't look for any internships.  And you still haven't looked for one, let alone a job.  How much tuition did it cost, huh?  How much money did our parents sink into you?

It's because you keep pussyfooting between church and ""normal life"".  If you're gonna dedicate this much of your life to religion, then just become a priest or something.  Otherwise, start looking for a job.  Our parents would be thrilled either way, no sarcasm.  JUST PICK ONE.

Even though I have to deal with your crap on a daily basis, I still feel worse for our poor mother.  She told me in confidence that she was extremely hurt when you basically threw everything she taught us about love and religion back in her face after you told her that ""you found God again"" and that her methods didn't stick.  She is the most patient and kind person I have ever known, and you shoved her face in the dirt.  What did she do to deserve that?  We don't see eye to eye about religion, and sometimes she regrets that I'm barely associated with the Christianity these days and wishes that she were somehow more involved in my religious upbringing.  Despite that, she trusts me to be responsible and we have a mutual respect for each other.

Honestly, up until now living with you was irritating but bearable.  After she told me what you said, I am BEYOND infuriated.  There's no way you would possibly listen to your little brother though... no siree, you're much too prideful for that!  At least these 3 weeks will finally give me a chance to breathe.

I am moving out in less than 2 months, and now I have absolutely no regrets about it.  Whatever you do after that is your business, I don't care.  I am done with you."

He's Jewish (although an Atheist) and intends to marry a Jewish girl, which is something I can respect. He's also older, well-off, and simply in a different place in life than I am. I never expected more than a bit of fun getting into this relationship. I thought I was all grown-up and could manage these ""FWB"" things that are all the rage. 

The catch is that he is very gentle and affectionate : I've slept in his arms, he calls me ""sweetheart"", reads me his favorite historical comics, takes me to dinner, tells me that he's missed me each time we see each other, pours his heart out about growing up in his family, his exes... Sex is the best I've ever had. 

I made it very clear that he should never buy me anything : I don't want him to be my sugar daddy, and I can take care of myself financially speaking.

I don't have much experience and, although he is not my first partner, he is my first ""fuck buddy"" arrangement. He insists that I call myself his lover or mistress (but he is single...) ; I like to call things as they should be called.

Despite the great connection I'm feeling, I am trying very hard not to get too attached. I know how Jewish men often spend time with ""goy"" women before settling down. I'm not interested in being introduced to his friends or family either - but as time passes, I do want to be loved and cherished, to have the freedom of loving and cherishing. Guess I'm a romantic.

Last night he told me he ""can't help feeling a great tenderness"" for me.

On one hand, I want to stop things before getting hurt, on the other, I fear regretting what could be a true love story. What should I do ?

---   
tl;dr: seeing a 30-year old Jewish consultant who will never be serious about me - but I think he's falling in love, and I'm on the verge of letting myself fall for him too. Is it time to flee ?"

So, I'm a 21 y/o male with a great internship. I quit pot to pass the drug test and secure the job, and have been clean for about 2 months. I'm wondering if it's time to respark the habit, but am fearful of the job consequences. The job is highly paid (engineering) at a great company, so I have a lot to lose! Please help and let me know your thoughts, it would be much appreciated! See my personal pros and cons below

Pros are: lessen or eliminate anxiety, be able to destress totally after work to come in refreshed the next day, improved sleeping and eating habits, being able to better focus my scattered thoughts.

Cons are: lessened work performance (maybe, but possible, as my work is very heavy on multitasking and attention to detail), fired if I ever get drug tested (there are no random tests but you will be tested if suspected), and having to lie/hide it from my family or risk alienating them (I live away from my family and see them a few times a year)

Over the summer I built a responsive social networking website with a complete login, profiles, walls, posts and comments just so I could work on my php and writing sql statements.  I am currently in school and pursuing a bachelors in computer science.

I applied for an internship at a small local web dev company (about 70 employees) who uses mostly php, javascript, html and css to build all their projects.  They liked my resume and sent me a series of 9 online tests, most of which were php, 1 javascript, 1 html, 1 css, 1 linux.  I scored roughly 76% to 82% on each exam except for linux, css and html.  I got a 43% on linux, 67% on css and html. I know html and css pretty well I thought but the questions they were asking on the exam were for some pretty obscure tags.  A lot of the questions were about handling audio and video files which I rarely have a need to embed and when I do I just look up a quick reference.  

**TLDR:** So I am not a master web developer, but I think I am decent enough to get by and figure things out.  Well I got denied after I took some online php,css,html,javascript exams and the company said I was unqualified at the time based on my scores (76%-80%).  But for an internship, are you expected to be a master?  Should I reply to them and show them some of my online work or just let it go?"

Cover letter I wrote to address the specific points of this position. I welcome your feedback to what I wrote.

&gt; Dear the team at SAP.
&gt; 
&gt;    My name is HoldCToCrouch. I am a pre-Junior pursuing a Bachelor Science degree in Computer Engineering with a minor concentration of Computer Science at Some School. I read with interest the job posting on the SAP Jobs website for a software developer-in-test internship at Vancouver, BC. Please accept this letter and the enclosed resume as my application for a six month internship for this position.
&gt; 
&gt;    As a Computer Engineering student of Some School, I have solid knowledge of a variety of programming languages such as Java and C#, as well as a year of practical experiences in the software development industry. During my cooperative education, the tasks handled by me included successfully researching, developing and testing several Grasshopper 3D components using C# for the firm’s architects; in fact, I had to devise creative ways to unit test the graphical programming elements, uncommon with what is typical of a software developer. 
&gt;
&gt;   When I found myself hitting the limit of my and the Research Group’s knowledge on this project, I reached out and engaged the head developer of Grasshopper 3D through the forum and e-mail. In addition, I found that my problem-solving skills and the initiative to learn new skills were enhanced by working as part of a multidisciplinary team and by considering other people’s ideas and needs.
&gt; 
&gt;    SAP is an international leader in developing enterprise and business objects software, while at the same time helping companies of all sizes and industries by providing solutions in the front-end and the back-end, desktop to mobile devices. The qualities of this position at SAP - the opportunity to challenge myself with a role that combines development with testing, and to be able to work with testers and developers to find creative ways to hack, break, demolish, and rebuild a piece of software, appeals to me greatly. I am actively seeking the kind of challenge offered by working for a global leader in the enterprise world.

So, a little background on myself. I am a upcoming Senior. I have about a 3 semesters until graduation. 

My goal is to get into non-profit work. The jobs I am looking to get are Director of Community Programs and eventually Executive Director. 

I am currently looking at different non profits, trying to choose which one to work for. I hypothesize that my position will be non paid, as most internships that I have seen are. I still need money to get to and from work. 

I want to work with someone higher up, and intern for the for money on the weekends. How do I go about asking them this? 

OR

What is the weekend job to get that leads to an actual career? Mind you, this job would only be on the weekends. I would be interning for free during the week, and would prefer to be working at something which also gets me to my goal during the weekend. I can't do another food service job. It is depressing to stand in a room knowing it is not getting you anywhere. 

My reason for using these two different approaches is that both can lead to a secure career. 

So things I am looking for. 

Weekend Job
Paid
Has future or Gives skills to create a future. 
Or, advice on how to contact people for this job. 

Below are some of the qualifications which are needed for my career goals. 

Broad understanding of business financial matters, including planning and budgeting, accounting systems and controls, financial reporting and analysis.

Experience in successful nonprofit development, fundraising and planned giving campaigns.

Demonstrated success in managing, motivating and developing office and maintenance staff.

Experience in facility administration, outside contracting for services, and negotiations with vendors, contractors and governmental agencies."
2a3rhd,7,2014-07-07,My story - Modern 'Mind Control',towhomiam,MilitaryConspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryConspiracy/comments/2a3rhd/my_story_modern_mind_control/,"To start this off a little family history. My father's father was one of ten kids of his siblings he was the only to live past 50 years old and the other 8 of this siblings had died before their mid thirties. I was passed on with a very uncommon last name and will receive many family heirloom military issued guns dating to way back and up until the Korean conflict but none from Vietnam even though several of my family members served. I will also inherit oil land in North Dakota. I am not connected nor have met with my extended family at all and assume it has to do with mineral rights and the way the lawyers wrote the distribution of the land to the family. I will inherit land but all the mineral rights to all the original land is owned by a single person and he has a very high position on one of the largest oil companies in America and Russia and shares my last name which only 270ish people in America has. My grandpa received a purple heart in world war two and then reenlisted. He met my grandma because of this, she was a naval nurse. All my grandpas sons and one of his daughters also served in the navy.

I grew up in Montana, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. My dad is an avid hunter and my mom shot a deer while 8 months pregnant with me. He tells stories of him putting me in a carrier pack and taking me bear hunting as little as two years old. My first memory of shooting any sort of gun was at the age of 4 where I had a ten pump bb gun rifle and shot a pressure sealed 2 liter pop bottle with a single pump of the gun. The bb came back and hit me an inch right of my right eye. I shot my first animal at 5 and remember feeling really bad but that was the only time I felt bad. I grew up in a family that neglected normal society standards and spent most of my time hunting, camping, hiking, scouting, and my dad teaching me everything he knew in those regards.

I remember very little about my childhood expect a few mentors whom all were avid outdoors men who also taught me stuff about knot tying, survival, took me to rope courses, fishing, and camping. I was didnt fit in with kids my own age and went through a period where I almost go expelled for breaking a kids arm, an others nose, not listening to teachers, etc. But it never happened because I was in all the advanced and honor classes. Instead I had to spend entire semesters in detention, took meds, and anger consoling. I remember starting in middle school I started doing a min of 500 sit ups a day and then in high school I added pull ups, pushups, and running into my daily routine on top of playing sports.

When I was 11 I got an old computer that didnt work. Thought I could repair it so I started off buying a motherboard it didnt fit in the case and all the other parts on the old computer were legacy. So, I continued to save my money from mowing lawns and ended up building my first computer part by part at the age of 12. Self taught on everything from hardware to software I began to web design and also hacked and changed webpages on a very popular website. I gave up on the 'hacking' because it was pretty silly but continued to pursue teaching myself computer stuff. Years later when I was a senior in high school the director of IT at local fortune 500 company that deals with internet software contacted my family and took me out to dinner. He asked me to do an internship with him. I did, they paid me well and also paid for me to take online college classes. After a few quarters of working full time and doing school I decided to not sign up for school. Shortly after that they said the internship program had ended. I had a nice apartment and car payments so I had to purse something quick.

I went to a recruiter at an armed forces building. I told him I wanted to get out of town as soon as possible and answered all his questions. I remember feeling at home talking to him just because the way he talked. I took the asvab test and completed it with out a problem very quickly. I have never had a problem with school and at that time already had many sciences and calculus under my belt. He told me I scored high enough to became a truck driver, because thats what he first told me when I went in when I asked them what they need. But he also said I missed every math problem but he never showed me my results. I filling out paper work and signed a few things and he said they would contact me shortly.

This is were my life gets weird. A lot of gaps and unplaceable memories. My cousin whom I hadnt seen in almost a decade after being sent away because of a troubled childhood caused from always wanting to be a navy seal just comes to town and I let him move in with me. His family lived in San Diego but I never really thought about how odd it was that he came down there until years later. But, I never heard anything from the recruiter and I dont remember ever thinking about it again until about 4 or 5 years later when I tried enlisting as a marine. But some person told me about this job that had just opened at a laser tag place that was in our small town. Had never seen it before. I walked in and was hired on the spot. I worked there for 9 months and in that time I quickly worked my way past people that had been there longer to being the shift manager. The lease was bought out from them and the building was taken down and a new building is there now.

My cousin then moved down to San Diego. I lived by myself and was handed another job from a board member that knew our family as a truck driver. There were a few other people that worked at lower positions that were just back from tours of Afghanistan. They were morons. 6 months later my cousin calls me up and was like I got a place come down to san diego and live with me. So, I just packed up what would fit into my car, quit my job, and moved down there. The first three months I dont have much memory of it at all. After than I got two part time jobs with minimal and odd hours. I have several memories being at work and hanging out with people occasionally such as parties. I remember my cousins side door stop opening so I jumping in it like you would see a in a jackie chan movie, climbing up the side of a three story apartment building because I forgot my keys, and on Halloween my cousin and I hopped the fence of water treatment facility avoided the cameras walked around and climbed up a water silo.

I remember having to go to the DMV to renew my drivers licenses and seeing a poster of a navy seal in full get up and feeling like something triggered. For the last past year and more I had no computer or tv service and had no previous research of conspiracy theories or anything but I just had this feeling in the back of my mind that I had another personality in my mind that was a black operations agent. It was in the back in my mind for awhile and I started feeling bad, guilty, confused, and so forth so I started to drink more and bought some weed. A month or so later my 'girlfriend' (had never met her dad or anything so really wasnt my girlfriend, she told me her dad was ex-FBI and she was too scared for me to meet him) had gaven me two pills to help me sleep. The next day I remember hearing the voice of god or something in my head. I dont believe in god but I was convinced to listen and obey what it was prompting me to do. I went from one place to another throughout the city and suburbs going to places I had never been. I talked to a guy at the back of a newspaper printing facility but ended up getting hand cuffed and sent to a psych ward several hours later after some really unexplainable things I still dont understand had happened.

I dont remember what time I went to the ward but they said I had slept for 17 plus hours and after talking to the doctor after I woke up they let me go with a bottle of pills. I got back my car had been taken title and all, had to pay the people that took it several hundred dollars as well. ended up taking everything I owned to a pawn shop to pay these guys. They were pretty scary repo guys. My dad flew down that next day and took me home.

I couldnt think straight nor had thoughts about anything much including the ideas of me being a black operations agent for a year or so. slowly my brain started working again. Went back to the university and got a degree in Mechanical Engineering so I cant be too stupid. But I still get the thoughts every few months or so that will keep me up for several straight days of me being some sort of killing machine or having my memories manipulated or mind controlled. So, here I am only have told this to one doctor in a confidential setting and a few small pieces anonymously online but never something this in detail.

I thought this was going to be much shorter but writing this helped me remember much more about my life than I do have off the top of my head. normally if someone would ask me about myself such as past things I would draw a much shorter answer or a complete blank.

Holy shit I completely forgot when I was 19 my testicles randomly got twisted up when I was at a grocery store. Was with my cousin and he was new to town. He had to run back to our apartment because we walked there and I had to guide him to the hospital because he didnt know where it was. Took about 45 mins. It felt like I was being kicked in the balls every second and even broke out the wind shield in his car on the way. I remember getting to the parking lot of the hospital then blacking out and waking up in a bed later.

Oh, another odd experience I will add. I was a cabin counselor at a summer camp I had been going to for years and pretty much knew everyone at the camp expect this one guy in my cabin. I was 17 years old and he was my age or a year younger. One night he woke me up and said want to see something cool. So he told me to breath hard then exhale with my hands crossed on my shoulders. He had explained what it he was going to do but I didnt believe him and wasnt scared so I did. It was the pass out game. My entire life passed by and faded out like waking up to a dream and when I woke up it took me awhile to remember who he was and where I was and such. Was pretty crazy. These sort of random memories I feel connect somehow.

Going to add one more thing then going to leave this here and forget about it. So, I am currently living at my dads house for a little bit and he offered another guy a room too. He sold his car and everything to try and become a navy seal but only made it through a 3rd of buds and is waiting a few months for the next class to start. Just too many thinks for me to not conclude these things about myself and the government.

I just want to know for sure. The facts. I dont want to go public or anything. I am very private I just would like to hear from someone I can verify that would know for sure about subjects like this on the inside to say yes or no to me that I wasnt apart of anything or I was. But I am convinced that my life that I can remember just mirrors another life that I lived like I was constantly consuming lsd for long periods of times and was told I was another place and seeing different things than I was."

So I sent out a memo to everyone telling them this with instructions on how to get the MAC address and to give it to me. I then left work early for a doctors appointment, turns out after I left someone in billing told everyone that using that address I can ""hack into your phone and steal your banking information and emails"".

Rumors spread and now everyone thinks all their stuff is hacked.

UPDATE: She played it off today saying she was joking when confronted and then gave me her MAC address. But I heard from someone else in the office that she was still saying that later on in the day. I pretty much calmed everyone down and explained what it actually is. My IT manager had a good laugh about it. Also I'm aware MAC filtering alone isn't good security but we're using it in combination with other methods. We just need it to keep certain devices off the network from employees and none of the employees would even know how to spoof a MAC address.

2a3uno,2,2014-07-07,My SO[23m] just ended our 2 year relationship with me[22f] due to ethnicity/marriage. Need some advice.,asdfhk567,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2a3uno/my_so23m_just_ended_our_2_year_relationship_with/,"My now ex ended our relationship due to wanting to marry a woman who is 100% Puerto Rican. His family has sacrificed so much for him by moving here away from all their family to give him and his brothers an education and better life. He thinks he owes it to them to keep the bloodline 100%, and since I'm american I'm not an option.

I knew we would never get married but we are so happy currently. We attend the same college and live only a few houses down from each other. Our internships are only a couple blocks away from each other so we would carpool every morning. I'm very much enjoying my time with him but know my life is going different places after school as well. But my thought process is why not continue sharing these happy  times together because it is rare you can find someone who makes you so incredibly happy. Then when one or the other finishes schools and moves we then can cut ties.

He believes continuing our relationship as lovers would make it harder for us in the long run to end things. But I feel that ending it now is almost worse because we are ending it almost for no reason. Our feelings have not changed one bit, and it is heartwrenching not being able to talk to my best friend, whom I love, everyday like we once did 3 weeks ago. 

I'm also struggling with the no contact rule. I literally cannot stop myself from wanting to talk with him. I'm not sure what to do. Should I try to convince him to continue our relationship, or let him do what he thinks is best even though it is killing me?"

I'm spinning in endless circles with absolutely no end in sight. I graduated college with one degree at the beginning of May. I have to wait till next spring for the other. If I can manage to pass my classes. I have been looking for a job but nothing is available anywhere close to me in the field I want. I tell myself to go get an internship but thanks to my teachers I have no confidence. All my teachers at the end of the semester said they wish I could go back and retake everything because they feel I am just not ready yet. My skills aren't up to the par that everyone else's are. Now I freeze up when I try to do anything. I keep telling myself to just get a part time job. To save up a little. But every job I have gotten an interview for I get physically sick over it. 

I am also constantly numb all the time. Even when I am with my boyfriend, when you would think you should feel happiness. I feel nothing. We have talked about breaking up. He doesn't want to, but he doesn't want to stay together either. He makes up for one of three friends. He is the only sane one I have. My other two, well one is too stressed with her own life to care, and the other one has to have her way. And when you do not conform to her ways she gets all mad at you. She destroys you with her harsh words. 

I make new friends easily. But somehow they always end up trying to get sexual with me. Girls and guys alike. I just want a basic friend and I find naughty pictures randomly sent to me. So I usually end up chasing everyone away. 

I also live in a nasty situation, but I don't have money to leave. I am forced to live with my half brother. He torments me constantly. I can't stand against him, I know he can and would kill me if the change arose. My father told me to get over myself. My brother won't do anything. But he has a number of times in the past. Something pissed him off and he took his anger out in physical violence towards me. He molested me when I was 4 and I have lived with those horrid memories. Only just recently has he admitted to it. My dad still believes he is innocent. 

I'm at a loss as to what I should do anymore. Just doing simple things like getting up in the morning is a huge chore. I think about suicide, but I just end up thinking I'm not worth suicide. Im hoping maybe you guys can give me some ideas? Or someone to talk to who won't want sexual stuff."

Even partial enlistmen in the army, I think, would develop other skills that would allow me to be a good, contributing, civilian member of society.

What do you guys think?"
2a40so,42,2014-07-07,Advice for new MS3s on interacting w/ residents (from a new intern),emmgeezy,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/2a40so/advice_for_new_ms3s_on_interacting_w_residents/,"So I basically had NO idea how big of a difference there is between residents and med students until I started internship. There is just so much more you have to do as a resident! Anyway, I have a lot of friends starting their 3rd year clerkships and they are always asking me for advice so I figured I would post this, as someone who was just recently a med student and can now speak from the point of view of a resident...

Being a hard worker is more important than knowing stuff. That's fo sho.

And knowing stuff about your patients is WAY more important than knowing pimp answers. Residents are so busy that we don't have time to know all of the details and extensive past history about all the patients so y'all as med students actually help by knowing your patient really well. It's your best attribute! And, one of the only ways you can be useful lol :)

And PLEAAASE say ""I don't know"" if your intern/resident/attending is asking you a question regarding your patient. NEVER MAKE SHIT UP. That's selfish. This isn't about you getting it right, it's about your patient getting better.

Also, we know you want us to like you but sometimes you probably won't be able to tell if we like you or not bc we are seriously so busy. Sometimes you will probably think we don't like you to be honest. But it's probably not you, it's us.* So don't be offended if we seem agitated constantly and ignore you all day and get annoyed easily. Just be quiet and don't bother us unless it's relevant.

And PLEAAASE try to google first. For example, don't ask me what the dosing of a medication is when I know you have an app for that. At least phrase the question, ""So are we going to go with the such and such mg dose as it is what the such and such guidelines recommend for a patient with this condition?"" Thank you. Also, you can use google or whatever apps you have to help us figure out complex/rare/confusing cases! We usually don't have time to do fun research like this and it's super helpful when y'all can bring in a paper or few referencing similar cases or suggesting certain treatments that might help your patient. SO HELPFUL!

And finally! Never complain ever. Because your job is SO MUCH EFFING EASIER than ours it's absurd. I never realized this until this year and you probably won't either. But we likely have 7-14x more patients than you do right now so calm. down. bro.**

*It might be you though so remember to be introspective and try to find ways to improve on your own. TAKE INITIATIVE!!!

**So you will complain. That's okay. But just complain to your fellow student and don't let your resident hear.

I think that's it for now, feel free to ask questions! And good luck!!! :)

**EDIT**: So I just re-read this since so many people had negative feelings about it and I am genuinely curious, was it just the ""And, one of the only ways you can be useful lol :)"" and ""Because your job is SO MUCH EFFING EASIER than ours it's absurd...But we likely have 7-14x more patients than you do right now so calm. down. bro."" that is offending people? Because I really can't see anything necessarily terrible about the rest of it.

I guess I could reword that first one to ""And, one of the many ways in which you can really help us out :)!"" and the second one to ""Try not to complain, and if you must, it's best to complain to your companions. It is totally reasonable that carrying 1-3 patients is stressing you out esp since you just started and are likely feeling very overwhelmed, but remember that your interns have just started too, and your PGY2s have just started as upper levels so we are all in the same boat!""

Oh, and for this part ""Just be quiet and don't bother us unless it's relevant."" I guess I mainly meant that for circumstances in which it seems like your resident is super busy and maybe on edge, I don't mean this for all the time. If we are not too busy then by all means, bother away!

I am being sincere here, please let me know if that wording is better. I honestly just copy/pasted this from a text conversation with my friend so I can see how the attitude could be taken the wrong way."

1. The beard... No more beard...
So (I'm art director@design house by trade btw)and I got this dream that our house got the job to create promo images for RPDR ..season 4. 
The problem is, when our staff retouching the images of a queen whom shall not be named (because she might popped out), her 5oclock shadow won't disappear, like magic no matter how we cover it. We give up and the result is promo pic with one stubbly queens. 
""Still a man..."" we shook our head. 
And i awake, I'm late to work today. 
But I got a good laugh.

2. Fan art
So I had this conversation with one of our graphic design intern whom is a young fanboy of drag race. He talk about how he like to draw fan arts of the queens but is too shy to show it around and he wish to get attention &amp; a follow in twitter by this queen for his fan art. 
Another senior staff goes like 'I don't understand you youngster do you guys use that as a bait to gain attention from your idol?""
I was like.. 'Interesting opinion..'

What you guys think about the (in particular, drag race) fan arts? 

As someone who do stuff like this for a living &amp; is older, I see the swarming of fan arts is,  more from younger fans, and done because they admire their idol and the aesthetic of the queens. Recognition from their idol? Well of course, who won't want that too. 

Hopefully these young artist will not just stuck as 'that drag race fan art dude' and develop their talent and gaining recognition outside their drag race fan art. 
(oh and I never join or be around 'fan community' so this subreddit is the first for me to see fans interactions so my view is, narrow. teach this old queen new trick! )

2a4757,4,2014-07-08,Me [21F] with my friend's [21F] ex-boyfriend [23M] of 4 months. I have his stuff and he won't take it back.,throwout_acc,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2a4757/me_21f_with_my_friends_21f_exboyfriend_23m_of_4/,"Some background: I went out with my friend C a couple of years ago (end of summer 2012) and she met D at a party. They became pretty good friends, then FWB, then started being exclusive in February of this year.

D goes to a close by school and got an internship in NYC this summer. My friend and my school is year-long, so we're staying in the city. C is an RA, but cannot stay in the dorms for the summer even though we have classes. Her dorm closes on June 7th. She got a summer apartment with a lease starting at the start of June, but didn't have furniture.

Since D was leaving the city for the summer and has a bed and furniture, he told C that she could have it while he was gone. That would be convenient, because then he wouldn't have to pay for storage and she would have furniture. Great.

However, he had to leave for NYC May 22nd, and C couldn't move in until June. C asked me to hold the stuff for about a week or two until she could move it to her summer apartment. I said sure. I'd met the kid before and he seemed fine, even if he used hard drugs and I knew he was seriously kinky.

So, move in goes fine. Most of his stuff is in an unused room where the cat lives, and his couch is in the living room. His giant ass king-sized bed is in my room, obscuring half my room, but I figure it's only going to be there for a couple of weeks.

A couple of days before C is supposed to take his stuff out of my apartment, I get a message saying that she just learned that D had cheated on her. A few days in NYC, and the moron can't help but find a transsexual hooker off of Craigslist and cheat. She says she doesn't want his stuff and I can choose what to do with it.

At that point I'm about to go on vacation, so I'm like, screw it, I'll deal with this later. While on vacation, he messages me saying that he and Clara broke up, and he'd like to get his stuff back. I said sure. It's not my affair and I don't have much to do with it. We tried to figure out a good day and time for him to get his stuff. Turns out that the only good day is the day I get back from vacation (June 22nd), but I wouldn't be home in time to unlock my apartment for him at a reasonable hour. I figure it's not that big a deal to cut my vacation a day short, so I say fine.

I get a text at 10pm June 21st that he can't make it because he has a family emergency. I'm irritated, but fine, whatever. We reschedule over the next week, with much badgering on my part. He's not particularly responsive, which is annoying to me since I don't exactly want to be holding his stuff. I rearrange a get together with a friend to schedule his pick up for July 6th. I ask my boyfriend to come over to help him move his stuff out. On the 3rd of July, I tell him that I will not keep his stuff for free after the 6th, so he better come pick it up then.

At 8am on July 6th, I get a text that says he might be later than 1pm, the agreed time. ""I think I may be arriving later. Listen if you don't mind just give me a price on storing my stuff there until the end of this month it's a real hassle to come to (my city). I hate to do this again but apparently my friends who are suppose to help me are also hungover. I'm not sure what to do at this point."" I told him that my boyfriend was here to help him out, and asked again what time he could get there. He responded, ""The plan was around 10 driving up with a friend but this person isn't responding. I'm not worried about packing up more than unpacking.""

I told him what a hassle he was being, and that I much preferred him to come down anyway. Finally I told him that since he was using the middle room for storage (as well as my room and the living room), I'd look up comparable rates around my city for storage for a 10x12x8 room. I also asked him to tell me what he thought a good price would be. I thought this was pretty fair, because I'd just wasted my 4th of July weekend, my boyfriend's time, and now I had to reschedule. But I was trying to be *fair* and *reasonable* to this kid.

He told he me'd look up prices and get back to me later that day. Well, at 11:45pm that night, I was getting pretty furious that he wasn't responding as I was *waiting on him* to give me a number. If I were him, this would be my priority. I am holding a very expensive computer for him, his bed, multiple pieces of expensive mechanical devices, etc etc etc.  

I got fed up waiting told him my fee was 175/mo and I wanted 87% of June money as well, since he started cheating at the beginning of June (as far as C had proof). Honestly... I don't think this is a terrible fee. He's taking up my personal space AND the cat-room AND my housemates' space. UHaul and PersonalStorage and all of the others charged around $165/mo for a comparable space.

He asked me how I came up with that number and I rattled it off to him. Then he dropped this one on me, ""You told me that I couldn't store my stuff for free after July 6th. Also, if I knew that you would charge me from the beginning then I would not have left my stuff. I understand that this is a seriously inconvenient situation and I'm trying my best to work with you.""

*I'm trying my best to work with you.*

Oh my god, I snapped. Asked him how he thought he was 'working with me' by blowing me off and breaking promises. I told him that I hasn't been planning to charge him on the 22nd, and I wouldn't have charged him on the 6th, and this quarrel isn't even my quarrel. But now I feel like I've been taken advantage of and completely disrespected. I told him that 'if I had known he was going to cheat I wouldn't have *let* him leave his stuff with me.'

I gave him an ultimatum. Either he comes tomorrow between 11-4, or he pays. He hasn't responded at all today.

What I actually, really want is to leave his stuff on the curb for either him or some other person walking along to pick up. I'm so sick of changing my schedule to fit his needs -- only to be told on the day-of that he isn't coming. Am I over-reacting? What do I do with his shit? I'm sick of it and I'm sick of dealing with him!

---   
**tl;dr**: Friend broke up with boyfriend after finding out he had sex with a transsexual off of Craigslist. I have his stuff and he keeps wasting my time by telling me he'll pick it up, but backing out on the day-of. I want to toss his stuff. What do I do?"

2a48zq,5,2014-07-08,I'm sick of this podunk little white trash town. I'm sick of retail and being treated like trash. I see no way out of here and I feel like I'm going to die in this place.,i_poop_more_than_u,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2a48zq/im_sick_of_this_podunk_little_white_trash_town_im/,"I moved to this shithole because I had nowhere else to go. I was suicidal then with no home, with my mother constantly berratting me about money, on a cocktail of various medications. I dropped out of college and my friend let me move into her mother's house in a trashy little farming community with no jobs. I stayed there a year and slowly managed to work most of my shit out, but now shit is hitting the fan. 

I loved my career. It was the only place I've been happy in the last 6 years of my life. I had a 6 month unpaid internship working for a game company in Seattle. I'd come in sometimes before anyone else in the office, and there were multiple times I stayed way after everyone else had gone home. Even unpaid, if I could have continued to work there for the rest of my life I'd be happy. 

I want to get back to that. It was the one thing that really made me happy, the one thing I miss out of all the experiences in my life. But it's been over a year since I've done work in that field. My portfolio is out of date and no one wants to hire someone who lives 4 hours away in a farming town when they can get people locally. There are no jobs even remotely resembling anything I have experience in here. Even going to my therapist and trying to get a job gives a resounding ""go work at safeway"". I'm so fucking sick of retail. Day in day out with me getting the minimum wage sitting there at home looking at my cash that's barely enough to pay rent and I wonder what the fuck am I doing?

A man shot himself behind my work a couple weeks ago. Stuck a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger, blew his brains all over the car. The only thing anyone said about it at work was ""how sad, that he had nowhere else to go but to shoot himself behind a goddamn &lt;retail store name&gt;.""

All I can think is how sad, all I have to look forward to in life is a god damned retail store. 

I've been turned away for not having enough ""experience"" to work in an office. I've been told I can't ""cherry pick"" my jobs just because I went to college for a couple years. I got called pretentious because I said I wanted to try to get an office job somewhere. 

I even though maybe I'll try and power through my degree. Maybe I'll get an internship again. Maybe I can go back. Now I'm being told I can't go back to school because I have no one willing to cosign loans for me. I'm 3 quarters from graduating and I'm told that I'm fucked because I dropped out ""at the wrong time"" as if I could fucking choose when I was standing on the roof of my apartment complex wondering how badly it would hurt if my skull fractured on the pavement below. 

Am I stuck here forever? In this shithole of a town? Where I was asked ""what for?"" by a therapist when I said I wanted to change genders. Where I was asked by a mental health professional if ""LGBT"" was a type of sandwhich. Where I had a man in my workplace terrorize me because I wasn't a teapartier. Where everyone undermines everyone else and my IQ drops by  25 points every time someone tries to talk to me about how they are having their 3 child with their abusive husband who was convicted as a child molestor. But I'm pretentious if I get excited about a movie with good special effects because god forbid I talk about the thing I wanted a career in.

I used to tell myself I'd kill myself if I didn't have my career, because the rest of the world was such a fucking shitty place. Now I'm being told that I fucked up my life at the age of 23 and can't even finish what I started. The very idea of going on another day in this place makes me sick to my stomach. If I wasn't living with my best friend and the only person I care about in the world, I'd have already spent my last paycheck on a gun so I could go out behind my work and make it a two for one special."

It’s time for our main event, the final confrontation between Senor Tigre and The Foiler! In just moments the Hurtsville Horror Show structure will be lowered, and-

Slam:  The what-now?

Andrews: The structure for the match, it’s… *[John looks up and sees nothing]* uh, where is it?

Slam: I think that one before was for decoration. It looked pretty ordinary.

Andrews: So you say. Well, let’s cross our fingers and hope we survive this. The lumberjacks are on their way to ringside right now!

*[Filing down the ramp and escorted by a cadre of Hurtsville Elite Guardsman, 12 RWF performers surround the ring. They glance around uncomfortably at the troopers, but avoid making eye contact with whatever lies beneath the helmets. Doug Laurie stands mid-ring, watching the procession with a healthy mix of amusement and anxiety]*

Slam: Hey, look who it is! Lee Mercer is out here! Now there’s a guy with little love for the Hurtsville boys. And George Bradley, the Chosen Cup of Coffee! And that huge guy must be Shane Storm!

Andrews: Hard to make them out amidst all the troopers… I see Redneck Warrior, former Hurtsville intern James Lafontaine… wow, there’s Dale Mollins! I guess Foiler let him out of the dungeons for this.

Slam: Maybe it’s Dean Mollins? You never know. Who else… cripes, there’s Alex Amazing! Where has he been? Scratch that, screw that guy. Tre Classic is out there, and Havok, too.

Andrews: Well, I’ll be a monkey’s uncle. There’s Armondo!  And Steve Rawls! And… Rodney, do you see what I’m seeing? Could it be?

Slam: I don’t believe it. It’s Chris Hardcore!

Andrews: The RWF Original, himself! Poor guy, they haven’t put him on TV in forever!

Slam: He’s like our JTG!

*[The lumberjacks space themselves evenly around the ring, three on a side, with old alliances still showing. Shane and Armondo stand together, as do Chris Hardcore and Alex Amazing. Lafontaine and Mollins stand together as well, bonded by their experiences in the Hurtsville Catacombs]*

Andrews: Now that’s quite the crew. 

*[Suspended above the entrance stage, the captive Faith No More (with Big Jim Martin and his reverse Mohawk on guitar because who give a crap about Trey Spruance) launches, on pain of temporal erasure, into ‘Surprise! You’re Dead!’ again, the longtime HVX theme song. The lights go out, but the band plays on. A lone white spotlight appears at the top of the stage, and a number of fully grown and hungry-looking Siberian tigers emerge from the light. They begin to line the ramp, making their own line of guards. The spotlight flickers ever-so-slightly, and the robed figure of Senor Tigre appears on bended knee. He looks up to where the Horror Show structure is, was, or will be, and then stands with a flourish. His robe, made of the finest interdimensional silks and fringed with black-and-white stripes of Venusian ermine, seems almost alive as he strides down the ramp. As he passes the tigers, they fall in line behind him. He reaches the bottom of the ramp and doffs his robe in one fluid motion, vaulting from the floor to stand on the top rope regally, surveying his former kingdom. The robe floats to the ground, and the tigers coalesce into it, the lot of them vanishing in a haze of striped smoke]*

Laurie: Ladies, gentlemen, and whatever else is out there tonight, allow me to present to you our Main Event!  This contest is a Hurtsville Horror Show, to be decided by one fall! In the ring now, the Felonious Feline, the Dapper Deposed Dictator, Seeeennnooooorrrr Tttiiiiiiiiiggrrrrrreeeeeee!

*[Senor Tigre, his focus unwavering, raises a single fist. His lighting fades and the arena is enveloped in a miasma of heavy purple smog, and Doug Laurie coughs a bit as it rises]*

Laurie: And now *[kaff]*, his opponent. From time immemorial, he is the Lord and Protector of Hurtsville, the Grinning Goliath, the Mirthful Monster, the Alliterative Antagonist, your god and ruler, none other than Theeeeee Fooooiilllllleeerrrrr!

*[A mystic swirling of the usual Hurtsvillian mist high above the ring slowly, in Cheshire Cat-like fashion, takes the form of The Foiler! He hovers above the ring, body shrouded by a large cape complete with Dr. Strange-edition ludicrous collar, and a military cap rests atop his awful, horrible head. He floats down to the ring, arms crossed beneath the cape, and stops in his corner. He throws back an arm, at once striking a fighting pose and losing his hat and cape, which for some reason explode into balls of energy like a dying Mega Man. He chuckles, and with a snap of his fingers Doug Laurie finds himself by the timekeeper’s table. The Foiler’s smile seems exceptionally wide as the lights come up, revealing the twisted, partially-living Hurtsville Horror Show cage high above the ring. It begins to lower itself, and The Foiler speaks]*

The Foiler: I’m glad you kept the entrance tasteful, aha, you mangy tomcat. And now, let our game come to it’s conclusion. There’s only one way, aha, that this can end.

*[The crowd shudders as The Foiler’s psychic wink reverberates though their consciousness, and the structure settles into place. The lumberjacks, trapped inside as well, shuffle around nervously]*

Andrews: It’s time.

Slam: I’d say ‘Heaven help us all’, but I don’t think that would fly here.

*DINGDINGDING*

*The bell fades and Senor Tigre and The Foiler begin to circle each other in the ring. Their movements are familiar to each other, and each knows they won’t find an opening without giving one up. After a few tense moments, and a complete circuit around the ring, Senor Tigre makes his move. He charges The Foiler and leaps, but The Foiler sidesteps. Tigre is counting on his brother’s evasion, as he lands on the second rope and backflips off, connecting with a Moonsault Body Press that brings The Foiler down! Tigre rolls to a standing position and hits the far ropes, aiming a lethal Dropkick at The Foiler as he sits up. With preternatural quickness, The Foiler lays flat and the kick passes over his head! He kips up and swings a heavy lariat at Tigre as he rises, but the Lethal Lucha ducks and whips out a toe kick to the midsection!*

Slam: Right to the boiler!

Andrews: Thanks, Mr. Uecker.

*Tigre follows up with a flurry of punches and chops, driving The Foiler back into the corner! He winds up for a big haymaker while the larger man is dazed, but The Foiler shoots out a massive hand and grabs Tigre by the throat! Pulling him in close, The Foiler blasts Tigre with a vicious headbutt, and then turns and tosses him over the ropes with one hand! Tigre is caught by Tre Classic and Redneck Warrior, who quickly roll him back in, where he avoids a stomp from The Foiler that shakes the entire ring*

Andrews: Looks like the lumberjacks are taking it easy so far.

Slam: Yeah, but that never lasts.

*The Foiler hits the adjacent ropes and picks up speed as Senor Tigre rolls to his feet.  The hulking form of The Foiler bears down on the Lethal Lucha, aiming a Kenka Kick right at his jaw, but Tigre counters with a low Dropkick that takes out The Foiler’s planted leg! The ring shakes as he hits the mat, and again as Tigre follows up with a Springboard Back Elbow Drop!*

Andrews: Stiff shot to the solar plexus, and Senor Tigre shows off his blazing speed!

Slam: Don’t forget about his educated feet. I think they went to the same school as X-Pac’s.

*Tigre pops up to his feet, but The Foiler snakes out an arm and hooks Tigre by the ankle, tripping him up. Still gripping his former partner, The Foiler rises and twists, swinging Tigre like a sack of laundry up into the air, releasing him. The Foiler turns his back and puts a hand to where his ear is not, playfully awaiting the ensuing thud of Tigre’s body on the mat. It never comes, as Senor Tigre lands silently in a combat crouch. The Foiler senses something amiss and spins, only to catch a brutal palm thrust to the throat that sends him reeling. Wasting not a second, Tigre leaps again with a Flying Shoulder Block, sending The Foiler tumbling through the ropes to the concrete, where he is surrounded by Lee Mercer and Alex Amazing. The two lumberjacks put the boots to him while Tigre watches with a smile from in the ring. The Foiler shoves Amazing away from his knees, and the clubbing blows from Lee Mercer only slow his rise for a second. On his feet, The Foiler blocks a punch from Mercer and hits a Heart Punch on the Brooklyn Beast, who stares wide-eyed and raises a fist in retaliation before the delayed reaction sets in and he crumples like a paper bag.*

Slam: Poor Mercer, The Foiler always manages to get him.

Andrews: It’s a risk you take when you become a lumberjack, especially in a match like this!

Slam: They didn’t volunteer, they were shanghaied. And Senor Tigre is going for the Pearl Harbor job!

*The Foiler turns just in time to see Tigre take flight, vaulting the ropes for a Body Press to the outside!  Showing off his inhuman strength, The Foiler gets his hands up and redirects Tigre’s momentum, sending him face-first into the twisted Horror Show framework! The metal itself seems to groan and twist on impact, almost as if it were growing. Tigre falls to the concrete and the lumberjacks immediately get to work putting him back into the ring. The Foiler, with an audible cackle, reaches under the ring and pulls out a steel folding chair before getting back between the ropes*

Andrews: The Foiler with the steel chair, and things are about to get ugly!

Slam: Did you notice the cage thingy is moving? It’s definitely more purple than it was before.

Andrews: According to the official documentary, the Hurtsville Horror Show structure is built and maintained by the will of Hurtsville’s ruler. In a way, it acts as a sort of barometer.

Slam: That’s… yeah. Geez, Johnny, you ever think you’d be announcing this kind of stuff?

Andrews: Some days I’m amazed at all the things I’ve seen and done here. Other days, I wish I was back on the radio, doing my sports call-in show.

Slam: Hey, I remember that. Didn’t you get replaced by Mike Francesa?

*The Foiler stalks the bruised Tigre, chair in hand. As the Dastardly Dictator hauls himself up with a hand on the ring ropes, The Foiler charges with the chair and swings for the fences. Tigre rolls to the side, and The Foiler tries a downward strike that Tigre backs away from. Using his size and reach, The Foiler keeps swinging and Tigre keeps dodging, until he’s against the ropes again. The Foiler gut-shots Tigre with the chair, then raises it high overhead for the killing blow. As the chair comes down Senor Tigre drops flat and rolls to the apron, and The Foiler connects instead with the top rope! The chair bounces back and hits him square in the face! He staggers back, shaking it off and bringing the chair up again, but Tigre has already come off the rope with another springboard, lashing out with a Spinning Heel Kick that sends the chair back into The Foiler’s head! The chair breaks in two and The Foiler falls to the mat!*

Slam: Ouchie!

*Senor Tigre picks up the seat of the chair and brings it down over the chest of The Foiler, who convulses with the impact. He sprints for the ropes and leaps again to the middle ropes, flipping over for a chair-assisted Lionsault! He winces as he comes down across The Foiler’s chest, not even bothering to move the rent metal before he hooks a leg like a tree trunk for the pinfall!*

1!

2!

*… but The Foiler powers out, throwing Tigre onto his butt in the process. Tigre is quick to recover and moves in with some low kicks to chip away, but The Foiler manages to get upright. He closes in and gets a massive left hand through Tigre’s guard, catching him in the jaw, then follows with a huge body blow that leaves Senor Tigre hunched over and gasping. The Foiler grabs him around the waist and lifts him into Powerbomb position, moving towards the ropes. Just as he reaches the edge of the ring, Senor Tigre throws his weight backward and hits a Huricanrana, sending The Foiler over the ropes again!*

Andrews: Timely counter by the cunning Tigre, but it’s going to take more than that!

*Senor Tigre lands awkwardly on his side, but The Foiler managed to get a hand on the rope as he went over and minimized the damage. The Foiler gets to his feet on the ring apron, but Senor Tigre tries for a shoulder ram through the ropes from the mat. The Foiler dodges artfully and clubs Tigre across the back of the neck as he pokes out, and the Striped Stalker goes down, hung on the middle rope. The Foiler pulls him out to the apron and grabs him in a Gutwrench, lifting him up high and jumping off to the cold, hard floor below, where he plants Senor Tigre with a Ganso Bomb off the apron!*

Slam: The Last Laugh, and Tigre must be crippled out there!

*The Foiler goes for the heap of Tigre again, but Shane Storm and Armondo are there to do their duty as lumberjacks. Storm steps in front of The Foiler while Armondo tries to stir Senor Tigre. From behind the former Revolution X stablemates, Chris Hardcore shouts out ‘Let them Fight!’ and the crowd starts up a chant to the same effect. While Storm engages Hardcore verbally, The Foiler shoves him into the RWF Original and they go down in a pile of arguing muscle. Armondo backs up as The Foiler turns back to his former brother, and the Hurtsville Horror slips an arm under the prostrate body of Senor Tigre, lifting him like a sack of flour with the Karelin Lift and slamming him into cage wall again! Tigre howls like an animal as the jagged framework tears into his skin, and a number of lumberjacks move in closer to the ring when they see the blood soak into the structure, which writhes and sprouts additional struts and spurs where Tigre hit. The Foiler laughs low and loud as he surveys the damage before shoving Tigre back into the ring*

Andrews: What a series of offensive maneuvers by The Foiler! This has got to be it!

*Following Tigre into the ring, The Foiler puts his forearm across the neck and leans heavy on him for the pin attempt. The ref counts to one, but Senor Tigre connects with a fist to the temple that shakes The Foiler loose. The Foiler falls back, apparently shaken up good by the blow, and as Senor Tigre rises the glint of his brass knuckles catches the light. He sneers, then slides over and wraps up The Foiler in the Tiger’s Bite! The huge mass of The Foiler is bent back like a pretzel as Tigre wrenches the hold in tighter and tighter, squeezing the neck and bending the spine painfully. The Foiler tries to pry himself free, but the hold is on perfectly! His flailing limbs cannot find their way free.*

Slam: Now that’s a toughie, Tigre might have it here, even after that thrashing he just received! What does that mean for Hurtsville?

Andrews: Well, for one thing the new stuff growing on the cage is looking a bit… striped. Regardless, The Foiler is going to have to break that hold the hard way. There’s no rope breaks or 5-counts in this one!

*Rocking back and forth, The Foiler attempts to either dislodge the tiger on his back, or gain some leverage advantage, but Tigre has his weight distributed expertly and it’s no use. With his strength visibly fading, The Foiler goes to work on Senor Tigre’s leg with his free elbow. Ramming his elbow point into Tigre’s thigh over and over again, he knots up the leg and manages to break the body scissor portion of the hold. He leans forward to get his legs in front of him, and with surprising flexibility he shoots his leg up, the vicious spike on the toe of his boot catching Tigre in the forehead! The shock causes Tigre to break the hold, and he and The Foiler get some separation*

Andrews: He broke the Tiger’s Bite again! 

Slam: Yeah and he.. hey, that cage is looking pretty odd.

*[The Hurtsville Horror Show frame begins to pulse slowly, unearthly flickers of light glancing around in the corner of the eye]*

*Both beings, wearing the pain of battle clearly now, force themselves up. They stand stock-still in opposite corners, the eyeless grimace of The Foiler locked onto Senor Tigre’s predacious snarl. Around the ring, the lumberjacks are restless, the tension immeasurable*

Andrews: What on Earth?

Slam: Not at all.

*A low growl rumbles from Senor Tigre, vibrating the cell-like thing, and The Foiler answers him with a soft laugh barely audible and completely terrifying. Senor Tigre puts his hands up in a grappling stance and advance to the center of the ring, where The Foiler meets him.*

Slam: Are they going to wrestle? Like *wrestle* wrestle?

Andrews: I think so!

*In perfect unison the Hurtsvillian pair tie up in a collar and elbow. Senor Tigre gets a standing armbar with an elbow for good measure, but The Foiler turns into a hammerlock and slaps Tigre on the back of the head, then shoves him away. Tigre gets up slowly, not hurt but confident that his brother won’t cheap-shot im at this particular moment. Tigre turns, ready, and they tie up again, or maybe not quite as Tigre slips around The Foiler and into a rear waistlock. He jumps up and gets the pinning combination with a Victory Roll! 1! 2! The Foiler forces Tigre back for a pin of his own! 1! 2! Tigre grabs The Foiler’s wrists and yanks his legs free, using them and rolling backwards for a modified Monkey Flip!*

Andrews: Dang!

*The Foiler arches in the air and lands on his feet, holding on to Senor Tigre’s arm and pulling him over into a Japanese Arm Drag! Tigre goes down but pops back up, tossing The Foiler with one of his own! The Foiler is up and tries for a clothesline, but Tigre sidesteps him and lands a knee to the gut! He rolls onto The Foiler’s back to set up The Feliner, but The Foiler has him scouted and grabs Tigre around the throat, flipping him forward to the mat. Tigre gets his feet under him and lands unharmed, dropping to one knee to simultaneously avoid am uppercut and land a throat thrust counter that backs The Foiler up. The Primeval Predator snags The Foiler around the waist from behind as he staggers away. Tigre ducks The Foiler’s attempted back elbow, snags the offending arm and swings his legs up with impossible agility, latching onto The Foiler’s neck with the Six Seconds Magic!

Slam: Another nasty hold, and one often favored by The Foiler, now used against him by Tigre. That’s a spite move in this sport, John. That’s personal.

Andrews: Oh, so *now* it’s personal.

*The Foiler looks to have plenty of steam left for the time being, dragging Tigre to the nearest corner and swinging him up and onto the ringpost, but Tigre doesn’t release the hold.*

Andrews: He’s got him up on the post, and… wait, The Foiler’s climbing up with him! 

Slam: Is he doing what I think he’s doing?

*Perched atop the turnbuckle with Tigre still draining his strength, The Foiler uses his free arm to lift Tigre as high as he can and pushes himself off, landing on the outside of the ring on top of Senor Tigre! Their crash takes out Steve Rawls and George Bradley as well, and Havok gets shoved into the cage as the lumberjacks gang way. The Foiler and Senor Tigre lie motionless on the concrete.*

Slam: They must be dead! Or, like, in Odinsleep or whatever.

Andrews: I can’t imagine either of them… oh, wait, no. *[shakes head]* Always right in time to make me looks like an idiot.

*Senor Tigre and The Foiler begins to stir, slowly inching their way free of each other and to clear ground. As each creeps agonizingly upward, the lumberjacks begin to help them up and direct them back into the ring. The Foiler, no on his feet, shoves the lumberjacks away in fury, when Senor Tigre moves towards him in a blur. Tigre leaps for the Flying Burrito, but The Foiler meets him with a toe spike to the head, and Tigre hits the ground in a daze! The Foiler stands over him, then looks to the sadistic patchwork of metal and wood, that twists and changes as the match goes on. *

Andrews: The Foiler has that evil look!

Slam: How can you tell?

*The Foiler hauls up Senor Tigre and grabs him by the throat, lifting him and slamming him into the cage wall! The cage seems to lap up the torn flesh, and The Foiler puts Tigre over his shoulder and spins, slamming him into the ringpost, then turning back and ramming him into the cage again! Senor Tigre hangs limp from The Foiler’s shoulder, and the Mirthful Monster lets out a haunting ‘ahahaha!’*

The Foiler: Ahahaha!

*Shifting the weight of his burden, The Foiler holds Senor Tigre across his shoulders and turns to the cage. With his whole body behind it, The Foiler sends Senor Tigre high into the air with a Forilla Press, sending Senor Tigre up like a rocket at the contorting wiry deathtrap surrounding them. The Foiler is too soon rushed by the lumberjacks who have been hurt by his aggression to notice that Senor Tigre twisted himself in the air and caught the framework! By now the lumberjacks are all fighting with each other as well, feeding the Hurtsville Horror Show cage!*

Andrews: It’s pandemonium out there! Somebody’s going to get hurt!

*With no clear target below, Senor Tigre Smiles and pounces from high on the cage, diving down and flipping into a Diving Double Knee Drop that levels Lee Mercer and Shane Storm!*

Slam: Dictator Drop! C-c-c-combo breaker!

*It’s a melee, but it looks like old grudges still carry some weight as both The Foiler and Senor Tigre are being ganged up on. The Foiler sidesteps a charging Chris Hardcore, sending him tumbling into Lee Mercer. Steve Rawls is blindsided by a Spamfist. Senor Tigre hits a split dropkick that sends Havok and Dean Mollins into the now-razor sharp cage walls, then lands in a totally sweet leg sweep that topples Redneck Warrior. Armondo gets in a jaw jacker on Tigre, but George Bradley hits him from behind and becomes the target of Armondo’s Irish ire (eire?). Fists are flying everywhere, and The Foiler and Senor Tigre are finally backed toward each other. They bump, and both spin with knuckles swinging on instinct, but when they realize who the other is they stop and stare, fists frozen in mid-hook. Tigre’s stare flits just over The Foiler’s shoulder, and he launches himself at the Tittering Tyrant. The Foiler catches him and elevates him even higher with a Flapjack, and Tigre rotates into a Shooting Star Body Press, coming down hard onto the chest of Alex Amazing! James Lafontaine comes rushing in to take advantage of the off-balance Tigre, but The Foiler plants a foot on Tigre and delivers the Shining Black to James, his former intern. In turn, Tigre brings down Tre Classic’s charge towards The Foiler, with a surprise Drop Toe Hold!*

Andrews: Did I just see that?

Slam: Nevermind you. Did *I* just see that?

Andrews: Did they just…

Slam: Help? Each other? After… all that stuff?

*The lumberjacks realize what they’re seeing as well, and begin to surround Tigre and The Foiler, who get back into the ring. The lumberjacks follow,  encircling the ring with Senor Tigre and The Foiler in the center like a big, sweaty crosshairs, with emphasis on the hairs. The Foiler begins to raise a hand, but stops and nods to Tigre. Tigre merely smiles out of the corner of his mouth, one unpleasantly large canine tooth sparking like Kim Hap Hwan, and the Horror Show fills with smoke, a swirl of purple and black obscuring the view. The crowd is raucous!*

Andrews:  Holy Shnikey!

Slam: What he said!

*The toot of a faraway steam whistle sounds, and what might just be laughter. The mistlike gloom dissipates, leaving no trace of The Foiler, Senor Tigre, the lumberjacks, or the ring and cage. The Hurtsville Hippodrome begins to shake, softly but growing slowly in intensity*

Andrews: What the $&amp;@# is going on around here? 

Slam: You know what I see? The guards busting their asses out the exits. I say we do the same. Leave this crap for Bryan Dawson to explain.

Andrews: *[drops headset and books it]*

2a4det,1,2014-07-08,I get anxiety about any kind of change in my life. Normal?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2a4det/i_get_anxiety_about_any_kind_of_change_in_my_life/,"I've always had bad anxiety, and it comes and goes in my life as it pleases (some times for no reason at all.)
 
But when it comes to change, the anxiety absolutely kills me. 

Just last week, I moved in to a new place and had such crippling anxiety that I couldn't actually stay in my place. I had to drive around or stay at my girlfriend's house in order to relax. Even being in the place still makes me feel terrible because I feel like I picked a bad area and no longer like it. Still, sitting here at my parents house an hour out of the city because I'm too much of a wuss to go back there, I can't handle this. And it's not even that I'm afraid of being on my own (I actually like it), it's being in this weird place I don't like. I've lived out of the house for 7 years now, and now I'm crawling back to my parents place with my head hanging in shame for no reason other than my anxiety got bad?

I also am being offered an internship opportunity, but have too much anxiety to take it because I am afraid I will fail, or it won't work out, or anything like that. And I can't sleep because I don't know what to say or how to say no, or maybe I'm making a big mistake.

I have anxiety about graduating University next year, wondering where the hell I'm going to go with my life.

I find so much comfort in the familiar, as everyone does, and I try often to force myself to step out of my comfort zone, such as traveling or going out to bars with friends or spontaneous road trips. But I usually fail at these things, because I have health anxiety that makes me worry that if I leave my city, I'll get some kind of weird illness and die while I am out of the country because I don't have access to my health care.

Seriously, I hope I'm not alone in this. How do I even defeat this? 

The only person that knows about my anxiety is my mom, and she is caring but she says she doesn't know how to help me.

Yech.

Sorry.

One from a second-tier national firm and one from a small firm with less than 10 employees where I currently work. 

I graduated near the top of my class and turned down an opportunity to intern at a Big Four New York office.

I am very high strung and the office I work in is very calm, but I have a strong desire to be around accountants my age. Currently everyone in my office is nice but all are at least 10 years older than me. These people are so nice to me but it's harder to relate to my coworkers. 

I also don't see myself ever making partner. Not because I can't but because I think I can have much better career satisfaction elsewhere. So I'm wondering if I should apply for a Big Four this recruiting cycle instead to have that name on my resume and to connect with high performing peers before they move on to private practice or higher levels in the firm.

Should I a) stay at my current firm b) go to the national firm or c) go to the Big Four? What would you do?

2a4fi1,27,2014-07-08,There is something wrong on my street.,sidewalkend,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2a4fi1/there_is_something_wrong_on_my_street/,"There is something wrong on my street. Things have been off for a while now but it was only recently that things have gone from “Strange but Fairly Harmless” to “Fearing for my Life.” I just want to get my story out there so that, when something happens to me, there is some available record (no matter how unbelievable) of what has transpired.


To be quite honest I want to get this over with as soon as possible, as I’m paranoid enough as it is, but I figure it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t take a moment to jot down some quick back story. My roommate, Laurie, and I moved into our apartment about seven months ago, at the beginning of our college’s “spring” semester. We chose the apartment because we had friends already living in the neighborhood (a street over from our apartment) who had nothing but good things to say about the area. Of course, being college students, we were just happy that the rent was cheap ($250 per person per month with all utilities included, can you believe that?!!) and the location was close to the college. 


Anyways, Laurie was going to be a senior next year so she was all stressed out studying for grad school admissions and signing up for internships and things like that, so I got into the habit of walking a street over to hang with our friends at their place. The only downside of this was that most of the time I stayed at their place until night fell (and where I live this happens very early, especially in the winter) and so to get back to my place I had to walk back in the darkness. Obviously as a young woman in a fairly poor neighborhood I had my share of worries about this. It’s kind of funny because, out of all the various terrifying scenarios I had imagined (rape, murder, etc.) the one that actually ended up happening was something more horrifying than I ever could’ve imagined. But I got over my fears and most nights I ran home as fast as I could, mace in one hand, keys tucked between the knuckles of the other. 



It was during these late-night dashes home that I noticed the first strange thing about my street- there are no streetlights. It is very strange. My street is in a well-populated neighborhood and, in fact, comes right off of the main street going through the (small) city in which it is located. The streets on either side of it have streetlights, as do the streets intersecting with it, so it would make sense for us to also have streetlights, but alas, there isn’t a single light on my street. No porch lights either. There isn’t even light coming from the windows of the various houses and apartment complexes, including our own. I found this particularly strange because I would look up at the windows of our apartment as I was coming down the street and I would see that the lights were off but as I entered our complex and made my way up the sloping steps to our third-floor apartment I would realize that our lights were indeed on. For some reason I didn’t really register this with anything beyond mild curiosity. I mean, every street has its quirks. Maybe our street wasn’t publicly owned due to some long ago land settlement or something. I didn’t really think about it too hard, and maybe I should’ve.



I noticed the second strange thing about a month after we moved in. My friends had come over to my place for a change and we were all drinking and playing truth or dare (perhaps a little childish for college students, but we aren’t exactly the most mature bunch around). After a bunch of the typical truths and dares (do a strip tease, crank call your grandma, talk about your crush, etc.) Laurie dared me to go to our neighbors and ask for a cup of sugar. Thinking back on it now that dare was stupid as all hell but at the time we found it genius and couldn’t stop laughing. “Who actually asks their neighbor for a cup of sugar?” Laurie slurred, “I mean like it’s a stereotype and all but how many people do you know who have actually ever asked their neighbor for a cup of sugar.” (If you know anyone please let me know) Anyways, I (rather unsteadily) got to my feet and made my way down to the apartment below us, on the second floor. I knocked for about a half hour (at least it felt that way, anyone who has been drunk before knows that after a certain point time takes on a funny sort of quality) and when no one answered I made my way up the stairs and reported back to my eager drunken friends that no one was home. 



Well, of course, they wouldn’t take that. “Go to the next one!” They urged. “And if no one is there, move to a different building!” They were really hyped up on this dare at this point (and to be totally honest so was I) and told me they would not let me in unless I had a cup of sugar to show for my efforts. So I went to the first floor, knocked, and got no reply. I was determined to see this dare through so I went to the apartment building to the left of ours and rang every single doorbell. Nothing. So I moved over to the house across the street from the apartment building to the left of ours and knocked and hollered and banged on all the windows. Still nothing. I honestly do not remember how many buildings I assaulted in this fashion but I was at it until the sun began peeking over the horizon and I began sobering up and realizing that I was tired and nauseous and 150% done with this dare. And thus I made my way home to an apartment full of passed out friends and empty beer cans and pizza boxes. 



Actually, now that I mention the pizza boxes I’ve suddenly remembered something else. We have never been able to get a pizza delivered to our apartment. Not once. The drivers either get lost, despite our best directions, or just never show up, leaving behind no record that we had ever tried to order pizza. So I have no clue where the pizza came from that night. Maybe my friends had got it delivered to their place? Maybe they drove to get it before becoming intoxicated? I have no clue, but one thing for sure is that it was definitely not delivered to our place. 


So far everything I’ve shared has been pretty mild. I mean, yeah, all this stuff was pretty weird, but there was never any indication to me, or to Laurie that our lives were in any danger. So when the first scary thing happened I honestly did not see it coming.  



It was four months ago, three months after we moved in. I was doing my nightly dash-home-from-my-friends’-place when suddenly I was lost. I mean honest to goodness, lost. It is a quick route from my friends’ place to our place- walk down half a block to the main street, take the next right onto our street, pass two houses and one apartment complex and you arrive at our place. I had done it dozens (maybe even one hundred? I don’t know, I’m too lazy to do the math) of times. It was pure muscle memory but somehow I managed to fuck it up. 


It was a clear night with one of those moons that looks full but isn’t actually full and you can’t tell why you know this because it really does look full, but for some reason you can tell that it isn’t. So I could see a little bit. And I knew it definitely had to be my street because my street is the only street in the whole city that doesn’t have streetlights. But for the life of me I could not find my apartment building. Not only that, but none of the buildings around me looked familiar. There were no numbers, no mailboxes, no gardens or lawn decorations, nothing to distinguish one building from the next.



I tried walking until I found an intersecting street in the hopes that I could reorient myself to where I was (by this point I knew the neighborhood and surrounding areas pretty well) but I never came upon one. This was probably the strangest thing. I ran, and then jogged, and then walked for what must’ve been miles and miles. I counted hundreds and hundreds of indistinguishable houses with no end in sight, the moon staying straight above my head the whole time. Eventually my legs gave out. If you’ve never exhausted a muscle to the point of total fatigue- it is really something. No matter how much effort you put in there is no chance of moving for a while. So at that point I gave up, laid down on one of the identical front lawns, and fell asleep. 



When I woke up I was on the lawn of my apartment building. I thought that maybe it had been a dream. Maybe I had passed out from exhaustion right on the doorstep of my apartment and dreamt what had happened. Then I tried to stand up. You know the scene in Bambi where he learns to walk? That’s how I felt. I gritted my teeth through the pain and stumbled through the front door and called up the stairs for Laurie to help me. After getting no response I figured she must have left early for her class and so I began the grueling task of dragging myself up three flights of stairs to my apartment. 



It took a herculean effort but I finally made my way inside of my apartment and what I found enraged me. Laurie had been there all along! I completely lost my shit. “WHY DIDN’T YOU COME HELP ME!” and “PULL YOUR TITS OUT OF YOUR EARS AND LISTEN TO ME YOU BITCH” and a bunch of other increasingly angry and nonsensical things. She adamantly claimed that she did not hear me and, in fact, did not even notice I had not made it back last night. She mumbled about exhaustion and stress and about how no matter how hard she studied she couldn’t remember anything.



I was way too angry to listen to, or consider, any of this and so I limp-crawled my way to my bedroom and collapsed onto my bed. I think maybe if we hadn’t fought (If I hadn’t gotten so angry) things might have turned out differently. I’m trying not to dwell on it though, because it brings me to a dark place.


And so a rift grew between Laurie and myself. We talked less and less and she spent more and more time in her room. The times I saw Laurie grew further and farther between. Two months passed like this until Scary Thing Number Two happened.



Two months ago I woke in the middle of the night to Laurie screaming. It is a miracle I woke up at all because the screaming was far off, like she was out on the street. Sure enough, she wasn’t in her room or the bathroom or the living room or the kitchen. I ran out into the street to look for her because, fighting or not, she was still one of my closest friends. The moon was the same as it had been that first night- full, but not really full. I stood on the street and called out to Laurie. It was strange because, no matter how loud I screamed, my voice sounded hollow and subdued- no echo and definitely not as loud as it should’ve been considering the deadly silence of the street.



After about the third or fourth time I called out for her I heard Laurie scream again. Even though I thought I had gotten closer to her, her screaming sounded just as faraway as it had in my bedroom. Still, I ran in the direction that I thought it was coming from. I ran and ran and ran and every time she screamed it sounded no louder and no quieter. Even worse, after pausing for a moment to catch my breath, I realized I was lost again- in exactly the same way as before. 



Actually, it wasn’t exactly the same. Although before my street was wide enough for two cars to drive on, on that night the houses were closer together, and the street was narrow- only big enough for one car at a time (had there been any cars, which, of course there wasn’t). After hours of fruitless searching I tried to lay down in one of the front yards and fall asleep but this was hard because I could still periodically hear Laurie’s screaming. I lay awake looking straight up at the full-but-not-full moon that never moved from its spot dead center in the sky. I don’t know if it was hours or days later (I had taken to telling the time by Laurie’s screaming- it had been 347 screams by this point) but eventually I fell asleep. 



This time I woke up inside the entryway of my apartment building. I don’t know if that has any meaning. I don’t know what has or does not have meaning anymore, but that is the way it happened. I ran up to my apartment and went straight into Laurie’s room. At least, that was my plan but when I got inside I found that the room that had been hers was completely empty.



It seems like I always end up furious at Laurie after these weird getting-lost spells. This time I was angry because I thought she had moved out and played some weird prank on me. I was so angry that I marched right over to my friends-one-street-over and launched into a rant immediately as I walked through the door. And that is when one of the scariest things of all happened.


As I was going on and on about Laurie and her selfishness and her departure and her pranks my friends watched with concerned faces. When I took a breath one of them put their hand on my arm and asked me “Who is Laurie?” 



I thought that they had to be in on this. I mean how could they have forgotten Laurie who had been our friend for years and who they had seen mere weeks ago. I frantically swiped through the photo gallery on my phone trying to find a picture for evidence but there were none. After I realized the fear and concern in my friends’ eyes was real I played it off as a practical joke and ran back home. 


Last month I “got lost” again. It was pretty much the same as before but now the street was about the width of a sidewalk. And this time instead of chasing I was being chased. I screamed for help- again and again, but nobody came. I couldn’t help but wonder if I was about to meet the same fate as Laurie- and if this was how she felt in her final moments. I think that whatever it was got me, but my memories are really hazy. All I remember is falling and pain and a moon that isn’t quite full. I woke up outside the door to my apartment.



It isn’t just my memories of collapsing that are leaving me. While the events of the past few months are as vivid as though they happened yesterday, I am losing more and more of my childhood. I lose more and more each day. My earliest memory now is from when I was seventeen. I can’t remember my mother’s name or my birthday. I don’t know if I have any siblings. I don’t know where I was born. 



Last night was the most recent time I got lost. The houses were so close that I had to edge my way sideways to move forward. I don’t know why I even decided to move forward. For some reason it felt safer than staying put. Things were lurking in the shadows. I kept catching glimpses of them out of the corners of my eyes- dark and writhing and like nothing I had ever seen before. I considered entering a house but the darkness inside was pressurized and I knew that if I tried to open a door or window everything would explode and I would drown in the dusty shadows that kept threatening to spill out from the chimneys and mail flaps and from behind the not-full moon. I woke up in my bed. 



I don’t know if this is all a delusion or a prank or what but I am scared and I fear that I may not have much time left. I don’t know who I am anymore but all that remains within me is the desire to not be forgotten. Please don’t forget about me. I don’t know where I am or where I am going or what is happening but strangely enough my biggest fear is that my existence will be wiped clean from this planet. Please remember me. And please spread the word: There is something wrong on my street.

2a4oke,2,2014-07-08,Not sure if anxious or just generally messed up (21f),Ask_anxiety,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2a4oke/not_sure_if_anxious_or_just_generally_messed_up/,"I have been struggling with mental health issues for years, and though I saw therapists as a teenager 5 years ago to work through some life events, I have never been diagnosed with anything such as depression or anxiety.


However, I struggle with simply living on just about a daily basis and I know that this is not normal. I have obsessive thoughts to where I can make myself sick overthinking everything in my life, from minor social interactions that day to my relationship with my significant other, to upsetting things from years and years in the past. These intrusive thoughts can keep me up at night or distract me from living in the moment, as my mind is caught up in its own mess.


As I have been going through undergrad business school and now an internship, it has been especially challenging... I have very little self confidence despite receiving really only positive feedback. I try to build myself up and take good care of myself physically but I feel that I am only scratching the surface of fixing myself. At night I just feel constant doom about every impending day despite nothing bad ever happening during a typical day in my life, and I feel anxiety in my chest when I try to relax or be positive. It kind of feels like an elephant's foot resting on my chest, a sort of threatening weight. I have felt that way much of the time since I was 15-ish. 


I used to self-injure in high school and self-medicate, but I thought that I was leaving my wild emotions and poor coping mechanisms behind when I came to college 3 years ago... I thought my emotions were justified owing to being a teenager coming back from a really unstable upbringing. But I have come to suspect that there is just something inside me that is not working properly. What do you think, r/anxiety?

2a4qc3,4,2014-07-08,"I'm having anxiety attacks that are going to needlessly ruin a relationship, and my mind is trying to go numb.",[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2a4qc3/im_having_anxiety_attacks_that_are_going_to/,"[Traditional]

So a to talk about this relationship I have to talk about my first one. It started off innocent. I was a senior about to go to college and she was a 15 year old sophomore. Ya I know. We fell in love over the summer and decided to try a long distance relationship while I was 4 hours away. Yes I know. It goes ok for a while. We skyped everyday, and talked as much as we could. I put the relationship over everything else and that caused everything to suffer. Now being a 15 year old she didn't know how to handle being in love. It wasn't what I expected. It's of no fault to her either. She was too young. The problem is that I didn't feel fulfilled physically because she was my first real anything really. It's not that I'm unattractive, I just have had major confidence issues. It stems from a lifetime of bullying but that's another story. In order to satisfy my needs I was sexting with girls I met in class and on the internet. Since it was my first relationship, I didn't fully realize it was cheating until later. Once I did I confessed, yet I told her I didn't think it was cheating. Naturally she broke up with me.

Now fast forward 3 years. I'm about to turn 21, I'm a junior and I got life figured out. I'm gonna graduate single and maybe meet someone later. I had another relationship that lasted a year, but this time I was betrayed, so I had my fill for a while. Then one day this random girl comes up to me after class and asks my name. She had heard me mention in class that I was a libertarian, that she was too, and wanted to maybe make a like-minded friend. I was cool with that, but I could feel something else. From the beginning I knew she wanted more. I have three older sisters and I know that women only approach men for either sex or a relationship. It's a generalization of course but a decent enough rule of thumb. So we hang out some, and after a week or two we're chillin at my apartment. There's sexual tension just filling the air. So we have sex. Multiple times. And I know from the way she's acting that A) she enjoyed it and wanted it and B) she wants more. I knew that she wanted more from me. I may not have had many relationships, but I read people and study them for fun. I knew. But I've been hurt. I don't want to be hurt again so soon. So we agree to friends with benefits.

FWB. The thing most men dream of and I hated every minute of it. This girl is seriously everything I've wanted. She's sexy, funny, nerdy, and deep down she cares about people. I truly cared about her. We were at a restaurant one time and we were talking about our pasts. We talked for hours and we ended up on the topic of her self harm and contemplation of suicide. When she started talking about it it cut me emotionally. I hurt for her. I felt this desire to hold her and protect her and never let anything happen to her. But we were FWB, and that would've been too entangling. To speed this story along just imagine us bonding from November till late February. Like hanging out and/or talking everyday. She did live 45 minutes away so we couldn't hang out EVERYday.

So we've been dating since February and it's middle of May. Finals are over and all feels ok in the world. She's in her home 45 minutes away and I'm horny. I want to masturbate to a picture of her, but I accidentally deleted the few that I have. In a ""stroke"" of genius I remembered something she told me about. Her old imgur account that she said she used to post on gonewild before we met. I go to the account and have a look. I notice two things: one is a picture that she sent me in December when we were FWB, and a new post about verification from the week before. She had been posting on gonewild for two months behind my back. But it wasn't just gonewild. I found posts on another subreddit asking people to roleplay as her professor she was attracted to. She had told me she had a sex dream about him but that she didn't feel anything towards him. The lies kept piling up. 

I cannot describe the feeling to you. It was the deepest feeling of betrayal I have ever felt. My greatest fears had come true. I texted her and attacked her with text messages. Then something hit me: guilt. I remembered 3 years ago when I did the same thing to girl I claimed I was in love with. And now I was going to condemn someone for the same sin. I do believe in God and I think he either has a sick sense of humor or he was testing me. So I forgave her. I told her that if she ever did it again then that would be it, but I forgive her and trust her. But I didn't. For about a month I was getting on gonewild just to make sure. I'm getting better now, but I'm not sure if it's trust or if I just don't give a fuck anymore.

So we recover. We go to my sisters wedding and I help her move to a new town across the country for her new job. She's a year older than me so I still have one more year. So now we're long distance by about 23 hours of driving, and I'm now realizing how hurt and damaged I am. That sounds like something a pussy would say, and as a Texan I'm supposed to be tall and proud. I don't feel tall, proud, or loved. We talk once a week. Over the past seven days we have talked on the phone once for 1 hour. That means that there's 167 other hours where she's doing the things she'd rather be doing. Now we can discount the job because that's important, but she works from 6pm to 2am. There's so much time in the day to just call me and catch up. Plus she has two days off every week, and I'm lucky to get a text convo in because she's always out doing stuff. I got denied for 5 summer jobs so I do nothing. I understand that people have different expectations but I talked to her about it. I said that I really want to talk more and she said she would try. But it doesn't feel like she's trying.

Then the bombshell.  She told me that she's planning on staying in her new city after her job which is actually a paid internship is done. She said no chance of her moving with me to a city closer our hometowns. She had said for months that it was an option then she just changes her mind. I thought she was preparing me for a breakup. So I had my first anxiety attack in 3 years. It was bad. over the span of two weeks I lost 10 pounds. And at 6'4"" 178 pounds I can't afford to lose weight. I was prepared to be broken up with. Then we talked for our ""weekly bullshit talk on the phone"" and she apologized, and said she's sorry and that it's still an option. But it doesn't matter. I've started trying to  numb myself. Trying to do anything that'll make it easier for me. I saw a guy tweet at her saying how beautiful she was, then he tweeted just about how much he likes sex. Day later I get a text saying she turned down some hot dude, and I should be ""proud of her"", and I immediately knew who. I was pissed. I wanted to talk to her all fucking day, but it was her day off so I gave her space, and she spat that into my face. Pissed me the fuck off. Now she acts like it's nothing that we haven't talked in week at a time when it's a huge deal to me.

Now I don't know what to do. I love her. I think I may even be in love with her, and that's why it hurts so much. I'm not looking for advice because I have enough of it. I just needed to put these feelings somewhere. When I was a lot younger the bullying almost brought me to taking my life. Which is why her confession to me touched me so deeply. I would never do that now, so I guess I'm getting better. Honestly though, if this gets deleted by a mod for a formatting error then that would be for the best. Just typing it out makes me feel a little bit better. I would also like to apologize for how disjointed and all over the place the story is. It's 4:40 in the morning and I just want to sleep. I know my story isn't significant, and I'm not a special snowflake. But we all go through struggles, and right now I really needed this. Also I'm not sure if there is a specific confession in this or if really the whole thing is one big one. Either way this is what I needed."
2a4x5s,2,2014-07-08,GOP's brilliant move to sue President Buckwheat,[deleted],Hooftroll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hooftroll/comments/2a4x5s/gops_brilliant_move_to_sue_president_buckwheat/,"John Boehner’s plan, in which he proposes to sue President Barack Obama for violating the Constitutional role of the presidency, is important and brilliant. I am an attorney, with a keen interest in both politics and law. I have read and studied the U.S. Supreme Court precedents in question.

Pundits with incorrect analyses make three wrong objections: (1) Congress does not have legal “standing” to be the plaintiff to bring a successful lawsuit. (2) The Courts are reluctant to get involved in disputes between Congress and the Executive Branch. (3) Congress has other tools and Boehner is off-base using a lawsuit instead of direct powers of Congress.

Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives John Boehner has announced that he will bring a resolution up for a vote to authorize a lawsuit by the U.S. House challenging recent presidential actions. It appears that this will authorize the House to act alone, and the resolution does not need the agreement of the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. 

Boehner has not given specific details of his plans yet. But that has not stopped pundits from slamming Boehner for his proposal.

First, it is true that a plaintiff in a lawsuit must have “standing” especially in the narrow requirements of Federal courts. That is, a plaintiff must have suffered an injury from the acts or omissions complained of which is more particular to the plaintiff than the general effect on society as a whole. Just because Congress passed a law does not give Congress the necessary “standing.”

But even the dumbest lawyer in America knows -- even a Speaker of the House -- can figure out, that all you have to do is add more plaintiffs to the lawsuit. Presumably, the lawyers assisting Boehner will search out people, business, or non-profit organizations that have been injured by each and every one of the president’s actions that the lawsuit challenges. Plaintiffs will be added who have standing. Problem solved.

Second, it is absolutely – wildly – false that Federal courts are reluctant to decide disputes between the U.S. Congress and the Executive branch. What the pundits are stumbling over is the “political question doctrine.”  But this involves the substance of the question, not the identity of the plaintiff and defendant.

Certain subjects do not lend themselves to judicial review, because they are “political questions.” This means that the U.S. Constitution clearly assigns the decision to one of the other Branches or there are no manageable standards that the Courts could apply other than raw political opinions.

For example, the U.S. Supreme Court slapped down presidential overreach by Democratic President Harry Truman in Sheet &amp; Tube Co. et al. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). During the Korean War, Truman tried to seize steel factories to keep them running during a strike. Truman claimed the legal authority by greatly stretching and twisting the terms of the Tart-Hartley Act (concerning labor disputes) and asserting a military emergency as Commander in Chief to maintain production of critical munitions. Truman confidently predicted that the U.S. Supreme Court would agree with him, since earlier Truman had seized 28 other industrial properties and gotten away with it. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the president had exceeded his authority under the Constitution, particularly because Congress disagreed with his actions.

In Powell v McCormack, 395 U.S. 486 (1969), the Court rejected a claim that the case ought to be dismissed as a political question. The case involved the refusal of the House of Representatives to seat Adam Clayton Powell. The Court concluded that the decision was not committed by the Constitution to the House. Since the refusal to seat Powell was based on acts prior to Powell’s election, the Court ordered Powell seated in Congress.

Another good example is INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), finding a legislative veto of Executive branch action unconstitutional. Congress was passing laws which specifically enabled Congress to veto any regulation created under that law. The U.S. Supreme Court found this violated the structure or architecture of the Constitutional system. 

Laws go to the president for signature or veto. Congress cannot reach over and pull a law back. Congress must pass a new law and present it to the president for signature if dissatisfied with how the law is working out. The U.S. Supreme Court had no hesitation finding that the Congress had overreached, based only on the implied architecture of the Constitution.

Speaker Boehner proposes to challenge the legality of President Obama’s actions as being outside the authority of the president. Courts do that -- testing whether an action exceeds legal authority -- “all day long and twice on Sundays.”  Whether or not Obama’s executive orders are legally valid is not under the “political question doctrine.”

Now, Obama’s followers are chanting that past presidents issued a greater number of executive orders than Obama has. Quite obviously, it isn’t the number of executive orders that is the problem, but the nature of them. Obama’s executive orders are fundamentally different from most of those we have seen pre-Obama.

What is an executive order? The president is the head of the Executive branch. As the boss of people working in Federal dDepartments and agencies, the boss can issue orders to his employees. But the president cannot create law or modify laws.

There are two types of legitimate pre-Obama executive orders: 

(a) A law passed by Congress specifically delegates the power to the president to decide something. For example, if a law empowers and requires the president to certify whether a nation is aiding terrorism, the president may exercise that legal authority in the form of an executive order. But the authority is created by the law Congress enacted.

(b) The boss issues an order to those who work under him: Thursday will be national watermelon day. Employees should not drink coffee near their computers. IRS employees shall make back-up copies of emails. Keep your hands off the interns. That sort of thing.

But Boehner’s lawsuit seeks to challenge Obama’s executive orders which fundamentally conflict with laws passed by Congress. Whether an executive order is legally valid is something courts will have no hesitation deciding.

Finally, those who have been tearing their hair out because Boehner has been passive now attack the speaker for not taking more aggressive action like impeachment or defunding government agencies. They argue that the courts will not hear Boehner’s lawsuit because Congress has other powers to use against the president.  When the speaker shows signs of life, it seems wrong to attack him.

It makes no sense to demand the drastic step of impeachment, which is highly unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, a Supreme Court precedent would be binding on future presidents. Impeaching one president would not prevent the next president from the same violation.

In theory, Congress can respond to abuse by the Executive branch by reducing or eliminating particular appropriations to the Executive branch. Federal courts mention this. However, that is a dangerous fantasy.   

Cutting appropriations punishes innocent citizens who are the intended beneficiaries – often people in need. Under current law, the offending bureaucrats can’t be fired and continue to get paid. So the Congress is put in the position of hurting innocent third parties in order to curb abuses by the Executive branch.

The modern practice of massive bundles of spending in a single appropriations bill makes it nearly impossible for the Congress to exercise the spending power effectively. A threatened presidential veto turns any attempt to withhold Federal spending into a now-familiar all-or-nothing government shutdown crisis."

2a593p,3,2014-07-08,Sit down with boss on compensation or start looking for a new job?,DeveloperDrew,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2a593p/sit_down_with_boss_on_compensation_or_start/,"I am thinking more and more about moving on from my current job.  There are 2 main components to why I think I should at least have a discussion with my boss:

1.  Compensation.  I have almost 8 years of experience, a proven track record and I even will be heading my own little Frontend team soon.  My boss has said on multiple occasions that I am the best dev he has worked with.  All that and I am only being paid about 54k a year.  Before my last raise I was making about 46k.  
2.  I have to teach myself everything.  Everything I learned about new technologies, new methodologies and new tools I have had to teach myself. I have done this by asking people, reading, going to user group meetings and conferences and through good old trial and error.  I worry that I am losing the ability to be part of a team or take direction from others.  

The reason I stayed up to about a year ago is a family matter and I wanted to be close to help.  Thankfully that is no longer the case and a move to another state would be okay.  The reasons I now stay come down to pretty much one thing:  my coworkers and my boss.  I have been the main developer for 4 years at my company (probably 80% of the development gets done by me right now) so leaving my current position would not only cause a potentially big problem for my company, but certain clients might have a problem with it too (no legal issues with me leaving just a big loss of knowledge for my company).  I would also worry that I am screwing over guys I consider friends outside of work by damaging the company.  

I am leaning towards a sit down with my boss about developer compensation (mine and my intern's if he decides to stay on).  I know I can make a lot more money elsewhere, but I am not sure my boss knows that.  I got an offer 3 years ago for 65k, but the job description sounded crappy, plus Google has been reaching out to me, although I figure Mountain View is a long shot.  This is part my fault for not pushing harder on my boss.  

I had a sit down with my boss last year about compensation, but while I got about an 8k raise, I don't think he got the message that I have been very underpaid for most of my career.  I think I should tell him I need a pay bump to something I could plausibly get out in the market (at least 70k plus bonus by my research and asking on this subreddit) and work with him to figure out a respectable offer for my intern should he decide to stay on.  

Any input is appreciated!"
2a5ac3,112,2014-07-08,Helpdesk Blues - Episode 1 : Introductions,CarlTHEELlama,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2a5ac3/helpdesk_blues_episode_1_introductions/,"After receiving some pretty quality calls and emails over the last few year, I think I'm going to just start my own little series about the crazy things that take place in my every day life here. I'll make 1 post every day during the work week for this series, so stay tuned for some pretty great stories, some sobs for stupidity, and some rage at relentless attempts to destroy my poor, poor computers :(


Let's start with the basics I suppose. I'm Carl, CarlTHEELlama, or CTL for short, chances are I'll never use that short form though. I'm the 'Vice Sub Manager' or something like that, can't remember all the stupid titles everyone gets. My job is to sit in a chair, tell people what to do sometimes, browse reddit often, and occasionally take calls and emails on the helpdesk from other employees, mainly all the weird / unbelievably dumb ones. 



I have a few Sub-Sub Employees (some sort of weird fucken tree system going on for these naming conventions, i think) in the IT Dept, not too many, as followed (with a little background info) :

Brainiac: Smart beyond belief, only in his late 20's, generally always knows the best way to do things but lacks motivation to do them, is much happier being left out of group projects. Majorly dislikes all other co-workers, minus myself and HeadSubManager or HSM (will use this one a lot).


Slowpoke: Always behind the curve, mid 50's, knows a little about a lot, but not a lot about pretty much anything besides when to be here and when to leave. Nice guy in general, our most senior employee, but somewhat lacking in brain cells what he makes up for in effort given.


Intern: For all intents and purposes, he's an intern. We treat him nicely for the most part, but he is an intern, and generally just sits near me and shadows what i do until i get annoyed or busy, then he goes and shreds paper in the corner.


NewGuy: An early 40's guy who I just hired, not great, but not useless either, more of a meat shield in case of zombie apocalypse kind of guy, since I like my other employees, but he's alright. He knows some stuff, most not relevant to what we do here, but he's a sort of normal paced learner, and he's great at taking the heat from the executives.


HeadSubManager: Quiet, keeps to himself mostly, really just deals with executives, tells me what they want, I relay it to the small task force of programmers / network assistants. That's really all I know about him other than his name, which I'll keep private.


Anyway, so we all work for company AutoProblem, which is fairly accurate because we always have problems here. If the network isn't down, it's either slow, or someone is pissing in the server room to make it go down soon. If a computer is slow, it's usually infected with more viruses than how many blinks you've done since birth. If the power goes it, I guarantee nobody hit the save button once while working on those super important reports for profits and margins, or made a backup, and then lost everything.

2a5m6m,3,2014-07-08,A Slightly Different Dead Bedroom Looking for Advice,[deleted],DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/2a5m6m/a_slightly_different_dead_bedroom_looking_for/,"So I've been lurking on DB for a while now, but now I've decided to post my story seeing if anyone has any advice. I feel as if my DB situation is slightly different from most of what I've been reading about because it has not been caused by a HL/LL mismatch, but rather me being a royal asshole for years. Let me explain the situation a bit. SO and I had an unplanned pregnancy at a rather young age (still in college, less than a year into our relationship) and abortion wasn't an option for her and not claiming responsibility and sticking with her wasn't an option for me. I was entirely unprepared for a child and had never planned on having kids. Long story short I am resentful, our communication is shit, we both come from shitty families (not fully realized until recently). All of these factor cause a lot of strife and passive aggressive BS that lasts for years. 

We eventually get married and a little over a year later a second unplanned pregnancy comes along. She had insisted we use natural family planning (NFP) as our sole BC and it worked for a little over a year but eventually she misread the information and we had sex when we shouldn't have. I always saw NFP as inherently flawed as people make mistakes and I objected to it. So all of my concerns about NFP being proven right+latent resentment(I feel I was still very much a child back then)+other life stressors (Trying to graduate+two internships) made me just want out. I brought up the possibility of divorce/separation about halfway through the pregnancy and we fought/tried to figure out what that would mean for both of us while I was simultaneously talking a ton of stuff out with a couple close friends for a few months until about a month after she gives birth and its summer break so minus the stresses of pregnancy and school I'm finally able to clearly see the value and joy found from a family (this epiphany was when I feel I actually started to mature). So I realize I actually want this relationship with her and I start trying to be the husband I should be. Everything is okay and it can only get better right? Wrong. The biggest mistake I made is that while I was talking this out with friends I never once talked to her about it or even mentioned that a family was something I now wanted. While it is easy to blame my upbringing and the fact that emotional communication was non-existant for me ever, ultimately I blame myself for being a moron and not realizing this would be helpful information for her to know. 

Anyway, years pass and come early this year I find out she has been cheating on me and having an affair with her best friend, a man who had previously confessed his love for her and I was always massively uncomfortable with. To be fair I had had a one night stand in the past while we were married because I was struggling with the fact that I had never had the chance to sleep with anyone else (did I mention my wife was my first). Anyway we go through the motions she cuts off all communication with him we start going to counseling and things are tough (they still are), but are getting better, and this is where we get to the DB. 

So we stopped having sex shortly after we started going to counseling (closing in on 5 months), and here are the reasons. Firstly, I was (un)fortunate enough to lose both grandparents on my mom's side at a young age and they left me money for college that, given the time it had to mature, grew into something sizable enough to support our family+let both of us finish up school. In the first couple years after kid 1 was born she felt obligated to give me sex even if she wasn't in the mood for fear of being left with a child, no money, and no means to finish up school. This stopped eventually, but for a bit over a year there was a sort of pseudo-rape situation that I was completely unaware of (this came out in counseling). Additionally when she was growing up her father essentially waged psychological warfare on her family as a means to cope with his own problems which left her with residual emotional scarring. Basically it is very easy for acts of sexual initiation to be interpreted as male aggression and send her into an anxiety attack. This is the factor that we've been both aware of for the longest and she has made legitimate progress in working through this. Finally, the last, and biggest factor, is that during the time when i was suggesting divorce she completely cut off any attraction or emotional investment in me as a way to cope/prepare for the time when I wouldn't be in her life. for the years between then and now we would have sex despite a complete emotional/attraction disconnect because she wanted to make me happy/make things easier between us. This last bit of information was completely unknown to me until we started going to counseling. She still has sexual cravings, but due to the aforementioned problems sex doesn't happen. We have small moments of physical intimacy (good bye kiss type stuff), but nothing even remotely sexual.

So where I stand is here. Things are better than ever between us communication wise, everything is out in the open, we are working through our problems and talking frequently, every day she seems a little happier, we have become great friends who legitimately enjoy spending time together, and we've worked to a point where she sees me as a neutral (which doesn't sound great but is a huge improvement over the negativity of the past). Overall, knowing what I know now, I honestly can say I'd rather be where we are now than before. Except for the lack of sex. I have always seen physical intimacy as necessary and feel a void without it. I don't/can't ask for it primarily because it stresses her out/causes tension (and it wouldn't happen anyway), and because I know this situation is completely my fault and that at this point she owes me nothing. At this point I feel like my only option is to just wait it out which is fine except that the feelings of helplessness cause their own sets of problems.

I don't really know what sort of advice I am looking for, and I apologize for the entirely too long post. Maybe I just needed to vent. I dunno. Anyway if anyone has some advice or a similar story I would love to hear about it. Thanks

2a5nq8,6,2014-07-08,[Advice] How much is too much to spend on rent?,frugaltoronto,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/2a5nq8/advice_how_much_is_too_much_to_spend_on_rent/,"I recently graduated college and took up a job that pays 50k + bonus. Let's leave bonus aside. From what I've read I need to be spending 50% of my salary on essentials (housing and food), 30% on lifestyle and 20% on finance.

Apparently that 20% includes loan payments and stuff, so what does the person actually save? 10% ? 5% ? 

I am not saying that I am going to be doing the exact same thing. Thanks to my Indian heritage and a well paying internship I cleared my student loan before graduation. I have around 3k in credit card debts which I am going to pay off in the next 2 months before I even start living properly.

After years of living the frugal life I really wanted to start living well. I will be taking home 3.2 k after deductions. Is spending 1000  on living expenses a lot ? (Rent, Internet, Phone, Metropass). I generally spend 200 on groceries and another 200-300 on lifestyle. Around 1500 or so in total living expenses with 1600 in savings. 

Is this good enough savings? I want to save enough so that when I decide to go to grad school in 3 years I have money to fall back on. 

My question is that for someone whos taking home 3.2 k a month is 1000 a lot to spend on living expenses without food?"

I am in dilemma. Currently, I decided to learn Rails and nothing else, it is interesting and takes a lot of effort to learn well. However, two months ago I had a workshop with local start-up that gives out small tasks to students and we will get paid on completion of the task, they give us some mentoring as much as they can and will have a lot of work in DJANGO in the future. The problem is that I cannot learn both. I have full time internship and I try to learn Rails in the evenings but the offer that was proposed by the start up guy seems good especially when they offer code reviews. 

I was also told that Django is gaining a lot of popularity and the guy from startup advised me to choose Django over Rails because that is what he's done and he's glad he did. 

What do you think? I ask because I really do not have time to learn both."

2a6adh,3,2014-07-08,Difficulty focusing when reading documentation and other people's code.,orelon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2a6adh/difficulty_focusing_when_reading_documentation/,"At my internship, I've noticed that I seem to have trouble concentrating when I'm reading through other people's code, or even documentation. It's like my eyes glaze over the words blankly and my mind doesn't retain anything. I find myself re-reading the same things over and over, and I even tried installing a Chrome addon that makes things (supposedly) easier to read.

This is an issue for me during the semester, too. I've managed to maintain a high gpa (~3.8), but it's only through practice and repeatedly reading the same sentences until my brain decides to accept the information.

Does anyone else have this issue? I originally tried just drinking some coffee, and it helps sometimes, but other times not so much. I've found that my most productive hours are late at night. For some reason, if I take my work home with me (or study) late at night (say, 10PM-2AM), I will be able to concentrate very well.

Any suggestions?"
2a6bti,1,2014-07-08,Volunteering to gain experience? Input please,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2a6bti/volunteering_to_gain_experience_input_please/,"Hey folks. I'm a BSME who just passed the one year mark working for a relatively large EPC firm (first year out of college complete!). For foolish reasons, in college I didn't pursue a career in the field that I'm truly passionate about. Instead I chose the “safe"" option, snatching up my first offer given to me, for the job I had interned the previous summer (an extremely regrettable and idiotic decision on my part). It took me little time to realize my mistake, but I told myself I would give it a year, because attempting to leave sooner would have likely been seen as a red flag. In the meantime, I've busted my ass studying to become a CEM (certified energy manager).  For those that aren't familiar, it's a very respected and valuable certification in the field of energy efficiency. The job market for CEMs is excellent. They're in very high demand and aren't easy to find. Since my senior year of college I've known this is what I *really* want to do career-wise.

Along with my desire to change career paths, I’ve also been going through a heavy load of personal problems.  No need to go into detail, but the problems have become such a burden that I absolutely need to take a temporary break from working full time, somewhere from 4-6 months off.    It may sound risky to some, I’m sure, but I have full confidence in my abilities as an engineer.  I have no doubt that I’ll be able to find a job and excel at it, when the time comes.  My reasons for taking off work are personal and not professional. 

So the obvious thing to do would be to start applying and interviewing for jobs.  The reason I hesitate to do so is because I think it’s going to be near impossible to get an employer to push back my start date by several months.  Correct me if I’m wrong on this.  It just seems like a slightly offensive thing to ask of a new employer.

I’m leaning towards reaching out to smaller companies overseas and asking for a shert-term apprentice/volunteer position performing facility energy audits.  I’ve been able to find several companies online that sound like great fits, located in Southeast Asia and South America.  This would be appealing to me for a couple reasons. I’d have flexibility with the start date and with working hours to be able to safely take the time off from work that I desperately need to take.  I’d have the opportunity to live overseas, which I’ve always wanted to do (never studied abroad in college, d’oh!), without feeling stuck.  I’d gain some extremely useful and relevant hands-on skills (energy auditing), things that employers will want applicants to have and things that will help me be successful in my career  After, say, 4 months of volunteering, I could decide to go back to the U.S. and get a full time job, or I could choose to  work full time at the place I was volunteering, if I end up loving it there.  The flexibility that this option offers is hard to beat, in my opinion.  

Now, I’ll freely admit that this sounds a little, um, wish-washy to me, at least on the surface.  I have no idea if a company, even a small one, would go for something like this.  Would a company take a volunteer with an engineering background?  Will they see anything to gain from giving me experience without an official job?  Any advice on how I should go about contacting them and asking for something like this? These are things our school counselors don’t really mention, because it’s so uncommon I’m sure!

I should also note that this option surely sounds “risky” to some, going several months without a steady income, health insurance, etc.  But it’s really not worrisome to me.  I didn’t take out student loans in college and I’ve been diligent in saving in my year of work + summer internships.  I’m fairly frugal, so the idea of living in southeast Asia for a few months without an income isn’t daunting to me.     

In summary

* I want to change career paths to a different industry.  I’m certified to work in this industry but lack relevant experience.

* I absolutely need to take 4-6 months off from working full time for personal reasons.

* I have the option of either:

A) Taking a job now and negotiating my start date to be 4-6 months from now.

or

B) Apprenticing on a volunteer basis with a smaller company overseas for a few months (which would give me the flexibility I need to deal with my personal stuff, while also providing me with useful skills and experience).

So, if you're still reading this, what are your thoughts reddit? Anything that I haven’t thought of or need to know? Any input is appreciated."

HiveQL seems similar to SQL in many ways, and considering my (quite limited) background with SQL, it seemed somewhat appropriate to post here.*

For some background, I finished up my freshman year at a state school studying Management Information Systems with a concentration in Business Analysis.  I have been learning SQL on my own over the course of the past month, mostly through library books and online resources.  I understand the fundamentals of joins, triggers and such, but I am by no means firm in my understanding.

Now I am interning with a consumer data analytics company this summer.  The company is new, but plans to contract custom queries of their massive data on consumer Internet browsing habits for a fee.  One of the directors of this custom query service has contacted me and given me a few resources by which to start learning about their primary query language for their cluster (HiveQL).  It is very much tied into Hadoop and MapReduce architecture, concepts that I have little knowledge of, but I know where to start learning.  Hive, however, seems much more elusive.  It is my understanding that it is much like SQL, but different in important ways  He is going to mentor me in writing some practice queries, but I really want to prove myself.  Therefore I want to spend a lot of time studying this on my own.  A lot will be made clear when I formally meet with him tomorrow, but now I simply would like to ask, what other places can I begin learning about HiveQL?

*Again, I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this question.  If it is, please refer me to a more applicable subreddit.*

**tl;dr** Internship wants to get me started working with HiveQL.  I have a tenuous grasp of SQL, and a rudimentary understanding of Hadoop and MapReduce.  My supervisor is going to mentor me, but I want to learn more on my own as well.  Where to begin?  "

2a6pks,0,2014-07-08,Sort of freaking out in terms of Career path I am on at the moment...Please help me out/ give me some insight..(Long Read ahead),Turin_Giants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2a6pks/sort_of_freaking_out_in_terms_of_career_path_i_am/,"**I apologize if this is in the wrong sub Reddit as well!**

Okay, I will try and calm down but i am sort of having a panic attack at the thought of this but I will try and explain my background for everything as clear as possible. 

**Background:**

 I have a bachelors degree from GMU in VA and I just graduated in May of 2013. I am 23 if that matters. I received a PSYCHOLOGY degree. I had always wanted to help people with their problems and, me being my ignorant self, decided ""fuck the money, I wanna help people and get a job right after college ends"" well that didn't happen. Fortunately, my Dad works for the county government and was able to get me an internship two years ago. I didn't particularly enjoy the internship, but being a poor college student, I wasn't going to turn it down or the cash. In the end, I graduated and was offered a full time job there straight after graduating. I took that opportunity as soon as it was presented to me because, I figured, who wouldn't take a job right out of college. 

A year later, I have saved up some money to buy a house in the future, as I am living at my parents house trying to save up money as best as possible. Realistically, I don't see myself moving out until next summer as I need a little more money for a down payment. 

**My current predicament:** 

This afternoon my dad slapped me in the face with reality. Honestly, deep down, I knew this job wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. My boss even knows that but she is still preparing me to take over her job when she retires in three years, unless ""she wins the lottery and gambles on cruises for the rest of her life."" That being said, sure a promotion is good. A promotion means more money but I am still stuck in a field (civil engineering (Public Transportation Planning). 

**What I want to do:** 

I have always loved videogames. I started out with xbox360, then wanting better graphics and cooler games, then progressed to buying a crap laptop to play said games, wasn't satisfied, decided to build my own pc, fell in love and the rest is history. 

I want to get into information security or some sort of IT field. Honestly, I would prefer something that pays well too (who wouldn't).  Also, being that I live in Northern Virginia (very high income median), the cost of living is extremely hard. 

I like the fact that information security is sort of like a detective work but in the cyber world. The fact that you find a hole created by someone, you then try and find out how that person made the hole, and then try and prevent it from hopefully happening in the future. I remember hearing a story, not sure if it was true or not, of a kid who went to my highschool who was extremely into computers. I remember hearing that he hacked the school's databases or whatever, was able to change his grades, etc. I remember he designed this chat room feature that could be accessed by students on all the school's computers. In the end, he was caught but instead of being disciplined, he was given an opportunity to work for some tech company trying to stop people from hacking other systems. They basically hired a ""hacker"" to help stop other ""hackers"" from doing what he did to their systems because he knew what to look for and where the weak links in the system where. 

Anyways, I got off topic. Bottom line is: I HAVE NO CLUE WHERE TO GO FROM HERE. I have a fucking psych degree, man. I can't do shit with that. I wasted four fucking years of college for nothing. I wasted four years of college studying something I ended up doing nothing with. Now I want to go into a field, which I actually have an interest in, but now I have no prerequisites. I have no prior experience in computer science other than building my own gaming PC (if that's even considered computer science). 

I have done some research into the field, and also heard a little from my neighbor, who works for Symatac, as a information security employee(? lol) and he said the key is in certifications. So for the past hour or so I have been looking at some of the top certifications that are desired by professionals for 2014 and they all sound so advance. 

Then I searched a little more and found CompTIA certifications. This site gave me a little hope because it was more user friendly and pretty much up my alley in terms of what to do if i want to get into this field. I am still a little confused on how to go about the whole process but I will learn in time. 

I guess the reasoning I am writing this short novel to you guys is for help/insight/personal experience if this happened to you. I know I am only 23 but I don't want to go back to school and get another bachelor degree and finally graduate and get a good job by the time I am in my 30s. Look I know things don't come easy and I don't expect people to spoon feed me jobs and opportunities and that I have to go out and find them myself. I would like a little guidance on how to go about this though. 

If anyone takes the time to read this long post, I really appreciate your time! Seriously, it means a lot. 

**TL;DR: Got a Psych (Bachelors) degree in college. Got a job after college. Gettin' paid. NOT SATISFIED WITH LIFE. Want to get into the IT field (particularly informational security). Unsure about what steps I should take to purse that career path. Help!**"

Experimentals is moving along at a good pace, many bugs found and squished so far, but even more valuable this time was the excellent feedback the experimental team is giving us. They’re going out of their way to help us tune the hundreds of variables that affect Contracts and Currencies, so here’s a big thanks already for all the effort they’re putting into helping us finish up this release. About the specifics of what we’ve done so far, the list is too big for a dev blog. Stay tuned for an update article soon.

**Alex (aLeXmOrA):** Last week I set the Independence Day Sale in the KSP Store for the weekend, it was a good one. Right now I’m doing some reports for the accounting department and then I’ll keep adding the new part sounds. I know, I’ve been working on that for a long time, but every week something has to be done here at the office.

**Mike (Mu):** The experimentals continue so have been squashing bugs and tweaking. Have also done some optimization work on some shaders to gain a little more overhead. Works out at around 8% for Kerbin’s main shader which isn’t too shabby.

**Daniel (danRosas):** Working with Max on the edition of a new gameplay video for First Contract. And moving on to new tasks, time to start a new Kerbal story, probably in space.

**Jim (Romfarer):** Between the tweaking and bugfixing last week i had time to create a new type of gui window that can be resized with the mouse. And now i’m two days into my one week holiday.

**Miguel (Maxmaps):**  Mostly working on the video preview for First Contract. Also trying to show extra love to all of our off site communities as well as organizing our by now traditional media group videos.

**Bob (Calisker):** Getting ready for First Contract to go live soon but in the meantime, was really stoked to see this Le Monde feature on Kerbal Space Program go [LIVE](http://goo.gl/KF4FNb). If you read French, please feel free to let us know what you think, or if you’re like me, use Google Translate to get the gist of it. We are trying to get ready for the upcoming launch, which means we want to release screenshots, details on the update, a walkthrough video (thanks Max!) and of course an animation video. Ideally, we can coordinate all of this so it is seen by both our community and draws interest from gaming media which covers KSP. Also, a big shout out to the Reddit community, who has now put Buzz Aldrin on record that he’ll check out [KSP](http://goo.gl/ezMiY7). That’s pretty cool.  

**Ted (Ted):** I’ve been very busy this past week with the QA and Experimental Team. We’ve finished up QA on Hugo’s branch with the first build of it in Experimentals running as of  writing this.

In Experimentals we’ve been going over the balance pass that Felipe and Mike worked on last week, as well as running through some of the more minor, but pretty significant, additions that were made in the interest of balance. We’ve also managed to narrow down and crush a few issues that were being very disruptive and not at all friendly. Lastly, we’ve been ensuring that some issues with the Launcher are all fixed across all platforms and it’s handling everything smoothly.

**Anthony (Rowsdower):** While again, Ted’s devnote puts mine to shame, I can share that you’ll be seeing a First Contract FAQ soon. Are there any specific questions you’d like us to answer?

**Eduardo (Lalo):** Diagramming processes!!! Everything that can be measured, can be improved!!!

**Rogelio (Roger):** Working on a new story along with Dan, we’ve been discussing about the main theme and how we will tell it. Finally we’re done with the .24 animation :)

**Hugo (The Intern):** Working on the Mk series pieces. Starting some IVA planning for some of these. I’ve been improving some of the MK-1 changes I did with the feedback of my coworkers. Getting super excited about the coming release. "
2a701y,9,2014-07-08,"I got a parking ticket in CA, and live in CO. What will happen if I never pay it?",hellaboobs,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2a701y/i_got_a_parking_ticket_in_ca_and_live_in_co_what/,"Background: I'm in Los Angeles for 5 weeks for a quick internship. I park daily within a half block of the street I live on, where parking is unrestricted other than street sweeping. Street sweeping is Tuesdays on some sides of the streets, and Wednesdays on others. I have Utah plates on my car, but live in Colorado.

What Happened: I screwed up, and parked on the wrong side last night, thinking that was the Wednesday side. I come out to my car to go to work this morning, and see a ticket on the windshield: $73. 

Going Forward: I'd like to not pay this. I know I deserve it, that's not what I'm arguing. What will happen? I read on LADOT's site that they do not tow or boot until you've had at least 5 unpaid parking tickets, and I do not intend to get another one. Also, the ticket states that the cost eventually doubled if left unpaid, so I figure worst-case scenario I'd have to pay $146 sometime down the road. Should I be concerned about a bench warrant? I don't really plan to ever register my vehicle in California. What can I expect going forward?

Sparknotes: $73 ticket for parking during street sweeping, leaving CA in 5 weeks, what will happen if I don't pay the ticket?"
2a76hi,7,2014-07-08,I am so totally fucked (a venting of sorts),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2a76hi/i_am_so_totally_fucked_a_venting_of_sorts/,"This is the last thought that runs through my head every night. 

I suppose I should start from the top.

It started my second year of college, the first year went great, but by the end of my third semester all my friends had dropped out, and I was then grinding out an engineering degree all alone. I leaned on weed for a while to manage the stress(something I'd been doing for a long time), but then quit to clean up so I could hopefully get a summer internship. This is when the panic attacks started, and the thoughts of suicide, I could feel my mind going(though everybody still seems to think I'm extremely intelligent), I began to fail classes. I started smoking cigarettes. I stopped answering my phone which was probably people looking to hire me. I saw one of the school counselors for a while, but this didnt help me much, so I stopped going. 

Then I transferred schools hoping for a fresh start, that went poorly, by the end of this school year, I wasn't showing up at all, I had more or less given up. I became even more depressed over this long cold winter watching my GPA plummet. My GPA is something like 1.4. A few months ago my mother forced me to go to the doctor, started medication, it more or less only helps with the dark thoughts. She made me an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I didn't go, just laid in bed feeling terrible the whole day. I don't want to share my deepest darkest secrets with some stranger whose actual job description is to pick my head apart. 

I honestly don't see how I'll ever have a happy life at this point. I have ~$60,000(I'm scared to actually add it up) in student loans, I'm currently living off overestimations on the last round of loans. No way I'll ever manage to pay that off without a college level job. No way in hell I'm going back to school, I can't handle it anymore, I'd blow my fucking head off in under a month, and there are no easier degrees I'd be any good at. 

I always think of depressed people as living a fairly normal life as some sort of cover up for their sadness, I don't even have that, no job, no girlfriend(never had one, virgin, used to not care about any of that but now I do for some reason), only 2 close friends, and a couple distant ones, who I avoid telling anything like this as I don't want them to have to think about that. People always say things along the lines of ""fake it till you make it"" but I'm a terrible liar.  It seems to me in my limited experience this is the goal of therapy too, to lie to myself it will get better and then hope I'm right by dumb luck, I don't operate that way. I've come to view most recreational activities as escapism, though still engage in a couple.  

So now I sit here, waiting for the money to run out to force me into some shitty part time job to keep paying the rent and hope it doesn't drive me to suicide. I'd rather die than move back in with my parents and screw over my friend/roommate.

Like I said, I'm fucked.  

EDIT, another thought: Even approaching this as the calculated, logical person I once was,  this is a clusterfuck of massive proportions and attempting to solve it would be an exercise in futility. "
2a76p3,4,2014-07-08,"Recent grad, new job, new accounts, credit questions",Krasnoyarc,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2a76p3/recent_grad_new_job_new_accounts_credit_questions/,"Hey everyone. 

So, I graduated college in May (computer science) and just started my new job yesterday. I've read a lot on this reddit over the past couple of months, so I think I have a good general idea of what to do with my money. I mainly had a couple questions about new accounts and credit, and I wanted to make sure I was on the right track. 


#1 - I have $20k saved up from internships in a bank account at Wells Fargo, getting something like .02% interest. I would like to put $10k of that into an account that gets more interest. I found a credit union that has 1.58% interest in my new area, for up to 10k with no fees/minimum balance. There's also Capitol One for .75%. I would like to open an account, but I'm wondering if it hurts my credit score or anything like that. Is a credit union ok for an EF, and does applying for these accounts hurt your score? 



#2 - I've also had an inquiry to credit recently from an apartment I'm signing a lease on (1550/mo, accepted). Since it was accepted, I'm assuming my score isn't horrible but I wanted to make sure. Is there any reason to check it? I know I get one free per year, but I don't want to waste it. 



#3 - Just to make sure I'm doing the right thing, I wanted to give you my numbers and take any advice on what to change. I'm not sure of my credit score. I have a credit card that I spend about $100 a month and pay off to get credit, with no balance. My car is paid off. About a week ago, I linked all of my accounts to Mint to start watching that, and figure out some budgeting after I get settled from the move. 

Assets

* Bank accounts - $20,000 
* Car value (paid) - $6500

Paychecks

* Monthly Gross (starting yesterday): 7300
* Estimated Net (assuming 70% gross): 5110

Monthly bills

* 1335 - rent (lease starts July 12, live in an expensive area. 450ft studio)
* 200 - parking
* 80 - gigabit internet
* 20 - electricity
* 80 - water/sewer/garbage/gas
* 500 - food
* 300ish - student loans (start in 5 months)
TOTAL: 2515/mo

Student Loans

* 20,000 @ 3.8%
* 5,000 @ 6.5%

So, without paying loans, bills are around half of my expenses. My plan was to put 10k in an emergency fund from the first question, and then pay off the 6.8% interest loan immediately, and use the other 5k to start saving for a house or condo. My company matches 50% of 6% of income for 401k, so I'll put 6% into that. Also, I have about $2000 of car repairs coming up. 

Knowing this, what should I do with the rest of my income and saved money? I know 401k matching is good, but I also want to drop the 1500/mo rent and parking as soon as I can, and get a house. I am going to be living in the area (northwest) for a long time I assume, at the same job. Should I save for this, increase 401k, or invest in something else? My company has a 10% off stock for employees, would that be good?

2a7c67,0,2014-07-08,Getting back into routine,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2a7c67/getting_back_into_routine/,"So I started going to the gym after being off an on in 4 month cycles due to school and work terms. During school I have no time to workout because my program is so strenuous but on my work terms (internship) I go to the gym consistently. As I stated, I began going to the gym last last week and started off with chest and triceps and hit every main muscle group over the course of the week. I was a little annoyed my first day for chest and triceps because last term I started at 45 8x3 (8 reps and 3 sets) but last week I was only able to do 35's with the same performance. This week however, I couldn't even do 1 rep of 35's and couldn't even hit  5 reps at 25's without struggling. I was embarrassed to say the least and a little frustrated as I expected myself to at least be doing 40's with no problem. I continued the rest of my workout but reduced the weight significantly for each workout and mainly focused on stretching my muscles out. Needless to say, I left the gym fairly disappointed.

I've been maintaining a healthy diet, I may not be sleeping the amount I should be due to the demands of my current internship (12 hour days etc.) and I've been consuming protein after each workout session.

I'm wondering what could be the cause of this and if anybody has any suggestions for me?

2a7dxi,2,2014-07-08,The Tape Recorder,rdgard,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2a7dxi/the_tape_recorder/,"I am posting this here since you have to take me seriously.  I don't know what to make of it and i need some advice.

  I've been working with the town’s museum in exhibits for almost 12 years now, and my boss is ambitious, I guess.  She always has a million projects going on at once, and with all of the interns coming in and going out all the time it seems like there are never-ending projects just left open-ended. For almost 6 months I worked tirelessly on a project to create placards for a display on local grasshoppers and other insects, only to have it scrapped completely just as I was wrapping it up. During that time I was basically an apprentice to our etymologist. I was so engrained in it that Petyr, our bug guy, offered me a permanent position.  This is the kind of all inclusive work that my boss expects from us.  It's tiring, but really challenging and I've never gotten bored.
About two months ago, I was assigned to determine whether we could protect three buildings in the town hall district.  This would call for me to do a survey, and to pull up all of the history of the buildings, and take pictures.  Sharon, my boss, wanted me to compile all of this and get it ready for a presentation to the zoning board so that we could zone these buildings in the local historic district so that we can restore and preserve them.  (She had gotten wind that these buildings will be open for demolition in about 3 months) So, I have been working on documenting everything about these buildings.  They were originally created in the 1830's as a stop for local traders making their way through our town on the way to bigger cities.  One of the three buildings was purported to be a brothel at one point, and the middle was a physician's quarters that was home and office to Dr. Pike.  Pike was supposedly a student and fervent fan of Dr. Benjamin Rush, but so far in my research I can't find much mention of him.  He was a urban legend in my town as he basically bled to death countless traveling townsfolk with his misdirected passion for bleeding as a cure-all. There’s still a song about this guy that I have used once or twice as a kid.  It wasn’t ever Bloody Mary in my town, but Bloody Liam.  People used to refer to the building to drunkards corner, although the town saloon was almost a quarter of a mile away.  People would stumble out of Dr. Pike’s shop, out onto the streets and along the way to trade their goods, they would perish.  It’s said that he loved blood so much that he would store it in jars in rows the main office to impress people upon entering.  
Years after Pike had died in 1901, people tore down the rickety wooden building and put in it's place the building that is there now. They didn't leave much of the original structure, but they did keep the fireplace and the stone basement that was used for cold storage.  I haven't dug more into that, but I am almost positive that it was used as a mortuary of sorts. Don’t' quote me on that, I'm not done with that part of the research just yet. After the building was completed, it turned into the local newspaper's editorial house.  The first printing press of it’s type in our area was just down the road, and this is where the local newsmen created their stories.  It's big, but I still am not convinced that it's historical district zoning big. 
At this point, I am torn with what I have found.  I don't know if I should intentionally bomb the presentation and see this whole thing come to a glorious, destructive end, or if I should keep pushing forward.  I did my physical survey a week and a half ago. It was kind of how you'd expect, dusty and old, as the buildings have sat empty for the last several years.  Everything was pretty straightforward, the buildings weren't in terrible disrepair, but the center building, the newspaper place, hadn't been touched since what seemed like the 70's. The style of the rooms, and one broken, leftover typewriter sat in the middle of the open floor on the second story.  While things were covered in dust and grime, it really wasn’t bad.  It could probably be fixed up in a few months with the right *ahem*rich* backers.    
I didn't take my camera that time, but it was only going to be open to me for 30 mins to an hour, and I could already feel the real estate lady downstairs getting impatient right as we got there. I stepped over a fallen ceiling tile on the first floor and was about to make my way out when I noticed an abandoned desk in the back corner.  It was butting up to a door that was closed, and I would have missed it completely had I not almost tripped over the tile.  Old, and perfectly centered on the desk was a grey/green  tape recorder. It was one of those handheld ones that a reporter might have used for documenting a conversation. It was covered in a thinner layer of dust, almost as though it had been placed there more recently, as though it was the last thing touched in the office right before they closed up the place.  I don't know what it was about it. I don't know why I had to touch it. I keep thinking about it and it makes me so mad. I wish I could have just left. I wish anything in the world would have happened but what did.
I went over to the tape recorder and, like an idiot, I picked it up.  Without a thought, just like that.  I pressed the rewind button, expecting nothing to happen, and i was surprised that it started reeling the tape inside back.  Slow at first, as though it was stuck, and then faster. 
 “Neat.” I thought. 
I pressed play and two thumps beat out at me.  Then I didn't hear anything.  So I tapped it twice, and heard nothing and then a weird scrape. I bent down closer to listen to the tape recorder and my shoe slipped on a piece of detritus on the floor.  It was then that it started to dawn on me.  The scrape sounded like an echo. For a second I thought that the recorder was malfunctioning and that it was in some kind of weird record/playback mode. Just as I thought this, the recorder jostled, as though someone had run their fingers across the mic. I flipped the recorder over to see what buttons were actually depressed and slowly, so so slowly realized that my finger had touched the mic.  I quickly pressed the rewind and listened to the sounds again. They didn't change, but now I came to realize that it was as though I had pressed record instead of play.  In exactly the same time I began hearing the two taps as I banged the player, the foot scrape and the mic rub. I let it keep playing. Nothing for a moment or two, and then the speakers made sounds of jingling like keys, and then there was a plastic sounding scrape.  On the tape player I heard the voice of the real estate lady say,"" How's it going in there?"" a pause, and then there was a jostle. I stood very still.  I waited for it, and then, sure as all hell, there was a jingle of keys and the lady called out.
 My voice began to come out of the tape player at this point. I sounded thin and tinny, and was obviously nervous. ""Everything's fine."" As my voice came out, I jostled the tape player. It scared me.  I couldn't help it.  I stared in disbelief.  My voice, disembodied. Then I noticed movement ahead of me and I saw the lady's head peering through the open door with her eyebrows raised questioningly. 
 ""Everything's fine."" 
She pulled her head back and closed the door soundlessly.  My mind reeled.  Literally reeled.  I was so confused and everything wasn't making sense that I have no idea what to make of all that.  I could feel my eyes get bigger and I searched the room looking for something that would ground me, that would make this make sense.  Some wire, or mic or something, anything.  The tape player started sounding one more time, and what was on it is what I can't stop thinking about. It was quiet at first, but I recognized it immediately. It was me. Whimpering.  Bubbling soft moaning noises from far away in my voice.  I instinctively pulled the thing away from my ear to look at it, and my cries started to get louder, the bubbling and moaning turning more desperate sounding. It is the most frightening thing I have ever experienced in my life.  I dropped the recorder and began to run, slipping again on that damn piece of tile, and as I was on the ground, I heard my voice unmistakable, begin to shriek and wail. I have never made those noises. I know it.  I have thought about it a lot since then. 
As I threw open the door to escape, I heard one final thing.  And I’m not sure about this.  Not sure at all.  But I think I heard wet noises.  The screaming was muffled and it almost stopped abruptly but the final noise was red, and wet.  I think. 
Maybe. 
 Maybe it's just my mind. 
Maybe I'm obsessing and none of this is real. I know about psychological priming, and even though the place was pretty straight forward, I did do my research on it, so maybe my mind was just primed to think of this place as a horror house. But, I don't think so, I don't know. And I'm scared.  So I'm putting this here so that maybe you can help me make some sense of it before I have to go back and document this place in its entirety. Help me figure this out.  I don't know, is it possible that maybe the recorder was so old it malfunctioned? 
Could that have happened?
I'm really scared.  
I have two days.

I accepted Company A's offer, but now I'm wondering if I should've either 1.) Interviewed with Company B and potentially use their offer as leverage or 2.) Negotiated my salary w/ Company A. I have a little under 2 years full time experience (plenty of internships) and would say I'm an above-average coder from a top 5 school. The offer's base salary puts me under 110k (stocks + signing bonus and yearly bonus do put me closer to 150k however).

I had a plan in place to attempt to commit suicide while the rest of my family was away on vacation. While they were away I was going to wrap up what matters I could, drive to a remote spot I know of and try yet again. I had a few methods in mind starting off with the most pain-free and least traumatic to myself and those who would find me.

But I wussed out. Perhaps I was looking forward to my ""date"" on July 4th, maybe it was just laziness. I don't know. I can't keep on going like this; I'm so very tired.

I no longer have any will or motivation, and truly, I don't know if I ever have. Back in highschool I only picked my particular degree to study in college to get my parents off my back. I had thought in my heart that I would be dead before I ever started my first semester. Well, 4 years later and I ended up finishing the degree. Having since had real jobs and internships in the field, I've realized how much I deeply hate it. I regret getting this degree more than all of my other fuck ups in life. Now I'm unemployed and useless living in my parents apartment. I don't even look for jobs anymore. What's the fucking point. 

You know, for a while last year I thought things were turning around for me. Colleen and I were talking everyday and things were getting more serious between us. She was my lighthouse in the storm-churned seas of my life. We were so good for each other. And to break up only because we live a few hours away? I tried to come see you so many times. I've told you countlessly that I don't care about the hours on the road. Seeing your face for even a scant hour after you get out of work would have made all of the driving time worth it. You didn't let me do anything. I don't know, Cheri, it's all just too fucking tragic. I loved you, I still do. I know you still care about me too, even if you didn't love me in return. I think you did, but I think you were afraid of saying it too. Again, because of the distance. The fucking distance. I wish you never gave me a chance.

I can't do this shit anymore."

We visited Esslingen and Stuttgart for a week few months ago and we absolutely liked it. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to visit Göppingen at all. Some of the local students (few of them studied at Göppingen) and even some of the professors gave us a conflicting image about living in Göppingen compared to what we had in mind.

That got us thinking of other alternatives but to be honest we are having a hard time to decide what to do, here are some of our thoughts:

 * Live in cheap student housing in Esslingen and take the S-Bahn to travel to Göppingen and back
 * Try to rent a bigger apartment from Plochingen from a private renter, which would suitably be in between both
 * Just forget the biased opinions of the local german students/professors and live in cheap student housing in Göppingen?

At the moment the option #1 feels the most suitable, at least in our minds.

I don't want anybody to code this for me, but if you can point me into the right direction which resources to use and where to look that would be extremly helpful.

As far as I have found out so far, this is how a lot of programming is done anyway: Ask for general help.

What I did so far:

* 1/3 through the Javascript tutorial on codeacademy.

* Started with the learnyounode tutorial from node.js, but I think you need more basics for that.

* Accounts at SO and github

* freshened up my math at Khan

Okay from all of your feedback i was able to compile a pros and cons list

Pro to attending top 15 CS School:

Better Connections, 
On Average more competitive/motivating/ talented body of students
Better University Setting (this is personal to Umass Amherst I am not impressed by the campus at Amherst)

Con:
20k more per semester (Generally the top 15 CS Schools are 40k While Umass Amherst is 20k instate)

Other Gathering include: The actual college that you attend has no barring on the hiring process, however prestigious schools provide the intangible items (refer to the Pro's list above)."
2a8pi3,1,2014-07-09,"GRO Part 6 – Daddy used it, too.",[deleted],sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/2a8pi3/gro_part_6_daddy_used_it_too/,"It was lunch and Kyle, Bobby and Jeni’s father, had come home from work. He’d told them he was sick, and that was partially true. What he hadn’t done was discuss the nature of his malady. He certainly couldn’t tell them he was leaving due to a raging hard-on.

Kyle knew he had been dumb going to work today. Unfortunately that hadn’t been the only dumb decision he’d made over the last few days, just one of the more recent ones.

The first had been using the GRO.

He’d found the tube in Bobby’s pants pocket while doing laundry. Later that night, curious about what his son had gotten himself into, he looked up the product on the Internet.

Now, any sane, grown man knew it was a bad idea to put Russian penile enhancement cream on his genitalia. But Kyle figured the only way to adhere to this sound advice would be to never possess such a cream in the first place.

The way Kyle figured, any man left for a sufficient amount of time with a cream that promises to grow his dick would end up using it. He certainly had.

That morning he’d woken up to a massive erection. The GRO had worked, but had come with enhanced libido as well. Mia, his wife and Jeni and Bobby’s mother, was already up and getting dressed. Like most couples they had tight routines in the morning and Kyle knew he’d have no luck getting her to fool around. Besides, he wasn’t quite sure how to explain his cock doubling in size overnight.

So he’d hopped in the shower and beat off. Once he’d gotten a good look at himself he was even more impressed with the GRO. Holy crap! He had to be 12 or 13 inches!

He had lubed his hand with shampoo and thought nasty thoughts for about ten minutes before painting the shower stall with his jism. Apparently, his enlarged balls produced an equally enlarged load of cum.

That had relieved his sexual needs a little, at least enough to stuff himself into a pair of khakis and make it to the office. He was still horny, but he figured he’d be fine until he could proposition his wife later.

He’d figured wrong.

As soon as he’d caught sight of the hot intern bending over to feed more paper to the printer his erection had come back in full force. 

She’d gone away, but then Nancy from accounts came over to talk to him – stupid, sexy Nancy with her three undone buttons and little hint of lacy bra showing! She’d stood there talking for ten minutes. Kyle couldn’t stand up to face her, due to his cock trying to tear through the leg of his pants. So he sat, face level with Nancy’s tits as she chatted away.

By the time she left he was pretty sure he was one panty-line sighting away from ripping the pencil skirt off some poor lady and getting himself fired in spectacular fashion, so he’d sent a quick e-mail to his supervisor and left for home.

Once he was parked in the driveway it was a mad dash to the computer room. In a flash Kyle’s pants were off, his boxers around his hips and he was furiously searching the Internet for something nasty enough to satisfy his urges.

He was just settling into some albums of young amateurs when he heard a noise downstairs. He listened for a moment, trying to convince himself it wasn’t what thought it was until…

KNOCK, KNOCK.

Fuck! The front door.

Kyle stripped off his boxers and threw on a pair of basketball shorts. However, his cock stood straight out, even inside, so he lifted it up and used the waistband to hold it against his stomach. A long t-shirt finished the quick camouflage job and he bounded down the stairs to hopefully rid himself of the annoyance quickly.

Reaching the door, Kyle peeked through peephole. He saw nothing at first, but then caught the top of a whitish-blond head of hair. Someone short. A kid.

Kyle took a deep breath and opened the door. But when he did, the sight in front of him knocked the breath out of him again.

It was a kid alright – a girl. Her light hair was in a pixie cut and she face was young and innocent, but very pretty. She was short and very petite.

However, what gave Kyle such a shock was the massive set of tits she was sporting under a skimpy bikini top. On any woman they would have been impressive, but this girl looked maybe Bobby’s age, and the triangles of fabric did nothing to cover the perky globes underneath.

And she looked as shocked to see him as he as to see her. 

“Umm, is Bobby home?” she asked.

Kyle shook his head to indicate the negative, not trusting himself to speak. Besides her eeny-weeny bikini top she was wearing tiny little denim cutoff shorts. She had flip-flops on and that was it. Her whole look was fun, carefree, youthful and – Kyle couldn’t deny – sexy as hell!

“Oh,” she said, clearly disappointed. She looked like she was about to leave. That was good right? What Kyle wanted?

Or was it?

“Do you…want to come in and wait for him?” he heard himself say. 

No, you idiot! How are you going to jerk off now? part of him screamed inside his own head.

But another voice – a new voice – spoke up. It came from somewhere else. Somewhere…lower.

Trust me. I have a plan.

She shrugged, put on a grin and nodded. He motioned her past him and crowded her just enough that she had to brush her right tit against his arm. Oh, god, Kyle! What are you doing?

She looked up at him, grinning a little more. No doubt she was used to male attention, with a pair like that. Even as young as she must be…

Please, let her be older than I think!

“So, can I get you a drink?”

“Umm, sure! A soda would be great!” The little sexpot sat on the edge of the couch. Kyle returned from the kitchen a second later with a cold can from the fridge. She took it, smiling knowingly at him.

Kyle sat on the arm of the chair opposite her, mindful of how precariously his cock was restrained behind his elastic waistband. Looking at this girl with her banging body wasn’t helping the situation, either. Every glance he stole at her cleavage made his already engorged member even harder!

“So, you know Bobby?” he said. Stupid, he knew, but he had absolutely nothing to talk to this girl about.

“Yeah,” she said, smiling. “We’re…close.”

Close, huh? Bobby, you lucky dog! Has his old man’s magnetic charm. Kyle had always punched above his weight, so to speak, in the girl department. His wife, Mia, was a MILF for sure. She was 36, eight years younger than Kyle himself. They had begun as a fling – Mia had been engaged when they first hooked up – and he’d gotten her pregnant soon after. Jeni had been two years old before they’d finally settled down and gotten married.

Kyle’s looks had a big part to do with that. He was tall, broad-shouldered and naturally fit. Even in middle age his chest was defined and his stomach flat. He went to the gym diligently, so his arms were strong, too. All-in-all, Kyle was still quite a catch.

So it was no surprise that Bobby was pulling hot girls of his own, even if he was a little young to be starting that. Kyle would have to have the birds-and-bees talk with him sooner than he thought.

I doubt I’ll tell him anything this hot little piece hasn’t already showed him, though. The thought of the hot girl before him on her back getting drilled sent a surge to his cock, making Kyle cough up the drink he’d just taken.

“Oh, are you alright?” the girl said, rising to her feet in alarm. When she did, she dropped her can. Acting on instinct, Kyle lunged upright himself, making a grab for it.

He missed, and the can hit the carpet and began spilling its contents on the floor. Neither of them watched, however, because of what else had happened when Kyle had moved.

They both stared at the massive erection that had escaped its precarious concealment and now pointed lewdly at the young girl’s impressive cleavage.

Kyle froze. Holy shit, we’re done for! One voice inside his head screamed.

Wait for it… insisted the other.

“Oh. My. God.”

Kyle held his breath, not knowing what would come next.

“That’s…amazing!”

Bullseye!

When her eyes found his, he saw the unmistakable look of lust in them.

Wow, Kyle thought, you were right. I should let you do all the thinking from now on.

Damn right, said the voice in his head that Kyle now knew was his cock. And here we go.

Amber couldn’t believe her eyes. She had been in awe of Bobby’s cock yesterday. Before seeing it she didn’t even think they got that big. Even looking on the internet afterwards had yielded almost none that compared.

Yet here, right in front of her was one even bigger. And it was attached to a quite-handsome grown man. Bobby’s dad, no less. Her little pussy creamed at the thought.

“Would you like to touch it?”

Would she ever! Amber couldn’t help but smile giddily as she nodded emphatically. She reached out her hand and caressed the head. It was almost the size of a plum, and it jumped when her hand touched it.

“Ooo!” she exclaimed, a little embarrassed by how young and girlish she had sounded.

Ever since she’d woken up to find that the GRO cream had worked and inflated her tits, she’d been dreaming of ways to get more and more male attention.

Alas, it was a weekday, so skipping school had been a mistake. Every male she knew was either in school or, like her dad, at work. She’d walked around the neighborhood, hoping to find some random guy to tease, but had come up ridiculously short. Wasn’t anyone unemployed these days?

Finally she’d come to Bobby’s house on the off chance that he’d stayed home too. She’d never expected to find his dad.

And she’d certainly never expected to find this!

Amber looked up into his eyes again to make sure he wasn’t mocking her. All she could see was a hungry look that made her little pussy moisten even faster.

Taking this as her cue to go further, Amber took hold of the thick, hot shaft and hefted it, stroking her hand up and down it experimentally. Bobby’s dad let out a low, rough groan that Amber found very encouraging.

Remembering what Bobby had showed her yesterday, she opened her lips wide and took the huge head of his cock into her mouth, being careful not to scrape it with her teeth. She closed her eyes, bobbing her head back and forth, letting her soft tongue rub the underside of the man’s mushroom head.

The effect on Bobby’s dad was immediate. One large strong hand buried itself in her short hair-do. She felt a slight dull pain as his grip tightened, pulling her hair and pushing his cock just a little deeper into her mouth.

“Oh, fuck yes!” he growled, sounding unlike any dad Amber had ever encountered. But Amber knew he was a father – the father of the boy that had taken her virginity yesterday, in fact. The thought was so naughty, so taboo, that Amber felt she might cum from the mere thought of it. 

She didn’t get the chance, though, because at that moment Bobby’s dad’s other hand scooped under her miniscule bikini top and found her enormous left tit and its ultra-sensitive pink nipple. The second he pinched it her vision turned to a billion twinkling stars and her pussy spasmed powerfully as her orgasm crashed over her.

Purely on instinct, Amber pushed more of Bobby’s dad’s cock into her mouth, all the way to the back of her throat. She immediately gagged and coughed, removing his cock from her mouth. 

But the momentary caress of her velvety throat – or maybe just the erotic sight of the preteen slut gagging in front of him – was enough to send him over the edge.

Suddenly a hot jet of thick cum sprayed across Amber’s face. It was followed by another and another – a seemingly endless supply of hot thick white jism that covered Amber’s face, hair and massive tits as she kneeled there in the afterglow of her own powerful cum.

Seeing his flow abating, Amber captured his big cockhead in her mouth once more, and got as her reward two more big mouthfuls of cum from Bobby’s dad’s magnificent cock.

The spent man collapsed back into the chair, his still-hard cock jutting lewdly from his lap. Seeing it again in all it’s glory made little Amber feel very naughty and very proud for having made it cum. How many girls her age could say they’d seduced a man their own father’s age?

She looked down at her cleavage: Covered in cum. She felt it covering her face and soaking her hair as well. How did this always seem to happen to her? Was she destined to be the cumshot girl?

Not that there was any way I could have swallowed all of Bobby’s or his dad’s humongous loads, she thought as she scooped fingerfuls of cum from her tits and face and fed them into her greedy mouth. She did love the taste of cum!

Her bikini top was soaked as well, so she removed it. That’s when she saw that Bobby’s dad was watching her, and what’s more he was stroking his hard length of cock with his hand. Even in his big fist it looked huge! 

Amber couldn’t wait another second. She stood up and wiggled out of her tight cutoff shorts, exposing her bald pussy to a grown man for the first – but she was certain not the last – time.

Now she had his attention for sure! His hand wanked his thick cock faster as he stared at the over-sexed preteen. Amber was loving this! She put her hands on her hips and modeled her enhanced little body, teasing this grown adult who was about to become her second sexual partner.

Finally figuring she had teased him enough, Amber walked over and straddled his lap. He was so much bigger than her that she had to spread her legs almost to the max, but that was fine – it would be perfect for what she planned to do.

Amber took the huge cock in her hand and raised up above, having to put on foot on the couch to get her pussy high enough to reach the tip. But it finally did reach and she rubbed Bobby’s dad’s engorged prick over her slit several times to get it nice and wet.

When she did, the man under her closed his eyes and laid his head back, moaning, “Oh, fuuuuuck, that feels sooooo good.” This made Amber smile as she began to sit down on it, forcing the too-big cock into her tight preteen body.

Inch by inch it slipped inside. His big hands were holding her tiny body around her waist, which made Amber feel secure and vulnerable at the same time, but also very, very sexy!

The pressure in her pussy was indescribable. Bobby’s cock had taken her virginity and stretched her immensely. It had hurt a lot for a moment at first, but then it had turned to intense pleasure. This was different. It didn’t hurt as sharply as Bobby’s had, but it was continuous and much, much more intense. But so was the pleasure.

Before Bobby’s dad’s cock was halfway inside the diminutive preteen, Amber was experiencing an orgasm that made every one before it seem pale and weak. Her head split, her scalp tingled, her legs went numb and her tits…God, her tits were on fire in an incredibly erotic way!

After about two dozen strokes, Amber’s bare little pussy mound touched Bobby’s dad’s soft tuft of pubic hair and Amber herself collapsed against the man’s strong adult chest. She’d never imagined she’d feel this full!

She also felt exhausted. But the man inside her didn’t let her rest long. He began kissing her neck tenderly, which contrasted nicely with the rough way his big hands were kneading her round little ass. Using her cheeks as two handles, he began lifting her slightly and dropping her back down, simultaneously thrusting his hips a little.

The subtle fucking he was giving her stoked her lust again to a full-on blaze. Every thrust he made inside her sent electricity radiating from her pussy throughout her body. Amber sat up in his lap, leaning back to support herself with her hands on his thighs, exposing her perky, pornstar tits to Bobby’s dad once again.

And her tits proved to be a temptation he couldn’t resist. The man let go of her ass with one hand and clutched one tit, bringing his mouth to the other to suck and gently bite her pretty pink nipple. All the while he continued to fuck his massive cock into her steadily. Amber could feel her pussy stretching with each thrust, the head of his cock buried so deep inside her it had to be inside her undeveloped womb. Every thrust made her tummy bulge out obscenely.

Between the physical attention to her enhanced young body and the obvious lust she evoked in this hot grown man, Amber was in heaven – albeit a very dirty, taboo corner of paradise. She was cumming continuously, her pussy juices lubricating their coupling as if her own body was begging to be fucked more and harder.

Bobby’s dad was happy to oblige. Soon he was bouncing her on his lap vigorously. She was so small and light he seemed to have no trouble at all lifting her, and was practically using her entire body to masturbate himself to a rapidly approaching orgasm. The way he handled her made Amber feel like a little fuck toy, and she creamed and cummed all the harder at the thought.

After what seemed at the same time like and eternity and a brief instant, the man slammed her down on his cock, wrapped his arms around her tiny frame and exploded inside her. She could feel his cock lurching in her tight pussy, releasing a torrent of hot cum into her womb. Feeling it send Amber of over the edge once again, and they came together, holding desperately to one another as they climaxed.

Basking in the afterglow, neither was aware of anything but the other. And so neither of them noticed they were being watched until a voice spoke up from the doorway to the kitchen.

“Wow, Daddy. That looked amazing!”

I had no idea anyone would be that interested and I was extremely humbled to be able to help anyone out. Since so many people had questions and I have the day off I figured I'd check in periodically and offer to do the same in a more visible way.

I'm a fully licensed mental health therapist at one of the highest rated hospitals in the USA.  I've been practicing mental health treatment in some form for roughly 10 years and I've been studying the subject since I was 6.

So feel free to AMA Smite related or otherwise.

Below you can find the answers to question from the other thread:
Q: How can I overcome conquest anxiety?

A:I will tell you how you overcome anxiety. The easiest most efficient way is behavioral exposure. This means that you actually just go play conquest. At first if you rate your anxiety on a scale of 0-10 you might feel like a 10. As time progresses and you play more matches you should see your anxiety decrease. This is due to a cognitive restrucuring that occurs due to the feedback from your experiences. Basically play conquest, experience isn't too bad, your anxiety will go down. Alternatively, play conquest, everyones an asshat, you see it doesn't matter anyway, don't give 2 fucks and anxiety goes down.

You could also do this through graduated exposure. Quickly this would look like - think about conquest, read about conquest, watch conquest videos, play practice conquest, play regular conquest custom games with friends, play regular conquest. Hopefully that makes sense.

Alternatively you could use more specific cognitive techniques. So anytime you feel a strong negative emotion there is usually a thought attached to it. If you are able to identify what that thought is you need to then determine if it's accurate and/or helpful if not it's probably a cognitive distortion and you need to work to actively correct it.

There's whole books on these subjects so 3 paragraphs isn't much an in depth analysis. Anxiety usually involves 16 weeks of tx with a trained mental health professional so good luck with these tips if you would like more advice feel free to ask.

No problem. Regardless of the context the cure for anxiety should be the same. Some form of behavioral exposure combined with cognitive restructuring should lead to at least some reduction in anxiety. From personal experience in other domains where I have anxiety, public speaking for example, I have found it to be very effective.

You could also use relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety. These could include but are not limited to: deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. Personally I can't see accessing any of these but deep breathing while actually engaged in game play.

Another ingame incidence of this would be something like where you get extremely anxious about landing your next AA as an ADC or spell as a mage and therefore miss. Enough exposure to this circumstance and some addressing of your anxiety cognitively (like it's ok to miss, slow down and hold your shot it's more important to land one shot than miss 3 and have them get away, etc) should allow you to land these shots more consistently.

The reason pros tell people that the key to success is simply playing a billion hours stems from this principle. Not just because practice makes perfect but because this allows for you to obtain exposure to as many possible circumstances as you can. Therefore you know possible/probable outcomes, experience reduced anxiety due to clarity of outcome (keep in mind the feeling of anxiety is basically a fear of an unknown or negative outcome that is forthcoming; That's why knowledge of outcomes and preparation reduces anxiety), and therefore act quicker and more efficiently than a less exposed individual.

Also, it may be worth looking into mindfulness and by extension mindfulness mediation. This involves engaging in an activity while not giving into the tendency to focus on external thoughts and emotions. Therefore, you note emotion and thoughts as they pass through you but you do not judge, weigh, or place any value on them. Example, you're playing poorly, you're missing your AA's as an ADC, you can feel super embarassed and start playing poorly, or mindfully note the embarassment and associated thoughts, set them aside as meaningless (cause thoughts really are and therefore emotions are by extension) and continue your focus on the actual gameplay. Successful use of this sort of technique reminds me of what athletes commonly refer to as ""being in the zone.""

Q: Should I do the same thing when wanting to ask out a hot grill?

Ask her out she says yes = less anxiety | Ask her out she says no don't give 2 fucks = less anxiety? What if I do give 2 fucks?

A: Actually the answer is yes. In order to get over your anxiety of asking out women you should ask out as many women as humanly possible. That's solely the behavioral component which will not produce change alone. By the same token you should figure out what the feared outcome you have in your head is that is responsible for your anxiety. This is the cognitive component that is essential for you to address in order to obtain more permanent behavioral, cognitive, and emotional change.

Anxiety, the feeling, is a direct result of a cognition in your brain. Example, ""I can't ask that girl out. She's way too hot for me. She's going to say no. She's going to laugh at me."" Every single one of these cognitions are distorted because they're neither accurate or helpful and the majority engage in attempts to predict the future which no one can do.

So, the meat of your question is IF she says no, what if I feel like crap anyway? Well here's the thing. If you're anxious you fear that your crappy feeling due to rejection is going to be so horrible that you're going to avoid it at all costs by never asking out hot girls. This avoidance actually increases your anxiety because your mental picture of the outcome becomes worse and worse.

So if you ask her and she says no, yes you are going to hurt and feel crappy. However, the appropriate response is then - ""Hey this feels bad, but at least I took a chance. Next time I'll have a better shot. Here's what I did wrong and could improve on. She didn't say no because I'm ugly or a piece of shit she's just got a boyfriend/is in a bad mood/etc etc."" These are much more accurate and helpful cognitions to have in relation to rejection and will result in a reduction in anxiety.

Speaking from personal experience I was told that I have no social skills at all and should never be a therapist due to this. Look at me today I'm a leading CBT therapist at one of if not the best hospital in the country. This shit works. Oh yeah and I asked out a hot secretary the other day, despite my anxiety, and she said yes. Asked out another woman while voting that same day, she said yes too. It's a total crap shoot man. Ask out every lady you think is hot. One day you'll hit gold and forget about everyone that said no. My personal cognition in relation to this ""If she says no it has no negative impact on me cause I never really knew her anyway and probably will never see her again. Next!""

If I was your therapist I would have to ask you what being rejected would mean to you? Does it mean you will never find love, you will always be alone, you're ugly, disgusting, a piece of shit, unlovable, etc. etc.? Answering this question will provide you with the distortions that you need to change because every single one of the aforementioned statements are wholly false.

*As an exception, if this is some hot girl you're friends with and had a crush on for the last 10 years that you never told her about and then she rejects you. Yeah that's a lot different because you can't get exposure to 10 year long events that frequently. So same solution to the rejection, address your distorted cognitions. But yeah that's going to hurt. No way around it.

Q: I had a goal about making a career in mental health, but lost the motivation for it. Speaking of your (former) lack of social skills, how did you make the transition to therapist? I'm pretty awkward socially and I think I'd look like an ass trying to counsel someone.

A: No problem. So the answer is that I wanted to be a therapist since I was like 6 years old and I had been looking at research psych but I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. So I had a choice of be miserable or figure this shit out.

So I went to school and had my first internship and I got placed with middle school kids. Let me tell you they will get you over your anxiety quickly. lol. The long and short of it is that by doing an internship and now my job I am forced to interact with new people daily. I simply don't have a choice about having social skills if I want to be successful. I've found the most important things are to be genuine and really care about other people and what they are saying. If you can do that then you can be a therapist with time and practice.

You have to learn through exposure and through analyzing your cognitions where your hang up might be. I'll just be super vulnerable and share mine: I would have defined myself as: Super nerdy, unattractive, awkward, introverted, and the list would continue a million miles long. The fact is if that's who I really thought I was than no wonder I was terrified of anyone seeing the real me or passing judgment on me.

You will fuck up. I did fuck up. But it's ok that's what learning anything, even social skills is about.

The most important thing that I have learned about my own social anxiety and I believe by extension others' as well is that it comes down to not accepting and being comfortable with yourself for who you are. There's a constant fear of judgement because in fact you feel that something is flawed about yourself. The reality is though that as long as you're not doing anything to hurt yourself or anyone else and you're happy with your life then you are a cool person and you should give fuck all what any body thinks about you [within reason; please care about what your family, friends, boss, etc thinks lol]. At this point in my life if I wanted to dress up like Rainbow Dash and prance around downtown I'd have no problem doing it and if I saw someone else doing that I would cheer them on. Disclaimer: I am not a Brony but I find that image funny
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Q: This behavioral exposure doesn't work for me.I have been playing Mobas for ~3 years.Be it in LoL,Smite,anything.Whenever I play,I start to sweat,pulse goes up etc.Typical anxiety symptoms.

Being inexperienced isn't true,because I'm not new to the game,so I shouldn't feel anxiety at all.

Is there anything more I can do so I can play without anxiety?Like,some streamers can play for 10 hours and show no anxiety at all

A: Ok so the answer is YES! XD

So you're getting behavioral exposure but this is not sufficient in and of itself to produce change unless there is cognitive restructuring (changing of your thoughts) at the same time. So like I can go to war 4 billion times and if every time something horrific happens and I define it to myself as horrific, then yeah my anxiety probably won't decrease.

So if I was your therapist for example, I would have to ask you what goes through your brain in these moments of high anxiety? what thoughts cross your mind however fleeting? Possibly they come as images instead of words? My hypothesis of some options might be: ""I'm going to fuck up."" ""I suck."" ""I NEVER manage to do X."" ""Aw man I'm playing against Person A he's the best I'm going to lose."" It could be a billion things.

Ok so once you figure that out. You have to address the cognition because even if it was fleeting I can pretty much guarantee it's where the anxiety stems from. The way to do this is to look at it as if you were helping out your friend. So your buddy comes to you and says ""Man I'm a terrible ADC. I miss EVERY single shot."" You might respond to him and say ""It's ok. Not everyone lands every single shot. It's actually not true that you miss EVERY shot. You do land most of them it's just at crucial moments when you miss it stands out so much more. Etc etc etc.""

As you can see there are a lot of possible responses you could give someone. Only a limited set of these responses is going to work for you and provide relief from your anxiety. Example: You have cancer I say it's all good man. No anxiety relief.; You have cancer we talk about possible methods to treat your illness - anxiety relief. So you may have to try out different responses before you find the right one.

Since I love giving personal examples that I may later regret....recently broke up with a girl that I actually really liked but she treated me poorly. I had a hard time sleeping because believe it or not I couldn't stop feeling bad for her lol. So anyway I tried some things - ""Don't worry about it"" ""It's over now"" ""whatever"" I finally got to ""Fuck her feelings"" and I felt immediate relief wash over me.

You would then basically do this friend advice for yourself in your brain. When the distorted cognition occurs you would respond with the response that you figured out. Over time the cognition or thought that you developed will replace the former one that you held. This is inevitable because if you are replacing a distorted cognition it is either inaccurate or unhelpful so why would it stick around?

Please keep in mind that on the surface this sounds extremely easy but it can take a tremendous amount of practice to be able to identify distortions and then to successfully remediate them through your responses. The best way to catch distortions is to ask yourself the questions I suggested I would ask you earlier whenever you experience strong negative affect of any kind (sad, anxious, angry)."
2a91ej,36,2014-07-09,"GRO Part 6 – Daddy used it, too. [Str8, Mf, oral]",throwaway_sis14,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/2a91ej/gro_part_6_daddy_used_it_too_str8_mf_oral/,"It was lunch and Kyle, Bobby and Jeni’s father, had come home from work. He’d told them he was sick, and that was partially true. What he hadn’t done was discuss the nature of his malady. He certainly couldn’t tell them he was leaving due to a raging hard-on.

Kyle knew he had been dumb going to work today. Unfortunately that hadn’t been the only dumb decision he’d made over the last few days, just one of the more recent ones.

The first had been using the GRO.

He’d found the tube in Bobby’s pants pocket while doing laundry. Later that night, curious about what his son had gotten himself into, he looked up the product on the Internet.

Now, any sane, grown man knew it was a bad idea to put Russian penile enhancement cream on his genitalia. But Kyle figured the only way to adhere to this sound advice would be to never possess such a cream in the first place.

The way Kyle figured, any man left for a sufficient amount of time with a cream that promises to grow his dick would end up using it. He certainly had.

That morning he’d woken up to a massive erection. The GRO had worked, but had come with enhanced libido as well. Mia, his wife and Jeni and Bobby’s mother, was already up and getting dressed. Like most couples they had tight routines in the morning and Kyle knew he’d have no luck getting her to fool around. Besides, he wasn’t quite sure how to explain his cock doubling in size overnight.

So he’d hopped in the shower and beat off. Once he’d gotten a good look at himself he was even more impressed with the GRO. Holy crap! He had to be 12 or 13 inches!

He had lubed his hand with shampoo and thought nasty thoughts for about ten minutes before painting the shower stall with his jism. Apparently, his enlarged balls produced an equally enlarged load of cum.

That had relieved his sexual needs a little, at least enough to stuff himself into a pair of khakis and make it to the office. He was still horny, but he figured he’d be fine until he could proposition his wife later.

He’d figured wrong.

As soon as he’d caught sight of the hot intern bending over to feed more paper to the printer his erection had come back in full force. 

She’d gone away, but then Nancy from accounts came over to talk to him – stupid, sexy Nancy with her three undone buttons and little hint of lacy bra showing! She’d stood there talking for ten minutes. Kyle couldn’t stand up to face her, due to his cock trying to tear through the leg of his pants. So he sat, face level with Nancy’s tits as she chatted away.

By the time she left he was pretty sure he was one panty-line sighting away from ripping the pencil skirt off some poor lady and getting himself fired in spectacular fashion, so he’d sent a quick e-mail to his supervisor and left for home.

Once he was parked in the driveway it was a mad dash to the computer room. In a flash Kyle’s pants were off, his boxers around his hips and he was furiously searching the Internet for something nasty enough to satisfy his urges.

He was just settling into some albums of young amateurs when he heard a noise downstairs. He listened for a moment, trying to convince himself it wasn’t what thought it was until…

KNOCK, KNOCK.

Fuck! The front door.

Kyle stripped off his boxers and threw on a pair of basketball shorts. However, his cock stood straight out, even inside, so he lifted it up and used the waistband to hold it against his stomach. A long t-shirt finished the quick camouflage job and he bounded down the stairs to hopefully rid himself of the annoyance quickly.

Reaching the door, Kyle peeked through peephole. He saw nothing at first, but then caught the top of a whitish-blond head of hair. Someone short. A kid.

Kyle took a deep breath and opened the door. But when he did, the sight in front of him knocked the breath out of him again.

It was a kid alright – a girl. Her light hair was in a pixie cut and she face was young and innocent, but very pretty. She was short and very petite.

However, what gave Kyle such a shock was the massive set of tits she was sporting under a skimpy bikini top. On any woman they would have been impressive, but this girl looked maybe Bobby’s age, and the triangles of fabric did nothing to cover the perky globes underneath.

And she looked as shocked to see him as he as to see her. 

“Umm, is Bobby home?” she asked.

Kyle shook his head to indicate the negative, not trusting himself to speak. Besides her eeny-weeny bikini top she was wearing tiny little denim cutoff shorts. She had flip-flops on and that was it. Her whole look was fun, carefree, youthful and – Kyle couldn’t deny – sexy as hell!

“Oh,” she said, clearly disappointed. She looked like she was about to leave. That was good right? What Kyle wanted?

Or was it?

“Do you…want to come in and wait for him?” he heard himself say. 

No, you idiot! How are you going to jerk off now? part of him screamed inside his own head.

But another voice – a new voice – spoke up. It came from somewhere else. Somewhere…lower.

Trust me. I have a plan.

She shrugged, put on a grin and nodded. He motioned her past him and crowded her just enough that she had to brush her right tit against his arm. Oh, god, Kyle! What are you doing?

She looked up at him, grinning a little more. No doubt she was used to male attention, with a pair like that. Even as young as she must be…

Please, let her be older than I think!

“So, can I get you a drink?”

“Umm, sure! A soda would be great!” The little sexpot sat on the edge of the couch. Kyle returned from the kitchen a second later with a cold can from the fridge. She took it, smiling knowingly at him.

Kyle sat on the arm of the chair opposite her, mindful of how precariously his cock was restrained behind his elastic waistband. Looking at this girl with her banging body wasn’t helping the situation, either. Every glance he stole at her cleavage made his already engorged member even harder!

“So, you know Bobby?” he said. Stupid, he knew, but he had absolutely nothing to talk to this girl about.

“Yeah,” she said, smiling. “We’re…close.”

Close, huh? Bobby, you lucky dog! Has his old man’s magnetic charm. Kyle had always punched above his weight, so to speak, in the girl department. His wife, Mia, was a MILF for sure. She was 36, eight years younger than Kyle himself. They had begun as a fling – Mia had been engaged when they first hooked up – and he’d gotten her pregnant soon after. Jeni had been two years old before they’d finally settled down and gotten married.

Kyle’s looks had a big part to do with that. He was tall, broad-shouldered and naturally fit. Even in middle age his chest was defined and his stomach flat. He went to the gym diligently, so his arms were strong, too. All-in-all, Kyle was still quite a catch.

So it was no surprise that Bobby was pulling hot girls of his own, even if he was a little young to be starting that. Kyle would have to have the birds-and-bees talk with him sooner than he thought.

I doubt I’ll tell him anything this hot little piece hasn’t already showed him, though. The thought of the hot girl before him on her back getting drilled sent a surge to his cock, making Kyle cough up the drink he’d just taken.

“Oh, are you alright?” the girl said, rising to her feet in alarm. When she did, she dropped her can. Acting on instinct, Kyle lunged upright himself, making a grab for it.

He missed, and the can hit the carpet and began spilling its contents on the floor. Neither of them watched, however, because of what else had happened when Kyle had moved.

They both stared at the massive erection that had escaped its precarious concealment and now pointed lewdly at the young girl’s impressive cleavage.

Kyle froze. Holy shit, we’re done for! One voice inside his head screamed.

Wait for it… insisted the other.

“Oh. My. God.”

Kyle held his breath, not knowing what would come next.

“That’s…amazing!”

Bullseye!

When her eyes found his, he saw the unmistakable look of lust in them.

Wow, Kyle thought, you were right. I should let you do all the thinking from now on.

Damn right, said the voice in his head that Kyle now knew was his cock. And here we go.

Amber couldn’t believe her eyes. She had been in awe of Bobby’s cock yesterday. Before seeing it she didn’t even think they got that big. Even looking on the internet afterwards had yielded almost none that compared.

Yet here, right in front of her was one even bigger. And it was attached to a quite-handsome grown man. Bobby’s dad, no less. Her little pussy creamed at the thought.

“Would you like to touch it?”

Would she ever! Amber couldn’t help but smile giddily as she nodded emphatically. She reached out her hand and caressed the head. It was almost the size of a plum, and it jumped when her hand touched it.

“Ooo!” she exclaimed, a little embarrassed by how young and girlish she had sounded.

Ever since she’d woken up to find that the GRO cream had worked and inflated her tits, she’d been dreaming of ways to get more and more male attention.

Alas, it was a weekday, so skipping school had been a mistake. Every male she knew was either in school or, like her dad, at work. She’d walked around the neighborhood, hoping to find some random guy to tease, but had come up ridiculously short. Wasn’t anyone unemployed these days?

Finally she’d come to Bobby’s house on the off chance that he’d stayed home too. She’d never expected to find his dad.

And she’d certainly never expected to find this!

Amber looked up into his eyes again to make sure he wasn’t mocking her. All she could see was a hungry look that made her little pussy moisten even faster.

Taking this as her cue to go further, Amber took hold of the thick, hot shaft and hefted it, stroking her hand up and down it experimentally. Bobby’s dad let out a low, rough groan that Amber found very encouraging.

Remembering what Bobby had showed her yesterday, she opened her lips wide and took the huge head of his cock into her mouth, being careful not to scrape it with her teeth. She closed her eyes, bobbing her head back and forth, letting her soft tongue rub the underside of the man’s mushroom head.

The effect on Bobby’s dad was immediate. One large strong hand buried itself in her short hair-do. She felt a slight dull pain as his grip tightened, pulling her hair and pushing his cock just a little deeper into her mouth.

“Oh, fuck yes!” he growled, sounding unlike any dad Amber had ever encountered. But Amber knew he was a father – the father of the boy that had taken her virginity yesterday, in fact. The thought was so naughty, so taboo, that Amber felt she might cum from the mere thought of it. 

She didn’t get the chance, though, because at that moment Bobby’s dad’s other hand scooped under her miniscule bikini top and found her enormous left tit and its ultra-sensitive pink nipple. The second he pinched it her vision turned to a billion twinkling stars and her pussy spasmed powerfully as her orgasm crashed over her.

Purely on instinct, Amber pushed more of Bobby’s dad’s cock into her mouth, all the way to the back of her throat. She immediately gagged and coughed, removing his cock from her mouth. 

But the momentary caress of her velvety throat – or maybe just the erotic sight of the preteen slut gagging in front of him – was enough to send him over the edge.

Suddenly a hot jet of thick cum sprayed across Amber’s face. It was followed by another and another – a seemingly endless supply of hot thick white jism that covered Amber’s face, hair and massive tits as she kneeled there in the afterglow of her own powerful cum.

Seeing his flow abating, Amber captured his big cockhead in her mouth once more, and got as her reward two more big mouthfuls of cum from Bobby’s dad’s magnificent cock.

The spent man collapsed back into the chair, his still-hard cock jutting lewdly from his lap. Seeing it again in all it’s glory made little Amber feel very naughty and very proud for having made it cum. How many girls her age could say they’d seduced a man their own father’s age?

She looked down at her cleavage: Covered in cum. She felt it covering her face and soaking her hair as well. How did this always seem to happen to her? Was she destined to be the cumshot girl?

Not that there was any way I could have swallowed all of Bobby’s or his dad’s humongous loads, she thought as she scooped fingerfuls of cum from her tits and face and fed them into her greedy mouth. She did love the taste of cum!

Her bikini top was soaked as well, so she removed it. That’s when she saw that Bobby’s dad was watching her, and what’s more he was stroking his hard length of cock with his hand. Even in his big fist it looked huge! 

Amber couldn’t wait another second. She stood up and wiggled out of her tight cutoff shorts, exposing her bald pussy to a grown man for the first – but she was certain not the last – time.

Now she had his attention for sure! His hand wanked his thick cock faster as he stared at the over-sexed preteen. Amber was loving this! She put her hands on her hips and modeled her enhanced little body, teasing this grown adult who was about to become her second sexual partner.

Finally figuring she had teased him enough, Amber walked over and straddled his lap. He was so much bigger than her that she had to spread her legs almost to the max, but that was fine – it would be perfect for what she planned to do.

Amber took the huge cock in her hand and raised up above, having to put on foot on the couch to get her pussy high enough to reach the tip. But it finally did reach and she rubbed Bobby’s dad’s engorged prick over her slit several times to get it nice and wet.

When she did, the man under her closed his eyes and laid his head back, moaning, “Oh, fuuuuuck, that feels sooooo good.” This made Amber smile as she began to sit down on it, forcing the too-big cock into her tight preteen body.

Inch by inch it slipped inside. His big hands were holding her tiny body around her waist, which made Amber feel secure and vulnerable at the same time, but also very, very sexy!

The pressure in her pussy was indescribable. Bobby’s cock had taken her virginity and stretched her immensely. It had hurt a lot for a moment at first, but then it had turned to intense pleasure. This was different. It didn’t hurt as sharply as Bobby’s had, but it was continuous and much, much more intense. But so was the pleasure.

Before Bobby’s dad’s cock was halfway inside the diminutive preteen, Amber was experiencing an orgasm that made every one before it seem pale and weak. Her head split, her scalp tingled, her legs went numb and her tits…God, her tits were on fire in an incredibly erotic way!

After about two dozen strokes, Amber’s bare little pussy mound touched Bobby’s dad’s soft tuft of pubic hair and Amber herself collapsed against the man’s strong adult chest. She’d never imagined she’d feel this full!

She also felt exhausted. But the man inside her didn’t let her rest long. He began kissing her neck tenderly, which contrasted nicely with the rough way his big hands were kneading her round little ass. Using her cheeks as two handles, he began lifting her slightly and dropping her back down, simultaneously thrusting his hips a little.

The subtle fucking he was giving her stoked her lust again to a full-on blaze. Every thrust he made inside her sent electricity radiating from her pussy throughout her body. Amber sat up in his lap, leaning back to support herself with her hands on his thighs, exposing her perky, pornstar tits to Bobby’s dad once again.

And her tits proved to be a temptation he couldn’t resist. The man let go of her ass with one hand and clutched one tit, bringing his mouth to the other to suck and gently bite her pretty pink nipple. All the while he continued to fuck his massive cock into her steadily. Amber could feel her pussy stretching with each thrust, the head of his cock buried so deep inside her it had to be inside her undeveloped womb. Every thrust made her tummy bulge out obscenely.

Between the physical attention to her enhanced young body and the obvious lust she evoked in this hot grown man, Amber was in heaven – albeit a very dirty, taboo corner of paradise. She was cumming continuously, her pussy juices lubricating their coupling as if her own body was begging to be fucked more and harder.

Bobby’s dad was happy to oblige. Soon he was bouncing her on his lap vigorously. She was so small and light he seemed to have no trouble at all lifting her, and was practically using her entire body to masturbate himself to a rapidly approaching orgasm. The way he handled her made Amber feel like a little fuck toy, and she creamed and cummed all the harder at the thought.

After what seemed at the same time like and eternity and a brief instant, the man slammed her down on his cock, wrapped his arms around her tiny frame and exploded inside her. She could feel his cock lurching in her tight pussy, releasing a torrent of hot cum into her womb. Feeling it send Amber of over the edge once again, and they came together, holding desperately to one another as they climaxed.

Basking in the afterglow, neither was aware of anything but the other. And so neither of them noticed they were being watched until a voice spoke up from the doorway to the kitchen.

“Wow, Daddy. That looked amazing!”

I am pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at San José State University this fall so I will be moving to San José at the end of July. I am looking for a job that will work around my school schedule (I have a couple classes two days a week) and would prefer an internship. Here is a link to my LinkedIn for more information: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/cory-cook/47/772/b29/

Halp,jra9390,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2a93sr/my_sister_isnt_seeing_the_same_results_as_i_am/,"I'm a 23m and have been workingout and powerlifting since I was about 14-15 years old. My sis, who is 21, came back from college over the summer and had a goal to lose some weight, I never though of her as big, I mean she's 5'7 and weighs/ed 150. but she wanted to get rid of fat around her legs...she was just about to shell out $200 for 8 training sessions at our local gym. Seeing that she was a broke college student, I knew it was going to be difficult for her to afford it. So I stepped in an volunteered to train her, on the condition she pay for my memebership at that gym for the summer (gym had a promo going where adding me to her plan only cost $9/mo).

A while ago, I found a study that showed weight lifting over a specific period of time burned more calories than cardio training over the same time span (couldnt find the link after a quick google search). Follwoing in the principle of calories in calories out, I educated her on nutrition and to focus on a 40/40/20 diet, eating protien around/after workout as well as trained her on the proper lifting techniques for alot of the big compound lifts. Once she had her form down, and seeing that she wanted better definition in her legs, I concluded that the 20 rep squat challenge would be the perfect exersize for her (http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/irontamer5.htm), it would be easy to track the progress, and anyone who has done to program can attest that your quads will look like they were sculped by the gods themselves when youre finished.

She is eating at a deficit (about 1200-1500cal day, she has a desk job where she interns), and progressing nicely on the 20 rep challenge, she just completed 135lbs/20reps yesterday (goal is 155/20, she has yet to fail on any of the weight stages). But she isnt losing weight! Since we started working out about a month ago, she has only lost 4lbs. I asked about her sleep schedule and she gets between 8-9 hours everynight. 

What's wrong? Could it be she isn't eating enough or needs to eat less??

Supplemental info: We are doing ""The Original 20 Rep Squat Program""
 (http://www.seriouspowerlifting.com/2843/articles/20-rep-squat-program) 3 days a week. We walk on an incline for 20 minutes after every workout session, keeping our heart rates between 60-70%."
2a97px,1,2014-07-09,Should I return to school for my bachelors?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2a97px/should_i_return_to_school_for_my_bachelors/,"Long story short.  I finished school in 2010 with an associates degree in Computer Information Systems.  Shortly after school I received my CCNA and began working as an intern.  From there on I met so many people in the field that had only an associates degree - if anything at all.  The word on the street was experience and certs will get you where you need to be.  The years have went on and the jobs have changed. I'm currently a systems engineer at a fairly large corporation working with a small team of guys.  We manage 3 data centers and I primarily deal with HP physical servers, VMware clusters, and various EMC SAN / DR products.  I enjoy my job, but know I have more potential to make better money.  I don't foresee myself ever being able to enter the management realm without having a 4 year degree.  (The CCNA has expired and I do very little to zero networking anymore.)

Fast forward:  My past school is now offering a bachelors degree that I can just tack onto my associates.  So basically I go back for 11 more classes and call it a Bachelors of Science.  It's more of an organizational supervision type of degree and is highly geared toward the business side of things.

My questions are pretty vague, but is this really worth the time and money?  I'm already paying for school debt and would really not want to take on more.  However if this is truly something that will eventually help me make $10-$15k more a year then its completely worth it to me.  Anyone else in this same situation?"

2a9h34,3,2014-07-09,"Hopping on the NoFapwagon, and here's why",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2a9h34/hopping_on_the_nofapwagon_and_heres_why/,"I never really thought masturbation was that big of a problem in my life, socially and sexually. When I was a sophomore-junior in high school at the ages of 15-16, I was in a fairly serious relationship. My girlfriend and I would always fool around, but only to a certain extent as I never experienced an orgasm from her, and very rarely got an erection to begin with. Needless to say, she and I never had sex.

At that time I didn't think much of it. I figured it was just hard to get hard. Well now, I'm 20 years old, and still a virgin with potential erectile problems. I have no problems meeting girls and getting them home with me, but I have a problem when I get to that point. I wasn't sure if it was nerves (I went to a urologist to see if anything was wrong with my willy, he suggested I see a sexual therapist since I am in very good help) or if it was for other reasons. It wasn't until yesterday when I realized my problem.

I was at work, I have an internship with a fairly good company around where I'm from, and I'm making great money. However, I was inclined, around 10 in the morning, to go to the bathroom and rub one out. I pulled up some P, started the M, but never got to the O. Which was probably for the better, as mid-masturbation, I stopped and thought to myself - ""Why?"" It then dawned on me the source of my problems was fapping.

Ever since I watched my first porn video, I was hooked. Anywhere between once and twice a day, I found myself rubbing one out in the bathroom from the ages of 14-17. Sometimes a nice, long fap session, but other times it was a furious, quick fap that could sometimes leave my penis in pain. I masturbate less now, but still usually 2-3 times a week. I now attribute that heavily to my lack of any performance in the bedroom.

After finding this subreddit and discovering that there are hundreds if not thousands of people with problems similar to mine, I realized there's only one thing to do. I'm proud to announce I am no longer fapping and I am very excited to begin my journey, as well as seeking and giving advice from/to people just like myself.

I'm a film student out in LA for a summer internship and I've been given a hands-on assignment that I could use some tips for.

Some background, I've been making my own short films since middle school, about to be a junior in college, so I'm fairly confident with the filmmaking process in a narrative context. I've written, directed, and edited several of my own films, and I've PA'd for a couple features too, but it's all narrative-based. 

So the issue at hand is, the production company I'm working with this summer is producing a behind-the-scenes/documentary/live performance video with a singer-songwriter. However, the founder of the production studio, who is also the in-house director, will be away for a wedding and asked me to direct and shoot it myself! (He handed me his Canon 5D Mk III to use and I almost peed a little)

Don't get me wrong, I love documentaries. *Senna*, *Jiro: Dreams of Sushi*, they're huge favorites of mine. I've also seen John Mayer's *Where The Light Is* docu/BTS/live performance about a hundred times which I'm assuming is fairly similar to what I've got to do. But I've just never shot anything without a script/shot-list etc.

So I was wondering if you guys might have any tips on making the transition from narrative work to shooting live performances/documentary style? For example, how to interview for this format, set ups for shooting a live gig etc. Oh and I've never been, but we're shooting at the Viper Room on Sunset if anyone has location specific tips.

Thanks!"

Recently, I was hired to create and control computer animations for the scoreboards at my Division 1 school as well. This won't be a big time commitment but I figured it would be a really interesting and valuable experience to have.

My dream is to eventually have a career within the theme park industry, through some branch of CS, and I'm considering applying for a seasonal IT technician job at nearby amusement parks for the summer (as an industry-relevant position).

Would it look bad in any way to potential employers if I have a variety of different CS work experiences without a specific specialty (i.e. Dev/QA/Graphics/IT)? I am just concerned that they may think I am not likely to commit to their company or able to specialize in a certain area of CS.

I may be in trouble... Most of you, okay, all of you don't follow my posts but in one last post I mentioned my job is not a typical 9-5.  My employer has me working in several offices (and two courthouses) every day so I visit the same offices once a week.  It's great because I get to meet new people everyday and I never get bored.

To the point, I went to work at one of the courthouses today and the summer is particularly fun for me because every office - including the courthouse - hires interns.  The courthouse hired one particular law student, a petite, second year law student from Thailand.  She had highlights in her hair, tan skin, and a beautiful smile.  I was walking down the hallway after a court docket and I made eye contact, stopped, and said hello.

She gave me a bright smile and said hello back.  ""I've never seen you before, are you new here?"" I asked.  She replied by telling me she's a new intern who started late last month (I only work at this courthouse three times per month).  To make a long story short, we talked and flirted for 30 minutes.  She hardly broke eye contact, laughed at every joke I made, and responded well to my kino (just light touches to her arm and a prolonged handshake) and even touched me a few times.

This should have been an easy close but fear struck me.  All I can think of was the nurse I went on a date with.  If you want more info on the first encounter and date knock yourself out: [First encounter](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/28o0d5/fr_closed_the_nurse_in_my_doctors_office_and_now/) and the [Date](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/292dyh/fr_got_a_nurses_number_during_my_doctors/).  Although we went on one date, I kept getting this nagging feeling that I could be betraying the nurse I went on just **one date with.**  

So the encounter ended with me saying I had to go but I will be back.  The law student asked when I'll be back so I told her the date.  Her smile slowly deteriorated so I told it her it was nice meeting her and I will see her soon.  She kept repeating ""Okay see you, bye!"" several times even as I walked away.

Could this mean I've got oneitis?  I only went on one date with the nurse but I'm acting as if I'm exclusive with her.  I'm going on a date with her tomorrow night so at least I got that going for me.  Did this penismissle go limp?"

I really want to make the switch to computer science and am excited to start studying everything full time.

As a post bacs, financial aid is really limited. I really regret my first major, but nothing to do now. I will have enough in loans to cover the tuition, but other than that, I am SOL. I can't even get a work study because I ended up applying so late. I can't even get other loans because I don't have a cosigner. I am a female so I'll be applying to a lot of STEM scholarships. Hopefully my second year will be easier financially but this first year will be rough.

I don't know enough about programming to get any sort of coding job yet and because the region the school is in, I am wondering if I would be setting myself up for failure if I were to get a 20 hour per week job waiting tables or something like that? I worked all through undergrad about 35 hours per week and I had an easy major. I got decent grades there, but I wonder about the CS work load. Anyone work while in school? I am prepared to be poor for the next year or two, I just need to get really good grades, as I only started to code when I was 25.

I am also concerned about the opportunities for internships at a lower caliber school. I would be applying for internships in the city closest to me- about 4 hours away. As a post bac, how can I best represent myself to get any internships, and would I need to have the cost of getting to the interviews when I did start to apply? That would be a real hardship for my first year in school as my financial situation is looking now.

Any sort of pointers for how to survive financially while in college would be helpful."

I told her not to worry, and then before we were about to cross the street I said ""hey"" and pulled her towards me and went for the successful k-close. We keep walking around and I don't force the hand holding. Anyways we end up going back to the same bar later to get another drink, I walk her back to her car, and we kiss more on the way and before she gets into her car.

I told her I had a great time and I want to see her again. She works nights as a waitress so she doesn't have many free nights which is okay with me. (One thing that happened was I messed up her name...I felt so dumb but she didn't seem too phased by it. Her name is Annie and I called her Abbie because I had been talking to someone else named Abbie in my phone earlier that day...shit)

When I got home I texted her letting her know I had a great time and made a joke related to me making it home safe (she called me a lightweight when I messed up her name lol which is true). I did not receive a text back that night and still have not today. 

Seddit - am I worrying too much about her not texting me back? She was a pretty cool chick and I'd like to see her again, I was planning on asking her out when she's free next week. I'm just going to chill for now and not try to contact her for a few days. Let me know what you guys think! I trust your judgment and criticism. Thanks!"

“If you see this man please let us know.” Harvey replied and placed the wrinkled photograph on the counter. We flinched as we stepped out into the snowy streets that made up the Narrows. How could a man so infamous simply walk out of a lunatic asylum into the night? Who helped him escape? These questions were branded onto my mind while we scurried back to our car, like all the rats who call this place home. The familiar scent of day-old scotch clung to the walls. Harvey was silent on the way back to the precinct; he was always troubled by unfinished jobs. The road above us was illuminated by our Chevy; we were still as blind as the bats that roam this city unchecked. Thump. Harvey swung the wheel as we skidded across the ice; the rats ran to their holes. I grabbed my Magnum as the door clunked open. The cool air shattered my breath. There was a dent on the roof of the car, something, or someone had crushed it. There was no sign of anybody nearby. 
“James, you can’t seriously think it’s him? We don’t have time to indulge your little obsessions, there’s a lunatic on the loose.” Harvey spoke calmly, but I could see his eyes twitching, searching for some evidence, something to let us know we were safe. The Chevy was warm and comforting, but I still couldn’t get the feeling that we were being watched out of my head. The adrenaline was wearing off by the time we reached the bridge. As we left the Narrows everything seemed brighter, even though the night was late. The thick orange glow flickered through the cables; I was going home to Barbara and my unborn child. I smiled, I could almost smell the biscuits warming in the oven, that scent of cinnamon all throughout the house, that perfume I got Barbara that she insists on wearing despite the fact that I know she despises it.
The Chevy sputtered into a space outside the police department, Harvey wished me a merry Christmas and left for home, we both know where he is really going. The doors were glistening with condensation as I pushed them open. The silence of the road was extinguished by the bustle of the building. Some men were putting up tinsel and decorations across the walls; I was greeted by the intern Dent. “Barry from Forensics says that there was no sign of forced entry or exit in the cell.”
That news does not make this job any easier. “Tell Barry I’ll speak with him tomorrow, I just have a couple of things to sort out tonight. Oh I forgot; how is Law School going?” I replied in the most cheerful voice I could muster. 
“Everything is going fine Detective!” the boy replied. Dent was filled with so much optimism, he always wanted to be a solicitor, guess that means he won’t be out there freezing his fingers off and living drunk like Harvey. At least this world has a little hope. I’m damned to hell anyway. My office was small and dark, covered in boards and newspaper cuttings. Harvey would tease me for them; they weren’t my cases, just my ‘obsession’. The cork was pierced by pins holding all the sightings of bats in this city. I was always intrigued by the Chiropteran order, now they had come to my city.
An hour later I climbed the cracked black steps to my home, awaiting the warming biscuits. The fragrant cinnamon. My family. All separate memories crossing at this one moment. Victor from next door asked me whether we’d caught the madman yet. I dreamed of bats that night.

Pope Kang needs a personal assistant. As the shadowy leader of a Neodiscordan Ultrachurch, Gift Shop, and Think Tank, he has a lot of responsibilities.

Knowledge of Discordianism is a plus. After all, there are religious sensitivities to be considered. An appreciation of Alan Watts, Terence McKenna, Robert Anton Wilson and similar lunatics is a bonus.

You have to be a motivational and focusing factor. You will be instrumental in helping him build the charity side of the organization. As the title suggests, you will be dealing with an eccentric thousandaire adult child. Patience is probably key.

You need to be comfortable with being on camera and interacting with the public. Pope Kang will be doing public events and working with charities. If you’re into that sort of thing this is for you.

It isn't the role I originally applied for, but since I have technical knowledge, they funneled me into this role for an interview. The only issue is that while they don't expect me to be a programmer, quite frankly I'm unsure of what to expect in the coming interview. I have experience working with MySQL, I'm familiar with the logic involved in programming and a lot of the technical acumen, but when it comes to actual programming I have no experience. They're preferably seeking somebody a computer science major with a business minor or something similar so I expect they need me to be at the very least, able to effectively communicate with software engineers and developers. 

I've looked at other interns in the same position at this company and they seem to have some degree of experience at least MIS with knowledge in either programming languages or SQL. 

Any advice as to how to prepare for the interview? They scheduled me in for a slot in two days so my preparation time will be minimal. Primarily, the big question is to ""Truly understand a program (and not just follow the steps)"".

Also, what do you think is most important for a project manager to you as a programmer and in what way could I be able to make your life as easy as possible?

Hello...first time on this subreddit, so my apologies for any rule breaking. 

I'm an IT Intern for a small software company. Currently our system is spread out across a few platforms and I'm looking into better options for us. 

What we're currently using: 

* Best Practical's RT for IT Help ticketing
* Nagios for network monitoring
* Microsoft Access for inventory

I am looking for an all in one management system: 

* Networking maintenance and monitoring, self sufficient would be ideal (Nagios ""self heals"" on several issues)
* Inventory of office systems (All hardware, software, etc) 
* Various Admin privileges and end user states.   (Manager will have higher admin rights than me, the intern, for example) 
* History logging
* End user system management, updates, etc
* Ticketing system for IT Help, ideally with connection to inventory. 
* ITIL Compliant 
* Ideally cheap or open source.  Company higher-ups are very ""If it can be done for free, we're not giving you any money"". 

Anybody have experience with any systems that they would like to give details on? The ones I know about...but I haven't actually done anything with: GLPI, iTop, OTRS, ProjectOpen.

Despite its 15"" screen like my current laptop (4:3), it is an 1.5"" longer (due to the numpad addition and longer screen). I didn't think this would be too bad in person, but it is really starting to bother me. I spend a lot of time traveling - to and from college and to visit family in other states - which means I have my laptop on the move a lot. I have a nagging feeling that this 15.24"" length laptop is not going to be as portable as I'd imagined.

I'm thinking about returning and downgrading to a Y40 - probably [this](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y40/?sb=:000001C9:00012260:) one however if you can find a better deal from another website so I don't have to deal with Lenovo shipping I'd be much obliged. My concerns with the Y40 is its AMD graphics card and downgrade in processor (still i7 but slower performance). I do like its better chassis and battery life which works better for my traveling. 

I plan to use the laptop for some gaming, but mostly college and intern work (heavy multitasking programs). Games mostly limited to WOW, LOL, Skyrim, portal, but not a priority to play on high settings. 

In your opinion, will this processor/graphics card change significantly affect my needs? I specifically went with this Y50 for the great processor over the much cheaper dual i5.

The $$$ difference is not the issue, although a plus if I get the y40. "
2aanz5,1,2014-07-09,Doing my first internship- is what I'm experiencing normal?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aanz5/doing_my_first_internship_is_what_im_experiencing/,"Almost halfway through my first internship. It's been a ride for sure. Confusing, exciting, frustrating, I'm sure that's all normal. But what I wonder constantly is whether my tasks/experience are also typical in this field?

When I first got here, I was told what my team was (i.e. ""we handle this part of the business""), handed my team's codebase and told to fix things (tests and bugs mostly). Ok, I can give that a shot, maybe was expecting more training, but whatever. After a few days + some frustration, I fixed some of the bugs. The others, I didn't know enough about the system/code to fix, so I was told just to document them. My team didn't seem too pleased, though.

Fast forward a few weeks, and its much of the same story. I'm still working on bug fixing and miscellaneous things for a codebase I don't understand too deeply (those who are available for questions are friendly, but very busy, and are not often familiar themselves since they haven't worked here long either.) I'm able to fix most of what's given to me, but not quickly. Completely fine with the job, learned so much, but my manager/team don't seem very satisfied with my performance. I have a good GPA and did well during the interview, so I wonder if they were expecting more?

The other interns (different teams) are doing pretty much the same (bug fixing), but their teams seem to be happy with them. The company isn't known to be that demanding or anything.

So what I really want to ask is: 1) Are my tasks pretty typical for software engineering and/or SE internships? 2) How can I improve? I want to keep working for this company in the future, and they initially told me that as well. But the more time I spend, the more they seem to not go down that route. They seemed disappointed from the start when I couldn't fix things right away. So if you have any intern/job experiences or and info, advice to share, I'd be so glad to hear it! This is my first internship and I would be so happy to hear anything that might help! Thanks!!"

I apologize in advance for the length but I want to make sure I describe the experience in some detail to give a accurate picture.  

I read a lot about it before using to know what to expect. I took it with my boyfriend and his best friend. We went to a hotel room for the night and put its in OJ and drank it (it was in powder form). I took 100mg at first and started to feel amazing. It was everything I heard it would be. We started having really great conversations and I felt like I wanted to talk about everything and anything being completely connected open and honest. I felt like everything was wonderful and never have experienced such bliss. I did feel very distracted and had a hard time focusing or concentrating on one thing at time though.  After about an hour and a half, we talked about redosing since we felt like it could be better and we our sense our touch was not very heightened. I took another 100mg bc we wanted a better high. Sometime along the night, we thought it was a good idea to redoes for the second time even though I read before NOT to and knew that 125mg was accurate dose for my first time. I am 27, 5' 5'' female and 128 lbs. All logic went out the window since we were feeling so good and it seemed like a good idea.I think I took another 50 or so mg (about 250+ total mg) This is when things turned around. I don't remember when but soon after I started getting extremely fucked up. 

I kept repeating myself over and over and couldn't stop for hours. Also, whenever anyone else would talk I would repeat them. I wasn't speaking normally either. My words would flip flop, were slurred, and I felt like I had no control over what I was saying. 

The comedown started around 10 am (first dosage around 8 or 9pm night before) was the worst experience in my life .I was very fucked up and couldn't really get words out. I was panicky and kept having severe anxiety attacks. For the rest of the day/night until about midnight the next night, I fell into a severe depression/anxiety stupor state and prayed for sleep. I thought I was worthless and everything was extremely terrible and was steadily crying.  I looked and felt like a zombie and my embarrassing moments from overdosing on E were like traumatic PTSD memories that wouldn't stop replaying in my head, however I couldnt speak right or function right in anyway. I was completely void of expressing emotion although I was feeling intense negative emotions. 

 Around midnight with the help of nyquil and antianxiety meds I finally slept and the next day I felt much better and relieved to be close to normal. However, it didnt end there and that night and most of the next day I felt more of the same. Debilitating anxiety that caused me to be unable to function and depression. I woke up in the middle of the night for the following 3 night following taking MDMA fighting panic attacks and one time had trouble breathing. 

I was extremely happy and relived  to finally get back to my normal self following this traumatic experience.  

My question for you experienced MDMA users is 1. Is this normal for a heavy amount?  and 
2. What could I expect to happen if I do it again 5 weeks after and take the normal dosage (100mg max)? I cant really wait longer since I am moving and starting an internship and want to do it with my boyfriend before I leave . For some reason, I feel like I want to try it again and do it right to have an great experience. I loved it before I took too much and just wanted a redo since I now know what to expect and how to make the most out of the experience. I also read a lot about vitamins to take to decrease the intensity of the comedown (e.g. 5htp). Is this a bad idea? 

Any thoughts/ help would be greatly appreciated !! "
2aaqvl,1,2014-07-09,"Me [21 F] met ""the perfect guy"" [22 M] within one week of ending a 5-year relationship [22 M].",blaze88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2aaqvl/me_21_f_met_the_perfect_guy_22_m_within_one_week/,"When I was 16 I dated my first boyfriend, whom I met in high school. Our relationship got very serious as time went on. He was a year ahead of me in school and went to college in the same city as my high school. I then went to a different university in that city and a few months into the school year we moved in together. 


Soon after I spiraled into a deep depression. I hated my college and I had a lot of issues with sex due to medical problems. I felt broken and wanted suicide so badly. My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through this. I decided I had to transfer schools to one of the very few colleges that offered what I wanted. This college was on the other side of the country. Thus we had 2 years long distance.


While I was gone my boyfriend slowly fell apart. He put all his focus on us and I put all my focus on school. I found out while he was visiting for my graduation that he still had about 2 years left to graduate, had failed several classes, had never checked his grades, had student loan collections calling my mom's house because he never did the paperwork to count his internship, cut off his father (which was a long time coming...), totaled his car (not from crashing) and his lease was ending so he had to move back in with his mom. He had dropped to minimum car insurance so he was not covered to get a new car and he let it sit in the repair parking for a month while he was visiting me, which cost him $10/day. He didn't even know if it was in impound. The only positive thing in his life was his unpaid internship with the city.


He was never like this before. When i came back home I asked friends if he had changed or if I was just blind to it before. They all said that he had changed. I feel like this might be mental illness related, and he is on antidepressants but refuses to take them consistently. I also learn most updates about his life from my mother, not from him directly. He says he is afraid to tell me because I get upset.


Well I got a temporary job near my college and he wanted to move in with me here. I liked the idea, as I found out before I learned how much of a wreck he is. When we looked for rental places he was disinterested. He was convinced there were no opportunities here, without really looking. He also didn't like the idea of doing one college semester out here and transferring it back.  


So while I was back in my home town with him we broke up. I had accepted the fact that this was going to happen, but said that if he goes back to his old self or gets his shit together that we still have a chance. I said we will reassess in 3 months, assuming that I would be alone for 3 months anyway. 


The job: During my interview I got the perception that I was working with all married people with kids. I also got the perception that the small town was mostly older people. I was told that I was working alone and nobody ever talked about any other hires. Well it turns out that a different department hired. I ended up with a huge, (reciprocated?) crush on my single coworker that only grew as I got to know him better. Its not an infatuation anymore... This person really is a good fit. My college friends visited for a weekend and met this coworker. Knowing that I wanted them to talk me out of any feelings I had, they still told me that we were a freakishly good match. Additionally, he is my only connection to meeting a friend group in the town.


Basically my thoughts are dating a coworker is bad; dating after a serious breakup is bad; I'm not going to live here in a year. Then I find myself hanging out with the coworker as my only source of friendship and not being able to friendzone well enough. I see no way out. What can I do? Every time I get a text I am afraid to look at my phone to see who it is. I can't live like this.


tl;dr

I broke up with my first boyfriend after 5 years. He fell apart while we were long distance. I moved to a new town for a temporary job. Within the week I had a serious crush on my coworker, who is also my only friend here. "

I have also taken interest in a man that I have been friends with for the last few months from school, and I would like to be open to having fun with that. I am dead set on ending the relationship, but I’m not sure how to do it.


He has already bought a very expensive plane ticket to meet me here at the end of my internship next month in order to join me on the roadtrip back home. I feel like I am stuck in the relationship until that has happened in order to save his finances, and I also genuinely enjoy his company.


Furthermore, he is my absolute best friend and I am very afraid to lose that aspect of our relationship. He has told me before when I’ve tried to break up with him that he will not be my friend if we break up. We’ve had a dead bedroom for six months (I can’t bring myself to be sexually attracted to him). I also do not speak to my family due to childhood abuse and other circumstances, so his family has become my family. When I break up with him to I stop all contact with them and delete them on Facebook, etc?


All in all, I would like to know what others think about how I should end it without ruining him financially after buying a nonrefundable plane ticket, and also how to deal with his family afterward?

Sure, they have come with consequences. There is no going back. I recognize that I have slowly developed a problem. But I just wanted to have fun. I realize now that my fun has caused some problems. A little back story:

2014 has been a bitch for me. My spring semester I was driving 80 miles round trip AT LEAST 6 days out of the week to go to class and work. My day would start at 5:30am, be on the road by 6:00am. Some nights I wouldn’t get home until 11:00pm, and I would start all over again. I didn’t spend a single night with friends enjoying myself. I would always venture straight home and prepare for what hell the next day had in store. If I was lucky to have a day off, my inbox would fill up with work emails. Studying had to be done at night. 

Along with all the work and school stress, my mothers health took a turn for the worst. A check up for health insurance purposes revealed her blood pressure was 252/(I can’t remember the bottom number.) She said not to worry, everything would be ok. Things got worse, and surgery was a requirement. She walked out of the hospital refusing to have it. The doctor guaranteed my mother would have a major stroke within a year.

While I only was in the office for 20 hours a week, I spent at least another 20 hours of my personal time assisting work. Unpaid. I had school, work, and a mother to worry about. Then I got offered the opportunity of the lifetime: interning in New York City. After years of busting my ass, I was offered my dream position. Housing was covered, plus an hourly rate. I was nervous about leaving my mom behind, but she said I would be stupid to pass up this opportunity. I agreed, and now I am 5 weeks into my 10 week internship. 

I’ve taken advantage of the New York lifestyle, but not once did I think I had a problem. I was simply having fun for the first time in months. But maybe you’re right. I’m trying to avoid the reality of losing my mother, and that soon I will be back in school for another stressful year. I’m using alcohol as an escape. My actions have been putting strain on my relationships. I realize now that I am close to having no one in this big ass fucking city. So even though you did tell our general manager, and numerous other managers in our company of me blacking out one night, breaking a computer, and physically injuring myself numerous times, I want to thank you. While you chose to gossip about my problem, I’ve been dragged back to reality and I’ve started to address it.

Thank you KG for making me realize that I was starting on on a downward slope. While others will continue to think I have a drinking problem, I realize I still have a chance to climb back up the slope and start a positive trend. Who knew that you running your mouth would actually help?

Thank you to all those who've read,

**Agency Internships are the gateway to the advertising world.**

Everyone on my account team (including me), started off as an intern at one point or another. It's not just accounts either -&gt; Strategy/planning, art directors, copy writers, etc

Agencies hire interns during three crucial periods.


late Nov/Dec for a Jan start.

late Mar/Apr for a May start.

late July/Aug for a Sept start.


Bookmark the agencies you'd love to work at and constantly check their job board for internships during those crucial months.


Also, do your research!!!

Log onto linkedin and check out past interns from agencies you are gunning for. Some agencies look at their intern pool as cheap/free labour. Some look to their interns as a potential hire (a 3-4 month interview)

Most the reputable ones are on the good side of this equation.

Boutique agencies are notorious for not hiring on their interns... but with that said, it's MUCH easier to get an internship at a top tier agency once you have a boutique agency internship under your belt."

I'll be graduating this August 7 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.  I have started applying for jobs, and I have realized just how difficult it is to get noticed.  Due to my own stupidity, I never had the sense of getting an internship while in school and now I realized just how disadvantaged I am in this job market.  The only job I have is working as a tutor for my university's learning center.  I feel as if I have no actual marketable skills.  I did well in my classes, but I know that's not enough.  I have decided to acquire some technical skills while I look for a job.  I am interested in automation, and I would like to learn PLCs, and do some arduino projects.  What advice can you give me to help me improve my skills.  I am interested in building some personal projects which I can talk about in interviews.  What projects could I build which will teach me a lot.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Met in college, have been together for about 3 years (officially dating for two). I graduated and moved home (would see her every weekend). Now she is about to graduate and picked up an internship, along with her job. (I live about 30 minutes away) This combination basically ruins every chance I get to see her. 

A week before everything started we were a normal couple talking about where we can take a 2 week vaction together in the summer. Since the start of her internship and work, she began to one word me, and not return phone calls or I love yous. After about a week of me starting dead end conversations and I stopped trying to initiate conversations with her. 

It's been about a month now, and she'll text me once a week saying that she really misses me and that she needs to take a break from her job and internship because she hates being so busy  and that she wants to come see me. This is very confusing to me and is giving me many mixed emotions.  

Meanwhile, I have a beach house with a bunch of my friends for the summer. In a town with a lot of people my age. I have never had a problem picking up other girls.  But me trying to remain loyal to someone who isn't willing to put up the same fight for our relationship that I did, is hard. Note: I have never cheated on anyone and don't plan on it.

I have been in love with this girl since I laid eyes on her. I have accepted the fact that she isn't that into me anymore? (Let me know if you get that vibe). I don't know how to proceed on without it making me seem selfish because she is so busy. If that makes any sense. 

I apologize for the clarity,  it's 2 am right now and I had a long day at work. This has been causing me to not sleep for the past few weeks.

Tl; DR;  girlfriend of almost 2 years is busy and only texts once a week to say she misses me"

I am an international student studying at University of Illinois-Urbana(Strong Big 4 target school) and I just finished my sophomore year. I want to work in the USA for 2-3 years after graduation but can pretty much only aim for the Big 4, since the smaller firms won't hire me. Here's some information about me:

1. Doing the 5 year BS/MAS program and just finished sophomore year with a 3.71 and made it to the dean's list a few times.

2. Have done an internship at Deloitte in my home country after freshman year. (That I got through family connections and didn't do much and just sat around in the office and did some basic tasks every now and then)

3. Currently doing an internship at KPMG in my home country. ( I got this by actually applying and doing an online test plus an in-person interview. Also, have been doing some work and going to client sites and learning a lot rather than just sitting around).

4. Speak good, clear English without much of an accent.

5. However, my extra curriculars are extremely lacking. Haven't done anything significant or held any leadership positions so far. Only thing I have done is play intramural soccer, volunteered for a few events and did the VITA program last Spring.

I regret not being more involved and I really want to make a change from this semester onwards.

My question for you guys is what do you guys think of my achievements so far? Do I have a decent shot at landing a job at the Big 4 eventually? I had joined the Accounting club at my college and went to a few meetings, but I never really figured out how I could ""network"". There was always only a few firm employees surrounded by about 50 Accy students and I didn't know what I could say or do to be even remembered by those people.

I am really anxious about the recruitment process because of how competitive Big 4 is and the fact that they are literally my only options to work in Public Accounting in America. I really want to be prepared as well as I can and give it my best shot. Any and all advice from you guys is greatly appreciated. 

Thank You"
2abllj,0,2014-07-10,My car is haunted,Rin_Takahashi,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2abllj/my_car_is_haunted/,"I've always wanted to get my car fixed up ever since I got it. It's a 2003(?) Black Lancer which my dad gave to me on my birthday. It was the best thing I could ever ask for my birthday.

Strange thing is that the car has an auto break system which it shouldn't have. There were times during my first month with my car that my car suddenly braked. By *itself*. 

One particular rainy night really freaked me out. I was on my way home when I noticed that my car was having trouble trying to accelerate. Suddenly, the car braked without me doing anything. I had my foot on the freaking gas for goodness sake! Anyway, I freaked out for a moment but felt myself suddenly get scared because as the rain lightened up, I noticed the blinking lights in front of me. There was an accident between two vans and it looked like I will be the third if my car didn't brake by itself.

Another weird thing is that, my mom scolded me in the morning because she used my car before I was awake to get something from the grocery and she noticed hand marks all over the windshield at the passenger side. As if, someone was trying to push out the windshield. I thought she was just joking and that the hand prints were outside but it turned out to be *inside*. I tried to clean it out but the marks are very hard to clean out all the way. This made my blood run cold and I asked my mom if I can use the other car. Thankfully, she relented.

I didn't use my car for a week but after that, I figured it was safe enough for me to use it again. Guess I was wrong. Throughout my drive to and from the university, I kept on hearing this weird water sounds coming from the passenger side. I investigated it but there was nothing amiss. This kept on happening for about two weeks before I broke down and went to a mechanic who looked beneath the glove compartment and the water just poured down. It freaked out the mechanic and asked me if I drove in a flooded area. I told him no because the only time that I used the car when it was raining is the time when I almost got killed. Anyway, he fixed it and charged me nothing since he's an old friend of my dad.

The water is gone for about a month before it started again. I didn't want to use it again because I think that the aircon is broken. 

Ants are a problem too. It used to be a really clean car and now ants are suddenly appearing on the headboard of my car. Mind you, i don't eat in my car. I think something died in my car but I wasn't able to find any smell or remains. But my best friend has other ideas. 

He thinks my car is haunted. With all the hand prints, the sudden automatic braking system, the water and the insects. He even brought up a dream I told him about a year ago. (which I regret telling him now because he's so sure that a ghost is in my car)

The dream is about me and a friend who is a girl, (Who I know now as my new classmate whom I met at january and now i'm giving her a ride home) driving home. I asked my friend who is sitting beside me in my car where we should go next and she told me that we could hang out at her apartment. A little girl behind us suddenly spoke up and I looked at her. I saw her eyes turn dark as night as she grinned at me. ""I wouldn't do that if I were you."" She said in a playful voice and I glared at her before snapping. ""And why not?""

The demon girl just leaned her head on my friend's shoulder and told me. ""Because a demon is obssessed with you and if you're not hom in a couple of days, he'll be maaaad."" That's when I woke up.

I only got my car last january as an early gift and I only met my friend last february. The dream happened last *year* september. I'm just looking for a good explanation for all this because I drive home alone now after my internship ends by 11pm and I seriously don't want to imagine a ghost or whatever invisible it is sitting beside me in the dark. If it really is a supernatural problem, help me know what and why it is haunting my car."

I'll have some good experience when I graduate (software consultant and research assistant intern) so it won't be all shit, but I'm worried it won't be enough to get my foot in the door of top places (IBM for instance).

Also a bit of a random question - is a degree from a lesser university worth as much as a degree from a top 10 uni? Say I were to transfer to a place where the course is easier would they still accept my degree when applying for grad schemes?"
2abwlx,4,2014-07-10,First Phish show this weekend!,BrunoBars,phish,https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/2abwlx/first_phish_show_this_weekend/,"Howdy friends,

I'm off to see Phish for the first time this weekend at Randall's Island. I'm incredibly excited, I've respected and enjoyed what the band has been doing ever since I got into the jam band scene and being able to see Phish is too damn exciting. 

I've seen recommendations here to bring a bandanna in case Randall's Island gets dusty, so I'm set there. Is there anything else you suggest a newbie does? I plan on coming very early, 5ish or so, I assume there'll be tents and people set up and having fun, right? Also, my friend warned me that Shakedown Streets at Phish shows are sketchy, is that true? I'm working a summer internship in the City so I don't know where to get what I want to get, but I'd rather not deal with sketchiness. Is my friend telling the truth in his warnings about Phish's merchants? 

Best to you all! See you Sunday!

2abzto,7,2014-07-10,[UPDATE] My ex broke up with me 4 weeks ago. I feel so mentally... congested. Please help me.,[deleted],Meditation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2abzto/update_my_ex_broke_up_with_me_4_weeks_ago_i_feel/,"I wanted to thank everyone for all the discussion on [this previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/29z1da/my_ex_broke_up_with_me_4_weeks_ago_i_feel_so/). There was a lot of empathy and mutuality that I know has helped more than just me. This is a huge learning experience.

Long story short, we dated for maybe a month or two. She went away for the summer. 2 weeks after she left, she comes back home for a weekend and tells me she wants to see me. She breaks up with me, in person, telling me that she isn't ready/wants to be free during summer/isn't happy/doesn't want to worry about a relationship/and most painfully **has zero fortitude for making our relationship work**.

I put a lot of effort into this relationship. The day she left, I was very enthusiastic and eager for the future. I was happy with her, and I think she was happy with me; but two weeks later, she tells me all my feelings for her have to stop, that our relationship will cease and the future is unknown.

To say the least, I was pretty ruined. I cried a lot, I tried to stay busy, I went out with friends as often as possible but I couldn't run from the reality of the situation, I posted on Reddit. I'm 19 and working an internship now, so the addition of working 40/hrs a week was very foreign and stressful to me.

It has been 25 (?) days since we separated. I haven't reached out to her yet, and she hasn't reached out to me. 

I have learned so much about myself since then. I'm happy to say that the whole experience has pushed me towards meditation, mindfulness and improving my mental health.

I'm worried what our future holds. I don't know if I we will get back together, I don't know if we will slip back into a friendship, I don't know if I just want to remove her from my life. Luckily, I have 37 days to figure that out before school starts.

______________________________________________________________________

I'm coming to realize one thing: **I need to forgive her.** Some of you have mentioned this in my previous post, but it is becoming more apparent. I want to revert to the time when I harbored no resentment for her and she was a neutral person to me. I want to forgive the pain she has caused me so that I can think more clearly, when the moment is right, as to what place she has in my life. **I do NOT want to go back to school with feelings of distaste for her. I need to separate myself from her and become independent**. My greatest fear is seeing her with someone else, which will throw me into an utter tailspin. I have 38 days to prep myself for that moment.

I can see the anger in my actions. You know how exes will bring new boyfriends/girlfriends to parties where they know their ex will be? I'm inclined to do something similar. She is a part of the same clique as me, but since she is away for summer, I have the clique all to myself. I hang out with said clique nearly every weekend, going to the beach or concerts and such and I feel encouraged to make visible that we, that I, am having fun without her, with her friends who she no longer has available. Social media (Facebook, Isntagram, Snapchat) are the primary vehicles for this. Posting pictures of us at the beach, with all of us tagged so that I know she will see it has become somewhat of a habit. Alternatively, we (Me, my now ex, 2 guy friends and 1 girl) went to a music festival 2 months ago. Last night, we (My two guy friends, the other girl and my ex weren't invited) just bought tickets to go to another festival in August. I made a point that I want to keep this event between us. I even posted a picture on Instagram celebrating that we are going to said festival. In general, I’m just happy to announce that we are going, but there is a part of me that posted that picture to Instagram because I want my ex to feel the hurt of not being included. I'm not sure if I am trying to make her miss me, feel isolated, feel desperate or hurt. Maybe it is just my way of getting over her, but I feel as if it is selffish. She *should* no longer be a concern of mine, but I feel pressured to do these things. At times, I even feel like I need to directly drive a wedge further between my ex and the mutual clique, but luckily these thoughts haven't escalated into action. I don’t think I will let them do so.

Deep down, I don't like this. It feels... Empowering and influential to be able to mingle with mutual friends that she does not have access to and in-turn, make her feel left out; but it's making visible a weakness of mine: **I can't let go**. I want to cripple her, and escalate into a position of power where I am in control, where she is sad and I am happy, and she is left to crawl back to me but that isn't right! That's not who I am or who I want to be. I want to forgive her in order to spare myself future pain and grief, in order to protect her, and as well as to allow the flourishing of a friendship but **how!?**

Thanks everyone for all the advice. I went in to the meeting and pretty much dominated the conversation with statistics etc. Listened to what they needed from me and visa versa. Went away with a few action items, and felt generally pretty well about how things had gone. 

For a few weeks, then walkin's started again, and I decided I would log them, and get them done so I can show what's happening. Then got hit with another random out of the blue request from my superior. I'm supposed to meet with each department head, do all their tickets until they are done before moving on. Give weekly updates, and do an inventory of all equipment, phones, printers, etc by the end of the Month. (not too bad)  I understand the weekly update thing it's something I've been trying to get done for a while. Just the whole way the email was put together and out of the blue, without even asking me about how things are going is what irritates me. 

So this leads me to my next topic. I have now got an Intern, he's an older guy through a program to get people who've been in prison back in to the work force. He used to be a software engineer, and worked on various contracts until he ran into a spot of bother. So my question here is, I need to bring him up to speed on things with servers, routers, etc. He's got the right mindset for troubleshooting so I'm looking for some websites/tools that he could use to get up to speed to learn. 

The other thought I had was to train him to take over my position whilst I look for something else but I don't know if that would be possible. Thanks again for all you're help I'm glad to have this as a resource.

Edit: Thought I better add this bit of information since /u/sdmike21 asked. Looking for training focused on desktop/server support. Maybe something like Khan Academy but for windows server stuff. My goal is that even if we can't hire him full time it will give him a leg up on his situation. As he is currently homeless."

2ac3tc,3,2014-07-10,"Me [21 F] with my fiance [21 M] almost 3 years, abuse, drunken kiss and sitting in limbo",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ac3tc/me_21_f_with_my_fiance_21_m_almost_3_years_abuse/,"I usually don't try to find answers on online websites, but at the moment I am desperate. Sorry that this is so long, but it is a very complex relationship. 

My fiance and I have been together for 3 years. We loved each other from the first day we met. It wasn't love at first site, but an immense attraction and understanding between the two of us. We fell into love easy and were great together. About a year later we were engaged, but decided to wait until we were both out of college to get married, which would be another 2 years at least. We loved each other and thought it was the right choice. Or at least that was what I thought. We spent almost every day together in the last three years. I thought was perfect and amazing. 

During the time we have been together, I also have been going through my own stuff. I was abused as a child and will admit that I am pretty messed up. I have low self-esteem, insecurities about other girls, anger problem, and really for a long time now didn't know how to have a normal relationship. That is only the tip of the ice berg. He was very supportive and helpful through everything. We worked on everything together. I have found that I am my very best with him.

However, recently I found out that I have been abusing him for at least the last 6 months. I was physically violent with him when I would get angry. I was possessive and clingy. I was wouldn't let him have girls for friends and would get extremely jealous. There is not excuse for it. Nothing I can say or do to change it. I have apologized to him and told him there is no excuse for it, for I have been very bad to him. I want to be better and want to change. I actually have changed alot in about a month, because of this realization. Everybody has noticed, but it doesn't change anything. 

I found out recently that he has feelings for another girl and wants to date her. He won't admit it, but I know(yes, I did some snooping). He made out with her when they were buzzed. 

Night before they did,  he drunk dialed me and told me he wanted to break up. Then next day we talked and he said he wanted to break up one moment and wanted to stay together the next. He left his parents house (where I am staying for the summer, because of the abusive nature of my household) saying we were fine and we were still together. That night he made out with the girl on a camping trip, which he is not sorry about. He believes its only cheating if we were together (which we were) and if they had sex. Then next day after they made out he said we were together and that he would never cheat on me.     

The girl is known to make out and have sex with guys without wanting a relationship with them. He really wants to date her, but she doesn't want to have anything to do with him. He keeps telling her all he wants is to be friends, but she won't have it. She has broken up an engagement before and will not do it again. She wants him to be faithful to me. He keeps texting her and calling her, but she told him to stop. She really doesn't want to have anything to do with him 

Now, he says he doesn't know if wants to be with me. He says that we are too different from each other and I stifle his manhood or personality. When I finally got him to explain what he meant by this, I found out he wanted more time with his friends. He wanted more time to do what he wanted , meaning his hobbies. Which are all fine by me. 

We are happy together. We like hanging out together and laughing together. We act like we are together. He keeps saying ""our"" instead of his or mine. He will talk about our future together (kids, jobs, etc.) like he used to. We have gone out on dates and everything else, but when I bring up our relationship and trying to define us, he shuts down. He says I don't know. I love you, but...  Relax. Sometimes its a definite yes we are together and other times its a definite no. Sometimes its I want to be friends, best friends He doesn't want to hurt my feelings, but staying in limbo between together or not is killing me. I tried to have a serious talk about it with him, but he uses every excuse in the book to not talk about it.  

Lastly, one of his friends keeps telling him I am insane. He has been saying it since he met both us at the beginning of our relationship. However, the reason he doesn't like me is that I don't like him. He had never respect my fiance, and he believes he is the bee knees. My fiance says he is his best friend so I tolerate him. My fiance even stood up to him this last year saying he needs to stop bad mouthing me. Yet, this particular friend also is the one who is telling him to go for the other girl and that don't get back with me. 

His other friends like me. Many of them enjoy hanging out with me and believe we are great together. They bring out the best side in my fiance. They don't pretend to know the situation or even me. But they know we are good together and happy together. 

He is at a new internship and hour away from me. They camping trip was him with some of the other interns. He did invite me, but I wanted him to have time with his friends. He never drank before, but now that is all he wants to do. 

So what should I do? I don't want to break it off. I love him and would love to work through this and everything else. Is there anything I can do to selvage this complex relationship?     


---   
**tl;dr**: I have abused my fiance for the last 6 months as I have been trying to work through my own issues. Now, that I am aware of this fact he doesn't want anything to do with me. I have apologized and I am finally ready to change. He has a crush on another girl who doesn't want anything to do with him. They made out once when they were drunk. He says he loves me and wants to be with me one minute and the next he wants too break up. One of his friends is pushing him towards breaking up with me while others support the relationship. I love him more then words can say. He also started drinking alot. The question is what should I do?  "

Didn't take but 7 minutes for an actual problem to arise after that post. 

Phone is about to ring, Intern has already answered the phone, (no idea how he knows when it's going to ring.. maybe he's cut out for this after all, no one really knows)

&gt; Intern : Helpdesk, this is Intern, how can I help you today?

&gt; Employee QQ : I can't get my system to work , my computer is really loud, my keyboard isn't working, I can't get to my emails, everything is frozen, sometimes my mouse doesn't work, I can't get anything to work, come help me.

Intern looks at me, clearly distressed with the load just dropped on him by this guy. He hands me the phone.

&gt; Carl : What's your PC Name?

&gt; QQ : MISLoaner45

MISLoaner45? The loaner PC that we gave him like, 3 years ago? That can't be right.. that PC is from ancient times, it was a temp while his new one was being set up, so I thought..

&gt; Carl : MISLoaner45? Did you say that correctly? What happened to your actual assigned desktop?

&gt; QQ : Oh, well someone said they needed it, it was better suited for their programs than mine, so I gave it to them instead.

A nice thought, though all of our computers are literally the exact same.

&gt; Carl : Well seeing as we don't buy different models or versions of any of the pc's that would be false. What employee did you give it to, I'll go get it later on today.

Haha, yeah, and by that i mean NewGuy or Slowpoke will go get it.

&gt; QQ : No I brought it home and gave it to my niece. She said it was a really good computer for her programs for school..

&gt; Carl : YOU DID WHAT?!?! You understand that is stealing work property, don't you? Are you crazy?! 

&gt; QQ : Oh.. no I figured since you gave it to me, I could do what I wanted with it.. Still, this computer isn't working at all..

&gt; Carl : I'll be down to look at it in a few minutes, in the meantime, I've got a few things to take care of.

Hung up after that, although I think he was going to ask I don't email his manager about it. Yeah ok, I'll call him instead.

Pick up the phone, Intern seems confused, he doesn't know what is going on currently. Will let him read this, he'll figure it out. Dial his managers extension, sit and wait for the phone to ring and hopefully be answered.

&gt; QQManager : This is QQManager in Quality Control, how may I help you Carl?

&gt; Carl : Are you aware QQ brought his work PC home and gave it away, very likely without a system restore on it, and the fact that it's WORK property and not his means he stole it from the company?

&gt; QQManager : I did not! That is ubsurd! What is he even using to do work?!

&gt; Carl : MISLoaner45, that vintage 10 year old 'thing' with about enough life left in it to flop over and die.

&gt; QQManager : Well I'll be damned, no wonder he barely ever gets anything done around here. I'll go talk to him and in the meantime, send an email to execs, they'll want to know.

Great. This is what I get for doing the right thing. Gotta bring in the Execs now. Well, I'll work on sending them this email, we'll see what happens but it's looking like it's not going to be pretty. Execs don't handle bad news well in my experiences..

Will keep you posted, but I may drop in an EDIT to explain what happens with the meeting. This is going to be very interesting..

Oh, and Ill let you know what is going on with MISLoaner45 too, It's probably has more viruses on it than I can imagine, not having run a scan on it in 3 years since I've given it to him..

UPDATE #1 : Meeting is set for this afternoon, after my lunch break and all that. Will do another update for what takes place at that meeting.

I went and looked at Loaner45. I spent all of about 4 minutes. It was literally 100% full no space. This guy was deleting information about products on a cycle, so the oldest was deleted to make room for new stuff. He didn't back up ANY of it. The company is now missing over 23 months worth of information on quality issues with products we've shipped, all of which we are still manufacturing. Fantastic. Can't do a scan on it without fear of the computer breaking down, so when it's finally given back and the files are transferred (assuming they even can be), I'll do a scan.

Oh, and also, the computer is literally being held together with Tape. Like, generic clear tape, not even like, duct-tape. There's gotta be 8 full rolls of tape on that computer / monitor to keep them from falling apart. Poor thing just needs to be put to sleep forever with all the torture it's been through. :(

UPDATE #2 : Hooolleeeeyyyyy sheeeeettttt. So, I'll start with the most important stuff, QQ and QQManager and QQManagersManager are all suspended for 3 weeks without pay, not fired at least, yet, i guess.

QQ will be getting the PC back. If any records show the data has been tampered with or copies or anything, he's out of a job and has to pay the cost of the PC.

I didnt get yelled at, nor did anyone in ID thankfully. We did have another ""How do we prevent this"" talk, to which i replied :

&gt; If you want this to stop, start hiring people who have common sense or you could just stop having job fairs at the mental hospital.

Then I got yelled at a little, and a dirty look from QQ, but it was worth it.

The actual meeting consisted of simply this on a loop :

&gt; QQ : I didn't mean it, im sorry, please dont fire me, i didnt think i did anything wrong, the guys in IT can get all the data back, my niece isnt working for a rival company and will not have shown anyone anything, i thought it was ok to give her the computer

s^o^o^o^o^o^o^o^o where does that leave me?

Gotta go get Loaner45, going to snap a pic of it and add it in tomorrows post, going to run a scan on it and tell you what i find in tomorrows post, and I'm going to go get QQs pc from his niece, and im sure that won't be terrible at all, ^amirite? Probably not. We'll see I suppose. 

Final Update : All things considered, a few more meeting having been had, and some group oriented 'brainstorming' ^because ^these ^execs ^think ^they ^have ^brains ^h^u^e^h^u^e^h^u^e^h^u^e

Sorry got a little off topic, brainstorming was to figure out a way to prevent this, when someone mentioned,

&gt; Exec : Hey, lets dedicate someone in IT to managing the loaner PC's.

&gt; Carl : Slowpoke has been doing that for the last 5 years .. Where the hell have you been

All hell broke loose after that. Now we have more meetings tomorrow for Slowpoke to better learn to 'manage' the loaner / rental PC's, and maybe execs think it might be a good idea to start charging money to employees if they don't return the loaner PC by a certain period of time after the reason they had a loaner pc has been resolved.

That's the smartest thing they've said in years.."
2ac7sz,3,2014-07-10,"Dating for 8 months, issues about ""serious relationship"". Bf [21M] Me [20F]",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ac7sz/dating_for_8_months_issues_about_serious/,"I met Brandon in November of last year. We both go to the same college and we had a class together. We started dating near the end of November. I've been in serious relationships before but he's only casually dated other girls in college for at most 2 weeks at a time. During this time, we would see each other almost everyday and hang out the weekends. Since he had never was in a serious relationship before I did not want to push him. It wasn't until March that I asked that we started dating exclusively (even though neither of us were really dating anyone else) and he agreed to be in a relationship with me.  

In my opinion, I thought our relationship was pretty healthy. We were never one of those couples that spent every waking moment together, we still gave each other space, and fights were nonexistent. So I was pretty happy about it. For summer, however, we both had internships that were across the country, so we anticipated the 3 month away from each other. We would skype each other every couple of days for a couple of hours and send several texts throughout the day. Now, he was never really big into texting, and I knew that. When we were both in school we would only text each other to plan out seeing each other. During the summer I expressed my desire for him to text more often (he would only send like 1 text a day) and he got better about it, so I appreciated that. (We still don't text each other nearly as much I used to with my previous SOs, but it doesn't really bother me.) 

During one of our skype conversations he mentioned that he didn't want to be in a serious relationship in college. Later on when I asked him what he meant by it he said that """"All I meant by the not be serious was that I didn't want to be as serious as you and your last boyfriend so fast because I don't want to cry for 3 months straight"". (I mentioned that when I got dumped before I could cry a lot). Okay, sure. I understand where he's coming from, and the way he worded it made it seem like he was open to it in the future, so I didn't prod him further. He asked me to visit him for July 4th, so I did and I stayed at his place and we visited things and had fun, etc. 

After I came back, however, I tried texting him but he would only give me one word responses. It got to the point where when I sent him a text to try to talk to him the night before, he would send me a response the next day after work citing that he ""forgot to bring his phone to work"". I suspect that's a lie because I sent him that text message at like 6 pm, so he had plenty of time to respond before he went to work. When I asked him to skype yesterday (3 days after I left to go back home) he said he was busy watching a TV show instead. I was pretty frustrated at that point, so I confronted him about it and asked him why he kept blowing me off. He told me that since we talked a lot when we saw each other that  ""we didn't next to text all the time for awhile"". I don't feel like I was being unreasonable, I only sent him 1 text a day and backed off when he only gave me a one word response. But it's been 3 days and he still doesn't want to talk to me. All my other friends and their SOs don't have this type of communication problem, they seem to have no problem texting/talking to each other more than we do. I asked him if it had anything to do with him not wanting to be in a serious relationship in college, and we just agreed that we would talk about it tomorrow over skype.

So... I'm not really sure how to confront him about it. I don't mind NOT being in a serious relationship at the moment, but I want to know whether or not he is willing to get into one in the future. Also this is a really delicate issue because he is graduating next year we both don't know where we'll end up after graduation (he's a year above me). Honestly, I would be open to a temporary LDR for a year or two to see if maybe we can end up in the same place after graduation, but we'll see. Sorry about the stream of consciousness, I was just hoping to get some advice on how to broach the matter, or whether or not I'm being reasonable or not. I was thinking that if he tells me that he doesn't see a serious relationship with me, to just break up. :\ But I really don't want to do that... because I like him. Oh, and we haven't even said I love you to each other yet, which doesn't really bother me. 

TLDR; Dated guy for 8 months, doesn't want to text/talk when we're away from each other as much as I'd like, also not sure if he wants to be in a serious relationship with me eventually. Advice needed on whether or not my feelings and actions are justified. "

But I worked hard, got an internship, did a 6 month student capstone project, and I feel like I've gotten a pretty good taste of professional development.

So, why am I getting rejection emails every single day? I'm not even getting interviews, just ""Thanks for applying, but we're looking for someone else"". I've gotten some high profile interviews (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Intel, etc), but aside from the big dudes, I'm getting rejected every day. It's really starting to take it's toll on me. Maybe I should apply to non-dev roles.

2ac9jq,7,2014-07-10,"31/m - Mortgage background, useless degree, not sure what to do next",thealmightybrush,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ac9jq/31m_mortgage_background_useless_degree_not_sure/,"I am 31 years old and work for a mortgage company (one of the big bailout banks). I have been stuck in my current position on a project team for a few years now and can't seem to find a way to move up. I have no idea what to do next. Background:

- Went to college and blew it off/didn't take it seriously. Got a Bachelor's Degree in Communications - Theory &amp; Rhetoric. Didn't take my internship seriously and used hookup my uncle had at a radio station to intern there which wasn't even appropriate for my degree since it was a mass communications internship but my degree was meant for public relations/advertising. Couldn't find work in that field out of college and abandoned hope of ever doing so. No desire to even try now. Only went for that degree because I couldn't pick a direction and had fleeting interest in public relations.
- Worked as a personal banker for 2 years.
- Have worked now at mortgage company for 6.5 years; first few years were underwriting loan modifications. I was good at it and the pay was alright at the time (30k + monthly bonuses = 48k my best year). However I got bored and decided I needed some experience working with management to try to move up in the world, so I got a new position working on a project team. It was considered a lateral move but it actually pays LESS because it's just the base salary without the bonuses I had before (although because of yearly raises I am now up to 36k a year). I work in the bankruptcy department and I assist upper management in all sorts of things, but they won't promote me. I don't do anything too complex; I take spreadsheets and make updates to them in Excel and make Powerpoint Presentations. I feel my skills are stagnating. I'm not learning anything new to make me stand out. There is ONE huge perk to my current position, which is that it's work-at-home.

Where do I go from here? I don't really want to go back to school, at least not right now. I am 31 and married and own a house that I just bought a couple months ago and can now barely make ends meet. There are a few things I am interested in:

- Management within the financial industry: This is what I've been currently telling myself my career path is. But I'm stuck. And I'm wondering if it's even all that lucrative. Maybe I'm wasting my time.
- IT job? I would have to go to school or at least get some technical training, maybe through a free website like alison.com. I was thinking of learning SQL since I work with some people who use that a lot. Maybe I could be a database administrator? Even if I go to night school for the next couple years and get some little degree, though, not only will I not have any free time the next two years, but even if I get a better job I'll have student loans to pay for (I have no student loan debt currently as my parents paid for my Bachelor's Degree).
- I often daydream of owning my own business. I dream a lot about owning a bar. I have no business plan or investors and no savings, nor do I have any equity built up in my new home yet to get a home equity loan from. Is it even possible for me to get a business loan? Would it only be possible if I partner up with numerous others? This route is such a long shot that I'm just wasting space typing it, but hey, it's a dream.
- Also sometimes dream about being a teacher, but I'd have to go for a teaching certificate and I can't substitute teach to build up experience in the meantime due to my day job.

I know this post is super long and few people post here but I hope someone has read this and can give me a suggestion. I'm hopeless. People younger than me are passing me by and I can't take it anymore."
2acas5,1,2014-07-10,"How do I tell my friend [28M] that he's in an abusive relationship with a sociopath [F, unknown age]",acatisnotahome,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2acas5/how_do_i_tell_my_friend_28m_that_hes_in_an/,"So here's the thing. I had this really good friend I know since 2006, and he is kind of submissive in relationships, he is really naive. He normally withdraws from his friends when he is dating.

When he started dating this new girl, we were already a little distant, although he and my best friend were starting a business together. But then he just stopped talking to all of us and started avoiding his business partner and his work on the company. 6 months into the relationship, they were engaged. I thought it was strange but I did not know how deep it went.

Se started hearing rumors that she was crazy. Stories on how she threw fits in front of his friends, once she started screaming that he was hitting ver because he playfully slapped her arm while telling a joke. She is also insanely jealous and once threw a fit because he talked about a movie he saw in 2009, she angrily asked him who he had watched it with, and when he said his ex, she screamed at him and demanded to go home.

But it began escalating. As if it wasnt enough that he wasn't contributing to the company at all (I had to step in to fill his place or else it would definetely fail), she wouldn't approve of it because his partner (my best friend) was friends with his ex that he dated almost TEN YEARS AGO. They were starting a house design online store.

One day, this ex posted a photo of one of the products she bought from the store. My friend reposted it, she wasnt in the photo and there was no mention of it... And here's where it gets ugly:

At first, she demanded he deleted it. He did because he didn't want any fuss. Even after he did it, she went to his office and found him in a meeting with the other offices from the incubator.

She barged into the meeting and started screaming at him in front of everyone. When people tried to get her to get out, she attacked them. She hurt FIVE people that day. Bites, scratches and she pulled a lady's hair through the gate (after they carried ver outside) and made a huge bruise on her forehead. They obviously pressed charges and we all thought he would finally break up with her, he said he was desperate and he would fix it....

This happened on a thursday. On saturday he posted a photo of them at a beach resort! He acted like nothing happened, and when his partner talked to him about it, he decided to leave the company (right when it was supposed to start profiting).

The company is fine because we all helped his partner, and he is turning some great profit! But I am still worried. My other friends are so mad that they don't care anymore... But I can't help it. He needs help. He has the perfect personality for an enabler and he is very easily manipulated.

This girl is a med student, my husband is a doctor and we've heard at least 3 people say she was kicked out of different internship rounds and has ended up in the police station more than a few times.... But her parents always fix everything for her, they are rich and powerful.

He won't talk to any of us anymore, I was wondering if there is something I can send him that he can't help but think about his situation. They are about to get married and bought an apartment together. She is violent and I'm afraid she might escarlate eventually.

Sorry for the bad text and typos, I'm on my phone, broken computer and had to get this off my chest. Please help, have any of you ever dealt with this kind of situation sucessfully? An intervention is not an option since he won't talk to us, she forbids him...

**TL;DR:** friend is dating a batshit crazy and violent girl who has ended up in the station for aggression many times, including that of his business partner and 5 other strangers who were there. He won't talk to any of us and I need something to send/show him to make him realize she's abusive and dangerous."

2achqj,1,2014-07-10,Question about temporary insurance/registration,adamdevigili,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2achqj/question_about_temporary_insuranceregistration/,"Hey guys,

Have a bit of a situation my girlfriend and I ran in to. We drove down to Florida from New Jersey for an internship for me and summer university classes for her. We took her 2002 VW Passat, and all was well. She calls me yesterday saying there was a shit ton of smoke coming from the hood. I told her to pull over and wait for me. I got there and the scene didn't look good. A pool of oil was on the ground and whatever wasn't on the ground was all over her engine bay. The mecahanics diagnostic confirmed my fear, blown head gasket and in need of an engine rebuild....$4500, way more than what the car is worth. So the (only) real decision now is to buy a car for down here, not only for us to be able to get around, but we need a car to be able to get our stuff that we brought back to New Jersey once the summer comes to a close. We have a solid 3k budget and I see a ton of great A to B cars like Accords and Corollas that would be perfect, but my question arises with going about registering and insuring the new vehicle for only about a month. Is this possible? Will it be difficult or expensive to insure and register it in Florida and then bring it up to NJ and switch? Can I register/insure it in NJ all together? Please anyone who has any knowledge in this area chime in, it is greatly appreciated!

Thanks

TL; DR - Buying a car in Florida to be brought to NJ in a month, what should I do for registration/insurance?

Also, if anyone has been in this position or has good advice, what should be done with the Passat? We were thinking of just junking it as selling it would be time consuming. If we go this route, what should we take off the car before hand? It has brand new tires so we know to take them, but would the junker still take the car without tires? etc. "

To give you guys an idea:

I grad in the bottom of the recession. No one really wanted to hire somebody with really no experience.

We have a Citrix server that host most of our applications for users in the plant. The server had gone down that morning due to an insufficient amount of memory error.I shut it down and configured the virtual machine to allow more usage of the memory as I was trained to do. Then the real shit storm happend.

There is only 2 of us in the office today and I just got back to my desk when I get the first can.

Me:""It support center how can I help""

Me:""Oh so you need a password reset""

Drone 1:""No my password works fine""

Me:""okay so what's the problem?""

Drone 1:""What do I put in?""

At this point I realize he hasn't even attempted a login yet.

Me:""sir you just have to enter in your user name and password you use for everything else""

Every thing we use Syncs to our Active Directory so logins are the same for anything we use.

He hangs up and I look over and see we have 12 calls waiting.

I pickup the phone.

Might be a long one.",fuckit-throwaway302,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2adc38/ok_here_we_go_me_19m_missing_my_ex_19f_might_be_a/,"Alrighty /r/relationships, this has been rolling around in my head for weeks and I need some outside perspective. I dated this girl, let's call her Ellen, (first girlfriend) through out my senior year of high school and then we broke up (I initiated) towards the end of year. We were both moving away and A) long distance wouldn't have worked and B) we both had some growing up to do and C) somewhat related to A and B, the relationship was getting too serious. I took the year off from school and did an internship with a Church in another state, she started school. we broke up in April 2013 but it was one of those things where we broke up but didn't really separate. Eventually over the course of the the summer we drifted apart before it was time for us to leave. Looking back, I realize how strange and not normal that is, but it more or less ended well. 

I moved for the internship and being away from home, it was like a new world. I didn't think about her too much and we didn't talk that much. I had a short relationship with a girl, let's call her Erica, and my thoughts on relationships pretty much centered her for the majority of the year. Come this May, I had gotten over Erica and (completely unrelated) Ellen and I started talking a little more, one particular event that sticks out is a phone conversation we had. This was the first time we'd talked not over text since we had moved away from home. After we hung up, emotions hit me like a semi truck and I realized how much I miss her. Over the last couple months we've been texting a little more frequently and I feel like the missing the other person could be mutual. I am home for the summer but Ellen is living a few hours away in her college town.

Now to make things more complicated. During the year I was in my internship, I became really close friends with one of Erica's friends, let's call her Holly. No romantic feelings just a really really close platonic friendship. I was there for her through two break ups and some really challenging things she had to deal with. Any time I would have any kind of romantic thoughts about Holly they would be quickly dismissed. Roughly April I started to take those thoughts more seriously. But I knew nothing was going to happen, I was moving 500 miles away to home. I eventually told her, but I remain uncertain about how reciprocated or not those feelings are. Now recently, over the last couple weeks, it seems as though Holly has been dropping hints that maybe they are reciprocated to a certain extent. But the fact that I am 500 miles away hasn't changed. Even if I was around, I would be very very hesitant to pursue a relationship with her because of the risk to our friendship and yet, as the saying goes, good relationships come from good friendships.

**DOWN THE THE NITTY GRITTY**
Ellen is pretty much everything I want. We have similar taste in music, enjoy the same weird stuff and just genuinely have great chemistry. Holly and I have great friendship chemistry and share some common interests but I doubt we would be anywhere near as compatible as Ellen and I. Honestly at this point I really want to just say fuck it and tell Ellen how much I miss her and let what happens happen. BUT I'll be starting school in the fall and i don't know who I'm going to meet there... If I told Ellen I feel like it would go one of three ways. 1) we acknowledge we miss each other and see where things go knowing that the other person might meet someone else (but probably hoping that doesn't happen), 2) we get back together and just make long distance work, 3) I'm misinterpreting everything, she just wants to be friends and I make it really awkward.

Any advice?

2addth,78,2014-07-10,Tales from a small town public school - Computer lab Issues part 1,NeoShader,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2addth/tales_from_a_small_town_public_school_computer/,"Backstory: I worked summers at a school, and during the school year, as a tech internship for multiple hours a day. Our high school had a program to have ""tech classes"" for 5-10 students as basically help desk slaves. Which was awesome actually, and is how I started learning about technology beyond installing and playing Quake3 and Halo PC.

I get a ticket to go to the middle school, and take a look at the English rooms computer lab. Generally, the middle school teachers were pretty tech savvy, but this one, oh boy.

I enter the lab and ask what the problem is.

&gt;Teacher: Well, we got all these computers over the summer, and now we are ready to use them, but they won't turn on!

&gt;Me: Okay, I will take a look.

I assume that the power strips might of been flipped, or something similar so crawl under the tables and look. No power strips. In fact...no power cords or anything that looked like power.

I get up and look at the back of the computers on the tables. No cables. No power cables anywhere.

&gt;Me: Sooo, where are the power cables?

&gt;Teacher: Oh, we stacked them in a box and put them away. I heard we had wireless now.

&gt;Me: ...


This is only part one of many stories dealing with her, and plenty more from my school experience which I will try to post on a regular basis.

Some of the stuff in the job description is stuff I've done before, but it's with the kind of company I've never worked for before. I'm afraid I won't be able to talk well about my past experience and I have no idea how to talk well about myself or what kind of questions the person is going to ask me. I wish my Nparents hadn't demolished my self-confidence and given me depression and anxiety.

I'm also afraid because this job interview is for a similar position as the one I was just rejected for this morning. They want someone who knows social media and though I'm experienced with Twitter/Facebook/Pinterest/Instagram and currently use them in my internship, I'm afraid that won't be enough to convince the person. They also want someone to help with their blog and I've done three blogs before, but I'm afraid that won't be enough, either. "
2adjv3,6,2014-07-10,State Park job thoughts and process,[deleted],ParkRangers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkRangers/comments/2adjv3/state_park_job_thoughts_and_process/,"following some of the job-advice posts, I thought I'd add my .02 on here about State Park Rangers.

Why State over National Parks?

As a State Park Ranger you're knowledgeable about all things (though a master of none), with work responsibilities that vary daily. One nice thing about State positions is that although you'll of course be required to do many things, one can often focus on one area you like the most, be it law enforcement or park maintenance or interpretation. many Rangers will also transfer to parks which are the best fits for their own interests.

What Degree to get?

although a high-school degree is often all that a state requires, you should be getting a four-year degree. Environmental Education may be the most valuable of the bunch.

Certifications?

It is common for a Ranger to be hired on, and unlike National Parks, you're sent to BLET after you're hired. however, check with your local police department, as many will offer to sponsor your entry just without the offer of employment upon completion. You'd have a year upon completion to land a job or else you'll have to take BLET again.

Otherwise, an Environmental Education Certification is highly prized, as is CPR/AED/First Aid. After that, anything else helps, like NAI or Pesticide Applicator or Fire Suppression. Also, many states offer free certifications on general maintenance through the Job Service. And if you can, find a way to learn how to use general park tools like a chainsaw, zero-turn mower, tractor and blower, because you'll be asked if you know how to use them.

Sure, you'll be re-trained on most things during BLET, but these are to set you apart from every other schmo who has a Ranger-type college degree, too.

Best Entry Into the Job:

Most State Parks offer summer employment, which of course pay just about nothing. Aim for the highest-paid summer-only position because it will carry the most responsibility, but not surprisingly, these positions are difficult to land. But accept any position you can land within the park and you should be able to move up in responsibility from there once you prove yourself. However, expect to spend a good few years as a summer-only employee before you land your first full-time job.

Advantage of Summer-only Employment:

The position is basically like your internship. Better than any book research, you'll have the chance to see what Rangers do on a daily basis to get to know if it's something you're interested in. You get your foot in the door, and you can bet that if you're a finalist for a full-time position, your boss is going to get a call about you. A glowing work review will go a heck of a long way to securing full-time work.

What is Expected of Summer-only Employment?

Depending on your Rangers, many full-time staffmembers hope summer workers just don't make anything worse. The work itself isn't hard, whether you're selling day passes or picking up trash. Just work your tail off. It's hot outside? Better to move very slowly than to sit down and take a break. Have your cigarette at lunch but not during work hours. Don't take credit for other peoples' work and don't speak negatively of anyone. Rangers are trained to notice you before you notice them, so hard work will be seen and appreciated without you having to point it out. And show up to work 15 minutes early every day.

More Job Entry:

One tough part about landing a State Park Ranger job is that you have to pass through two very different levels of people to land the job: HR and then the Director/Head Ranger.

Human Resources often has this idea that Park Rangers spend all day skipping through sunny fields of clover with children in tow, teaching them about nature. Thus, you need to show your expertise in Interpretation. You should be going to the local Wildlife Center to volunteer to give presentations, or volunteering to do so at your local municipal park. Do anything you can to get this experience, as you won't get far in the application process without it.

The Boss? Sure, he cares about education and interpretation, too. But he also wants to know if you know how to work. Here, previous research about the park you're applying to is vital. You'll be able to tell if the park is visitor-heavy and so needs law enforcement people, or if it is interpretation-heavy, etc.

The Interview:

It can be to your advantage that State Park interviews are often structured. You may well get 80% of the same questions from one interview to the next. You may well blow the first interview, but take good notes when they ask you questions so that you can study your answers for the next time and better understand the process.\

Though you'll be submitting your resume and cover letter when you apply online, don't expect them to be read. Be detailed about the information you include in your formal application. For example, list every specific tool you know how to use instead of saying merely ""general maintenance equipment."" Many HR Departments score applications on a point scale, so vague and general wording may not score well. If you have experience in one of the required items, write it word-for-word in your application just as they have it in the job post. And when you sit down for an interview, the Hiring Rangers may not have been forwarded your application, so be sure to have copies of your resume for them, but still be specific when you give your answers in case they have rules as to how they can write down your answer. For example, ""I went to college"" does not technically mean you graduated, so say ""I have a BS Degree from XYZ."" 

And do not be picky about which Park you apply to. Apply to them all. You can always transfer to a preferred one at a later point. Even unpopular parks will get 250 applications for a position, meaning you're probably up against 50+ qualified applicants. So don't be dismayed if it takes a while to land that first interview. But once you do, you can be more confident that you've become a marketable candidate going forward."

2adlh9,2,2014-07-10,Internship at a medical marijuana company?,Xozorion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2adlh9/internship_at_a_medical_marijuana_company/,"I'm going into my soph year of undergrad as a CS major/business minor. After my freshman year I didn't know enough to score a relevant &amp; worthwhile internship, so this summer I've been digging into programming and working 2 menial labor jobs to make money. 

Last week, my 34yo cousin offered me a paid internship at his medium-sized medical marijuana dispensary &amp; grow-op for next summer.  According to my cousin, my work duties would consist of helping him out with basic IT &amp; ""tech stuff"" (dude is hopelessly tech-illiterate) along with building him a new website and social media presence. Being a marijuana connoisseur myself, I've also thought about developing him a customized and simple app for inventory / grow management. 

Post graduation, I would like to work in ""big tech""/Fortune 500 company if for no other reason than to score a decent job until I'm both willing and financially able to move into entrepreneurship/startups. As you can probably guess by now, my main concern is that in the future anti-pot corporate conservative types will immediately toss my resume in the trash for working at a company growing the Devils Lettuce.

TLDR How would interning at a medical marijuana company ""look"" to future employers? especially those at Fortune-500 type companies?

Thanks for your help.

2adnst,2,2014-07-10,Need a advice - CS graduate student,alberteinstein1905,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/2adnst/need_a_advice_cs_graduate_student/,"I am doing my masters in CS. I have 2 years of experience in working for a IT services company. The reason why I left that job to do my masters is because I felt the job was not that challenging and also I want to work for a world famous company like Amazon, MSFT etc. After having read their interview process I felt I am not upto the mark. To put my place in perspective I as of now cannot even solve a round 1 coding challenge in Google code jam (If I can it will take at least 2-3 hours with googling). I just got a call from Amazon and Google for FT employment. I am afraid of even doing one. I applied for companies which I think I can clear their interview but they are not calling me. I did not get an internship offer. While I saw all of my friends got internship in good software companies that did not even ask for a technical coding interview! (Very good software companies!). Because of this my confidence is very low. 

Question 1: Can anyone advice me on how to proceed? 

Short profile
- MS in CS at a state univ
- ~1.5 years of exp as software developer for IT service company
- A good web developer of LAMP stack
- Active in github

I am not very good at interviews, but if I am asked to do a web application I can do it very well. 

Question 2: Are there any companies that select based of previous experience and projects rather than 5-6 rounds of difficult algorithmic interviews?"
2adpsd,5,2014-07-10,I'm worried that being honest with my doctor will prevent her from taking me seriously.,bluestreak27,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2adpsd/im_worried_that_being_honest_with_my_doctor_will/,"I'm a 22 year old senior in college and am becoming more and more concerned that I may have ADD/ADHD issues. I've always been a very active and social person, high school was a breeze, and my college grades have been in the B-ish range for the past couple years. However, the older I get the more I'm realizing that I work differently than most people, and am afraid with more life responsibilities coming my way that I may not handle them well.
 
 There are many reasons why I'm worried I have issues:
     
-I've never been the type who can knock out homework in a few hours. I can never keep focused enough to knock out whole assignments at once. I have to start work way in advance and work on it for maybe an hour or so at a time multiple times.
   
-At work I'll have an idea to work on something, but always burn out and lose focus after 10-15 minutes and have to move on to something else. That or I'll get caught up in a detail and forget why I started the project in the first place. There have been times where I'll start a project and forget that I had started the same thing a few days ago and never finished.
   
-I've always been someone with a lot of stress and anxiety. I have mood swings, get very irritable with others, and have moments where I just need to get away from people. I think a lot of this comes from a constant sense of underachievement that leads to a big lack of confidence. 
     
-When it comes to reading I can get through maybe 20 pages and lose all focus even on a book I really want to read. 
   
-I bounce around from checking my phone, email, looking around and needing to walk around all the time which leads to a lack of concentration. I often start things and then think of a million other things that I want to do (clean, go to the gym, cook a healthy dinner, practice guitar, read) and then give up because I don't think I'll ever get it done. This is much better early in the mornings but after lunch it goes downhill quick.
  
-I do like to work out and eat healthy most of the time which has helped me mentally, but still I end up drinking a lot of caffeine (~5 cups a day) and consider myself a heavy drinker.  I have read from this sub and other sources that mood issues and overuse of other substances are a sign of adult add/adhd.

I mentioned some of this casually at my last check-up but my doctor basically shut me down immediately and wouldn’t give me the time of day because I had done pretty well in school. I really want to talk to a professional but here’s the kicker…Around junior year of college I would casually take my friend’s adderall when studying for exams, writing papers, and have an overwhelming amount of school on top work. This isn’t something I’m proud of but I can’t say I regret it because it made me feel more in control and I actually starting getting A’s which I felt my work ethic deserved. I’m afraid to tell a doctor this because I don’t want to seem like some lazy drug seeking college kid just trying to get a prescription. I don’t really want to be on medication, but I’m terrified that I might actually have an issue and what that could hold me back from in life (I currently have an internship which I’m worried they may not make me a full time offer for some of these reasons). I guess any advice on how to overcome this anxiety/if it sounds like I’m just being overdramatic would be much appreciated.

TL;DR I am a fairly successful college student with increasing fears of ADHD issues, however I am terrified to seek real help because I’ve casually used a buddy’s Adderall during times of high stress.

2advh0,5,2014-07-10,So recently i got diagnosed with depression...,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2advh0/so_recently_i_got_diagnosed_with_depression/,"After a decade of feeling like shit i gathered the strenght and saw a psychiatrist, and here i'm, a 23 y/o depressed dude in my second week of taking meds and feeling that i failed at life. I feel that i failed in every possible scope: academic, professional, social, etc. 


I'm struggling to finish my BS in Computer Science, i have always been a straight A student but i never really liked studying anything, i believe that i only got good grades since elementary school because i studied at lousy instutitions. I can't find motivation to do my research paper. During high school, my father suggested that i took a technical course in informatics and so i did. The same thing happened with university. He never forced me, but since i didn't (and still don't)  know what i want to do of my life i went with the flow. 

I work at a small company as a web developer but i feel stagnated there. There really is no oportunity to grow, the work is kinda boring and most things are done half-assed at the company, which is really demotivating. This is my first job (i started there 3 years ago as an intern). I reddit all day there but still manage to finish my activities, but i know i'm not even remotely close to being productive. The idea of job hunting is excruciating, i don't know how to network so i can only count on my qualifications to find another job, which i don't believe are enough to get into a big company. I have no confidence in my skills. I will never be successfull, when my father pass away i don't know if i'll be able to sustain myself, i live in a third wolrd country and the pay is shitty. I wish i was as successful as I always heard i was going to be from teachers, classmates and family because of how well i did at school.


I'm not a social being but when i'm alone i want to be with other people and when i'm with other people i want to be alone because social interactions drain my energies. I have never had a girlfriend, never even had the courage to ask a girl out. I already had opportunities to kiss girls at parties but I was always a coward and never went for it. I have no self confidence, i believe i have no attractive traits and I have the conviction that i will die alone and miserable. When i go to parties I get super drunk because that's the only way i'm able to function at them, i end up doing and saying drunk stuff and dancing like crazy, i've never kept in touch with anyone that i met at a party. I have a group of friends since elementary school, but they are the ones that normally start interactions, always inviting me to parties and other stuff. I think they keep in touch with me because they think my weird and goofy behaviour is funny. I should feel grateful for having a bunch of friends because i'm really a boring and uninteresting person. Most of the awesome things i did (rock climbing, rafting, paintballing, kart racing,etc) was because of them. Even though we know each other for so long i don't open myself with them, i keep this image of a funny and tough guy(maybe that's why it took so long for me to try seeing a doctor).


I don't have a good relationship with anyone in my family. I live with my aunt since my grandmother died almost 2 years ago. She invited me because she didn't want to live there alone and i accepted because my house was small and my parents are always fighting and it always got on my nerves pretty easily. 


I have no hobbies. I spend my free time reading books/comics, gaming, watching movies/series because i need to occupy my mind or i will fall in a spiral of self depreciative thoughts. I tried learning an instrument, tried getting better at coding, learning another language (besides my native and english), but i wasn't able to stick with anything.


I feel like shit because there are so many people around the world that don't have opportunities in life while i had so many and i fucked up them all and i will probably keep screwing up until none is left. 


Well, this is enough bitching for a night.

To put my place in perspective I as of now cannot even solve a round 1 coding challenge in Google code jam (If I can it will take at least 2-3 hours with googling). I just got a call from Amazon and Google for FT employment. I am afraid of even doing one. I applied for companies which I think I can clear their interview but they are not calling me. I did not get an internship offer. While I saw all of my friends got internship in good software companies that did not even ask for a technical coding interview! (Very good software companies!). Because of this my confidence is very low. 

Question 1: Can anyone advice me on how to proceed? 

Short profile
- MS in CS at a state univ
- ~1.5 years of exp as software developer for IT service company
- A good web developer of LAMP stack
- Active in github

I am not very good at interviews, but if I am asked to do a web application I can do it very well. 

Question 2: Are there any companies that select based of previous experience and projects rather than 5-6 rounds of difficult algorithmic interviews?"

I'm an upcoming sophomore at USC majoring in CS. Things have been going well -- got good grades, 3.75 GPA, and was fortunate enough to land a sweet internship in the tech industry, and overall I'm content as an engineer. 

Now, you can call this overconfidence or naivety, but despite all that, I've always wanted to be a doctor and go to med school. Is it too late to start taking General Chem classes, Bio, O-Chem, etc..? How would I go about trying to get experience in the medical field over the summer despite needing experience in the CS industry on top of that?

Or am I just trying to tackle too many things at once? Any help is appreciated.

2adyp6,2,2014-07-10,Harmful to career to take two years off from doing clinical work?,[deleted],socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/2adyp6/harmful_to_career_to_take_two_years_off_from/,"I am a BSW student about to start my senior year. I work two jobs at the moment. My full time job is at a mental health day program where I run psycho-educational groups and maintain a caseload. My part time job is at a private practice clinic where I do quality assurance for their substance abuse program, auditing charts and the like where I have zero actual client contact.

I have become increasingly dissatisfied with my full time job, the caseloads and workload are high (I have 21 clients on my caseload and run on average 15 groups a week) I love the clients I work with, and I enjoy running groups but I feel like it is just too much to handle, between school and my other job. I also have a pretty crappy supervisor, who treats me like an idiot because I'm not a licensed clinician (the only one at my office who isn't). 

My part time job has the potential to become a full time job, my supervisor there is willing to take me on full time to do other clerical/administrative tasks in addition to my QA work.

My real issue with this is would it be harmful to my career to not be doing clinical work directly with clients for the next two years at least. My only clinical work will be my internship to complete my BSW and the one I will have to do in grad school.

I have a bit over three years experience working in a clinical position, will it look better to stick it out at my current full time job where I spend most of my time working directly with clients? It's stressful, but I feel I can manage, it will have its ups and downs but I need to take into consideration my future and I don't want to set myself back since I am already an adult student (I'm 30.) I feel like it would be better to stick with my full time job as is, because by the time I finish school I will have been there for 5 years and leaving my job after I have my MSW could be easily explained to prospective employers that there were no opportunities for advancement upon completing my degree, as there is no guarantee that there will be an open therapist position after I graduate.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"

I'm currently still in school and just completed an internship at a Big 4 company.  Last summer I worked for Google and loved it and the previous summer I worked for a smaller company and still enjoyed it.

However, finishing internships has been a _relief_ to me and I can't imagine working 40-50+ hour weeks.  12 to 14 weeks has been my limit and I'm scared to enter the working force fulltime.  I feel like I've had a good taste of what working is like from my internships.

Is grad school the path for me?  Should I try it? I think I'd really enjoy being able to research from anywhere I wanted and then go into teaching.  I do have a somewhat low GPA (above 3.0 but not 3.5) because I got really depressed from a death in the family (so hopefully it'd get overlooked)... but before that I had around a 3.9.

I think I'd be happy at a job where I could wake up at noon and then put in my 8-9 hours from home or somewhere else.

Should I go to graduate school? Are there jobs I should be looking for?  What else is out there?

This morning I posted about feeling crappy.  I took it slow, took some ibuprofin and called in late to work.  I got to work late and found the rest of my field team burned out and tired too.  I knew they were just as sore as me. It's been a rough week for them too.  I'm a field biologist and I have college kids who work with me during the summer for research internships.

So we did some work in the heat and humidity, then decided we'd take a long lunch and go swimming because there is a small pond near one of our sites.

Then shit got crazy.  On hot days we can swim in a shallow rocky pond a short walk from the car.  At first, I was the only one swimming.  I was floating on my back, looking at the oak trees and enjoying finally relaxing after a rough morning.  The other two guys were just eating lunch on the shore.  Then one of my students decide to wade in and swim too.  He gets in the area that's like neck deep next to me.  After no less than 5 seconds his head went under water and he was flailing really slowly.  At first I thought he was just screwing with me, but after about 15 seconds I knew something was wrong.  I grabbed him to see if he was ok.  His head came up for a second and he gasped for air and coughed.  HOLY CRAP ARE YOU DROWNING?!  Eagle Scout Survival Mode switched on and I grabbed his arm and pulled him to the shallow water and got him on his feet.  He was really dazed.  Apparently he hit his toe on a rock, panicked,sucked down a bunch of water and went under.  ""Did I just save your fucking life?""  ""Yes.""  What?!  

I saved someone's life today. 

Afterwards I asked him, ""You said you've been swimming before.  What happened?""  He then tells me hes never swam in a pond before, only a deep indoor pool (wtf dude, why wouldn't you say that) and cant tread water or float on his back (double wtf).  I was both angry and relieved.  At least he's ok.  If I wasn't there he would have been in serious trouble.  It is just a pond in the middle of the woods.  Nobody else was in the water near us but me.

""Ok."" I say to myself ""So today we had a close call, I'm tired, they're tired.  Let's call it a day after lunch and just do some safe labwork.""  We stopped to get some coffee/soda on the way back and start talking about all our close calls with death.  We talk about some bucket list things too.  My younger student, who I had just saved from the pond, says that he has never seen the ocean.  (TRIPLE WTF.  We are in New England, 30 minutes from the Atlantic ocean and some of the most famous seashores in the world!?).  

""That's it.  We're going to show you the ocean.""

We drive down the highway to the ocean, park the car, and walk along the beach for a few minutes.  I made this guys' *year*.  He took pictures with his cell phone and was catching hermit crabs like a kid.  Some college kids here almost never leave the campus except to go home or visit NYC/Boston with some friends.  I was happy to do it.  We head back to wrap up for the day.

Of course, Karma being the bitch that it is, my car starts acting up immediately.  My battery light comes on when I start the car to go back to the college.  About 15 minutes down the highway, my AC craps out.  Poop.  Oh well.  Windows down.  Then all of a sudden my tacometer redlines ""RERHRHRHRHRHHR""   WHAT NOW?!  The car is stuck in 2nd gear on the mother-flipping highway.  I go down to 30 miles an hour and put my hazard lights on.  When I put the hazards on, everytime they blink, the dashboard craps out and I can't tell what speed, RPM, gas, gear... anything is.  Then when they hazards blink off, the needles fly back up a again.  My entire dashboard looks like a mother fucking clock from Alice in Wonderland.  The engine sputters more so I pull over in a parking lot.  I try to start the car again.  Dead.

One of my guys calls AAA to get the car towed.  The cell service is shitty so it takes like 4 tries and since it's getting late we know it will be a while.  Eventually the tow truck comes and we have to push the car to a spot that the tow truck can lift it.  Oye ve.  While we are waiting for the tow truck, I called my wife to give a lift to my students to bring them back to campus. [ She's the best ]

Anyways, I decided to go with my crapped out car and the tow truck.  I go to get in the tow truck, and the driver is on the phone.  I wait and when he gets off the phone he has this soul-crushing look on his face.  I figure he's pissed at me.  ""He you wanna get going, you don't have to wait for us.  Whatever is easier for you man.""  ""I pretty much don't fucking care what happens now."" He says.  Yikes.  This guy is really upset.  I reply.  ""Is everything ok?""  

He proceeds to tell me that his closest friend is on his death bed after a car accident and is in critical condition now.  I try my best to console the guy, but he's a complete stranger after all.  We start driving off and I get him to change the subject to me, and he asks about my work.  His mood improves and he actually impresses me with some really great knowledge of ecology.  He asked better questions about my research than some of my students, lol.  I think I cheered him up and helped take his mind off his friend for a while.  He told me how he heard that some forest fires are started by beetle outbreaks in Wyoming.  Neat.  I never knew that (he is right btw).  All shapes and sizes, right?

I got the car towed home (I can fix it, I think...)  I decided to have a nice Mexican dinner with my wife.  I told her about my day, including my downright awful drinking dream the night before.  When I was describing how scary the dream was, I said that I feel like I'm *afraid* of drinking now.  I didn't realize this change had happened until tonight.  I am scared of what might happen to me if I drink again.  That's what my drinking dream signifies. 

It's not that I'm afraid of drinking.  I don't say ""Gah, it's a beer, run.""  It's a fear like fear of unnecessary risk.  *I see drinking now like 'normal people' see heroin.*  If someone offered it to me I'd be terrified to use it.  I know how dangerous it is and how much damage it can cause.  

Today was just... today was one of those days.  

Edit:  I accidentally spelled Tachometer as ""Tacometer"". I regret nothing. The tacometer should exist.

2aec09,5,2014-07-11,[22/F] My boyfriend's(22/m) family seems to not like me anymore. Is there anything I can do? (wall of text coming),Cumble,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2aec09/22f_my_boyfriends22m_family_seems_to_not_like_me/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 8 months now and it has been going strong. However, we did have a few bumps in the road around the 6th month mark BUT we were able to fix things. Basically my boyfriend was getting stressed over trying to balance an internship, a relationship, and family life. We were both stressed over making things balance for both of us and it caused us to get into some heated arguments over the phone and in person. Even so, we were able to work things out now we are happy and having a lot of fun times together. Now his family always seemed to like me and always welcomed me, but they are a tight nit family and basically family has always come first no matter what. This is fine but it has caused issues in the beginning where my boyfriend and I would make plans in advance but at the last minute he would have to cancel them to go pick up something for his parents or something of that sort. Even so we have been working together on that and things have been getting easier. I guess they never really understood exactly why my boyfriend wanted to do things a lot with me and it would boggle their minds almost. However, they have been more accepting over time. Now I don't want people to think his parents are mean or anything because they aren't. They've always been super nice to me and welcoming. 

However, the issue is after the couple weeks of arguing over things and them hearing us talk on the phone has caused them to suddenly not be so welcoming towards me. They think now I'm just some added stress in his life and that i'm not supportive enough towards him. Which isn't true because I've always tried to be there for him and was helping him study for a big test to get this internship. Now I never really feel welcome in there home and I seem to always kind of get the cold shoulder from them. Even his younger sister (16 and who used to enjoy talking to me) is very cold towards me and anytime my boyfriend and I pick her up from school she's really kind of rude towards me. Now this all really hurts me  because I've always been super nice towards his family and I think it's really unfair that they've made it sound like I'm the one who is causing problems and causing stress with everything even though honestly it's just something between the boyfriend and I and we both recognize we have stuff we both need to work on. I don't think his parents are mean but I just have this feeling they aren't incredibly understanding in these situations. 

I guess i'm just kind of tired of feeling unwelcome at his home and wish to do something about it. However, I have no idea how to go about this and even though my boyfriend has talked to them they really don't seem to want to let up.Is there anything I can do? Or is this something that will have to just be fixed with time and distancing from the family? Honestly it just makes it difficult because I feel like it's his WHOLE family (aunts, uncles, etc.) that seems to weirdly dislike me now because they are usually together a lot. It just really both hurts and bothers me and makes things awkward for me when I go to his home. "

But I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, and this is driving me up the wall!  
  
Anyway, backstory time. My friend (who we'll call Casey) became friends with a girl online she'd met (who we'll call Hannah) five years ago, and they started dating for about two. They live 800+ miles away from one another, so they barely see each other in person and rely on texting and video calls to meet with one another. My friend Casey has always had trouble relating to other people, but when she does, she feels the need to butt into their lives and try controlling it. She doesn't mean anything harmful by it; she's just trying to help other people in what she feels is the best way. She's a college student doing a double major and a minor and balancing multiple jobs on top of that, so she's always been busy and (in my opinion) overachieving to reach her lofty goals. Not to mention, she's pretty much got her whole professional life thought out...she's very much a go-getter. Hannah, however, I know very little about, but I do know that she's three years older than Casey, and she lives with a rather emotionally abusive father and a few siblings. She never really gets out of that house much, either. From what I've been told from Casey, Hannah doesn't have much of a desire to leave that household and enjoys simply doing the menial work her dad gives to her. She's a high school dropout, and she's been involved in some rather sketchy relationships and abusive during the time Casey has known her (before they started dating).  
  
Casey, in what she feels is right, has been trying to help Hannah move on from her current life, with much reluctance from Hannah. She's gotten Hannah jobs outside of what her father makes her do, she's making her attend an online college, and she's coaxing her into making stable relationships with other people outside of her family. I feel like this is a rather helpful and kind thing to do, but its also been the source of a few arguments and a temporary breakup between them. In Hannah's point of view, she doesn't seem to understand why she would need to move on from where she is in her life. She loves her father and doesn't mind doing his work for him. She doesn't seem to care that she doesn't really have an education or friends other than people she's met online. So she's been rather hostile to Casey trying to make her change. Most recently, Casey got Hannah to join a program in a town close by to her where she works a part time job and gets to take a few college classes for free. Once Hannah got into the program, her dad kicked her out of the house, and she's been staying at a friend's in the mean time before the program begins. During all of this happening, Casey has been overseas at an internship and wasn't talking to her much.  
  
Yesterday, Casey got drunk and, apparently, said something along the lines of ""if you just want to end it, then say so"", to which Hannah took seriously and broke up with her. She blames Casey for essentially making her homeless, and says that they're incompatible and their dreams for the future are far too varied to ever work. Casey has been continually talking it over with her since, but she hasn't gotten Hannah to change her mind yet.  
  
During this whole relationship, I've basically been Casey's confidante. She's always come to me for advice, which I've found silly since I've never been in a relationship myself. Hell, I've never even had a crush on anyone before. Yet Casey doesn't really have many people she trusts, so I'm the best she can get. In any case, I've always been supportive of her, but in my head I keep telling myself that the relationship will never last and there's no point to trying to help. I'm not entirely sure Casey is really, truly in love with her; she's in love with the idea of being in love, and Hannah was willing to go along with that. But Casey desperately wants to have a perfect Disney-esque romance. I've tried telling her that that just was never going to happen in real life, but she ignored me and went about trying to force a perfect relationship (hence being controlling). Just as always, she's asking me for support during this breakup, but all I can think is that this relationship is poisonous for both of them and she needs to get out of it while she's still free to do so. Actually, I feel like Hannah's pretty much got it right; they're just not meant to be with each other. I'm not sure how to tell her that though, or if I should even tell her that at all.  
  
Am I a bad friend for secretly being happy every time they have a misfortune together? Is it bad that I don't want them to succeed, because I think they aren't right for each other? I want to be helpful to my friend and do what's best for her, but I don't want to tell her to leave this relationship behind just because I think it's bad. In any case, I really needed to write all of this down. It's mentally helping me sort out my own feelings here."

How should I go about asking for this?,indoordinosaur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aeez0/i_feel_like_i_needdeserve_a_raise_but_im_an/,"So I've been working in this payment processing/e-commerce company as a helpdesk guy since November, it's basically an internship to become a sysadmin. Anyways, since I'm about to graduate with a CS degree in 6 months I asked about a position doing what I really wanted to do which was .NET programming with their software dev people. I performed well as a helpdesk guy and the engineers and managers I will be working with all know me and I feel like I've made a pretty good impression. I've been making $15/hour and was expecting a raise to $18 (that's my peers got after working 6 months or so) but our Director of the internal IT services department left the company right around the time I would've been getting mine so it never came around.

Now my my friend/coworker who started at helpdesk a few months before me and getting $18/hour a few months ago moved over to being a software dev intern exactly as I will be soon. He has been doing real QA work for the group and will soon be writing code. When he moved over he tried to ask for a raise but they wouldn't give it to him and just kept him the same as what he was making already. I wouldn't mind $18/hour but $15 seems low to me and I'm worried they'll just try to keep me at the same wage. A few months ago I went and interviewed with a different company (before I knew I'd be getting to do software dev here) and was offered $22/hour to intern but I didn't take it due to commute distances.

Should I tell them that I was offered $22 somewhere else? Should I let on that I know my co-worker is doing the exact same thing as me at a higher wage? Or do I just have no bargaining power as an intern?

I'm miserable. I have no right to be, yet I am. I have an amazing family that loves me dearly, an amazing internship at an awesome tech company, I've got books, video games, friends, and just can't stop feeling like shit.

Elementary and middle school were fucking terrible. I had no social awareness and it showed. The few memories I have of that time were getting left out of teams, not getting a turn on the swings, getting ganged up on to prevent me from playing games, etc. I stuck to myself and had no friends outside of half of my cub scout troop (the other half taunted me when no one was around).

Middle school was a nightmare. I spent my first two days bawling my eyes out wanting to leave. I'm not sure if I was homesick or just hated change, but I needed to leave. After a while, my parents got my a psychologist. I don't recall much of that time, but I do know that after seeing her for a while, I was fine at school. I even got friends that I spent recess and lunch talking to.

High school started out terribly. I was used to putting up a facade and hiding my real self because my real self was a hyper, under-aware, socially awkward kid. However, I got into marching band in high school and, somehow, got it into my head that these were my people. So, I let my guard down. I sprinted around, spun in circles, talked a lot, and made people annoyed. I was known by many as ""The Asshole Kid"" (to my face, even (not sure if that's good or bad)).

Eventually, I start hearing people ask if it grows back. I had no idea what they were talking about for a while, but then I remembered: our cub scout troop went to an outside group (agency? company?) for **The Talk** (toward the end of elementary school). Essentially, it was six, hour-long sessions to learn about Our Changing Bodies. I asked the question ""Does the penis grow back after sex?"" I thought it popped off and became the baby. I was told no. I felt comfortable asking this, since it was in complete confidentiality. I was wrong.

The kid apologized after his mom told him to, so whatever. The rest of school was better, and I even became drum major. Everyone in the band loved me, with one calling me Jesus and almost worshiping me. The secret to success was to never have an opinion about anything. By remaining neutral and not speaking up, everyone thought 
I was on their side.

Jeez, this is long. Thanks for sticking around so far, but there's more.

College was the worst. I spent the first month, month-and-a-half being incredibly homesick. I stayed holed up in my room and did not want to be a part of the school. Eventually, my dorm found me and dragged me into the light again. I even started dating a fantastic girl for over a year. It should have ended before then, though, as I started losing interest, but did not want to upset her by breaking up (I realize how stupid this sounds, but it was my first (and only) relationship so far.

I could talk for paragraphs more, but I want to wrap this up before I lose the will to hit submit. Basically, I want another relationship, another chance to feel close to someone, another chance to get things right (or at least less wrong). I tried approaching girls in my dorm, but one rejected me on the spot, and the other two rejected me  after the first date. I want love, but I have no idea how to go about finding it. Any advice/help/thoughts appreciated, and thanks for listening.

Some background: I work for a small company that troubleshoots energy monitoring systems connected to home networks. I am a computer science student that worked this summer IT job due to my lack of motivation to get a stereotypical internship at large software company X. Saying that my job of setting up wifi adapters, power cycling hardware, and being the omniscient being of tech knowledge for an office ‘easy’ would be the understatement of the decade… It pays well so w/e

So I arrived at work the other day only to find that I had nothing to do until 2pm. As I was starting my daily ritual of creating an epic playlist to listen to while I entered an endless pile of forms into our database, I received a call from a customer who needed help connecting his system to the cloud. I breathed a sigh of relief as I knew I could go out to an easy service call and escape an office filled with a plethora of PMSing females. I grabbed my backpack of troubleshooting goodies and dove into the nearest company vehicle.

As I arrived on site, I knew that going to the front door would be difficult since I had no clue where the hell it was. (Sidenote: I live in a  part of the world where houses are so old, so heavily modified with single wall add ons, and are used by four generations of family members that houses become a labyrinth of gates, patios, dog runs, yards, car ports, sheds, and decks. Needless to say, finding the main entrance used by the residing group of homo sapiens becomes a feat of human ingenuity. It's times like these when I laugh my ass off when people ask me where the bathroom is in my two room apartment.)

After cleverly unlatching 3 gates, shimmying a side yard, and crossing a dogshit filled slab, I could only deduce that I had arrived at the front door as evidenced by there being a pile of shoes on the ground in front of the door. Unsurprisingly there was no doorbell to alert the customer that I had arrived at his fine place of residence (not that they ever work anyway when they are there). I then resort to the trusty knock that humans have been using for hundreds of years.  Knowing the immense size/complexity of this house, and the distance it spans, I start off with a very firm three pound knock. After waiting as long as my patience could stand, I gave the door a shattering trio of knocks that would wake up even the deepest of sleep behind three closed doors. After hearing only the buzzing of flies encircling the mounds of dogshit behind me, I could only conclude that the customer was not home even though I told him I would be there only an hour previously.

I then pulled out my phone and gave him a ring…

&gt; Derp: Hello?

&gt; Me: Hi this is tech herp, I am outside right now, could you let me in so I can get access to your router?

&gt; Derp: I am on vacation right now but you should be able to get in.

O god please don’t make me break into your house…

&gt; Me: I don’t think I can help you since you are not home.  Could we reschedule when you get back?

&gt; Derp: Arggg!! I installed this system blah blah lots of money blah blah can you just fix it?

&gt; Me: Ummm, fine…, how do you want me to get in?

&gt; Derp: If you go around back you should be able to get into the unlocked laundry room. Blah blah blah

So to shorten this monstrosity of a post I end up talking with this customer on how to break into his house. As simple as he made it sound in the beginning, I ended up having to:

- Retrace my steps out three gates and side yards
- Unlock a combination gate by trying a dozen codes
- Scale a rusty sheet metal filled backyard
- Disable a home alarm system
- Search a bunch of pots for a key
- Ram open a jammed door
- Scale piles of shit filling nearly every room in his house

I've heard that I should start applying early (Fall 2014?), even if I'm only going to be available to work May 2015. Both my internships were as software engineer, but a few other roles also look interesting, namely product/program manager and data scientist. Is it possible to ask a company to consider you for software engineer, PM, and data scientist all at once, or does that look bad?


I am familiar with data structures/algorithms (thank you, college courses) and have coded a lot in Java/Python (thank you, CS assignments). But I still feel unprepared. I've looked over Coding the Crack Interview but I didn't find anything too hard. **What should I do in the meantime to prepare? And what are some generally good tips for CS job searching?** "

I'm a 23 year old guy who currently weighs 99kgs (5 feet 5 inches in height). I've tried losing weight before, but have somehow now succeeded.

On numerous occasions in the past, I went to the gym for around a month and even stopped myself from eating junk; however, after a small period, I always go back to being my old self and thus, never lose weight. I generally eat more than an average person, but don't have an eating problem. I am extremely lethargic though, and lack a lot of willpower to lose weight, and I'm really disappointed in myself for it. My stamina is pretty low (I can only sprint for 45 seconds max), and my body is just not used to hardcore exercises.

I'm planning to get an internship in Europe and will be shifting there in around 5-6 months. Before that, I'm really hoping to get myself fitter. I want to feel good about myself whenever I look in the mirror. I'm a decently funny guy, but my weight really downs my self-esteem. I know for a fact that no girl wants to date a fat guy, no matter how good he is on the inside (experienced that on a few occasions).

Today, I rejoined the gym and have just come back from an hours worth of exercise. I'm again going to stop eating junk food (pizzas, burgers, etc.); however, I am clueless on what exactly I need to do to lose some weight. If anyone can help guide me to figure out a proper diet plan/exercise schedule (considering my stamina, lethargy, etc.), it'd be splendid. I could really use all the help I need.

P.S Some additional information about me

Right now, I'm working from home and preparing for getting an internship, so I have plenty of flexible time to work around my exercise.

I'm from India. My daily eating habits include having lunch at around 1.30 PM, some random snack at 6-7ish and then dinner at 9.30pm. I can't make my dinner any sooner than that."

I'm a Canadian studying Computer Science in a [Russell group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group) school in the UK. I'm looking at making a move to an Ivy League school to study **Financial Engineering** , **Quantitative Finance**  or **Computational Finance** at Graduate Level (Masters).

My end goal is to work at a HFT firm or a Hedge fund as either an algorithmic trader or an analyst. 

I've just finished my second of three years and my GPA is at a 3.7 (after conversion). I have little experience in my field apart from some personal projects and a 12 week internship at a medium sized loans company (~50 employees).

I've done some research and found that normally Universities do a GRT (Graduate Recruitment Test). I'm also aware applicants are required to give academic references and write a statement of intent, which isn't a problem. 

I've also looked at [school admissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League#Members), by my logic the greater the number of graduate admissions the higher my chance of getting in. 

So my questions are:

1. Am I being realistic about getting accepted?

1. What can I do in my final year to improve my chances?

1. If I'm not accepted, whats my next best option (considering my career end goal).

I was hired on as a grad intern after I graduated originally thinking I would become a float pharmacist (posting was for float). Now that I have passed my licensing exams and should be receiving my license, there are two openings for staff pharmacists in my are and I'm not sure what to choose.

As a new graduate, I feel like it would be beneficial to float for a while to get an idea of different managerial styles and problem solving processes. Floating would also be excellent for networking. 

On the other hand, as a staff pharmacist I would have a set schedule and I was originally planning on trying to obtain a per diem hospital job to retain some clinical knowledge in that area. I feel like if I want to try to have a part time thing going on somewhere else, then I should take a staff job. 

I would really appreciate your input on which one you believe is best for professional growth. What would you do and why?

Unfortunately, some previously-undiagnosed learning disabilities and anxiety disorders really slowed down my progress in school until just the last few years. But, now that I'm being treated, I've worked really hard to get up to speed and get things done as quickly as possible. That said, I don't have much 'official' work history in the field apart from freelance work and a brief internship (where I felt mostly overwhelmed). I currently work part-time as a mobile-device salesman/tech. Because of this, I can't help but feel that I'm at a severe disadvantage and I'm not sure what would be the best next-step.

I really have a passion for it, though. I run my own home-lab (pfsense, Linux servers, managed/unmanaged switches) which I've used to experiment with so many different server and network technologies that I've honestly lost count. I've covered basically all of the CCNA and CCNA security level material during college and worked hands-on in their labs (but, I haven't gotten any certs yet). I know three programming languages, including assembly language for several CPUs, and have a deep interest in computer engineering alongside IT. But, all that still seems like it's never enough. 

I know the opinions on higher-education are mixed here, but my current plan is to go for a bachelors. It seems like it will be, overall, beneficial in my life (and it's something that will last my entire life). There is a state university here that offers several degrees relating to IT. But, partially because of some of the issues above, I may have to spend an extra year there just fulfilling the prerequisites for the program (which have to be taken consecutively). Leaving college at 27 with only a bachelors just seems like a bad thing, I suppose. 

Another option that caught my eye was to go with WGU. They look really appealing, especially since you earn a bunch of certs during the course and that I can work as quickly as possible. But, I know other online 'universities' have really poisoned the water for the rest of them. I feel like the school and it's program are legit, but I don't know what the consensus is on them. Right now, on paper, it seems like the better option. Do you or your business have an opinion on them?

I guess I'm not really sure what I'm asking for. It kinda feels like the only thing I've learned after all this time is just how much I *don't* know about *anything* and that I have no barometer for this field in the 'real' world. And I wonder if any decision I make will be based more on the, probably irrational, fear of failure of becoming miserable or 'unhireable' than anything rational: whether I take too long to get in the field, or get my degree, or if I get a worthless degree, or if I regret not going for a degree, etc. Maybe I'm looking for direction or perspective because it feels like I'm walking in the dark, bumping into everything (which, I suppose isn't abnormal).

I know you guys have probably read things like this a hundred times before. So, if nothing else, thanks for reading."

Okay, so I got the computer lab plugged in, and power on, logged into a machine, and called life good.

A few days later, I get a ticket about the computer lab being slow to login, slow on the network drives, slow internet, and some won't even get logged in.

I assume this is standard PEBKAC again and head over.

I sit down and login to the first system fine, but it did take minutes. The second system would not login, and the third was slower than molasses. I try to login to a few more with similar results.

I head to the wire room and grab a fluke toner and tester to see if the cables might of been cut/mangled/etc. This middle school was actually brand new, so I figured cables might of been crushed in the roof/wall during installation by the ""expert contractors"".

I tone a few lines and get nothing, or nearly nothing. Next up, fluke tester.

&gt; Fluke: BEEP BEEP! Fault at 10 feet.

10 Feet? What in the world, that would be in the wall. I trek back to the computer lab and pop the tracking panel on the wall off.

Our tech intern boss was here with me and almost started crying

&gt;TechBoss: Oh no. They didn't. What in the world? WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS!?

&gt;Me: Uhhh, is this spliced cat5?

&gt;TechBoss: Yes. Go back to the tech office and grab a few boxes of cable..

We ended up having to rewire the entire lab of ~20 computers. The buidling contractor folks ran 4 lines, then spliced them to the rest of the computers.

Moral of the story: Don't assume the users are always wrong, but always assume the non technical building contractors who have never ran data network cables might be. (No offense guys.)

[Also, here are some pics related to the event. Old blue splices, and pretty new yellow after we ran new lines.](http://imgur.com/a/zqvTy)"

To cut a long story short I was offered a summer internship by a large multinational engineering company which supposedly has a good reputation. After having my placement confirmed over the phone and by email, rejecting my other placements and moving home I was informed two days after I was meant to start that I know longer had a placement.

Because of this initial mistreatment I then decided to complain to HR where I was asked to supply the email confirming my placement, after doing so I was told that I was not sent that email. Essentially what I had discovered happened is that the email confirming my placement had been edited by someone so it looked like I was never offered a placement and I was essentially accused of lying by the person i was complaining too.

Fortunately I knew someone who already worked at the company who then managed to organise a meeting with a head engineer and another person in HR, a meeting which I still haven't heard back from even though it happened two weeks ago. My friend tells me they took my side and an engineer says he is looking into it but it seems to be going nowhere as its a HR problem being dealt with by HR.

Any next steps that can be recommended? It has been a long, frustrating ordeal and I am now out of work for the summer as i rejected my other opportunities."

The internship's duration is 6 weeks. I'm also living somewhere in Eastern Europe, and I'm studying something which can be described as a mix between Computer Science and Computer Engineering. In a few months I will be starting my last year, and I plan to work as a part-time developer.
         At the internship, in the first 2 weeks I studied/ worked with Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and in the next week I should start using Spring and Hibernate. I am somewhat familiar with these technologies, as I implemented a few projects using them during the last semester. Now after 2 weeks I have a much better understanding of these technologies, and I enjoy working with them.
    A few hours ago, someone from the company announced us ( the java interns) that there is a position available for android development, and if we want to, we can switch to that. I was also interested in android a few months ago, watched a few tutorials, implemented 3 or 4 simple apps, but I never got the chance to work more with Android, as I had a lot of projects to implement for uni, including the ones in which I implemented java web application. So basically, I was and still am very interested in learning android, but I don't know too much about it, while I also like implementing web applications, and I know  a little about the technologies. Also, I don't know any details about what I'll be implementing if I switch to Android. 
    For my current position, the mentors are passionate developers, and help us a lot, and I can say that I learned a lot during the last 2 weeks. After the internship ends, there will be an evaluation, and if the result is good, I have the possibility to stay at the company for a few more weeks. After that I can get hired as a part developer. 
     I feel that I have a good chance of getting hired if I stick with the current technologies. I understand them and I enjoy working with them. So I'm curious about what do you think I should do. Any advice is welcome, especially from people who worked with both mobile development and web applications."

2ag4q6,1,2014-07-11,Me (25/M) and my sort-of ex/sort of current GF of six months (24/F) have been communicating long distance but she seems to be getting more distant,scratchcorwood,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ag4q6/me_25m_and_my_sortof_exsort_of_current_gf_of_six/,"So I met this girl on OKC a couple months ago and we hit it off immediately. She's extremely bright, very sweet, and we have a strong mutual physical attraction. For two and a half months, although we live a bit of drive from each other, we'd take turns driving and see each other every weekend. I did everything I could think of to make sure she knew how much I liked her and that I was not going to cut corners in terms of making the relationship work. She's a vegan and I learned to cook vegan meals for when she came over. We'd chat constantly and when she left grad school for two weeks to see her parents I drove five hours so I could meet them and her dog who she absolutely adores. Though her parents weren't very talkative and the dog seemed to instinctively hate me, everything else about the visit seemed to go well (with me and her.) 


She'd mentioned early on how she gets very stressed out about having to turn in final papers and when finals time came around, about two weeks after the visit to her parents, she broke up with me saying she still had feelings for an ex and that she didn't think it was fair to me to continue seeing me. Though I was extremely disappointed I made the case for why we should stay together but said ""Only you know what you need. I care about you a lot and want to see you happy. If you want to talk I'm here.""


Two days passed and I was a complete mess. I didn't feel like getting out of bed. I decided I'd write her a letter, not sure if I'd send it or not. It seemed like a good way to at least get my feelings clarified. The letter turned out well, it basically said ""I miss you a lot, you're terrific and I'd like us to stay in touch if you feel you can do that. We both care about each other and make each other happy. In my experience that's rare and well worth working for."" There was more to it and it was more gracefully phrased, but that was the gist. I sent it to two female friends (25/F, 63/F) to see if they had any advice and they both said ""Scratch, this is beautiful, at the risk of giving bad advice, send it.""

So that night I saw she was on FB chat and I sent ""I wrote you a letter, is it alright if I send it to you?"" figuring that sending it without asking would be disrespectful and seem weird. She said ""Sure"" and suddenly we were talking again like nothing had changed except that the relationship status wasn't clear. I was happy to talk to her again. One of our little things was that she'd prompt me and I'd improvise bizarre short stories to her which she found amusing and seemed to like a lot. I started compiling them into a small book I printed and hand-illustrated it and gave it to her when I went to visit her at the end of the semester.

On that visit we had a long discussion about where we were. I was embarking on a long road trip to make a documentary and she had an internship over the summer so although we both had feelings for each other, she thought it was best we hold off until september when we'd be living near each other again to restart the relationship. I thought that sounded reasonable and we made plans to go camping in September.

On the road we were chatting every day and I'd try to send her things to show I was thinking about her, pictures of things I saw on the road that related to in-jokes we had. And for a couple weeks we were chatting a lot and it was really nice. I still have the sort of silly gleefulness at hearing from I did right after we first met.

However, in the last two weeks she seems to have grown distant. I send her messages and don't get a response for several hours and frequently the response will only be a word or two. We would always tell each other ""goodnight"" but she stopped doing that. I realize long distance is difficult and that technically we're not in a relationship but I'm not sure how to tell her I'd like to talk to her more or hear more about what she's been up to without sounding clingy and needy. Should I directly tell her that?

I have continued to use it at home a lot and (shamefully admit) I haven't done the inventory of apps I've been meaning to before surrendering it.  What will happen to it afterwards?

2agm8x,0,2014-07-11,Should I try to graduate early?,roup1,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2agm8x/should_i_try_to_graduate_early/,"Hello!

I will try to be brief. I am currently an 18 year old student beginning my second year in Mechanical Engineering. I have read through my degree plan and have figured that it is possible to graduate one year early. This would be possible by taking 15 credit hours per semester for four semesters and 6 more hours online or during the summer. The only problem is that next summer would be my last summer as an undergrad, leaving a small window for an internship if I were to take classes during that time. In addition, even though it may be early, I have considered graduate school so I can study mechatronics/robotics. I live at home right now and I think it would be interesting to live away from home which is a reason to go to grad school, on top of my interest in the subject and desire to work in that field. I have a few questions about my situation:

Would there be an opportunity to get an internship during grad school or is undergrad the ideal time for that?

Would it be best to minor in CS/EE and graduate on time?

Would graduating at age 20 be detrimental in any way to my future career or well being?

I'm sorry if my questions seem scattered and if they overlap, it's just that there are many options I can take. Right now, the best option seems to be to graduate on time with a minor and an hopefully an internship,but really, I just wanted a second opinion. Thank you in advance!"
2agp7o,1,2014-07-11,Looking for some feedback,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2agp7o/looking_for_some_feedback/,"Hey guys! So this is a bit long.

So, I've been talking to a guy for a while now - let's call him Zach. We've known one another and been good friends for nearly four years, so we're fairly comfortable with each other. He's been in a crappy relationship for awhile now - perhaps a year with a guy (I'll call him John) who simply doesn't take care of him and has quite a few issues at home, with his family, work, and life in general. For the last 3 months, Zach and I have been pursuing one another while I was working 2000 miles away at an internship. Meanwhile, Zach was also trying to carefully break-up with John. There have been several physical and verbal fights (which really upset Zach since he and I are both pacifists) and John has been taking advantage of Zach. Eventually, John found messages between Zach and I and has even approached me - saying that Zach loves him and I need to stay away so they can sort things out. That's what Zach wants according to John. However, Zach says that he's interested in me, has been for years, and wants out of this terrible relationship. 

Last week, I came home from my internship and have been spending a lot of time with Zach. At the same time, Zach has been very clear with John that he wants to break up and fully intends to spend as much time with me before I leave again for another three month internship. Zach also says that he has been trying to avoid and ignore John as much as possible. 

Last night, I stayed with Zach. We drank a few beers, watched movies with his roommate, and laid in bed in the dark talking to each other about all sorts of things until we fell asleep. All night we took turns snuggling one another and it was wonderful. Every time we're together, we both feel so alive and comfortable. He's a big sweetheart that's just bursting with life and I love every bit of it. 

This morning, we were goofing around in bed. Wrestling, kissing, etc. At some point, he was showing me some apps on his phone while I was sitting behind him - arms wrapped around him and my head on his shoulder. He was quickly swiping between the pages of apps on his phone when I saw the familiar Grindr icon. At first, I thought I had mistaken it for another app - so I flicked back a couple pages just to be sure. Yup, Grindr. I didn't say anything about it - and my mind is telling me to just let it go. I really don't think it's a big deal with him. He probably just hasn't deleted it. However, I can't see John being ok with it even being on his phone and I know John was accessing his phone regularly because he found our messages several times. 

Next week, Zach and I are going camping. Just the two of us in a remote area for 2 or 3 days. We're both stoners so weed will likely follow along, but I also had planned to take some mushrooms with us. We both really enjoy psychedelics and have never had the opportunity to trip together - something we're both really excited to do. We're also both outdoor enthusiasts and camping together is going to be a blast, regardless of our relationship/friendship status. But as I was driving home I started thinking about this morning and everything that has happened over the last few months. Now, I don't want to say that I have doubts about our growing relationship (which isn't quite defined yet), tripping together, or even spending time with one another - but I do want some outside opinions on the matter. I spent the earlier portion of this year living with my first really serious boyfriend and have quite a few regrets about rushing into it without listening to anyone's advice. I don't want to make the same mistake with Zach - especially since we've been great friends for so long and we both really seem to be into one another. So what do you guys think? Anyone have a similar experience to draw upon? Should I go with my gut and just keep having fun with Zach or take a step back and be guarded? 

**TL;DR I'm sorta dating my dream guy but he's exiting a nasty relationship and taking his time about it. Found Grindr on his phone and though I don't feel threatened, I'm looking for feedback on how I should approach the situation. Planning to trip together next week during a camping trip and just want to have everything sorted out in my head before hand.**"
2agvcd,3,2014-07-11,"Do I have medical ""good cause"" for Unemployment?",kbforthree,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2agvcd/do_i_have_medical_good_cause_for_unemployment/,"Hey Reddit. So I'm two years out of college, and after two internships in my field, have been in my ""dream job"" for nearly a year (ad agency). I've dealt with anxiety/depression for a long time unknowingly, but it really hit me when my dad passed away several months ago. I started getting panic attacks and wasn't able to do my job effectively so my employer allowed me unpaid leave. It was tremendous in my recovery and am feeling much better. 

I returned to work three weeks ago and the feelings are coming back. But only at work. When I get home, despite being miserable from a long day I feel relatively happy. There are just too many memories and associations with being unable to do my job here. It is slow torture being at work and mostly miserable, doing just enough to not get fired.

Basically, I need a change of scenery. I just started looking yesterday but don't know how long it will take. Fortunately my experience has given me a pretty solid resume and am confident I can find a similar job. 

My question is if it's worth it to apply for unemployment in the mean time as a backup plan in case it takes me a while to find a new gig. I have documentation from my psychiatrist about my medical health and reasoning for time off. What do you guys think? Do I have a case for ""good cause""? "
2ah6i9,7,2014-07-11,My goddamn roommate,StolenAphrodite,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2ah6i9/my_goddamn_roommate/,"Backstory: I am a female college student who got an internship 8 hrs from school for the summer. Internship fucking rocks, but I had no clue where to live, office is in the far sprawling suburbs of a major city. A co-worker suggested I live with his girlfriend's brother, because he had a spare room, and the perks (A/C, laundry, own room+bathroom) for the price were better than anything I saw on craigslist. 

Fast forward to living with the jackass: Meeting him, he didn't seem so bad. He'd be super chill about telling me where amenities were, etc. About the only thing we had in common was Game of Thrones. He's a 26 yr old finance dude who just works out excessively and I'm a 20 year old nerd who goes to concerts in basements. We're different people. But whatever, right, we can find some common ground on something eventually? 

Well, every time we'd converse (read: he'd yell over anything I had to say) he'd steer the conversation to how much money he's making/going to make or how hot the women he dates are. And it got worse from there. He'd get into his relationship past and current which I quite frankly, didn't want to hear about. 

He's on every dating site known to man. He rotates through girls like crazy. And, he's miserably sexist and won't even consider that as fact. His family is incredibly wealthy and I get the feeling he's never been told he's capable of doing anything wrong. Here are some actual quotes that he's said:

 * After telling me about a ""6/10 attractive"" tinder date he met who was checking out other guys at the coffee shop, he said, ""I don't get it, I'm the best she could ever do""

 * Ex girlfriend story: ""She was bat shit crazy, and SHE dumped ME"" Right. because only a crazy person could ever dump you.

 * ""Well, she was at least cute facially""

 * After talking about a girl he dated who was ""just a waitress,"" he finished the story with, ""yeah, I got tested after her""

 * ""It's so obvious I'm not the only person she's seeing."" He routinely dates 3+ people at a time, so I said, ""Wait, does that bother you?"" and he said, ""Well, yeah!"" like it was obvious or something.

 * ""If my mom looked like a dumpy housewife, my dad would divorce her so fast"" Ok, good, so we at least know where your awful sexist and shallow tendencies are coming from.

 * ""She's really pretty and she seems smart, usually girls are one or the other"" I just stared at him in awe after that one. Like, what the fuck

 * ""I just don't understand women"" fucking obviously

 * ""Do these shoes look homo?"" This is one I fucking called him out for. There is no damn reason people should still be using these phrases. I was like, ""Dude, there is a whole thesaurus, why go with that word"" and he tried to rationalize it, saying, ""I don't mean it like, homosexual, I mean it like, that's gay bro."" ...the fuck? 

 * ""I don't get offended by things"" YOU ARE A HETEROSEXUAL WHITE MALE WITH AN IMPOSING PHYSICAL PRESENCE. OF COURSE NOTHING OFFENDS YOU. WHEN YOU OFFEND PEOPLE, YOU LIKELY DID SOMETHING WRONG AND YOU SHOULD FIND OUT WHAT AS OPPOSED TO DEFENDING YOUR SHITTY POSITION. GO FUCK OFF AND WATCH MORE TOSH.0 YOU ENTITLED ASSWIPE.

After he started a conversation with me about which of the girls he's seeing he should call up that night, I got super fed up of his shit, broke my silence amidst all this, and called him a sexist, and he asked why I thought that. I said he objectifies women and doesn't see them as people. He responded that he objectifies everybody, he's just not trying to get with the dudes.

I responded by saying, ""You know, it's sometimes hard to have a level conversation with you when your ego is the biggest fucking thing in the room.""

Perhaps the ""fucking"" was inflammatory and excessive, but he didn't talk to me for 3 weeks after that. And it was wonderful. If we were in the same room, we were silent. He wouldn't even make eye contact with me. I was ecstatic.

He decided he should start talking me again last night. Fuck. The conversation was benign, with hints of his ""appearance is everything and I am the greatest person""-ness about it. Like, he was talking about how it's important to have a nice DVD collection because people are impressed by it. Dude, nobody is impressed that you have a copy of I Love You, Bet Cooper collecting dust on a shelf. Nobody.

I know a lot of people have had shitty roommates to an extreme (stealing and selling their shit, overall being unsanitary, being stalker crazy, etc.) so I guess things could be worse. But this is probably the first person I've met that I genuinely hate and have to deal with regularly. It's a weird feeling. **Advice on how to deal with assholes like this is much appreciated.**

I'm only here for 1.5 more months. That is my mantra.

I work as a PC tech and soon realized how stupid people can be when it comes to technology. This is the conversation I experienced today on the phone.

Me: ""Hello this is Finny545.""

User: ""Yeah this is User my network cable was recently replaced and my internet is now slower. I submitted a ticket because the old one was fraying.""

Me: ""Um OK let me take a look at the ticket."" I look and see that it was a basic cable swap and that I did it. ""Sir I see that I replaced the cable but can you tell me whats wrong?

User: ""It just seems like it is running slower since you replaced it.""

I ping his PC and nothing is out of the ordinary so I don't exactly know what to do since I am relatively new at this. Then he said that the cable was the wrong color. It then clicked that we are latest shipment of CAT6 cables were gray instead of blue.

Me:""Sir the cable is the same it is just a different color, our newest cables were just gray instead of blue.""

User:""No it is slower that the last one I am positive.""

This went on for a while until I just went and replaced it again with a blue one, but I learned to make sure when I replace a cable in the future to make sure its the same damn color!"

As of now, my resume includes my math major, business and computer science minor, and multiple examples of job experience including my current internship which is a full time analyst position.

The ticket would be from Cincinnati but shit I'd be willing to find a way to Chicago if I could find a cheaper price.

Did I decide to buy my ticket too late? Am I not looking in the right places?

How much did tickets cost you and how did you find them?

Edit: so it looks like August is a peak time which is the reason for the prices. Unfortunately I'm not really flexible with the date I can leave since it is for an internship and I go a couple days after I finish another internship. 

Since I'll be staying in a motel for each day I wait past August 15 I have to pay an additional 60 dollars. Now maybe I could find someone to stay with for free but... I doubt it.

One thing that would be great is to buy a one way ticket but I've heard customs won't allow it, is this true? If so will a flight to Korea suffice as a ""return ticket""?

2ahg7a,11,2014-07-11,Unsure where to go in the future...,cjazz92,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2ahg7a/unsure_where_to_go_in_the_future/,"Hi all!  So I've been thinking a lot about the CPA exam and my accounting future recently, and I'm having a bit of a crisis; I don't know where (location-wise) I want to work.

I am from, and went to undergrad in Upstate NY, but I have never had, and still do not have any interest in returning to the northeast in the near future.  Unfortunately, the firms who visited my school seemed solely interested in putting people in NYC/Boston/etc..  I went to a Big 4 leadership program last summer in NYC, but made it clear this past year that I did not want to return to the area, and did not get any internship offers in public accounting (potentially for that reason).

I am currently interning in Detroit in a non-accounting role, and although I've enjoyed the experience, it isn't really a company I see myself with in the future.  I also don't have any real ties to, or interest in working in the area.

Next year, I will be going to grad school in Indiana for my MSA, at a ""bigger name"" school, with more of a national recruiting reach.  Again, I don't particularly want to work in Indiana, but at least I'll have more options at that school.

Career-wise, I have a specific company in mind that I would like to work for in the long run, with locations in Florida and the Los Angeles area, but I don't know the best way to get there.  For now I would like to work in either public accounting, or if possible, for this company.  I don't have many ties to either of these areas, so I don't know whether to try to go there now, or start out somewhere else, perhaps a little bit closer to home.

I'm also in the process of studying for the CPA exam, and at this point I don't know which state to register with. I don't plan to take any sections for at least a few months so ideally I would like to know by then, but I have to wonder, what happens if I'm not able to sort it out by them, or worse, if I'm not able to get a job in the state I register with?

If anyone has any advice for me, it would be greatly appreciated!!

**TL;DR** I don't want to work in any of the places I have ties to. I do have a long-term career goal in mind, but I don't know where to start out if I want to achieve it.

2ahgou,25,2014-07-11,What more can gain I in this community pharmacy rotation?,[deleted],pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2ahgou/what_more_can_gain_i_in_this_community_pharmacy/,"I've been going to my community pharmacy APPE for the past 3 weeks. Aside from learning how the computer system works for this particular chain, I haven't learned much more than what I've already gained through experience at the pharmacy I've interned at for the past few years. 

I'm wondering what kinds of questions I could ask my preceptor that would help me develop. What other tasks could I be doing besides the usual intern stuff I do at my own store? We've gone over pharmacy finances, a bit of federal/state law, vaccines offered, and motivational interviewing."
2ahjgk,3,2014-07-12,"A month ago I was told I would be transferred for an internship/job, but I'm still waiting",swimswithsquids,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ahjgk/a_month_ago_i_was_told_i_would_be_transferred_for/,"Background information: I am going to be a Junior this Fall, majoring in Finance and Business Management. This past semester, I missed my easiest chance to get an internship, my school's career fair. So here I am now working for a casino that I had been with for the past 2 years. I work in a department that is not inside the casino because I am not yet 21.

At the beginning of the Summer I was asked to come to the HR office to fill out some forms, and I got to talking with one of the higher ups of that department. We talked for a little bit about school and such, eventually the topic was brought up that the public accounting department was looking for an intern. She told me that I seemed like a good candidate and would pass my name to them.

I waited about a week and didn't hear back, so I went to her office where her receptionist said she was busy, she said she would pass my number to her. One week later, she saw me passing by and said that I was in for sure, and that I should expect a call soon to ask a few questions/get my resume. Two weeks later, after not hearing anything, she passed me by again at work and told me they were going to put me on the accounting schedule. I told her that I was very eager and wanted to get started as soon as possible, she said she would tell them to hurry.

It is also might be important to note that she asked me before if I was 21 or not, because their largest accounting department is in the casino, but there are a couple smaller ones for the other buildings they own. This could possibly be why they've been holding off, because they only need an intern in the casino. But I do turn 21 next week so that can be fixed.

So what I wanted to know is what should be my next course of action and how should I approach it? Is there any point in bothering her still? Summer break ends in 5 weeks, should I just give up? 

Thanks for the advice everyone, I really appreciate it.

My transcript is far from stellar, although I am above a 3.0. I'm currently working as a software engineering intern, and I am at sort of a crossroads for determining how to spend the next few years.

My goal ultimately is to have a career working with interesting technologies, and I'm aiming for grad school to study either computer vision or machine learning.

My options at the moment are:

A) Transfer to a small-ish UC this fall, finish a B.S. (Applied Math, focus on CS), possibly get some research experience, and apply to grad school, or

B) Possibly continue to work as an intern, take more community college classes, and pick up 2 classes at UC Berkeley through concurrent enrollment, and reapply for UC transfers next year.

Neither plan is entirely concrete, but I wanted to see if any of you guys that are more established in the field had any advice. "

2ahsfa,5,2014-07-12,"My [24 M] best friend [21 F], who I have known my whole life, slept with a married man and I'm debating ending our friendship. Is this the right decision?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ahsfa/my_24_m_best_friend_21_f_who_i_have_known_my/,"I recently discovered my best friend is hooking up with her former boss at a place she used to intern about a year ago.  I knew that they had kept in touch after she left, but she had always just called him her friend and said she babysat his kids once in a while.  I'll admit that I found out about their relationship through snooping, which is a shitty thing to do, but I saw a lewd text from this guy pop up on her phone while I was hanging out with her and was so shocked that I had to sneak a look when she went the bathroom to make sure I had just made a mistake.  Turns out I hadn't...

I know it's technically none of my business, but I see this as one of the worst things you could do to someone.  While it isn't me she is hurting, I think it shows poor character and while who she sleeps with isn't my business, who I choose to spend time with is.  I think another part that bothers me is that it's not like she's desperate or anything.  The two of us go out to bars and clubs all the time and wingman/wingwoman each other, and she has no trouble getting men.  Out of all the choices she picks someone who has a wife? AND kids?  It's so morally wrong to me.

Honestly, if I had only known her for a few years I would have already made the decision to stop talking to her, but it's far more complicated then that.  She and I have known each other since we were children, our moms are best friends, my brother is friends with her brother, and her family comes over every year for holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.).  Her family practically is part of our family.  Lastly, despite this one action, she actually is a good friend.  I value her because she has helped me get through some tough times and she is the type of person who is always willing to go out and have fun, which is a quality that I have trouble finding in other friends I make. I don't know if I want to end an otherwise solid 20 year friendship over something I should never have known anyway.  What would you do reddit?

TL;DR: I learned my best friend, who is like family, is sleeping with her former boss who is married.  I really value her as a friend, but I feel this reflects poorly on her character and I am not sure if I want someone like that to be one of my friends."

I've read countless threads where it is more important to have work experience rather than waste two years of work on school. But I wanted your feedback on this option and see what you all think about this. 

I proposed this question to my friends (they're engineering students a year ahead of me in schooling) and they said so long as I network, find clubs related to engineering, find internships (as early as sophomore year), and do well in school (3.0+). What is your take on this? And to make sure there is no confusion, I am thinking about the idea of seeking an MBA (don't know what but most likely in management) after finishing my BS/MS track and working for a few years.  "

1. How are the gyms in Japan generally like? I read online that most gyms are focused towards machines in general and free weights/barbells are rather limited. I'm planning on visiting Gold's Gym, so I hope it'd be more conducive towards powerlifting/olympic lifting but I'm still open to any other suggestions.

1. In terms of sharing equipment or asking for a spot, how do we go about it? I have limited conversational ability in Japanese, so it would be great if you guys have any phrases that I could really use when it comes to such situations.

1. Any other things that I might need to take note of? 

Thanks!

2aibpr,1,2014-07-12,This past year my life changed a lot..but I still feel hopeless and alone.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2aibpr/this_past_year_my_life_changed_a_lotbut_i_still/,"I've always had depression off and on, since I was around 17..It originally started because I was in high school and while people 'liked me' I just wasn't that outgoing or had a lot of interests that made people want to actually be around me it seems.  So while I had a close group of friends, we didn't see each other too often.  Also I didn't really know what I wanted in life yet, which I see is kinda normal for a 17 year old.  Anyways my past isn't that relevant now I guess..

Now I'm 22 years old, and from age 18-20 I really felt alone, like I was going no where in life, changed my major, and am still unhappy with it today.  I eventually transferred to my university where I was until I was 21, and applied for an exchange program in Korea; despite being in a hole mentally, one of my dreams was just always to go away somewhere and experience something new, I thought that would change me.  Well, last August I finally set foot in Seoul as an exchange student, I knew absolutely no one, and that was my biggest worry coming here, that I would know no one for the whole I was here.  Well I was wrong, during this time from then until now I met some of the most amazing people and made extremely close friends.  However here's the thing, now the time has come to go back home, and most of these friends have left to go back home as well; and I find myself feeling alone again.  Most days I'll just be sitting in my room in the dark, not waking up until around 6pm, and then when I do, I go to my computer and just sit there, start some activity and half finish it like I always used to do.  I've started pondering life again and my future and realizing that I have no idea what I'm going to do when I graduate, I have no internship experience, no job, my parents are poor, I have no money left much except for financial aid from my school.  I told my friends that I want to come back to Korea for graduate school, but I honestly don't know how plausible that is..I feel like the only thing thats drawing me back to coming here is that it is one of the only big memorable experiences I have had in my life.

There's a lot of other stuff that makes me feel like shit most of the time but honestly I don't tell people, or even show being depressed in front of people.  I just feel alone and the 4 super close friends I've made here, I dont want to show them how I really am, there is one girl in particular who I feel like I can talk about anything with, but since she looks up to me and I'm someone she can lean on when she needs it, I don't want to show her my weak side..

I just don't know what to do with myself.."
2aif75,5,2014-07-12,"PLEASE HELP! Met the HB of My Dreams, But There Are Some Obstacles!",[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/2aif75/please_help_met_the_hb_of_my_dreams_but_there_are/,"This summer, I got the opportunity to work for a company as an intern. I saw this girl (fulltime) about a week ago and I thought she was attractive. I also know another girl that works there full time and asked her if she knew what the HB's relationship status was at the time. She answered, she's engaged. I was initially thinking, damn that sucks, but then I asked where her ring was? She responded by saying she wears it on the wrong finger (the HB gives the reason of just not remembering/some other BS response). Normally, after finding out a girl is engaged I would just drop it and walk. 

However, this HB invited two other interns out to a bar after work. One of the interns forwarded me the invite so I decided to tag along. Well fuck me. So we all sit down (at first outside) at the bar and order some drinks. We all talk theres some bullshitting/social protocol etc. So the HB asks about whiskey and what it tastes like (im drinking some makers) so I said find out for yourself and she smiles and drinks. (Almost spit out haha). Eventually, we move inside the bar due to the heat. Now luckily the HB and I get one end of the booth, while the other two get the other side. I'm no PUA, but I have heard of Kino and decided to try it out throughout the night. I complimented her watch while grabbing her wrist, I touched her arm, and shoulder. (It was hard to get intimate as we are all coworkers and in a group of 4). A quick side note: I'm definitely the alpha of the interns, (the HB even decided to start calling me Jason Stackhouse haha). So I'm portrayed as the guy that gets women daily. Another important sidenote, HB has poison ivy on her arm which we all joke about being herpes. This provided me with some kino opportunities. However, at one point I had made a joke about the herpes and she laughed jokingly saying, ""If anyone had herpes, it'd be you."" Before she could say anything else I raised my voice and said ""If any of you have the courage to ask for it, I'll whip it out right now to prove my herpes free status."" The HB smiled and said damn I was just about to say if you are herpes free prove it, but fuck, I didn't think you would haha.""

Moving on.. throughout the whole night we kept really good eye contact and she looked at me a lot while speaking. At one moment the two interns were talking about something extremely nerdy and I smiled, got close to the HB and whispered ""can you believe these love birds, and look at the price of this prime rib... so cheap!"" She giggled quietly and agreed. 

Now, I have been looking for more serious things as I have gotten older (21 almost 22). This girl may be engaged ( not confirmed, as she never talks about the guy or invites him along, he supposedly works at the same company). This girl is a coworker, but I honestly feel such a connection to her and I can't stop thinking about her. During one of the conversations, she was describing her brother (saying he's a jock in a high school and dates really hot girls) and she said that we would get along (her brother and I). 

I apologize for jumping around, but I had consumed some alcohol and I'm trying to provide as much detail as possible. 

Returning the actual hang out:
So as the night ended, all four us walked out and stood on the sidewalk talking for a few minutes. We informally planned something for next friday, but we were all drunk so who knows. As we were saying goodbyes, first the HB turns to me and I to her. Still knowing this was a coworker situation, I fist bumped her and she punched back. She then says some shit , smiling and joking about me being a jerk. 

End of the Night.

Points that I really want to discuss:

1) At one moment in the bar, we talked about first time getting caught hooking up by our parents. The HB said that her father walked in on her making out and yelled at her BF. I said that her father is the man and I would have done the same thing. Accidentally, I started bringing up her father in a couple light jokes, (saying what would you do if your father and I became drinking buddies). Out of the people there, the other two interns knew that the HB's parents were going through a divorce. Finally, when I was made aware of the situation, the HB said something like ""Yeah, I dont hate my father, yatatata"" seeming kinda down about the situation. So I immediately turned to her (and noticeably got serious while looking into her eyes) and said ""I'm so sorry, you should have said something like ""shut up (My Name), you douche bag."" She smiled and said it's ok. The night did go on from there, but just thought I mention the situation (Did I handle that appropriately, from a game perspective? I have heard that apologizing is weak and turns girls off?)

2) At the end of the night, after I hit the gym and sobered up a bit, I thought, what if I had done something like (after she had jokingly flipped me off) put my arm around her and walked her to car saying I need to talk to this one for a moment (acting mad/but obviously joking). I may have been able to try a k-close or #-close. Did I fuck up here?

Also, how do you guys/girls recommend I play this out, when I go back to work on monday?

Some options I am considering:

1) Ask her out to lunch (she mentioned she loved sushi and I told her about a great sushi place). If I do ask her out, should I invite the other interns?
2) It was her birthday yesterday and though we all said happy birthday in the beginning of the day, we all forgot to say it at the end of the night. Should I use forgetting to say happy birthday as an excuse to take her out to sushi?
3) or Should  I just play it cool (because I genuinely don't know her actual relationship status/feelings for me) and wait until we potentially go out again next friday ( at which point I walk her to her car and go for k-close/# if things are feeling good that night. 

My other really pressing question is:

Should I ask about her relationship status at one point? I mean her friend said that she is almost positive that she is engaged (which the HB doesnt know that I know). I am thinking that if we go on a date or something I ask her so are you seeing someone right now? If she lies and says no, then I consider that shit a win haha. 

Honestly, I am afraid to ask because if she says she is, don't I have to back off? I have been with girls before and haven't had too much trouble. However, it has been so fucking long since I have felt this level of attraction to someone (of course because she is hot) but because of her personality. I know I shouldn't dwell on one girl, but fuck man, this is the first time I am really struggling with that notion. 

Anyway, I will keep you guys up-to-date if requested.

I can't thank you enough if you manage to read this rambling wall of nonsensical text. If you do, and offer advice, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I really appreciate it.

If anyone has some questions about the situation or needs more detail just ask."

2ait85,1,2014-07-12,"PhD route or Industry/Masters route? This ties directly to my personal finance, and need your guys' input",ricksteer_p333,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ait85/phd_route_or_industrymasters_route_this_ties/,"Hi all. At first this topic may seem to be unrelated, but one of the largest factors that will be deciding which route I take is my ability to finance myself and my soon-to-be wife.

I'm currently on a 6-month internship with Intel, and in May 2015 I receive my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. For several years now, I have been wanting to pursue a PhD, and I believe I have a fair chance to a university like Stanford, Caltech, or Berkeley. I would be starting my PhD next fall, 2015. The salaries for PhD students are well below $40K, most of the time below $30K.

The other option I have is working full time at a place like Intel while doing my masters simultaneously. At this point I'll be looking at a $60K + salary, depending on the location.

Now, the problem comes in with my student loans and soon-to-be wife. She's a foreigner that will move to the US, and she'll need my financial support for a few months as she situates herself in a new country. 

My question is, how affordable will it be if I'm doing a PhD, to pay rent and have a dependent for several months? Especially if I am in San Francisco, where rent is sky high, will I be forced to live with roommates to save money and support her? Also worth mentioning that I'm 22 yrs old and I want to start generating wealth as soon as I pay my $30K in student loans.

On the other hand, if I choose the industry route, none of this will be a problem, and things will be relatively easy, financially speaking. 

FYI: Both routes, phd and industry/masters, entail doing what I like. I won't be sacrificing what I love to do for money. The advantage of a PhD is having the opportunity to be an expert in a field, which is very attractive to me.

**TL;DR** Girlfriend is moving from her country, to the US, next Fall 2015. I need to support her for some time, and I have $30K in loans. Do I pursue a PhD ($25-$35K salary) or industry/masters ($60K-$80K salary) ? I'll do what I love in both instances."

All there software is written in C++. I am fortunate in that I look 10 - 15 years younger than what I am. In school the people I made friends with all thought I was 26. So, I know this is to my advantage. When I sent out my resume I only put down a job that I had previously for 3 years, and then my college. So, from 2006 on. I didn't want to put down too many years of non related experience as it would more likely show my age. I am thinking this was a mistake. I am starting to freak out and have second thoughts about going to the interview. I am starting to feel like I am too old to get into this field and what was I thinking? I had a phone interview with them last week. This is an entry level position. I feel like I am just as qualified as someone 25 coming out of college. Do you think employers will think i am too old and not hire me. It scares me that there are so many articles online that say over 40 you are too old for programming. What advice can you give me? 

EDIT: I wanted to say that I knew someone in my school who just graduated last year at the ripe age of 55. In his junior year he got an internship at INTEL. He now works for a consulting firm as a tester. You would think that would be enough to convince me."
2aivxk,8,2014-07-12,How to deal with a coworker who's bad at his job?,tsu91,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/2aivxk/how_to_deal_with_a_coworker_whos_bad_at_his_job/,"I am in a relatively entry-level position at my company.  We recently hired someone, let's say ""Dave,"" with no experience or internships to start taking on some of my responsibilities so that I can take on some additional projects.  Though I'm not his manager, I'm almost solely responsible for delegating work to him, training him, giving him feedback, etc.  We both report to ""Rick.""  Dave is a career-changer, so although he is in an entry-level position, he's about twice my age and has around 20 years of experience in another industry.

Dave's been here three months, and he's not very good at his job.  He seems eager to learn and interested in the industry, but he isn't really picking up he technical skills, and he seems to either disregard or be unaware of deadlines.  He frequently doesn't read his email, or maybe just forgets about it - I'll send him an email like, ""Can you call so and so and ask about this issue by the end of tomorrow?"" and I'll follow up later and he'll have no idea what I'm talking about.  His work has been laden with mistakes, and he tends to make the same mistakes repeatedly.  I have documented processes extremely clearly, and he'll often make mistakes or be clueless about something I have explicitly explained in the documentation or discussed with him multiple times before.

It's beginning to reflect badly on me and making it seem like I'm not giving him enough direction/documentation or not checking his work enough.  It's also becoming extremely stressful - he was hired with the expectation that he would be taking over a lot of my work and I'd be taking on new projects.  But now I'm taking on new projects and also spending a significant amount of time checking and rechecking or redoing his work to get it out on time, and I've been working really long hours.  (He has been leaving at 5.)

Our manager Rick has noticed an issue as well on a few projects they have worked on together.  He approached me about it and asked my opinion on how Dave's doing.  I was honest and expressed some of my concerns - is that a dick move?  If it was just my coworker and not someone I was trying to delegate work to, I'd never bring it up with his manager, but it's at the point where it's significantly affecting my own work.  And Rick seemed to notice the problem as well.

Honestly, I don't see Dave progressing too far in this profession.  It feels like it's going to be a very very long time before he is able to take on what he was hired to do.

I was patient for the first two months, but it's at the point where I feel like he should be improving at a pace much faster than he is.  I get that starting in a new industry is hard, but the ignorance of deadlines and the making the same mistake multiple times thing is really concerning.

How long is reasonable to expect someone to get up to speed?  How open about the problems should I be with our manager?  Any advice that you think would help him improve?  How much of the blame should I put on myself?  I feel like as the person training him, I bare part of the responsibility."

Basics:
I am 25, about to turn 26. I will be graduating this fall with a 2 year degree, then I have about 5 classes left to a 4 year degree (which I plan to finish later). My 2 year degree is in office administration, which is also my current field of work. My boyfriend is a bit older than I am, wants to finish his degree when we can (after debt is payed off and we are stable). 


We were both unemployed for about a year, at the same time. He had an apparent 'gap' on his resume (he was not unemployed, he was a paid live-in caretaker for a vet); I wasn't having luck with anything I applied to either. It was, and is, rough. We made the choice to live at my family's house, in a camper. Because of this, we don't pay rent or utilities. We both became employed again a few months ago.


We are both employed, but neither of our jobs are 'stable.' He is currently temp-to-hire (he is doing amazing so far, so I have no doubt he'll be hired full-time. He is WAY overqualified for what he is doing, but they were looking long-term when they hired him, and said so. That said, I'm a cautious person and I don't want to be unprepared). My two jobs are an internship and a weekend receptionist respectively.




I am looking for full-time work... I've gotten enough hours at my internship now that it's not neccessary (but it is a paid internship). I love my non-internship job, but they seem uninclined to give me more than weekend hours. He is also still looking for other work/better paying work in his field of expertise.




I work 2 jobs right now, unfortunately even with both I am not at full-time hours. One is technically an internship, which provides 20hrs/week at  minimum ($9/hr). The other is weekends only (though I have asked for more hours), 13 hrs/week at $9.50/hr. I am seeking a third job, preferably evenings since the internship isn't always the same schedule (though I will force it there in a heartbeat if I need to). 




I have no student debt, one old credit line bill I just found out about (aprox $200), and currently my personal monthly bills are as follows:
Phone: $40. Netflix: $8. Entertainment: $48. = $96.




He works 30-40hrs/week, @ I think 9.50. These are ballpark debt figures as I can't find our folder right now. 
Student loans: 1 @ about 2k, 1 @ 15k?
Credit cards: 1 @ 1.5k, 1@ 3k  [These are not currently used]
Verizon: ~$500 (early term fee + a month or so from when we were unemployed)
Comcast: ~$50
His bills: Entertainment: $30 ish? Gas: $500+? (his commute is short, ~10mins, but his car has issues). 




Shared: Groceries: $~300/mth. I need to track this better, and budget/plan meals better. 
Eating out: Way too much (we have been bad about having lunch food at home, this is being changed).


We don't pay rent, don't have a car payment...





Now, 
I make about $1,180/mth, he makes about $1,000 (ball park, estimating low). 



His car is shot. I am having it looked at to see if there are any cheap things to keep it running, but right now it's running horribly and guzzles gas. Not good. Completely fixing it would cost far more than the car is worth. I do not have a car.



He wants to move out, and so do I. However, we haven't payed off any debt yet, don't have savings yet, and we don't make enough to pay rent. Plus our work isn't stable yet. I'm working on reminding him of the logic here, but I do understand how frustrating it is to be in our living situation. In addition, we have animals (rabbits), which means most apartments are a no-go. They can stay at my parents house, but then I have an added commute expense to care for them.



We are also looking ahead, and while we can't start saving quite yet (paying off debt is more important), our plan is to build a tiny house as soon as we can. 



So. We need a 'new' (to us) car that will run for commute to/from work, and we need to pay off debt. We need to start saving, but imo that is lower priority than getting rid of debt right now.



**Thoughts? Logic? I'm familiar with both the snowball and avalanche methods. I lean more towards the snowball method, as right now we are still both at the stage of being overwhelmed. I don't know the interest rates, but I'm sitting down with him tonight &amp; having him pull his credit karma so we can get started. He has been avoiding it a bit, not ignoring it, just anxiety that we both deal with.**



*edit: UGH. Sorry about formatting. For the life of me, I can't get nice line breaks between paragraphs....*

2aj73q,5,2014-07-12,"Me [23M] and my gf [23F] of 5 years, she felt neglected I changed, find out she's been sexting other guys for a while, and now I feel neglected",thisgirlstressesme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2aj73q/me_23m_and_my_gf_23f_of_5_years_she_felt/,"This is lengthy, probably due to some much needed venting, but I’m looking for some suggestions. I've been with my current girlfriend for five years, and we have been living together for four years. We have been quite the happy couple for the majority of the time, but this past year has been a little bit bumpy. Here's why: We’ve always lived pretty busy lives, but it is starting to cause problems. My girlfriend works two part-time jobs and attends a few classes at the local community college. I'm working one job, finishing up my undergraduate degree, and going through the medical school application process. We both had no problem with our busy schedules, because we each made time for each other and stayed in communication. 

However at the start of this year my responsibilities became exceptionally more demanding. I was a TA, VP of student organization, doing research in a lab, working my job occasionally, taking 24 credits, landed an internship at a prestigious university hospital in US, and I also care for a physically/mentally disabled family member daily. So I’d wake up next to my girlfriend, chat for a bit, have breakfast together, and then leave by 7am. I normally wouldn’t return until about 8pm, and then I would either be grading papers/researching/completing my own work/etc until midnight sometimes later. Repeat. Some nights (never more than 2 per week) I stayed at a friend’s apartment that was right next to my university, but only if I had to be there early the next day just so I could get some extra sleep. In retrospect, I really did overdo it for about 5 months, and I understand if my gf was starting to feel neglected. On occasion (approx. one night per weekend), I’d take my gf out on dates to restaurants or bars we like. We seemed just as happy as usual expressing our love emotionally and physically.

 After three months of this schedule, my gf confronts me saying she hates my new schedule because I rarely am ever around, and she feels like a single person living with a friend who she has sex with. She suggests taking a break, until I have more time. I confessed that I probably shouldn’t have taken on some many things at once, and I am willing to take a break if she wants. In addition, I said I’ll cut down on my future responsibilities when the time is right (two months later). She decides to not take a break and wait the two months for me to have more time. I keep my end of the deal, 2 months later step down from my TA position (which took up most of my time), and take only 12 credits (only 3 classes) the subsequent semester. My time availability greatly increases. I then engage and spend more time with her.

A few weeks later things get tumultuous. One day, I ask to use her computer and when I do I find she left her messages (from when she synced her iphone) open. Right there I see she’s been flirting and extremely sexual (sending pictures and videos) to this guy. I’m angered, so I scroll through it and see it’s been going on for the past 5 months (weeks before she confronted me about my busy schedule). I click the next message and I find she’s been doing this with multiple guys, and even tried to meet up with some even though it seems she hasn’t been successful. Then my gf comes running into the room, because she forgot she left her messages open. I confront her about it and she gets emotional, apologetic, and says that it never progressed past pictures/videos and she never met up with anyone. I did always find her to be honest in the past, so I do believe that it was strictly just messages. I ask her why she did it, and she said I was never around. So I ask her why didn’t we just have a break then, and she says that she didn’t want to lose me because I’m the best bf she’s ever had. Kind of sounds like BS to me, more like she was stringing me along until something better came along. We hash out the details, and come to an agreement that she would cut off contact with these guys and we would make efforts to strengthen our relationship. So we continue on happily, and I don’t hold any grudges because I believe we moved on. 

Then fast forward two months (June of this year), I get an anonymous message from someone telling me that my gf has been messaging them sexual content doing the same with other guys. They then send me tons of conversations and pictures as proof, its same as before just with different guys. I confront my girlfriend and she becomes apologetic yet again, saying it was a mild relapse into her old ways, and tells me not to worry it won’t happen again. I tell her if something like this happens again that I will most likely be leaving. Now she changes her tune. She says I spend too much time with her and she wants to hang with her female friends more often. She also says,” why don’t you go hang w/ your friends and stop studying and researching all the time.” I’m fine with that, though I am annoyed because she now just did a 180 on me after I adjusted so much to make time for her. So she spends most of her free time with them. 

She’s been out every day and night with them. She comes home, showers, eats, and goes to work or with her friends. I see my friends here and there, but I actually cannot remember the last time my gf came home and slept beside me or even at our place. I tell her that I feel we just did a role reversal, and would like to spend some time with her because I’m starting to feel excluded or like I’m the third wheel in my own relationship. She says, “well now you know how I felt back when you were working so much and trying to save the world!” I tell her that I apologize for the past, but I think we should move past that. I have been making great efforts to be there for her for the past 3-4 months, and she agreed. Yet she says,” well my friends were there for me during that time, and you can’t just expect me to change just like that and start spending more time with you again and less with them.”  So at the time I had just accepted the fact that maybe she needs more time to adjust. Then days later I began getting more angry when I realized how much I’ve helped this girl out and the sacrifices I’ve made, and she doesn’t seem to do the same for me. We haven’t gone out on a date since June- even though I’ve tried-, she often makes excuses saying she has already made plans with her female friends. I know she’s with her friends because I always see pictures of them doing stuff together on social medias that I’d love to be doing with her. 

Now I am the one feeling neglected in the relationship. Frankly I’m pissed off after I’ve made many adaptations for her over the past year but she doesn’t seem to respect me enough to reciprocate. It seems I’m used for a place to keep her stuff, provide some support financially, and put a roof over her head. I am very close now to just calling it quits with her but I do still love her, and it surely would be better if we could stay together. However, I am not willing to derail my own aspirations and mental/physical health for someone who comes across so selfish and possibly unfaithful to our monogamous relationship. All my family and friends say I could do so much better than her, and that she’s probably only with me for the future possibility of providing her with a cushy lifestyle. Now I’m starting to think they’re right, unless she shows that she can take an interest in us. So if you read that wall of text you’re an awesome person and you deserve some sort of prize. What would you suggest? 

TL;DR I had many responsibilities and obligations for approximately 5 months, and I could spend little time with my gf. She doesn’t like it, I make time for her, find out she’s sexting other guys, she apologizes, find out again, she apologizes…yet again, then she says I spend too much time with her, now we just switched places, and I’m the neglected one. What would you suggest her or I do?

2ajaoe,1,2014-07-12,Cheap monthly transportation options in Vegas?,NeedTransportation,LasVegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/2ajaoe/cheap_monthly_transportation_options_in_vegas/,"Hi.

I'm doing an internship in downtown Vegas and don't have a car and am having a lot of trouble with transportation. The bus system here is terrible, I tried biking but I was getting flats literally once every other day because the streets are so poorly maintained here and there is broken glass and shit everywhere. I also felt like I was constantly about to die due to the terrible/drugged-out drivers.

At the moment, I'm walking. But it sucks hard. On most days I walk about 6 miles in the heat, get to work totally drenched, etc. It's also extremely time consuming. 

Do you guys have any other ideas? I looked into renting a car...but I can't find anything cheaper than $900/month since I'm under 25. The most I could really do would be like $400/month. 

I also know that you can ride a 49cc scooter here without a registration, etc. So I looked into buying one...but it's all so shady. And I feel like it's really dangtherous to ride a scooter here. I figured maybe I could rent a scooter since it's likely the rental company will maintain their scooters decently---but that will cost more than to rent a car!

Anyone have any ideas? Or any loopholes to get rent a car on the cheap for someone under 25?

Thanks."
2ajeaz,1,2014-07-12,I wasted 4 years doing absolutely nothing. What can I do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ajeaz/i_wasted_4_years_doing_absolutely_nothing_what/,"I will go ahead and give detailed information because this is a throwaway account. I'll try to make it as easy to read as possible.   

&gt; I graduated High School in June of 2010. I had a 2.8 GPA and an ACT score of 19. According to the ""guidelines"" that would give me a very low chance of being accepted to the University of Utah. I didn't have any scholarships and I didn't worry much because my dad has a business that is successful and could help me pay for school. I figured I would just go to Community College. So I did just that. I applied and they accepted, which they always do. The school I went to was Salt Lake Community College. I declared a Computer Science major because I want to program. I've always wanted to do that since I got my first computer when I was 10 years old. I took a semester and dropped out because I wanted to work. So I got a Full Time job and dropped out of school. Two years later I joined again, and once again dropped out because I was depressed and couldn't sit through a class let alone go to work. I also lost my job and just sat at home and played video games all the time. I dabbled here and there over the years with HTML, CSS and some Java. I know basics for Java and I'm mediocre with HTML and CSS. That's just website development so that doesn't matter to me. I decided it was time to get my life back in order. I feel better about myself and I reapplied to school. I'll be going back to Community College hopefully this fall. I have $1,000 to pay for the tuition I had back in 2012 that I will take care of this week. I just have a few questions I'd like to ask to hopefully get a better understanding, some words of encouragement and some tips if you will. Hopefully someone who was in my situation can help me out here.

1. Is Community College frowned upon? I read the FAQ and it doesn't give much information.
2. I have to start with Math 0990 which is Elementary Algebra pretty much and have to finish Calculus II to be able to transfer over to the University of Utah. So that means that I will probably have to take 6+ semesters to be able to catch up. Does this hinder me in any way? Is there a faster way to get through these math classes?
3. How do internships work if you go to a Community College? Will people still take me? When should I apply? First or second year, or should I wait to get into UofU?
4. I have to work Full-Time. Go to school at night. I bought a $700 a month car, with a shitty APR. Has anyone had to do this? Is it possible? Juggling school, work and homework seems like it will be near impossible to have a social life let alone be able to do my own side projects. My dads business isn't doing that amazing anymore so he's kind of strapped and I work so I can basically pay my car. 
5. Is there a way to get into a State University even though I didn't have the grades for it and have been out of school for pretty much 4 years now?
6. Should I take back my car... don't really want to do this... and find a part-time job to focus more on my projects and school. 
7. Is it worth sticking with Java or should I first learn something like C++ or Python?
8. Is the University of Utah a good school to get a bachelor's in Computer Science in? My goal is to be a Software Engineer.


I'm still learning Java and so far it's coming along great. The community college focuses on Java programming, not sure what the State University focuses on. I'm willing to put my all into this. I'm sick of wasting time and my life. I have friends who are in there 3rd year of college and I'm not even in my first. I'm so much better than this and everyone tells me this. I was just depressed for so long without telling anyone anything that I just sat here and dreaded living. It's going to be a hard and long journey, but I'm excited and willing to make the effort to succeed. I'm only 22... I'm still young right?

Thank you all for taking the time in reading my post. I would do a TL;DR but it doesn't seem possible since I have so many questions.

I would say that I have a moderate grasp of C++, and I am trying to improve as much as possible. I have a very high GPA and I study as much as I can. I'll be taking some more advanced classes and I will be covering some important topics for SEs, such as Data Structures.

Though I've been quite worried lately. Every time I feel like taking a break or just relaxing, I can't because I'm worried that I don't know enough for when I go into an internship and eventually a job. Some of these things people talk about for side projects I would have no idea how to start. I've tried working with a framework for C++ called Qt, and it felt like a whole other language. I really don't know what I should be learning. Should I be trying as many APIs as I possibly can? I've never really had a decent side project to show off and I'd really like to make one but I have no idea what to do really.

I think I'm in that transition stage where I can understand the easy stuff but I don't know what to do for the intermediate/hard stuff.

Does anyone have any experiences they can share?"

I wanted to ask for some advice on how to pay for my graduate school and subsequent living expenses starting this fall. Just some personal background, I'm 22 yo and pursuing a Master's degree in International Affairs from The George Bush School at TAMU. I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science (minor in IR) from a small but reputable liberal arts college a month ago. Fortunately, my family has been very gracious and I have incurred no debt, coupled with me having a four year internship and coaching three teams throughout college. However, reality has hit me and the prospect of paying for graduate school is quite daunting- frankly I feel quite broke and am afraid for my financial future. More specifically, any advice on how much to take out for a loan? The loan will pay for my tuition and housing. Ideally a job will pay for personal day-to-day expenses (groceries, gas, etc.) 

**A Quick Financial Synopsis:**

* No Undergraduate Debt.
* No Savings due to two family tragedies.
* Roughly $2,000 in Checking Account. 
* Part Time Job Currently due to me relocating (professional coaching-so good experience and pay but few hours in summer months). Currently looking for job in new city to pay for personal expenses. 
* Opened up Discover Student Credit Card to start building credit. 

**Expected Debts:**

1^st Yr. Tuition: **Tad &gt;$6,000** 

1^st Yr. Leasing Fees (12 month, Utilities Included): **~$10,000**


2^nd Yr. Tuition (scholarship may be prorated at 75% depending upon GPA): **$7,250-$11,000**

2^nd Yr. Leasing Fees: **Hopefully Less?**

This great woman and I met months back before she was left for an internship across the country. After dating for less than a month, she was gone. We are simply ""dating"" but I'd like to pick up where we left off when shes back. No long distance minutes so we email almost every day. Sometimes we skype. She has a very busy schedule, but we work around it. I really like her. I am counting down every day until she gets home in 34 days!

I started to see a red flag in her a few months ago. We would talk about our days and I was telling her that one of my closest friends was acting off. She asked if maybe this friend had feelings for me. My friend is straight and dating a guy so I just chuckled. I never told her this but she was right. About two weeks after my friend broke up with her boyfriend and tried to pull me in for a kiss. She confessed her feelings to me. I told her I didn't have the same feelings. I debated telling the woman I'm dating, but everyone told me it would only upset her.

Now as soon as I say I went somewhere or did something with this friend, she's overly attentive. She always calls me ASAP and asks about what we did. She asks me questions about her, situations we were in, and then gets very flirtatious or sweet with me. She showers me with compliments.

I think she's afraid that things are going to go further between me and my friend. I don't want to lie about who I've been socializing with, and I don't want to call her out on what she seems to be feeling right now. The way she gets so worked up about it shows me it hurts her a little, but she has nothing to worry about. I've told her that the only person always on my mind is her. I don't want my friend to be anything more than a friend to me. I've also turned down dates with other women because I have feelings for her, and I'm not interested in dating anyone else.

I don't have any idea how to show her that my friend is not a threat. I don't know how to ease her mind."

I made a post about a week ago asking about running pfSense on a laptop using a USB NIC. Here is the final setup:

1. [TP-LINK TL-SG108 8-Port 10/100/1000Mbps Desktop Gigabit Steel Cased Switch](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A121WN6/ref=twister_B00CGJEVK8) (works perfectly)
2. [Plugable USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Gigabit-Ethernet-Network-Adapter/dp/B00AQM8586) (uses the ASIX AX88179 chipset and the axge driver in FreeBSD)
3. [Ubiquiti Networks UniFi AC Enterprise WiFi System - UAP-AC](http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Networks-UniFi-Enterprise-System/dp/B00D80J2XU) (I am only borrowing this from a place which I am working as an intern. UniFi APs are fantastic but man, this ac unit sucks)
4. A Compaq CQ61 (only 10/100, but I don't have a gigabit WAN connection anyway)

The first issue I encountered was the fact that the axge driver for the ASIX AX88179 chipset is only officially supported in FreeBSD 10.1, which means I needed a backport of the driver. I cannot for the life of me get a 64 bit VM of FreeBSD 8.3 to successfully install and compile the module, so I ended up using one on the pfSense forums. After loading the module, everything is fine and the NIC is recognized but it will inexplicably lose its WAN connection without reporting anything in the usual system logs. The only way to fix this is a reboot. The only ""fix"" I could find anywhere was raising the limit on mbufs clusters in FreeBSD with kern.ipc.nmbclusters=""32768"" but that seems to have done nothing. I suppose the next option is either to buy a small managed switch with VLANs or just build a router from the ground up. I'll probably have another go at building an updated version of the driver, but I don't think it is going to make much of a difference."

I finished my first year of college about 2 months ago, and I have been home since. 

I was in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend from high school, but she broke up with me about a month ago. I got an unpaid internship at an IT place, and it has quickly become very boring and uninteresting. To go along with that, some of my friends that I wanted to hang out with this summer from high school have definitely changed a lot, and it is just really uncomfortable being with them now.

My 2nd year of college doesn't start until August 25th, and I have never looked forward to anything more in my life. I feel like my life is there now, and I can't wait for the next month or so to pass. 

For the past couple of weeks, I have been in an intense psychological debate with my conscious about rationalizing masturbation. I have fapped a number of times, but it really isn't worth it. It just isn't. 

I've never been one to watch porn, but that doesn't mean I haven't had a fair share of faps in my youth. Girls on Facebook, Twitter etc.

I've tried to use this as a rationalization: ""hey, I don't watch porn, whats the problem with rubbing it out every now and then to some cute girls on social media?""

And I try to use summer as a rationalization too: ""I still have a while before school, its okay if I do this just to pass the time right?"". 

No. No No No. It's not alright. Every time I masturbate, For the next day or two I feel like shit. My mind is cloudy, I lack the motivation to do anything, and I'm just tired. So what if I'm not having the awesome summer I was looking forward whilst I was trudging through finals week? 

I still have my mom and dad, I still play basketball and go to the gym, I still have a few good buds who are still true friends, I still have my two awesome dogs, I'm learning to play the harmonica and I'm enjoying reading books more. Masturbation honestly just destroys all the genuine feeling I get from all of these people/things. I'm putting my foot down.

If you're going to take anything away from my story its this: no matter how you're feeling, no matter what your circumstances are- don't masturbate. It just isn't worth it."

Around two months ago, I started a new job with a ton of enthusiasm. I love the company and the people...but the workload is killing me and I'm apparently not even up to a full workload yet. While this is only my second ""real"" job (but my first new position since finishing my BA), I am not new to time-management and task prioritization; I have worked two jobs (one full-time, one part) and gone to school (6 credits) at the same time and been less stressed out than I am now.

I'm continually having new things added to my plate before I can even make a dent in what's already there, especially since I'm still learning things. It's very frustrating to plan out how I'm going to spend my time for the week only to have something huge thrown at me on Monday afternoon and having to force it in with everything else I'm already doing. The only way I'm truly managing to keep my head above water is by working on things in my limited free-time which isn't a sustainable strategy given some circumstances in my personal life. I've mentioned my stress level to my manager and, perhaps I haven't been assertive enough about it, but my concerns have gotten brushed off for the most part.

As someone who has lived their life as a perfectionist and is generally able to stay very much on top of everything, it's really difficult to accept that I just might not be cut out for this job in the long-term. I've already turned to upping my dosage of antidepressants and using low-level doses of anti-anxiety drugs (under a doctor's supervision) as the stress has exacerbated previous depression and anxiety issues, but I'm starting to think it isn't worth it.

If I start looking for another job, do I include this short stint on my resume? The only other resume-worthy jobs I have are a 4 year stint at the job I left for this one and a summer internship. Will I look like a job-hopper trying to find something else so soon? Should I try to stick this job out for at least a year to see if I eventually adapt to the stress? The thought of being a quitter really bothers me, but so does the thought of being so anxious for another 9-10 months. I'm getting a lot of valuable experience from this job, but at what cost?"

**********
I am not a religious man.


I don't believe in the metaphysical. Too easy for a mind eager to embrace the ridiculous, the nonsensical, the gibberingly insane. 


This (dis)ability lends me a certain flexibility of thought. I can perceive and grasp, twist and turn and reshape in my head. 
It has granted me some facility with humor, has lent understanding to difficult to grasp concepts, persons, and situations. And those moments when my double hinged tongue have brought someone laughter, or tears, or dare I say, sexual excitement, I have felt truly filled with purpose and the sense of connection with the cosmic some find through God. 


Through understanding, I have known, am known. Become more, and lesser than. A constant and an instant, a tiny fraction and the whole. All through these glyphs and their utterances.


This flexibility has allowed a portion of my perception to be freed from the burdens of reality, and that lightening of body and mind, where gravity refuses to weigh me down.


But reality has sharp fangs. 


The tarot deck signifies The Fool as a wanderer, a journeyman, one foot hanging inexorably over a cliff. His face is smiling, one hand is raised in greeting, or recognition, farewell or tribute. It matters not. He is registering something meaningless in the face of his fate. His intent is lost to gravity. Head in the clouds, foot firmly loosed in midair. 


In discussing my mental illness, I have often employed simile and metaphor. It's easy enough to tell someone you hear disembodied voices that whisper vile things in your ears. Mock your inability to sleep. But the concept seems more easily grasped when couched in the metaphysical. 


Tormented by demons? Plagued by spirits? These conditions have been recognized far longer than a simple breakdown of organic compounds within your brain. 


I've always called my tormentor my Passenger. He's a colorful fellow, I must admit. His creativity in discouraging me is quite impressive. In those moments when I am barren of thought, he floods forward with torrents of energy. 

It's a little impressive in volume for a nonexistent entity. What weight does a ghost have? Can you trip on the quantum?

So the idea that my tormentor is greater than me, some sort of spiritual aggressor, is an attractive one. But I feel it somewhat disingenuous or dishonest. An easily grasped handle. Somehow relieving myself of responsibility in being possessed.

But I was recently ridden by a loa.

This concept of possession from voodoo makes a person a vehicle for a spiritual being, some good, some of ill will. They are feared and respected. 

The person possessed, usually a respected shaman, works themselves into a hyper-real trance state through dance, and music, and intoxication. Then the spirit runs through them. 


I've had some pretty spectacular mental lapses. I usually come to a moment of great stress, of hopelessness, and my mind snaps into what I call ""Bullethead Mode"".


I become fearless. I sleep little. I process quickly, efficiently, though  perhaps without the greatest depth. I like to think that it lends me some situational awareness, Though if I were to use a video game analogy, I would probably be more like the noob who sprays-and-prays, and less like the seasoned veteran who holds fast and chooses his battles. 


This has kept me alive in situations that more rational or normal folks have simply shook their heads at. But it also means that occasionally I lower my head and charge directly into a brick wall. 


My most recent adventure, however, lacked something. Control, or really, any sense of any kind whatsoever. 


I'm going to attempt to parse this together in an entertaining manner, recognizing that the emotion involved is coming in hindsight and reflection. At the time, I don't recall any emotional reactions at all. I'm attempting to understand what happened, learn, and grow.

So here's the breakdown. Strap in. 

It was moving day. I was moving out.

Things were in flux, but I felt good. I had the advice of a trusted counselor, and no more than general anxiety about the day. Things were certainly not as bad as they could have been, have been in the past, but were definitely shifting. I recall feeling good.

I collected my few belongings in the driveway and called a cab. My local hack has been a longtime source of good service, but lately has become a wretched hive of scum and villainy. 

The guy wanted a fifteen dollar ""moving fee"" to transport my items to storage. We had some back and forth, but much less hysterical than my reaction to the driver who awarded himself an unsanctioned ""tip"". 

But, pioneers get scalped, don't they? 

So we negotiated, and off we went into the unknown. 

Maybe this is where the loa rode me. Maybe here is where the demon took control. Maybe this is all hogwash and a combination of high spirits, strong coffee, and a sense of adventure filled me. I changed my destination. I was going to a motel before the storage unit. All of my stuff would enjoy a night of luxury with me. 

Loa. Don't ask me why. 

 
From here, the murk only gets deeper. By my own design. I checked in, shaved and bathed, and went for breakfast.

I had cash. A fair amount. But I also recall an ATM, and a lotto like flurry of bills. 


Playa, playa. 

I had a drink at the cafe. They didn't have dark rum, so the Cap'n and I were messmates. Some breezy conversation, and I was on my way. 

One Captain Morgan and soda. That's it. Honest injun. 

So it's about four hours later, and I'm in across town in a cab with a meter that looks more like a latitude reading than a price. Not the greatest amount I've ever spent on transport, but substantial. 

The man with me goes by the handle John Poop. No idea why. He is an inveterate junkie. I'm in the mood for some chemical entertainment, and John is the man with the plan. Or rather, the man with The Man. 


""Whaddaya need?""


""Whaddaya got?""

We depart to his lair. He cautions me twice about dosage. I smirk and add more chemicals to the stew. He expresses admiration for my tolerance. No virgin, I, I explain. Yeah, still though, he says. 

Hours later. Back at the hotel. I inform the dour woman behind the counter I will be staying another evening. She replies that I will not.

I am confused. Mr Poop and I did our dirt elsewhere. Perhaps my scarlet flush and massive pupils were the ticket out. 

No matter. These plebes do not desire the business of the maestro? Cabbie, away!

A new hotel. I go to dinner. 


Prime rib, rare. Blue cheese wedge salad, extra balsamic. Fried onions. That nice sweet bread, and butter. 

I don't eat a bite. I have it boxed up, pay my tab, get another cab.

Some more murk. Then, a bar. A friendly couple. A *very* friendly couple. 

I can't remember where the fuck the motel is. Somewhere between the steakhouse and the bar I got turned around. The couple is no help, the key is plain, old fashioned, on an unmarked fob. 

Another Goddamn expensive taxi ride. I could have financed a vehicle on this night. 

Back at the hotel. There were sexytimes. I'm certain of that. Things were...sticky. None of the condoms I bought were used.


Early morning. I go for coffee. 


The man at the counter is treating me like a dangerous child. This is confusing. Aren't I maintaining? 

I pull out my wallet, and retrieving my card produces a magician's prestidigitation. A thousand cards explode everywhere. Every card I've ever owned, applied for, held, seen on a commercial suddenly hit the floor. 

I bend to pick up my surfeit of plastic. My back complains. 


Back at the hotel. I'm late for checkout. I beg for a few extra minutes. Explain about my back. 

I manage to make it to the storage space. I collapse. 


I awake on the side of the road. Behind a garbage can. I am wearing torn and soiled pants. My belt is gone. 

I limp to the storage shed. My affairs are in disarray. Easily noticed as missing: Laptop, phone, all my kitchen wares.

I'm full of drugs, but not high. I've dined in restaurants and not eaten a bite. I've drank in bars, but am not drunk. I've had sex...I think. 

And the small of my back is a small sun of fire and searing discomfort. My entire world is bent into a furious piece of bone and sinew. 

My head simply explodes. 

I've had it, I think. This is it. As low as I can go. I've done it this time. 

And then, the Passenger speaks up. 


Seemingly silent through the debauch, he chuckles, and says, ""We're just getting started.""

My back is now so Goddamn painful I can only crab walk sideways. I stop looking for answers and start looking for a bus to the hospital. Finally give up and call an ambulance when I become frozen. 

They collect the bag I have been carrying. I have eight phone chargers. Why do I have eight chargers? None of which match the phone I lost? 

The hospital urinalysis actually makes an intern say ""Wow."" I am stuffed with drugs of all shapes and varieties. None of which are helping the searing pain in my back. 

An MRI confirms a herniated disc. There is some discussion but my impression is, you done fucked up, boy. 

I've written out this long ass tale not because I understand what occurred, or what happens next. I'm working on that now. Here on the ward. 

I have trusted advisers and friends helping. It will be a struggle to regain my footing, but I am feeling okay about it. I will go on.

2alxxe,8,2014-07-13,Relocated for a job last month and things don't seem to be adding up.,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2alxxe/relocated_for_a_job_last_month_and_things_dont/,"EDIT: To appease LocationBot. I am located in the US.    
EDIT: Looks like PMs are a problem. I went to school in Oklahoma where I signed the terms of the scholarship and I relocated to South Carolina.

Hello /r/legaladvice I am glad you are here!

Starting at the beginning, I accepted a scholarship that left me in dept to my current employer i.e(I got my tuition paid for and in exchange I work for them for two years). After graduating (Early May 2014), we agreed on a start date at the beginning of June. Later I received at tentative offer of ~60K in salary for the duration of my employment. Then the Friday before I started work I received a phone call stating that the initial offer was in error and I would only be making ~40K. The real problem is that I was also obligated to work as an intern during the summers I was a student (wording is bad sorry)... the pay that I was making then as an intern is what I am making now not the 40K salary. I have been waiting for them to get this changed for over a month. I am a full time employee as well, but I was told by HR that until I have an effective start date at the higher pay scale I wont be able to receive benefits. We made no agreement on salary when I accepted the scholarship, but surely they can't legally require me to work for them for two years and keep me at barely above minimum wage with no benefits. I have looked over what I signed and they didn't mention in the document how I could pay them back i.e(interest rate or time period) if I were to breach the contract.

//RANT 
So confused by what is going on and my employer has irritated me to the point that if this doesn't get resolved within the next month I might consider relocating back home. I could easily move back home and make more than I am making now. My parents have offered to pay off what I owe(I am really lucky. Not to mention if I had no savings I wouldn't have been able to pay my bills last month). This seems, so f###ed up. I mean if this were someone else with no family to support them or money to fallback on they would be screwed and it pisses me off to think that I may not be the only one to have been put in this situation. Also, the only job I have ever held is a part time computer tech job. If I am being unreasonable in having expected this to not be an issue i.e.(expecting my first pay check to reflect a 40K salary, having benefits, etc.) please just tell me I am being a brat and need to give them more time. I'll admit I am ignorant of a lot of the laws and terms I should have made myself aware of before accepting this scholarship. Any advice legal or otherwise will be appreciated. Hopefully, my employer will have this resolved soon.

//QUESTIONS 
How fubar would I be by any repercussions for resigning(Not sure if resigning is even the right word given the circumstances)?
If they make an unreasonable claim for compensation what can I legally do to counter it? Would that mean court?
If I pay back the tuition and stipend how will that be reflected in taxes?

Thanks for reading.

I had a 3.8 gpa all through out high school and I plan to keep it that way through college (i know college is different)

2am70u,13,2014-07-13,Over a year since I've smoked.,kriskris4,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2am70u/over_a_year_since_ive_smoked/,"I was a daily user who smoked as soon as I got up, got really high, fell asleep, and woke up to smoke again and again, until I finished my stash. That was my life for a while. Unfortunately I started having mental health issues and after a bad accidental mixture of drugs had my first psychotic break which led to a suicide attempt. 

After that break, smoking pot alone would trigger psychosis. I struggled with this with hospitalizations for a couple of years. It still didnt stop me from getting high. One day my psychosis got really bad and I was scared to start getting high on weed again. After that I started abusing the benzos that my doctor prescribed me. After being in a drug addiction support group for two years, I finally have over 6 months of being clean and sober from all substances. I dont have a problem with alcohol, although when I drink I get very drink and cant really control how much I do drink. When I am drunk I start craving marijuana again and the other drugs I have done when I decide to start getting high/drunk again.

Anyway, it's been over a year since I've smoked weed and I can listen to music and enjoy it like I did when I was getting high. It's not the same and music definitely had it's edge when I was stoned but when I listen to music now I definitely enjoy it at a level where I can dance and have fun with the music. I was scared that I wouldnt be able to enjoy music anymore without the weed.

Marijuana is a mild hallucinogen, and completely affected the way I saw things and perceive things. It made everything profound and interesting, and sometimes I lack that in my life. However, having lots of friends in my support group and learning coping mechanisms and how to enjoy life sober has given me the opportunity to find a new zest in life. I highly enjoy the time I spend with my friends. I dont think about getting high anymore. I only talk about drugs or drinking when I am discussing things within my support group. 

The thought of getting drunk or high is a fleeting moment when I see beer commercials or something or I smell weed. I dont obsess over it anymore and I can live life sober. Being high was fun but I was lost in a world of my own and didnt know how to interact with the world around me without  being high. Also, it wasnt like I was doing a great job being high either. I had no social skills and would just sit there being high as a kite happy about nothing. I would be happy about ignoring people around me and not interacting with them. Now, I have the skills to be able to interact with the world around me and I've learned so much. I learn much more about myself every single day.

Not having a drink or a drug in my system has taught me how to love myself and enjoy being the person I am without wanting to alter the way I think. If I did start drinking again it would just lead me to other drugs especially pot. Pot is my favorite drug not alcohol. I do like MDMA however it is a hallucinogen just like pot and it will not mix well with the mind I have today. 

I need to take prescription medication to maintain my mental health. I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder with bipolar depression. This is all due to my drug use in the past. Pot just makes things worse and makes me want to off myself  because I am too sensitive to peoples' energies and I think I am on acid or something and tapping into a reality that doesnt exist. That's what I'm like when I'm off my meds. 

Life is beginning to be fun again, amidst having not such a high energy level due to depression, however I do have the tools to cope with it. I stay connected with friends (I pick up the phone and keep in touch etc.), I go to social gatherings with sober people and spend leisure time with friends and family, and I write and do some introspective work. I also take medication which helps me. I do not take any benzodiazepines because I do not need them. The obsession to use or drink has been lifted from me and I do not think like picking up. 

Because I am doing better my life is turning out for the better. I am doing well in school and I am 4 classes away from finishing a two year certification program that I enrolled in. I also am doing an internship at an all mens recovery home in which I might be hired to work as an assistant soon. I am studying to be an alcohol and drug counselor in which I can support peoples' journeys in recovery and help them find a better life for themselves. 

Many people have problems because of drugs and or alcohol and I think that if people do run into problems the best thing to do is use harm reduction strategies or to abstain completely from any mind altering substances. When I get high I am cheating myself out of a real experience I can have with myself and others. I am rewarding myself for no reason without doing any real work to gain the joy and understanding of doing a hard days work or having a deep conversation with someone.

I know this is a long post but I'd just like to share my experiences. I still joke around with my friends about the times I used to get high but unfortunately at the end we have gone through more troubles than the time it was just an innocent person getting high and not having any consequences. 

I do believe marijuana should be legal because alcohol is legal and is definitely more harmful than marijuana. Also, it helps people stay away from more harmful drugs so that they dont have the chance to run into harder drugs because of dealers and get themselves into more trouble than they should, and get into the dark world of harder drugs.

Marijuana was fun, but it also caused a lot of problems and it has taken me years to gain insight about what I really did to myself. My suicide attempt was very painful and I have scars. The insanity is that sometimes I dont think it was a big deal and I brush it off. However the longer I stay sober I feel that it was a big event and I make damn sure I do the right things to stay away from those situations in the future and help others recover from their own problems.

Good luck guys and I hope I helped someone.

Thanks!"

2amhpl,1,2014-07-13,[MF] Stolen Work,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/2amhpl/mf_stolen_work/,"	Whenever I'm on campus I always make it a point to stop for a drink from the same fountain in an alcove of the English building around the corner from my creative writing lab. My intentions are not  so much directed by my physical thirst, but by the certainty of her presence. Perpetually hanging out in her frame above the fountain, she gazes out at me from amidst a charcoal tangle of bed sheets. Her shoulders and clavicle are curves of smooth brown velum stroked by her maker's pencil. He created perfection in her eyes. They draw me to her like inky pools of pulsing gravity. Often, I end up stooped over with my gaze averted towards the ceiling slurping much longer than I need to. 
	The sketch is titled, In the Morning. How many times I have wished to have actually been there on that morning, to be the lucky one who first saw her lying there in the flesh, a vision to inspire any form. He's the one who gets all the credit on the placard though. “Troy Munro, American, b. 1986. Troy's works in many mediums are inspired by placid scenes of everyday reality.” Everyday reality? Who are these curators kidding? Girls like that don't exist in everyday life! They inexplicably manifest out of some interdimensional field of radical perfection, on a collective mission to populate artists' receptions and backstage band interviews. “So,” the man with the tape recorder asks, “where do you draw your inspiration from?”
	What was it like on that first morning when he woke up in her bed? Was he so smitten that he immediately leapt up and reached for his notebook and pencil to immortalize the moment? Would she have thought he was weird if he did? Was she complicit? Is she a model? One thing I know for certain is that she was drawn in her natural habitat, completely at home, wrapped half modestly in those rumpled sheets. No, it can't have been the very first morning because no human being could possible exude that kind of perfectly serene languor after such an uncertain, seminal night as the one which surely preceded, could they? That would be so cool. I wish I knew who she was, and whether or not her and Troy Munro's relationship came to the eventual, fortuitous demise that I'm imagining. 
	I live with my girlfriend, Jenny, in an apartment off campus, and we mostly get along. Sometimes we seem to get so busy though that we exist merely as images passing through each other's space. The cohabitation thing really didn't come about as the result of a well thought out plan, it more or less just happened. My old roommate dropped out of school in the middle of last semester and bailed on the lease. Two weeks went by and nobody responded to the fliers I hung on billboards around campus. My ad said, “Space available. Potential applicants should be fastidiously undistinguished, not lacking in discretion, and tasteful in habit and manner. 1 bedroom, separate bath, $400/mo. plus utilities.” I guess I was looking for another ultra-ironic English major. At least Jenny puts up with my mess making.
	Last week I left a Facebook conversation up on my monitor with a girl from my Film and Lit. class about an extracurricular movie we watched together. During the ensuing hostilities I tried to cobble together some kind of scholastic justification for our liaison, but Jenny tested my fumbling excuses like a tuning fork and they all rang hollow. That night I slept in the computer room, on the floor in a sleeping bag, staring up at the glow of my desktop.
	The next day I found myself back at the fountain, head bowed as if in wistful supplication. Please relieve the futility of my situation. As I gaze at her portrait her voice glides smooth as pulp into my ear, “It's already a perfect morning, Robert.” Now that I'm lying next to her I'm beginning to understand the image from a different perspective. That stack of books on her nightstand wasn't visible from the other side of the fountain. She's obviously a grad student; every volume meets my perspicuous approval- discourses by Barthes, a collection of Thoreau, confessions of Augustine, even a door stopping volume of DFW. The same voices flow through her supple mind as through mine. We hardly need to speak, but we do. Dialog after dialog, bantering easily in the most natural poetry and prose, there in her room, in the morning.
	Back at the apartment that evening and Jenny can't believe that I didn't bring home any take-out for dinner. Seriously, after yesterday, I can't even bother to grab some Chinese? The cable has been cutting in and out all evening and she tried to call but the account is in my name and they won't do anything unless I talk to them. But the call center is closed now because I took my sweet time coming home. Don't I understand that she would have cleaned the kitchen if she hadn't had her class and then her internship, and what had I been doing all morning at home by myself anyway? Maybe if I controlled my time better, both of our lives would be a lot easier. Oh yeah, and have I checked my fucking Facebook lately?
	That night I lay curled up on the floor and dreamed of stealing that picture.
	In the morning, when I am with her, time ceases to function in its usual jet propulsed way. Her artfully tossed sheets freeze sloping rifts in the continuum between space, time, and everything else. We clamber barely clothed among the many incidental ridges, trekking the badland hills of her linens like a couple of early morning wanderers trying to rediscover where we pitched our tent. She stokes the smoldering campfire and boils organic fair-trade coffee for us in a speckled green percolator. Even in the desert wilds, this one has class.
	It's nine P.M. and students and faculty are clearing the academic building in mass exodus. I have very little desire to go home, and my company has already been politely declined via text from the girl from Film and Lit.. Sitting on a bench in a deserted hallway reading Don Delillo, I must look like I'm waiting for someone. In a way, I suppose I am. I unzip my backpack and wander around the corner to the fountain. There's a moment where my adrenaline jumps and I am petrified that someone is about to come out of the restroom while I'm stuffing her into my bag. I feel kind of creepy to be honest, but I can tell that she wants to come home with me. So I commence with the theft. At the last second I decide to snatch the descriptive tag along with it. Now the only evidence left of her abduction is a tiny white hook. These corridors are hung like art galleries; nobody will even notice that she's gone.
	When I get home, Jenny is already shut off in the bedroom watching HBO on the DVR. Right now I am ever so grateful to be separated, even just by walls and noise. I don't dare get a hammer and nail out right now to hang her properly, so I just lean the frame up against the wall on the back of my computer desk. I check online to make sure I haven't missed any messages, fiddling around with the title placard while I click around and think. This tag is evidence against me. It has got to go. I already know the title of the piece, and of course the preeminent Troy Munro signed his own work. There's no getting around that, but it's mine now. Sorry about it friend. I'll just throw this card in the dumpster tomorrow when I go out for a smoke. But that's in the morning. For right now I'm just going to sit here in my computer chair for a while and just stare at her.

From someone who should know from his personal experience.  Good advice at the end – share this with every female democrat you know!

STRIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH.  BETTER TAKE THIS MAN SERIOUSLY.  

By Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill Clinton.

                 

AN ANALYSIS  WORTH READING.

                 

If you happen to see the Bill Clinton 5-minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware.  As I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone, I offer a few corrections.

                 
Bill says:

""In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.""

                 

The facts are:

Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.  She went to court every day as part of a  law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.

                 
Bill says:

""Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.""

                 

The facts are:

Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.

                 
Bill says:

""Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.""

                 
The facts are:

She flunked the DC bar exam; yes, flunked.  It is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar.  She had no job offers in Arkansas - none - and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there.  She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.

                 

Bill says:

""President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its chairman.""

                 
The facts are: 

The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy.  Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.

                 

Bill says: ""She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital.""

The facts are:  Yes, she did.  But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the WalMart board of directors for a substantial fee.  She was silent about their labor and health care practices.

                 
Bill says:

""Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.""

The facts are:

Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP.  It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott.  I know; I  helped negotiate the deal.  The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement.  Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.

                 
Bill says:

""Hillary  was the face of America all over the world.""

                 
The facts are:

Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House.  Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.

                 
Bill says:

""Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues.""

                 
The facts are:

Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation.  One set up a national park in Puerto Rico.  A second  provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions.  And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation.  Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize the Woodstock fiasco of 40 years ago.

                 

Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country (that's you and me!) when it comes to the war on terror.

                 

1.    She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.

                 

2.    She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.

                 

3.    She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.

                 
4.    She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.

                 
5.    She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military &amp; CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.

                 
One cannot think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our country and make it a more dangerous situation for all of us.  Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.

                 

Share this with every female democrat you know .... ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong.  Think  about it - Dick Morris has said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for defamation of character!  And you better believe Hilary would sue him. 
Is America ready for a woman president? 
I believe we are, just NOT this one!

2amqf3,3,2014-07-13,[MF] Stolen Work,digitalburrito,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/2amqf3/mf_stolen_work/,"Whenever I'm on campus I always make it a point to stop for a drink from the same fountain in an alcove of the English building around the corner from my creative writing lab. My intentions are not  so much directed by my physical thirst, but by the certainty of her presence. Perpetually hanging out in her frame above the fountain, she gazes out at me from amidst a charcoal tangle of bed sheets. Her shoulders and clavicle are curves of smooth brown velum stroked by her maker's pencil. He created perfection in her eyes. They draw me to her like inky pools of pulsing gravity. Often, I end up stooped over with my gaze averted towards the ceiling slurping much longer than I need to. 
	
The sketch is titled, In the Morning. How many times I have wished to have actually been there on that morning, to be the lucky one who first saw her lying there in the flesh, a vision to inspire any form. He's the one who gets all the credit on the placard though. “Troy Munro, American, b. 1986. Troy's works in many mediums are inspired by placid scenes of everyday reality.” Everyday reality? Who are these curators kidding? Girls like that don't exist in everyday life! They inexplicably manifest out of some interdimensional field of radical perfection, on a collective mission to populate artists' receptions and backstage band interviews. “So,” the man with the tape recorder asks, “where do you draw your inspiration from?”
	
What was it like on that first morning when he woke up in her bed? Was he so smitten that he immediately leapt up and reached for his notebook and pencil to immortalize the moment? Would she have thought he was weird if he did? Was she complicit? Is she a model? One thing I know for certain is that she was drawn in her natural habitat, completely at home, wrapped half modestly in those rumpled sheets. No, it can't have been the very first morning because no human being could possible exude that kind of perfectly serene languor after such an uncertain, seminal night as the one which surely preceded, could they? That would be so cool. I wish I knew who she was, and whether or not her and Troy Munro's relationship came to the eventual, fortuitous demise that I'm imagining. 
	
I live with my girlfriend, Jenny, in an apartment off campus, and we mostly get along. Sometimes we seem to get so busy though that we exist merely as images passing through each other's space. The cohabitation thing really didn't come about as the result of a well thought out plan, it more or less just happened.

2amqw3,3,2014-07-13,"feel like shit lately, trying to nail down my actual issues",Yqa,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/2amqw3/feel_like_shit_lately_trying_to_nail_down_my/,"well, I am a talk-thinker. If it's really important, I gotta talk about it to think. I am literally gonna vent and I don't care if you answer or not, but i figured I'd do this here since writing in an online journal, nobody could possibly comment with suggestions and I don't know who else has as much time to sit around and listen to my problems as my good old laptop.

I just got back from what I'd call a pretty good weekend. But once again, I keep having these little near-romantic-occurrences where something happens where I'm getting very close with certain girls and later on I regret not moving in faster, then I also have times where I move too fast and regret acting like such an idiot (most of these occurrences happen when drunk) and then I wonder about the girls who I have basically fucked it up with by acting too forward with them. Part of me says, hey, Don't give a shit about it, if they were worth it they would stick around. But sometimes the friend circle I'm in seems smaller and I feel like people know me as an asshole who everyone either does or eventually will hate. I also need to learn the golden rule, don't shit where you eat. 

Problem is, I really care about this stuff. I try not to, I read all the time that the literal worst thing you can do when you're trying to get a girl is to...try to get a girl. Then people say shit about how it's like fishing. Well every time it's happened for me, which has been enough to say I at least sorta get it, I had to stick my hand in there and pull it out. If I sat on my ass, it was gonna pass me up. Shit doesn't just fall in place for me, ever. Like as if either the people who apparently it does for are lying or I'm literally just doing everything wrong. I'm the guy that puts a quarter in the gumball machine and the gumball won't come out cause I turned the crank one too many times. That's okay, I've learned to appreciate working for what you get, but it gets on my nerves to see people who just have everything they'd ever want apparently just straight up handed to them. 

Now with girls it's the same shit as that, I work my ass off just for the 1% that stick around that honestly I don't even like that much. The girls that I really like just don't really seem to like me that much in that manner. Not sure what I can do there, but I try my best to partly learn how to fix that and partly learn how to accept it. If I stop caring completely, I know I'm gonna regret it. I'm in fucking college and I always hear from people how easy it is to hook up and here it is literally almost never happening for me. Certainly never hooking up but even the dating is blah. I partly wonder if I am just not changing my social circle enough, but that's hard to do. I don't have a friend that's literally into the same stuff as me or anything. Most of the time I make a best friend at school, they fucking graduate before I can even do anything with them. I need to make younger friends really.

All the while, I do have a sort of a love interest. But we rarely talk and she's basically been overseas since December, though I did get to see her once in May. She's a damn sweetheart, and she really is cool but I just get irritated by her somehow. There is literally nothing wrong with her, we just sometimes have personality clashes. And partially I also just don't dig not being really in LOVE with her. I just don't want her to not be around, I don't sit around pining for her which I have absolutely done for girls before. I really do want to be in love again.

Honestly that has been an issue as well lately, is that I haven't been with a girl that I really care about that much. It's really fucking depressing. I mean, I know that it could be that I'm looking for something that I don't really want... I am not really sure. If I knew the answer, it would just fix it. But I am sort of getting tired of waiting on the situation which does not seem to be 'clearing up.'

Part of the problem I saw was that I was physically unattractive. I looked like a scrub. And I went to /r/malehairadvice and /r/malefashionadvice and just became more conscious of that stuff. I did /r/keto and lost like 40 pounds. I started lifting, I started trying to make things into systems and just care more about myself, my life and keeping shit in order. Reading self development books. Really just worked on a lot of shit. And as far as I'm concerned, it had nothing to do with the girls. It had to do with me. I wanted a better life so I just started making it happen. Yeah, it's not perfect yet but I just look at me and I am either totally who I want to be in some aspects or I am at least on the right track, mostly anyways. But why does it feel so fucking boring here? Like as if it was easier when I didn't give a shit, and logically can't convince myself to stop giving a shit. I don't mean like I worry, as if I worry about my hair for instance. But I can't convince myself to go get it buzzed or stop doing anything with it. Although I do hear, if you keep doing what you're doing, you're gonna keep getting what you're getting, which for me currently is almost nothing I want. But I don't want to change everything and blow it. Not to mention, I'm not fucking 13 anymore. I know 20 is still a pretty young age but I can't go around whipping around life changes like they're nothing. I mean I could, but I feel like my friends would see me as a joke. And as it is, I already feel like I keep it around my limit. I do shit totally differently very often...if I did it much more I think people might think I was insane.

That said, most of my old friends don't really bond with me much anymore. We're still sort of friends but they've all gone to church together. They are super Christians now and I am the kid in college who drinks and smokes pot and makes money and thinks that this is most of the people in the world and the church going friends have just gone weird. But it is shitty. I just don't have anything in common with these guys anymore, as most of the stuff I do just might turn their stomachs (I.e. fucking random girls (every once in a while), trying random drugs, drinking to get drunk, being an asshole in general for fun) and I really don't dislike the way I live and I have no intention of changing that.

You think you don't have to be much like your friends, and that friend-'love' will guide you through. I call bullshit. My friends and I really think the others are cool but we rarely hang out because they go to church LITERALLY 3 FUCKING TIMES A WEEK. Apparently some churches hold on Saturday and they go there too so literally no day is safe. Ironically, they don't have jobs and they don't have money. They're always a lot happier than me but it's happy like a dog is happy when you throw a tennis ball. I actually value certain worldly things which they don't seem to understand but it's whatever. I am just sad not to have the old guys around anymore. My area is also very secluded, graduated about 125 kids in about 80 square miles of a district. Well I had about 5-10 friends I hung out with and literally every single one is now a full-time church goer, moved away or has a girlfriend. I don't even know where to go to meet people cause I'm fucking 20 which is the lamest age cause I'm just too young to go to bars (which may be no better, fuck if I know) and I'm too old to have hookups from high school who want to hang with new people or something. Home is fucking boring.

At school things always seem pretty good. Things move so quickly there it's hard to even keep track of shit so you stop worrying. I currently spend about 2 hours 30 minutes driving every day. 120 miles a day. I work very far away from home and all of that time behind the wheel really gets you to thinking. I analyze all the fun I'm not having during the time I am doing what is preventing me from having the fun. I wake up at 6 am to get to work late every day, drive 60 miles, do whatever I can to make work less shitty cause I'm just bored there (intern) and after I'm done, I leave. I always worry about how they might actually look at my punch-in/punch-out times and yell at me for it, but it hasn't happened yet so I guess we'll see. 50% of the way through but who knows.

At this point I'm sort of out of breath. There's more shit to say but I am sufficiently out of stuff to talk about for now. I don't know what I need to do but I'm really waiting on shit to stop sucking as soon as possible. And I'm kind of tired of being told by people that it has to suck and that's life. Fuck that. Maybe it's just being 20 or something but I really think it's bullshit that I literally have to be miserable and nothing work out for me for the rest of my life. That's stupid.

Once again, told you the length for this was gonna be unreal. If you read all this or even half of it, you're pretty fucking cool."
2amzct,2,2014-07-13,I think I have Depression.....,OctoSquid0,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2amzct/i_think_i_have_depression/,"(Before going into this, I wanna point out that I have a tendency to get anxiety and I'm an emotional person)

In short: I've had alot of stress over my past roommate since the last week of June. July 10th I moved out and I have a new roommate (she's nice and I'm comfortable with her for now.) I went to the councilor's office the next day, telling her my problems and she suggested that I'd get away from the dorms. So I goto my friend's place for the weekend and I enjoyed myself and all. I was still feeling down, but adleast had some time getting away from the dorms. 

I come back and I feel awful. No inspiration to do anything, every negative thought ends up in me crying my eyes out or just random crying in general, and my appetite is off. I eat a meal and I immediately feel nauseous but I don't vomit or anything.

I'm in college right now (about to enter my 4th year), working 3 days a week in an internship. Most of my friends are gone for the summer and my roommate has a life of her own so I feel lonely not doing anything with anyone and I feel frustrated that I don't have the inspiration to do anything! 

Do I have depression? Can I cure this because I don't want to be medicated!"

I eased through courses because all my tests/quizzes/etc were online for the most part and thus I had my books and resources there to find the answers. Unfortunately, it hasn't helped me retain anything. At least, it feels like it doesn't. I'm not technologically illiterate by any standards and I'm not afraid to take time to look for the answer to problems, but as for the general tech knowledge and facts, I just don't feel like I've retained any of it.

I already have a crappy memory. I always have. But the fact of the matter is, now I'm in debt and I feel like I've wasted two years of my life and there's a required Internship that I feel entirely unprepared for. Especially considering I have no experience in my field while most of my classmates have been in this field for some time (it's a community college the average age is 30+). Add that to a crappy test taking mind, which transfers to crappy interviewee, and it's the worst case scenario.

And just all of this, is killing me. And I know it's my fault, but I can't stop stressing out. I don't know how I can honestly walk in and expect to get any kind of internship.

The only thing I am trying to do is cram study before my interviews and hope that what I heard during lectures comes back to me and I don't make an entire fool out of myself but... ugh.

I feel so dumb."

* **K is the FILTHIEST human being i've ever met!** K showered maaaybe once a week, without owning a razor or bodywash all year. her room always had 10-15 cups/bowls filled with old food and mold, bags of leftover takeout and garbage, *aaaand the litterbox for her cat,* which is where my story begins.

K, as expected, neglected her cat as badly as she neglected every other aspect of her life, even though she claimed she ""loved"" him and ""could never get rid of him"" if anyone were to ask. Here are some examples of how well she ""loved"" her cat:

* **K fed her cat about 2x a week.** not wanting this cat to die, S and i fed him when we could. when the cat ran out of food, K would go DAYS without buying him more, and would only go to the store when she needed to get more cigarettes.  
* (Here's the best one.) **K didn't change the litter, or even scoop the litterbox, once for *FOUR MONTHS*.** the box was in her bedroom, where neither S or I would willingly venture, and because it had a lid and door on it, K was able to keep us from *seeing* how bad the litterbox was, ***BUT THE SMELL...*** 
imagine four months worth of cat shit and ammonia piss, sitting for the entire summer, the hottest months, in the third floor attic of our un-airconditioned house... 
* Because he was bitter and neglected, K's cat was EVIL. K wouldn't pay to declaw him, so the cat shredded every piece of furniture in the house. He sprayed everywhere. He shredded clothes left on the floor. He pulled out the trash and carried it all over the house. He hid around corners and under furniture and lash out, dig in his claws, and bite down on your legs as you walked by. 

S and i planned on taking the cat to the APL to give him a chance at a better life, and telling K he got outside and ran away. but i was terrified that she would find out and give my dog away, who i love more than anything, as retribution. S and i toughed it out the rest of the year, dealing with her and taking care of her cat before moving out. She stole our belongings, food, money, even our medications the entire time, and K never once acknowledged, paid us back, or thanked us for keeping her fucking cat alive the entire year.

---
**FAST FORWARD:**

K moved out one week before S and I did. Obviously, we were all on rocky terms that day and didn't help her move. Her boyfriend came to get her things, and she was gone!

That evening after K moved out, i realize K never brought down any of the dirty dishes from her room! I headed upstairs to K's old room wondering, ""did she take the dishes off of her dressers and just set them on the carpet before moving out?? surely, that would be a low blow, even for K....""

2anbor,2,2014-07-14,T4A mind games (group play),[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2anbor/t4a_mind_games_group_play/,"It's different... He knows I'm different from the moment he laid eyes on me as the interviewer.  My expensive tailored dress suit is radiating confidence; my long and lean legs show off my tall and slim figure.  I carry myself with the air of someone who gets what she wants, all the time.  

We're on the 40th floor looking out and the downtown skyline is bustling with activity, but he tries to focus his mind on one thing: to nail the interview and get the golden internship he wanted. Well... and the subtle cleavage in front of him, probably egging him on to nail the interviewer also.

It doesn't help that I've been flirting with him the entire interview, and he obviously enjoyed it immensely. It was thus pure lust overcoming his senses as I stood up, locked the door from the inside, and commanded him to give up his phone and also to drop his trousers.  

I gobbled up the rock hard cock instantly, pushing him against the long wooden desk and gave him the best head he ever had.  Little did he realize I was also phoning his girlfriend on the mobile, and she was listening intently to everything that went on.  What can I say, I just like to ruin lives, knowing that I can... It's my way of proving to myself that I can manipulate anyone I like.

I finished him off easily, sucking him dry with a smile... I stood back up and handed the phone back, turning it off subtly so she can't call through, but having already noted her phone number.  I send him away now, but made plans to meet up later on.

After he left, I immediately called the girlfriend, sobbing as I tell her how I was molested. I begged her to stay put and avoid contact, and to meet me up after work to see what we can do.

After hanging up with the gf, I called HR and lodged an extremely vague complaint but declining to give details, covering my tracks.  It was only then when I sit back and smile to myself wondering how much fun I can have later on.

_____________________

(F) can play as the GF, you can either team up with me and take revenge on your unfaithful BF, who's been screwing behind her back more than once already. You can also play as the loyal GF after finding out I was in fact the manipulative bitch and plan your revenge.  

(M) can play as the BF, either continuing to be used, even betraying your GF for my pleasures.  You should be enraged when you find out I have tricked you later that I am a TS.

(A) You can also play as the HR who has been suspicious for a while now and deciding too take things into his/her own hands.

Ideally we can find a few people as a group play, but let's see if we hit it off first!"
2ankzr,1,2014-07-14,Is debt worth experience and happiness?,ironyinabucket,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ankzr/is_debt_worth_experience_and_happiness/,"I moved to the UK from Canada for school in September. Prior to coming here I assumed I would go back to Canada at the end of my degree (a 1 year Master's program) and look for work there. Slowly, as I spent more time here, I came to the conclusion that I don't want to go back to Canada for many reasons, the largest one being there are MANY more entry-level jobs in my field here.

I started applying for jobs for post graduation in London, the city I currently live in and where I want to stay, and came to realise that even recruiters wouldn't look at my CV and portfolio until I had at least a couple of months commercial experience. My school had an internship program which extends your degree by a couple of months (instead of finishing my dissertation at the end of September I will finish at the beginning of January) but obtaining an internship is on yourself. My student visa accounts for potentially having an internship already so I don't need to worry about extending it yet (only if I find a full-time job). I decided, because of what I learned through my job search and having heard nothing back from the full-time positions I've applied for and only negative responses from recruiters, that getting an internship is a must, either on the internship scheme with my school or after I graduate.

Here is where the problems start to arise. I applied for both paid and unpaid internships, because I felt I am going to need to have one either way so a few months without wages isn't that big of a deal. I'm not working right now anyway, having covered all expenses for this year using loans from the Canadian government and my parents. But, I've come to realise that once my lease in student housing ends (at the beginning of September) if I extend my degree my housing and transportation costs are going to be at least £600/month (and this is living an hour commute to the school, renting a room in one of the less expensive areas of London). I also know, from experience, that I can probably live off £400/month in expenses (food, bills, etc). I can probably get this lower, but this is me living comfortably and still able to go and do some things I enjoy. Now, £1000/month isn't too bad of a sum. But this cost would be for September, October, November and December, and all my loans are in Canadian dollars. All future loans will be in Canadian dollars, meaning I'm adding another $7400 (converted from £4000) at least to the $80000 I already owe (rounded up, but it's close to that).

If I don't take an internship during my program I will likely go back to Canada and try and find an internship in either country. It's more likely I'll find an internship in London but it will still be expensive, although probably a little less so because I wouldn't consider flying back for an unpaid one. My job hunt is going to be much longer without the internship, and even more so if I go back to Canada. It might be months before I actually get to work if I don't get some experience first. 

What I'm trying to decide is a 3 month internship and a 4 month extension on my dissertation (which would be a huge help in it's completion), plus getting to stay longer in a city I love worth putting myself in that much more debt? Having the internship will give me the experience I need to get an entry-level job and pull me from a salary bracket of about £0-£12000 to £22000/year (or $0 to $45000 if I were to go back to Canada, the difference is from internship pay to entry-level pay), but my debt is still going to take years to pay off. 

I know for the moment I'll be happier here than back home, but I don't know how long that happiness will last if I'm paying off an unmanageable amount of student debt. Based on my calculations I'll only be able to pay back $4000-$5000 a year at first, until I start making more than entry-level wages. Most of my debt is from my parents, so it's interest free, but this will extend my bank loan from something I can pay off in a year or two to something which might take five or six (if I don't get a raise before that). Are there other things I need to consider? Is living with debt really as awful as everyone makes it seem?

tl;dr: Internship will give me experience so I can get a job, plus I will get to stay in a city I love and will get more time to work on my Master's thesis, but I might have to put myself almost $10000 more in debt (where I already have almost $80000) to do it. Worth it?

edit: calculations, grammar, spelling, you know."

2ansjg,7,2014-07-14,New Arduino Robot not detected by computers,wonderlove,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/2ansjg/new_arduino_robot_not_detected_by_computers/,"I've had the opportunity to work with my first Arduino - an Arduino Robot - for the last week for a summer internship (getting paid too - pretty cool!) and on Friday, my laptop stopped being able to detect the robot when it was plugged in. Before this, it was working perfectly.

After inserting the USB, no 'Device plugging in' sound is played, the device is not listed in the Device Manager and in the IDE software, under Tools, the Serial Port selection is grayed out. 
The LCD does light up when plugged in or switched on, but no programs are run (which I would expect one to, as a sketch was uploaded before it stopped working).

I tried all the ports available, rebooting, re installing the Arduino software, trying a different USB cable, deleting and re-installing the FTDI USB drivers from [this website](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) and trying two other computers (a windows 7 and a linux computer - I'm currently on Windows 8.1).

Nothing has worked so far! I've also looked pretty extensively on various forums for advice, but nothing has been of much use as of yet.

Does anyone have any idea what could help?

EDIT: Okay, it looks like the problem is definitely with the Arduino board - so I've ordered a new processor and I'll post the results when it goes on!



FINAL EDIT! - 22 days later: After working at it for ages, the robot finally works! In case anyone experiences the same problem, here's what I did:

I took the microprocessor from an Arduino Leonardo (they use the same one) - the ATmega32u4 - and replaced the bust one on the Arduino Robot with a little help from some friends from the electrical engineering department at the university where I'm working. Then I bought a Pocket AVR Programmer from Sparkfun and used it to upload the bootloader following [this guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pocket-avr-programmer-hookup-guide/all). That worked in the end and it's now running around again being the cheeky little scamp it once was.

Good luck to anyone experiencing the problem! Feel free to message me if you need some advice on this specific problem."

No major drama, which is impressive whenever you have a total of 8 people (including my husband and I) hanging out together every waking hour of the day for a couple days at a time. There are some very strong personalities in the group, though. I'm generally a pretty quiet person and really thrive in one-on-one or small group interactions. So being around so many loud, boisterous people really took a lot out of me. 

At one point, we all went out to dinner to a restaurant I selected. It was a seafood place with lots of different options regarding bulk items to get for the whole table vs. individual entrees. Once we were seated, everybody seemed to turn to me to ask what they should get, how many of X would be enough for everybody, how do I open this damn crab, how much would it cost to just get a sampling of X, etc etc. 

This was a happy event, everybody was excited to be together and to try this special local seafood place. But there was just so much going on, so many questions being shot my way, so much attention on me, that I got completely overwhelmed. My heart was pounding, I was sweating, my hands were trembling (this part really freaked me out because the trembling reminded me of my first days of sobriety), and I just wanted to go outside and cry alone. I've always been an anxious person, but it used to only manifest itself through worrying about the future. This weekend, my anxiety was so immediate and physical...in a completely non-threatening context. I've never experienced anything like it, but perhaps that's because I would have normally had several drinks during this dinner so any over-stimulation/anxiety would have been dulled or completely numbed :-/ 

I guess I'm just finding it a little disappointing that at 6 weeks sober I'm still feeling so completely miserable sometimes. And the misery is evolving in ways I never experienced. Has anybody else experienced a complete change in their emotional responses like this...not during early withdrawal, but weeks or even months into sobriety? Does stuff like this just keep happening for a while? How do you deal with it?"
2ant92,38,2014-07-14,My dad: only just discovering he may be a narcissist and maybe I'm not wrong after all....,tinkerbelle91,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2ant92/my_dad_only_just_discovering_he_may_be_a/,"Some back story: I'm 22, female and in the middle of a maths degree. 

Don't get me wrong, my mum is the nicest person I've ever met and my brother is my best friend, but my dad has always been a bit of a dick. He told me I wasn't allowed to date until I turned 18 as I had ""all the love I need at home and I need to learn to be independent."" At a glance, I guess that's pretty normal for a dad, but he used to take my phone away at night, and tell me off for being up past 11 at night (this still happens when I'm at home today).

He hit me, when I was about 11 - just once, but he gave me a black eye and chipped my front tooth, which was already adult so I still have a filling there. It was all because I was struggling with my maths homework and he got angry when I wasn't getting it. The worst thing? He blamed me and said if I'd just pulled my head out my ass, he wouldn't have gotten angry at all. My parents made me lie and say I fell down the stairs, and until this day the only people that know are them, my brother, my lovely boyfriend, and no, I guess, you fine people.

I have always been good at maths. I got mostly As at GCSE level (A* in math) and a couple of Bs. He told me I failed my GCSEs because I should've got straight As. I went on the do A levels in physics, maths, and chemistry - B,B,C. According to him I failed my A levels and he blamed this on my need for attention, as I hadn't been without a boyfriend during that time. 

In fact, I had a few boyfriends during my school years. Most of them were horrible people, and even I could see they weren't long term material - it was just for fun. I was still a virgin till I turned 19. However, on a regular basis my dad brings up my long list of ""poor decisions"" and how it's thanks to him I managed to get as far as I have.

I went on to study Maths at uni, and I met my current boyfriend within 2 weeks of starting there. I had moved out of my parents home, and I spent a lot of time meeting people and having fun, but he was the only person I genuinely enjoyed spending time with. We lost our virginity to each other, and spent almost all of our time together. I told my dad, and he said that its fine to have fun, but suggested I sleep around a little more before settling on one man. I told him I didn't want to and my current boyfriend and I started dating officially. My parents both told me I was making a mistake and I should be focusing more on study and less on boys.

I passed first year and moved in officially with my boyfriend. We have since both agreed that this was a mistake, and our second years both turned out a little worse than expected. My boyfriend had to resit some modules, and I ended up taking a fall and breaking my wrist before my exams. My dad told me I was a ""fucking idiot"" and I was ruining my education, his reasoning was I should've been indoors studying, and then I wouldn't have gotten injured. 

I went on to do a placement at an insurance company in London. I had a difficult year as I was also studying for my exams that I'd missed the year before. I ended up failing my exams as I had too much on my plate, and so my dad counts that year as a failure. 

I applied for mit circ and was able to resit those exams last year. I just got my results, and I passed one and failed the other. I have a resit in august. I really struggled and I'm losing my motivation for this degree. I don't even think I wanted to study maths, I did it because thats what he wanted. 

I lived apart from my BF last year during my internship, and my dad helped me pick the flat. He made me move into a place close to their house, literally down the road. I love this flat, but I hate how much leverage he has over me - ""I only let you move out because I thought you'd come home all the time"". He expects me to visit them every day, or as often as I can and frequently berates me for not visiting enough (I'm there at least twice a week for dinner, and my boyfriend is never invited for various reasons.) I often go home to find he's mad at me for not giving a shit about my family, or just generally failing. My BF moved in with me in october and we are finally happily settled, and saving to move somewhere bigger, but my dad frequently tells me I'm not really happy and I have made yet another mistake. 

He often expects me to come home and stay the night (which I avoid at all costs) and the times I have he sends me and my 18 year old brother to bed at 9 and tells me off for talking to my boyfriend at 11 at night. He keeps telling me to ignore my BF when I'm home, and expects me to come home for dinner alone, leaving the other half to cook for himself (which is never fun!). 

He tries to interfere with my relationship, and constantly holds the fact that I don't have a lot of money over my head. I currently work for a tutoring centre, and I don't make much, but I love it. However, whenever I mention worked he reminds me not to enjoy it too much since I can never be a teacher - it doesn't pay well enough and he wants me to be an actuary or a chartered accountant. 

So, things came to a head yesterday when I got my transcript. I didn't want to tell him how badly I did in my exams, so I vaguely said I passed both, and when pressed for more information, I said I got a B and a B-. I hate lying, but I thought this way, I would avoid an argument. I'm currently on track for a 2:1, provided I pass the one in August, since I have As and Bs in all my other modules. 

He got angry, and shouted, and told me he was disappointed. He was horrible and made me feel like shit, despite the fact I've been coping really well. Now I have to go home tonight (I promised I would) and I have to face his wrath. I'm scared, and I feel really shit about myself. 

I found this page yesterday night, and looked through the list on NPD dad's. My BF made me rate each one for 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and they all got a 5. You could literally use that page to describe my dad. He's an alcoholic, he takes up one whole sofa to himself, he watches whatever TV he wants and no one is allowed to change the channel, he never apologises and he frequently calls us assholes, wankers, sluts, bitches etc. He is often anti social, particularly when I get the bring my boyfriend round. He never joins us for days out as a family, and he tries to one up my boyfriend in games (like poker for example). He shouts for no reason, and he barely makes sense because he's always drunk.

I know this is long, so those that stuck with me, is he narcissistic and how can I work through this so that I don't have to deal with his shit anymore?

EDIT: My boyfriend and I pay for most things ourselves. My mum has lent me money once, but otherwise, we've been fairly self sufficient. My parents frequently offer help and I turn it down. My dad berates me for this and says I'm being childish, but I know if I took any help, I would have to do something in return, most likely agreeing to stay at home twice a week, which I really don't think I could take, and would also cause me more pain than good.

2ao2c7,6,2014-07-14,Some questions if some people have experience with this.,Coenn,Thritis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thritis/comments/2ao2c7/some_questions_if_some_people_have_experience/,"Quick introduction; I've had Juvenile Arthritis since I was 12. I'm 20 now and my RA has been pretty non-existent for the last 6 years, maybe more. Sometimes I have a flare-up where I feel stiffness, but that's about it.

Currently I'm having a flare I think. I'm doing my internship and because I'm finishing up I'm behind my desk in an office for 40 hours a week, and I spend some good ammount of time behind my desk at home too. Finishing it up also brings me some good ammount of stress. (nothing to worry about, just deadlines) 

Over the course of the internship the stiffness became more apparent more often. And now it's starting to get annoying. I had to postpone my appointment of july with my rheumatologist until after the summer break (early september). I visit the rheumatologist 3 - 4 times a year and nothing has ever been wrong and I've been on a long-term decrease of activity (to the point it's not active). 

Of course, as paranoid as I am, right after I canceled the appointment I started to feel everything :)

So my question in experience; do you think stressing + more-than-full-time desk-sitting can trigger my RA to be more active? It's mainly annoying stiffness, can't really call it painful.

Last Saturday night (05/07) I missed my medication.. And, as a result I had my first seizures in 18 months on Sunday (06/07); 4 heavy TC's spread over the day and a smaller one at night.

I've had a LOT of seizures in the past so I'm used to the after-effects and expected a long recovery period. However, this time everything seems to be completely different..

Because I've been working on multiple projects at my internship I've kept perfect track of my planning and actions for the past weeks. Looking back at my calendar made me realize I've lost most of my memory of the week prior to the seizures, and I also forgot much of the information I've acquired during my 10-week internship (I was coding VBA/C++ and now it all looks like magic to me).

For the past week I've had memory flashbacks very often, but only things like feelings (mostly emotional, some physical) and smells; no actual information. I've even felt some depression for the first time in my life. I'm the least depressed person in the world and I kind of tried laughing it off, but everything still stuck and it felt horrible.

All of my previous seizures would only cause me to lose 1-4hrs around the time of the seizure. This stuff is just crazy and I've got no idea what's going on any more. I'm going to wait before calling the neuro because right now I've got no idea how to explain to this overly serious science geezer what's going on. Should probably consider a shrink instead.

So thanks for reading my random blabbering! Do you guys get a lot of different side effects from seizures, or do you manage to keep everything somewhat under control?

I've received two job offers from the same company.  If I turn down both offers, would that harm me if I applied to the company again in 3 months?

details:

I've been on a job search for a few months now.  I really don't want to relocate, but I will if I can't find anything in my current city.  I've applied for several positions at Intel; I had an intense interview process for one position, including them flying me across the country for an onsite interview.  I was given an offer, but I decided to decline it for several reasons - the location was the biggest one.  At the same time, I was contacted about another position I applied for at the company, and had a phone interview with them.  It's similar work on a different but related project.  It's also located in a different state (in the same region of the country).  They skipped the rest of the interview process, and gave me a nearly identical offer, based on how I was evaluated in the previous interviews.  Since the cost of living is lower in this new location, the offer is very respectable.

With all that said, I still would prefer to stay where I am, and I think there's a good chance I could find something here in another couple months of searching.  However, if I do have to move and work for a megacorp, Intel would be my best bet - I've had several internships with them, I know how to have a good interview performance, etc.  If I didn't accept the second offer, would this hurt my chances if I decide I have to abandon my job search in my current city, and I start applying to new job listings with them later in the year?"

I was wondering if there is anybody out there that would have the time to help out a struggling student. My parents do not really offer the best financial advice, and I admit that I am terrible with money. I have had to support myself through college working a part time job with a well known software company. This has been especially difficult since the curriculum is rigorous and I struggle with a learning disorder. Regardless, school expenses have cost more than I have been able to pull in. This coupled with some unnecessary impulse buys have put me in a considerable amount of debt. If anyone has the heart to help me develop a plan of attack so that I can focus on my studies without having to worry about finances as much as I already do... that would be greatly appreciated. Below are my financial details. Please let me know if I am missing anything.

This might not sound like a big deal at first, but there's a story behind it. My mom knows I was bulimic for over 10 years, with a bout of anorexia that lasted about a year and half (I lost over 30 lbs in that time). She's always had eating problems herself, and lost a massive amount of weight around the same time I got down to my smallest. I probably triggered her. We were both (unsurprisingly) incredibly unhappy at the time. We had a terrible relationship. This was also around the same time things were quickly going downhill with her and my father. It seemed like she took it out on me; she became very self-centered and would make comments about my appearance all the time that she never would before (ex. 'your pores look really big today'). She would take my clothes and wear them without asking and then claim she looked better in them anyway so I should 'get over it'. The one time I wore a shirt of hers she emptied my closet and threw everything down the stairs. When I went on a trip to Panama for a month, I came back to find she had remodeled my room into a guest room and tossed all the clothes, makeup, books and, most importantly, *personal journals and notebooks* that I'd left behind. I was wrecked. She said it shouldn't matter since I was leaving for university soon anyway, and the room allegedly looked much nicer. It's all about image with her. Later I found she'd kept one of the journals, read it, showed it to my dad, he found something he didn't like in there and decided to rip up at least half of the pages. I never got an apology.

Anyway, I left to the UK for university. It was such a necessary escape. I found my people, rediscovered my academic drive, began to drink and party again, reestablished a life for myself beyond calories and the scale. Yeah, I gained weight. A lot of it. More than the usual 'freshman 15'. But I'm much, much happier. And she knows that. 

But these days I can't help but feel like they'd rather I still be sick and starving and hyper-athletic, just so they can show me off like a trophy child the way they do my four, tall, handsome, rugby-playing brothers. I can tell how ashamed they are of me. Every facebook post on their pages is about my brothers or pictures of them followed by a slew of 'such handsome boys!!' comments. They rarely post about me, even though I attend one of the best universities in the world, have recently acquired numerous VP/Pres roles in wonderful societies there, excel in my studies and have a great internship set up for this summer. Because of my mom's problems I can't help but think she'd rather I was skinny and pretty than happy and sure of myself. 

It's starting to trigger me. I'm home for the summer writing my dissertation, and I've started to fear the kitchen. I've contemplated skipping meals. And now this. I can't believe she'd approach me with this article. My heart sunk. I don't know whether it's irrational or not to be angry. My first instinct is to be upset and disgusted with myself.

I'm a frequent lurker, and sometimes poster, on /r/personalfinance on my other account, but have created a throwaway for this post.

I'm currently between my junior and senior years of high school (will be 18 next year). I have a paid internship, making $12/hour. Generally I work around 20 hours per week, though that number could rise. I may also start another job, at $15/hour, working 15-20 hours a week.

Much of the advice I read on this subreddit advocates saving earnings for college, things I want to buy now, or unexpected expenses. However, I'm extremely lucky in that my parents make a great deal of money (&gt;$500k) and cover all my expenses (car, gas, eating out with friends, clothes, etc). Every few months I buy a video game, but usually on sale.

This will be true in college as well. I have spoken to my parents and they will cover all college expenses. I do not expect to graduate with any debt. I plan to major in engineering of some sort, most likely Computer Science.

Currently my pay is direct deposited into my personal bank account (not custodial, somehow). I have both checking and savings. My parents encouraged me to establish a Schwab Roth IRA. I put $2000 in last year and have put in $2500 so far this year. It is currently invested in S&amp;P 500 and Schwab 1000 funds. My job also offers a 403(b) plan or 457(b), in both Roth and Traditional varieties, with TIAA-CREF and Fidelity funds (among which is a Fidelity Freedom Class W fund - is this any good?). Is one of the offered retirement plans better than the other?

Should I be saving more of my pay in more liquid forms (savings account)? Is there something else I should be doing with my time or money? Any other advice you'd like to offer is welcome as well. Let me know if I've left anything out and I'll be sure to add it. Thanks so much!"

Originally I was here as an intern, later hired full time to work on the same project. Slowly I have grown to hate my current position, as well as the stress and anxiety that comes with it. 

The project itself causing all these feelings, was originally described as an electronic medical record system, but turned out to really mean to be a software web based solution to all their problems. None of the requirements or goals seem to ever be concrete, if not get things added constantly. Additionally, being the only person working on this that is physically in the office, all the stress and questions come down to me. Technically I have 1 contractor working on things I can't, and had one previously whom started the project but later quit. 

On top of working on this project, managing it, all of which I feel should be a more senior position, as I have no experience doing anything with the technologies used in the project, I as well am stuck handling all IT issues within the office. 

As well no standards are actually followed as I am stuck working on this. People working on the software as it is in an alpha state, still being developed. All while it is expected in this state for it to be done quickly, without errors while having high functionality without the necessary effort, nor time to be put in.

All of this has been causing me severe anxiety, making me extremely uncomfortable in this job. As besides the issues following actual procedures, I feel like my current job is nowhere near entry level as it was described. I have been looking for a new position to escape this place.

I have somewhat been thinking of leaving this job before finding a new one. As I feel all of this is adding way too much stress &amp; anxiety to my life currently, and that I'd be better off starting from scratch looking for a new job.

Living arrangements at the moment wouldn't be an issue as still for now, living with my parents until I save up money to get an apartment.

Generally I am not sure if it is worth putting up with the anxiety the overly high expectations had, the lack of actually following procedures for things,or lack there of despite the best efforts to create them or sit down with my boss and create some. So I am not sure how bad it would affect job hunting for a new position, if I quit this one before finding one. Or if I am better off jumping ship first before running myself into the ground."
2ap1vn,2,2014-07-14,My wife can't handle my depression anymore,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ap1vn/my_wife_cant_handle_my_depression_anymore/,"We've been together total of 5 years now and things have gotten really bad lately due to my depression. 

I recently moved to the opposite side of the country for an internship but we couldn't afford to move her and all our stuff so I'm working part time to pay bills and interning while she's back at home. Recently she told me that since I've been gone she's been the happiest she's been in years because I'm not around to bring her down with my constant (and rather severe) mood swings and pretty consistent feelings of unhappiness. Because I have a hard time enjoying anything, I never wanted to go out or go do anything, and since I've been gone she's been going to all these places, and doing all these things that I never took her to. 

So i'm alone in a new strange city, and the depression was enough to cope with when i was just lonely and missing her and my friends and family. She's the only thing that's made me happy and since i've never been able to be happy on my own I relied on her for my happiness. Now she's almost ready to just end things entirely because she says she cant handle being my emotional crutch anymore. 

I don't have many people I can talk to, I don't know how to stop feeling so sad and empty every day, and now without her support I feel like the last lifeline i had has been cut. "

started porn at 9 or 10
one day at that age i decided to google ""chicks with dicks"" and yea from the 5th grade to my senior year of college the tranny porn escalated hardcore. im not gay, i am not attracted to men but in the last 3 months..all that being handsome and a college athlete and all that other bullshit has gone down the drain. ive met many women and only two or 3 have really given me something to do..not necessarily sex or anything but just the time of day or consistent communication and hanging out. I've been trying to meet chicks, have a good time with them..if they smoke pot we smoke, if they drink we drink, and now that i have a summer internship i have money for real dates as well.. but i have been having very bad luck with women for the last 3 months.. and i just cant figure out why but now i think i know.


PAUSE LET ME BACKTRACK AND MAKE THIS CHRONOLOGICAL

-5TH GRADE EXPOSED MYSELF TO TRANNY PORN
-BEEN PMO'ING SINCE
-STARTED WITH SOFTCORE PICS, THEN ESCALATED TO LESBIANS, EVENTUALLY TURNED INTO TRANNY
- LOST VIRGINITY AT 14 AND ALWAYS LOVED SEX. 
- I HAVE HAD ABOUT 50 SEX PARTNERS AND THE LAST 3 WERE TRANSGENDER/CD
- I STUMBLED UPON NO FAP IN DECEMBER OF 2013 WHEN I COULDNT GET IT UP WITH A GIRL. I ATTRIBUTED THIS TO BEING WORN OUT FROM HAVING 4 ORGASMS WITH A GIRL 2 DAYS BEFORE.
- COULDNT GET IT UP FOR 3 WEEKS WITH THIS GIRL.
- 3 MONTHS LATER AFTER TRYING TO ABSTAIN FOR 8 DAYS, I HAD A SEXCAPADE WITH SEVERAL WOMEN WITH NO ISSUES. AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS ROCK HARD AND HADN'T BEEN THAT HARD THAT EASILY IN SO LONG.
-I HAVE BEEN RELAPSING SINCE WITH THE PMO DEAL...
-IN MAY I RECEIVED ORAL FROM A TRANNY
- THEN I FUCKED ANOTHER
- AND TODAY I SUCKED ONES PENIS

I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE. FROM HERE IT'LL ESCALATE TO GOD KNOWS WHAT BUT NO NO NO NO NO I WILL NEVER EVER PARTICIPATE IN A GAY ACT AGAIN.

WITH ALL THE GOOD THINGS GOING ON IN MY LIFE I AM SO SURPRISED THAT I HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF TO STOOP SO LOW.

FROM HERE ON ITS NO MORE PORN. I HAVE TO GO PORN FREE. I AM THINKING OF PARTICIPATING IN NO FAP AS WELL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:


-IT AIDS IN RECOVERY TIME
- EARLIER I MENTIONED THAT I HAVE HAD 50+ SEX PARTNERS AND ALTHOUGH I FEEL IM NOT READY FOR MARRIAGE, I DO FEEL THAT I NEED TO FIND RESPECTABLE WOMEN (NOT THE SLUTTY KIND OF ENCOUNTERS I HAD IN COLLEGE) AND GET TO CONNECT WITH THEM AND NOT BASE OUR RELATIONSHIPS SOLELY ON SEX
- I NEED TO CONTINUE TO REPENT MY SINS AND BECOME CLOSER TO GOD
- AND I ONCE AGAIN NEED TO NOT BE SO SEX CRAZED. I ACTUALLY AM A WITNESS THAT IF YOU DONT WATCH PORN, YOU BECOME HORNY LESS AND AFTER SUCKING A PENIS TODAY, I NEVER WANNA WATCH PORN AGAIN BECAUSE IT HAS CORRUPTED ME...ONLY BECAUSE I ALLOWED IT TO DO SUCH THO, THAT PART I AM AWARE OF. 


I EVEN CHEATED ON MY EX GIRLFRIEND 3 YEARS AGO AND I NOW REALIZE THAT THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A YOUTHFUL MISTAKE AND ALSO TOO MUCH PORNOGRAPHY DISRUPTING MY BRAIN...HAD I NOT WATCHED PORN AND FAPPED WHILE WITH HER IM SURE SHE WOULDVE BEEN THE ONLY WOMAN I NEEDED....LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED

2ap4c6,0,2014-07-14,Toronto employers: Why not take a chance?,shuamu,toronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/2ap4c6/toronto_employers_why_not_take_a_chance/,"In month 6 of my job search now and I'm beginning to wonder why employers won't take a chance on a new employee with the skills, but not so much experience.

Today I saw a job posting where they offered to ""hire"" you as a one-month unpaid intern, and then they would negotiate the salary later if you're a good fit. A month long trial period? Who can afford that?

In my search I've found only independent contracting and multi-level marketing schemes seem to be offering jobs.

So here's my question: What happened to taking a risk on a new employee? We have the 3-month probation period as is... why won't companies just take a chance on a potential employee? Why do employers now force the employee to take all the risk.

Is there just a labour surplus and it's a buyer's market? 

Will someone take a chance on me?"

2aphy6,1,2014-07-14,20 y/o looking for the potential investment ideas and what to do with my savings.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2aphy6/20_yo_looking_for_the_potential_investment_ideas/,"Personal background:

I'm was born in Brazil and moved to the U.S. when I turned 12 but I digress.

At the age of 16, I began saving the majority of the money I received.
That is when I told my mother that I wanted all of the child support money my father gave (He is Brazilian and paid in Real, which wasn't much). So she said yes and opened up my first Brazilian bank account.

Since then, I have about R$10,000 which is equivalent to $4,500. That money is still in Brazil and I get 6% annual interest rate but that ins't enough to beat inflation.

Fast-forward to the U.S. and I just finished my first year of college and I'm doing BA-Finance at UMASS but i digress again.

My mother and I have made an oral agreement that we will both save for my future. We recently started and I know we don't have much but I still dream about a big future and I know this is just the beginning.

So far we have $3,500 and we are continuing to save. For now, I can save around $300 a week while my mother is saving $200. I can only save this much during the Summer (as I get older, I'll be able to get a better paying job or internship and I will be saving more)  but my mother will continue until I finish with college. 

The point is, that from July 2014 - July 2017 we will be able to save around $30,000 at this rate.

That whole spheal was not the reason why I wanted to do this, but I have recently opened a Fidelity account and put the $3,500 my mother and I saved and I don't have a strong understanding of all the investments considering I just finished my first year of college and I only took general courses. I've been hearing that I should put my money in ETFs and Mutual Funds but I also wanted to hear the perspectives and ideas of others. I plan to take all the money that will be saved and continue to deposit in my Fidelity account but I still need more advice before I blindly buy what I should not have.

I would appreciate to hear some ideas and place that I could learn about.

I was accepted to cal poly, ucr, and uci, (not trying to brag) but I may not go to Cal Poly Obispo or UCI because of the distance, and the extra cost of a dorm.

2apn4m,1,2014-07-14,"Graduated with a 1st in Biomed, but what now?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2apn4m/graduated_with_a_1st_in_biomed_but_what_now/,"Hey, so here goes:

So I'm 20 years old and I've just finished my degree in Biomedical Science at Nottingham Trent University. It's not a great university but it's one of the better non ""red brick"" universities in the UK I suppose. After completing  my final year research project I've decided I don't really want to pursue a career in biology, as I think I'd go insane working in a laboratory for the rest of my life. I also don't feel like I actually learned much (other than how to cram successfully and write essays) and feel as if I wouldn't have the knowledge for a biology related career.

So what now?

Throughout my whole university experience strangers would always be impressed by my degree title (due to the fact it has medicine in and they obviously assume I'm going to become a doctor). I've been told countless times how highly regarded science degrees are due to the skills required. But are they really regarded that highly? Perhaps chemistry or physics but biology?

I've been researching all kinds of graduate schemes to help me decide what career I'd like to pursue but it's not helping me at all. Many of the graduate schemes here require a 2:1 degree, ok great. But the majority of them, particularly the decent ones also require 300 UCAS points. If you're not from the UK; UCAS points are determined by the grades you received at A-level (I have no idea what the American equivalent is, APs perhaps?).

Anyway, my A-levels were pretty disastrous. I got a B in biology, C in physics and D in chemistry. This was primarily due to my absolute hatred of organic chemistry which resulted in me spending hours trying to learn chemistry whilst neglecting biology and physics as I could do those at an acceptable level without much effort. I also studied at my schools sixth form which is probably one of the worst in the country (they no longer offer A-levels surprisingly), but I'm not going to go on with some form of sob story, I could've done better or gone elsewhere, what's done is done.

So the combination of my awful A-level grades and not knowing what area of career to pursue I'm stumped. I'm particularly worried about getting a job for the summer whilst living at home with my parents just to earn some money (and avoid their constant nagging) and getting trapped in this city forever (Birmingham, I hate it).

I've always liked the idea of business and big cities like London. I think I'd enjoy working in a business environment as I'm extremely competitive and I'm sure the chance to move up the career ladder would be a great incentive. I'm also extremely interested in the opportunity to travel and would love the chance to migrate; although this is probably just some kind of dream job that I have no chance of getting.

Last year I had a summer job at a finance company doing data entry which was fairly well paid, despite being incredibly simple. I really liked the office environment and learning about the company during my introduction was pretty interesting. However, I never studied business or economics or anything like that at school as I was always good at core subjects like English, sciences and maths so I stuck with those. I also don't think I know enough about each of the areas in business like sales, accounting, finance etc. to make any kind of decision. 

A relevant summer internship would probably be extremely useful if I decide on a career path, but the majority of graduate schemes just filter out applications that don't meet the grade requirements. It never really occurred to me people would even care about UCAS points after obtaining a degree. Particularly when you consider that you could pick 3 or 4 ""easy"" subjects (I'm looking at you media) and get the golden 3 Bs required for the majority of schemes. Re-sitting A-levels isn't an option either as companies only take the results from your first attempt. 

I'm currently attempting to learn Excel out of boredom and in hope that it might be useful when applying for jobs, although I'm not sure how useful knowledge is without a certificate to say you can do it nowadays. 

*Thanks if you somehow made it to the end of this.*

**TLDR: I got a 1st in my degree but my A-level grades suck and may hold me back from a decent graduate scheme. Am I screwed?**"

2aq3i0,0,2014-07-14,On handling a small auto collision...,jeanlerenard,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2aq3i0/on_handling_a_small_auto_collision/,"Hello PF!

I recently brushed fenders with a car in a low speed collision. We stopped and gathered all necessary information, including pictures. Here is the [damage](http://i.imgur.com/JjJ19OX.jpg) on the other motorists car. My car is essentially untouched. He claimed that he was okay at the site of the incident and in a phone follow up. We didn't get the police involved due to the minor nature of the collision.

Here are some relevant details; let me know if you need additional details!

- 19m working a summer internship (monthly wages - 1,400 after taxes)
- Living with parents for the summer with limited expenses (monthly expenses ~400) What's not an expense is being put into a ROTH IRA, savings account, or Emergency Fund
- Emergency Fund - 1,800
- My parents own the car that I drive and pay for insurance
- The collision was my fault and I intend to cover it with cash from the emergency fund. I would prefer not to go through insurance to handle the claim to avoid the extra burden on my parents
- The man has not called back since the collision (About three weeks ago) with so much as an estimate or plan to get an estimate, leaving me in the dark
- The man was reasonable at the time of the incident. He doesn't seem like someone to milk this incident for additional maintenance or medical bills
- I have earmarked as much as 1,000 of my emergency fund to cover this incident, which I think should be more than enough

How should I handle this situation? Should I call the man and request an estimate ASAP? Should I leave the ball in his court to come back with an estimate? This situation is a liability that I'm more than capable of handling, but it's an uncertain one. How can I bring more certainty to a small pain in the butt.

Thanks PF, for modeling what sound personal financial management looks like!"

I recently applied for a software engineering internship. Going into my first interview, I discovered most of the questions were focused on HTML and Javascript, both of which I have no experience in.

I answered as best as I could, but definitely didn't know a few. 

I apparently answered questions well enough to pass the first interview and got called in for a second, technical interview with a committee. 

I have a solid background in C++, a little C, Assembly and I can hobble my way through Java. 

What material can I attack in the next 24 hours to get me the basics of HTML/Javascript?

2aqe8i,3,2014-07-14,I want to change my life direction so I'm thinking of getting a 2nd bachelor's in IT...have a master's in communications...,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2aqe8i/i_want_to_change_my_life_direction_so_im_thinking/,"So I have a B.A. in English and recently M.S. in Communication. I am a walking cliche of the late 20s millennial dissatisfied with the job market and not having any ""real"" skills to contribute to it. I work as a marketing assistant and I really don't like it or my future prospects. It took me hundreds and hundreds of interviews and a few internships to get this job, and it mostly sucks. I've been there a year and continue to apply for other jobs and get nowhere.  Not only is the pay poor, but I wish I was doing more technical-minded stuff instead of writing cheesy blog posts or trying to convince news outlets to write about us. I think the field is just too crowded, competitive, and not in demand. I also consider myself a computer geek that should have majored in something computer-related, but I missed the boat due to immaturity in college. Of my work, I find that I love the web editing in html/css the best.

So I really want to break into IT, and I am considering doing a 2nd bachelor's in it. I found a program that I can do this for only $11,000, and it is from an accredited state school close to me. I have no school debt, and although I would be taking out loans for this, that's not bad at all. The program is particularly cool because I can choose my own path. If I want to focus on programming, I can essentially take almost all programming language courses. If I want to focus on network technologies, I can just focus on those. I think I want to be a database admin, which would have a bit of both.

Now a master's seems like it would be better, but I am wary because of three things: 1) I hear of discrimination against those of us with master's in the job market (people assume we're pretentious/entitled/expect more money/whatever), so I can only imagine the discrimination I would face with 2) I really don't feel that I have a knowledge base to do computer science of information technology at the grad level and finally 3) grad school is a lot more expensive ($18-25k more depending on what I do)

I don't care about the idea of having another master's, I am fine with a modest B.S. and I intend to work my way up in the field.

However, I am worried that this will look damn weird on a resume, having a bachelor's degree listed after a Master's. Like, is it weird to have a Master's sandwiched in between two Bachelor's on a resume? I also could just replace my BA English with it on the resume, but then it might look like the IT degree is stale.

Also, some people have mentioned that doing this would look like a step backward, and that I might as well just get the master's.

Finally, I know with IT that you don't need a degree, but I am thinking long term. Maybe you WILL need a related degree in 20 years. I already see some jobs that request a related degree. I am embarrassed enough with my two current degrees that I KNOW I want to get some kind of additional degree in IT or CS...it's just a matter of which one and where. I also know that a CS degree is better than an IT degree..and I am considering that too, but it will be an even bigger investment since i'll have to do pre-req classes for any master's program..and it will ultimately end up costing like $30k

 My plan is to get the degree while studying for certs and pursuing internships. Right now I just don't have the knowledge/skills to get into anything.

So what does reddit think...do I have the right idea for my future? I'm so confused on what is the right idea for me to do and it keeps me up at night looking through different programs and options.

Also keep in mind I'm not trying to make a money grab..I just want to make more than I currently do. If I had a $40k/year job that I liked...I would be insanely happy. Life is more than money to me, I just want stability."
2aqf9f,1,2014-07-14,Need advice: What do I do with free flights?,tookenfir_granted,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2aqf9f/need_advice_what_do_i_do_with_free_flights/,"Alright, for some background: I'm not an airline employee but I'm part of an airline family (big 3 US airline). This means that I receive the same standby flight privileges as the employee does. 

My situation: I'm a college student about to enter his senior year. 90 days after I graduate I'm out of the program. No more free standby flights, no nothing. 

My question is this: If you were in my position, where would you go? I fully recognize that I took for granted my ability up until very recently to fly for essentially free. Nowadays, however, I feel like every waking moment I don't spend trying to be in another part of the world is like I'm spitting on the amazing opportunity I have to travel, but at the same time I've got school and internships to complete and minimal funds to actually travel with. 

So to clarify I'm curious what you would do if the cost of air travel to major destinations equalled zero but free time was limited. Where would you fly to? What would you do there? What kind of destinations can I visit for 1-2 days and still gain a meaningful experience from? 

My biggest hangup is the fact that I'm pretty much alone in this ability. I don't know anyone my age in a similar situation so 1) I can't make plans to travel with friends because the flights often fill up and I have to be flexible and 2) I'm hesitant to travel to super exotic places all alone lest I fall into some sort of misfortune. 

Any advice would be really appreciated! "
2aqihd,2,2014-07-15,I (25f) feel that my husband (32m) is being insensitive about my feelings. Please give me perspective!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2aqihd/i_25f_feel_that_my_husband_32m_is_being/,"I am going to attempt to be as honest as possible. 


My husband, Chase, and I each have one child from previous relationships. He knows that I had to do everything alone when my child was born up until he and I got together. It was not a fun time, as I was barely of age and all alone because my child's father chose not to be a parent. We have full custody of his child from his previous marriage. He was not really around when his child was an infant/baby due to being deployed for military service. We have now been together 5 years and recently had a child together, Grace. 


Chase was due to graduate college a few months before her arrival and had been an intern at a reputable company. They had offered him a position and without exploring any other options he accepted. He accepted knowing it would take him away from us for three months for training in another state at a very important time for our family. I had expressed that I was unhappy about him leaving because of the timing. 


I talked the doctor into having labor induced a week before she was due to arrive. Grace is born, all is ok with her. Chase leaves the very next morning. I cried to him when he left. I cried every day that he was gone. I was overwhelmed, had no time for myself. I almost felt like I just had another baby alone like I did with my first baby. I felt abandoned in a sense even though I knew he was coming back. So while he's out living the good life at the beach and the bars, etc., I am left trapped at home.


Well here we are, I took care of our three kids, two dogs and ensured the house didn't burn to the ground. BUT- I am and have been suffering from postpartum depression. I've tried my best to keep it under control but I just can not anymore. I'm tired of pretending that I'm alright. Tonight Chase said something to the effect of what's wrong with you, why do you get so upset and I just flat out said,  I'm depressed. But he quickly dismissed me and told me to 'get over it' just as he always would. That's part of the reason I kept my postpartum depression under wraps for so long. 


So Reddit, am I wrong for feeling this way? How can I get him to understand my feelings? Is he being insensitive/ am I being overly sensitive?


Tldr; wife suffers from postpartum depression husband says feelings are invalid and to get over it. How to proceed."
2aqil5,3,2014-07-15,So many problems with this job.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2aqil5/so_many_problems_with_this_job/,"I'm not sure what thread to post this under… I figured r/offmychest was applicable because it’s kind of a combination of job and finance issues. I feel like I should leave the job, but I'm a fresh graduate from college and this is my ‘first full-time job’ even though I’ve been doing graphic design for about 4-5 years.
I'm at an interesting risk of posting this, I hope not to make it too personal but I'm sure it would be identifiable... Here goes nothing.

The company I work for is an advertising firm of some sort. I don’t want to get too specific because of recognition issues. It’s sort of a “mom and pop” shop, if you will. I work for this company as a graphic designer and technician. In most companies, you would think those two jobs would be separate. However, the local ‘team’ I'm on, is rather small (about 7 people, including myself). We have other offices around the state and in other states of about the same size.
The owner of the company, we’ll just call her “Paula” hired me in April of 2014. At first I was supposed to just be an (unpaid) intern, but then she decided she wanted me to be on salary ($250/wk). She told me this was a part-time job, but she was very impressed with my work so she wanted to give me a salary. I was originally hired as a graphic designer, but since I had technical experience as well, I offered to take over the role of the technician since the current one was leaving the company. I didn’t expect a pay-raise because at the time there were some setbacks that caused sales to plummet for about a month. So, I was busy, but “part-time job” busy. Which was fine.

I should note: I asked about becoming a full-time worker when a friend of mine was hired as a salesperson for the company. When we started talking about full-time work, my friend (we’ll call him “Tim”) asked Paula if this job was able to supply any benefits (401K, Retirement, Medical, etc). Paula said that she wasn’t able to at this time but she’d “look into it.”

I'm being paid by check (that has the company name on it), but it’s just from a business checkbook. It’s not really very official, and there’s not really a well-documented paper trail (except for what I'm documenting). 
I started to become concerned when I realized that I was being paid as an “independent contractor”. Thus, I have to keep track of my expenses, income, gas/mileage, etc. so that the IRS doesn’t rape me at the end of the year. This is completely new to me because I am used to my paychecks already having the taxes taken out of them and then I usually get about $500-800 back at the end of the year.

Another thing that really bothers me is that I never signed an official contract of employment. I don’t have a physical (or digital I suppose) copy of my employment and duties. I don’t have a job description. I don’t have a salary agreement. I’ve asked multiple times about these but she seems to come up with excuses for why it hasn’t been done or that she doesn’t have “the time” to do them. This is excruciatingly frustrating because I know that if I leave this job it will be extremely hard to prove I was ever even employed there in case something were to come up with legalities. (i.e. she could say that I never even worked there, or she paid me more/less than she actually did, fake verbal agreements, etc.)
Paula has told me since April that we were going to have an actual office in the town I live in. She lives about an hour away, and in May decided she would buy a trailer home in the town I live in, and live there / have it as our office. This was extremely awkward to ‘go to work’ in a trailer house. Other than having to go there a few times, I’ve been working from home and attending business meetings at various restaurants or meeting areas.

I’ve been taking out $50 of my $250 paychecks each week toward taxes. So, my income is about $800 a month. My rent alone is $380, which is almost half of my salary. I'm paying off my Macbook Pro (being a designer, it was kind of a “need” more than a “want”) which is $150 until November.

Two other designers that I graduated with are making $11/hr, full-time. So, they make roughly about $1760 a month, BEFORE taxes. That’s twice what I make now, for one full-time job. Keep in mind: I'm doing two different job positions here.

Now that you’ve got some background,

In the last few weeks, we’ve completely revamped the company because there were no policies in place (no contracts as I mentioned before), no marketing materials for the sales people, no training, nothing. I am very quick to learn so although it was difficult, it definitely could have went a lot smoother.
This is an advertising firm that didn’t have any contracts in place for its customers. Everything seems to be run on verbal agreements. It’s actually kind of scary.

EDIT: In the last few weeks, I've been working 9am-5pm from home (with a lunch break around noon) Monday-Friday, which is not 'part-time' by any means.
So, today, I brought up the fact that I'm being completely overworked for the amount of money I'm being paid (I worded it more nicely obviously) and Paula told me that she had to think about it, and finish another important project, but that I'm “at the top of the priority list after that.”

I will say I do love the people I work with. I think they’re awesome people. I think this business has awesome potential, but it’s so poorly organized and terribly coordinated I don’t think I’ll be with the company much longer. I’ve started applying for other jobs, but since I'm so “new” to the industry, it’s really, really hard to get a job in my field close to home. This company literally will have no one to take over if I leave and because I'm such a passive person, it’s making me stay, but I’m slowly becoming more and more miserable and more and more stressed about money.


I just wanted this off my chest, but I guess I’d take advice too.

2aqnxw,8,2014-07-15,"In the beginning, there were twelve of us: Week 1",[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2aqnxw/in_the_beginning_there_were_twelve_of_us_week_1/,"When me and the 11 others first arrived, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We thought we had signed up for a summer camp, our rich parents were all eager to send away their kids. My dad was recently promoted to CEO in a company that will remain unnamed. This gave him the money to send me away the summer before my Junior year. When I first heard about their plans to send me away, I was infuriated. They usually sent me to my Grandparents when I was ""in there way"". My name I guess is Alex, I don't think I'll bother with an alias at the rate things are going.

I guess I should introduce ""us"" now huh? We 12 were the ""lucky ones"" selected to attend the private camp out of the *hundreds* of other entries. I arrived first at Persephone Island, after taking a plane to Los Angeles and then a private plane taking me directly to the island which is a good distance from California's coast (so much for swimming home). Being the first one to arrive, I was also the first to meet the four counselors, Shane, Mercedes, Zak, and Iris. They all looked like college students taking some sort of summer internship. Shane was tall with shaggy hipster hair and a tattoo his shirts sleeve concealed.   Mercedes was tanner and shorter compared to the others, she had guy-short hair and a bunch of earrings scattered along her face. Zak was twinkish looking, and I would've assumed he was gay if he wasn't romantically cradling Iris, who looked the most normal amongst them all with a kind smile. I got a brief look at the surrounding buildings before they led me to the cafeteria where I waited for the others to arrive. 

The cafeteria was indoors with nice tables except for the one in front of me. It had graffiti scratched on its surface and I surreptitiously switched seats. There were two things, the first was a line that read ""Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,"". I knew immediately that this was a quote from one of my favorite poets Poe. Since then I reread the poem and tried to link any of its lines to our situation to no prevail, so its pretty irrelevant. The second was of a strange symbol whose origins neither of us have discovered yet. I redrew it in my notebook because I didn't think to much of it at the time to take a picture. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/IVaoqry.jpg) (Sorry, I'm not an artist). Anyway, if anyone knows what that means we'd be grateful if you enlightened us. 

Continuing on, students started arriving and filling up the empty seats. We were all pretty spread out, only glancing at one another sizing each other up. A black kid  had a TMNT shirt on and huge Steve Urkel glasses that made me smirk. Another girl who I would discover is a real bitch (pardon my language), was staring at everybody with a look of distaste. I classified her as the pretty rich white girl. I classified correctly. I also noticed another guy that was shorter than the rest of us and was whispering to himself. An Asian guy was scribbling in a sketchbook, another girl was whistling a complicated tune. And yet another girl was looking around at invisible stuff like she was stoned or something.

Soon enough 12 kids filled the room, and that's when the counselors walked in, lunch-ladies served us lunch and after we feasted the counselors announced a sort of game to break the ice. They would throw a squishy ball to someone and that person would catch it and introduce themselves. Naturally, I attempted to blend into the wall and Shane must've noticed this because he threw it to me first. I sighed, not sure whether to be modest and appear like a nice guy, while underestimated in my abilities, or to entail my strengths and appear as a threat. Or to be honest. I went for the latter. ""Well,"" I began, ""I'm Alex, I'm 16, my parents sent me here against my will,"" a few others nodded their heads in relation. I also the noticed the stoner girl had a giddy smile on her face. ""I'm fairly athletic, I love to write, and I'm very strategic."" I stated which was all entirely true. Iris nodded and instructed me to throw the ball to another camper, which made me feel like a dick because I would be forcing this person to introduce themselves against their will. 

Luckily for me, Stoner Girl raised her hand. I threw it to her and she caught it clumsily. She had on a dark purple shirt,  faded jeans, and red sneakers. ""My name is Phae,"" she began, ""and I have [Synaesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)."" The counselors nodded in approval as she further elaborated. ""It means sound for me is a bunch of colorful fireworks."" This intrigued myself and most of the other campers. She stopped there though and sort of relished everybody's new found interest in her (Later, when I told her my first impression was that she was on drugs she got mad, lol) . The ball continued to be tossed around. Bernard was the kid with the TMNT shirt, and had an interest in graphic novels and superheroes. Samantha was the rich girl who had everything to complain about. Hiromi was the Asian kid who had some amazing artwork he showed off. Bianca, the whistling girl,  was Italian and a musician. Humble, (his real name) is an athlete that didn't come off very humble imo. Stacy was a poet, and she stood and told one of her favorite poems ""[A Dream Within a Dream](http://100.best-poems.net/dream-within-dream.html)"" (By Poe!). Dakota, the kid mumbling to himself, was some sort of genius and already in his senior year of high school (He's 14!). Compassion was some sort of child model and worked with huge clothing companies. Serenity was a singer who sang the national anthem in a pretty amazing way. And Joseph... was just Joseph, he didn't display any unique qualities. So we all had our strengths (except Joseph) and the counselors took our bags and let us mingle before the afternoon activities. I went over to Phae, Compassion and Serenity chatted with Samantha, Bianca and Stacy talked about different songs. Bernard bombarded Hiromi with questions about anime and manga. Joseph wandered over to Humble. And Dakota continued mumbling to himself so me and Phae invited him over after a bit. He explained how he was socially awkward and didn't like to talk much and we nodded that we understood. After talking to Phae a bit, she further elaborated how Synesthesia works. I would be lying if I said I didn't envy her. It seemed like a really cool thing, she described my voice as a relaxing blue, and Dakota's as a sunset orange. By the end of the day we were in normal high school cliques. Granted, they were tiny, but we managed. 

The rest of the week continued like this. We were assorted into two cabins, one for boys and one for girls. Our luggage was unpacked and we made ourselves at home each decorating our individual areas with personal items and what not (I just spread out a few books I brought). After that day we started our classes and got to know one another better. Eventually Humble sort of abandoned Joseph and started hanging out with Samantha and her friends. I learned more about Phae and Dakota too. Phae's originally from Michigan but she had recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Dakota was from Wisconsin and the only one between us three who had siblings. I also learned more about the other guys just by hanging out with them before lights out. Humble was from a small town where he was practically worshipped by peers, and Hiromi replied snidely not to expect anyone to bow down anytime soon. Bernard and Hiromi grew pretty close and I hung around them more as the week went on. Bernard was a huge fan of anime and they were playfully creating a Manga loosely based off Attack on Titan (an anime/manga they highly recommended). We took our Wilderness Survival Classes as usual and learned basic outdoorsman skills. We were gradually liking the place and genuinely getting along. On Thursday, some stuff went down in Samantha's clique and Serenity started hanging out with Bianca and Stacy, which made a lot more sense to me. 

Then Friday came. I probably wouldn't have noticed Joseph was even missing if we didn't share a bunk and I wasn't use to his snoring. I woke up and noticed he wasn't on his bed. At first I assumed he was in the restroom but in the five mornings here he's never woken before me. I didn't think too much about it then and I picked up my novel and continued reading (Battle Royale by Koushun Takami). When more than an hour passed and everyone was awake we started questioning where he could have gone. Dakota who had been in the restroom stated he wasn't there. Bernard and Hiromi decided to go talk to the counselors at their lounge. They returned more than half an hour later stating that Joseph was ill and flew home. We didn't think too much of it at the time. As harsh as this sounds, none of us were really going to miss him anyway. I did notice during our classes later though, that none of the jets were gone and Hiromi specifically stated that Joseph ""flew"" home. 

Right now we have more questions than answers, even now things are getting weird and we only have so much time until... well you'll find out soon enough. Sorry if this isn't a sufficient place to stop for now, I've written more than I intended. I'm just curious as to what the symbol meant and if that could help us in anyway. Thanks for caring ~Alex"

A chance to feel good about myself.",NightBane,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2aqwlo/i_just_wanted_a_win_today_a_chance_to_feel_good/,"A little about me. I'm suffering from an illness where I can't go outside or eat properly. I've been like this since the start of this year, confined inside. Every day has nothing but being locked in my own personal hell, not being able to work or go out with friends. Every single day I've lived in this depressive hell by myself. I lost my chance for internships and I'm even about to lose my house because my landlord is a greedy fuck.

And then something happened today that I thought I was going to have that chance, I thought today was going to be the day that I finally felt good about myself. Today was the day that I was finally gonna get a win, in a losing streak of depression.

Today I found a chipmunk in my yard while taking the dog out. My dog happened upon it and I quickly sent her back in the house. The chipmunk was injured, and it had a broken leg. I quickly got some gloves and scooped it up. It was shaking and breathing, and in my hands I had something so tiny and small. This was my chance. I devoted my afternoon to this little chipmunk. I quickly put him in a box, and got whatever I could find that was small and what they liked to eat. I called as many places as I could to see if they could take it, but no one would. I called my friends but no one would come, and I watched this poor thing struggle and shake in pain.

I felt helpless.

10 minutes ago, in the pouring rain, he died in my hand. To have something so small looking at you when it dies. It broke me. I wanted to help it, I wanted to save it. But there was nothing I could do, and no one could help me. And in turn, I could not help it. And it suffered for so long, and died.

I know that death is a natural thing, and it happens. He died in my care. And what I thought was going to finally break this wave of feeling useless, what I thought was finally going to be my day to win, turned out to be a terrible loss.

So I'm sorry, little dude. I tried, but there was nothing I could do. I'm so sorry."

It's full-time, not an internship.

**About me:** 23, BA in [relevant thing], four years' part-time experience in [highly similar job].

I played up the relevant position as much as possible in my CV and cover letter, and I do indeed spend more hours on this job than the others.

Within a few hours of sending my application, a representative of the company contacted me to ask about salary expectations. I went with what I considered to be a low number since I am just trying to break into a full-time office job for the first time. Shortly after that (same day), I received the ""we just opened the position and therefore the [selection] process will take some time"" response.

The job posting was about a week old when I responded, and the message exchange was also almost a week ago. The same representative just recently viewed my LinkedIn profile. No interview invitation yet, though.

**Am I being quietly snubbed, or do I have a chance?** I don't know if I messed up with the salary expectations. The quickness with which they responded and their follow-up on LinkedIn have to be good, right? Are they really operating on a longer time window and want to collect as many applications as possible?

**(How) Should I follow up again?** I've been thinking about asking what ""some time"" means. I'm starting to get interviews for positions that I find less desirable and I'd just like to know where I stand with this one.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I applied around for numerous Internships yesterday, and one which has come back to me is for time away in China! Exciting right? I thought so.

Now my issue comes in with the cost, I can afford to do a month without accommodation being sorted for me, but with costs of flights and living costs it is a little hard to achieve as I have not got an income while I intern (I finished uni 2 months ago). 

This program however supplies a 10% discount bonus if anyone else were to sign up for an internship, and this applies to every person who refers me, meaning if 5 people sign up, thats 50% I can get off! 
Not that im expecting this many people, but it is a nice thought. 

So I write here to ask if any one would be interested in signing up for an internship. Here is the link &gt; http://www.gi2c.org/internships.html

I would highly appreciate any cooperation if it were to come my way, please PM me or write in the comment section if you feel interested in this scheme.

Thanks,

Georgia requirements are pretty lax compared to other states. 

I'm just wondering - how often do requirements change? For example, I would hate to finish up and then it be changed to require a masters or something. 

Also, I currently work fulltime in addition to fulltime classes - 12 hrs. I don't have time for anything else really. How will recruiters look at that? I don't have any extracurriculars or volunteer besides high school because I just haven't had time. In fact, I'm going to keep working until I graduate and until I pass all my CPA exams. I can't afford to stop working because I support myself. 

What's the best way to transition into a firm if I can't intern during school?"

I was wondering there was anyone out there who could help me out with advice on a future for me. I'm 26, currently studying towards a degree in History through the OU, and unemployed at the moment. I have several years of experience in various administrative roles.

I was wondering if anyone out there knew of any NON graduate training schemes available to me? It's really difficult to find online in a web search, as pretty much 99% of everything I see is 'graduate', and I'm not currently there yet. I applied last year for M&amp;S retail management scheme, and got invited to the assessment day, but I picked London as my location with the intention of moving there, but it all fell apart and I had to withdraw. Now I really regret it. It seems to be the only non graduate training scheme around? I am very interested in retail btw. I also need something that will pay, as past mistakes mean I need a constant income to pay off debts every month, and also be able to live - although I would love the luxury of being able to do unpaid internships as a foot in the door. I am willing to move to alot of different cities for opportunities.

I'm sorry if I have rambled, and if there are any questions please shoot, or if I have missed anything out please let me know.

Thanks anyone who can help :)"

Helpdesk isn't too busy with anything out of the usual 'reset my password' stuff. Not a great day, but, a fundamentally solid morning.

Scratch that, got a ticket in from someone in Accounting, we'll call him M, seems pretty urgent too :

&gt; **M :** Excel won't open, get error *random error message that i'm not entirely familiar with*, tried on multiple pc's with my account so it must be a user issue and not a pc issue.

Wait.. did this guy ACTUALLY submit a ticket with info?? Praise be to the TFTS Gods.

&gt; **Carl :** I looked at your user settings, seems there are some local settings on your Citrix account that aren't working very well together. Where is your desk located, I'll come check it out.

&gt; **M :** Near that new girls desk which is near the accounting cafeteria which is near that one loud printer you came to fix 3 weeks ago.

Welp, I guess they can't be useful at explaining everything. I'll hold onto the fact that he submitted a proper / nice ticket :)

We go through the whole 9 yards of explaining where his desk is located, I'm going to head over there now and see whats up. Shouldn't be long, will update when I'm back.

**15 Minutes Later**

So I'm back, man that was interesting. Nice guy, a little understanding of his explanation now, it was literally as he said it, couldn't miss it, near the new girls desk near the caf near that printer.. huh.. 

&gt; **Carl :** Hey M, mind if I hop on your pc for a few minutes, take a look at whats wrong?

&gt; **M :** Yeah sure, I'll be right back, take your time.

So looking around, his local settings are pretty good for the most part, seems it's just his Citrix webpage shortcut for excel is all screwy. Literally as easy to fix as recreating a shortcut, but that's not his fault, he doesn't really have much access, that's something I will have Intern do so he can get some experience with these issues later.

I notice M is returning with a drink from the caf.

&gt; **Carl :** Alright so it's just a little issue with the shortcut, I'll go back to my desk and fix it up real quick and I'll email you when it's done!

I even said this politely, which is rare, but he was nice, so I tried to be.

&gt; **M :** I CANT BELIEVE IT, GOSH DANGIT!!!!! THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!!!!!!!! D:&lt;

He  was red faced and fuming and for some reason pissed off. This caught me by surprise, I don't know what I had done wrong, and everyone was looking.

&gt; **Carl :** I'm.... sorry M, not sure what I did wrong? :(

In a much calmer voice :

&gt; **M :** Oh, no you did just fine. I was just informing the accounting office that the cafeteria was out of straws. 

He flashes me a smile and I can hear everyone chuckling softly to themselves. 

&gt; **M :** April fools, and happy birthday Carl!

Wut?

&gt; **Carl :** We're in the middle of July, and its not my birthday, uh... so, you know... yeah...

&gt; **M :** WUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTT?!?!?! THIS IS TOTALLY THE LAST STRAW!! 

Again I hear everyone chuckling, one guy couldn't contain it apparently, and started laughing uncontrollably. It was contagious, as everyone joined in after that. Everyone but poor me, who was still in shock and slightly confused.

M, noticing my lack of laughter, patted me on the head :

&gt; **M :** Sorry Carl, just playing a little joke on ya, didn't mean to make you all flustered. Go fix that excel shortcut, and here.. have a cookie.

He hands me a cookie. I walk out of the accounting dept with all those people still laughing. The cookie was nice, made me feel a little better. I will also note that the head-patting was quite helpful too.

As I got back to my desk, i sat down and started typing this up and beckoned for Intern to come over here and fix the issue. He seemed pleased that I asked him to help out and fixed the issue properly and went back to Reddit browsing on his PC, *Loaner45 II* :D

With the issue fixed, I emailed M back,

&gt; **Carl :** M, fixed the shortcut, try now please.

&gt; **M :** I don't see the shortcut anywhere.

&gt; **Carl :** Oh, sorry, forgot I renamed it ""THIS IS THE LAST SHORTCUT!!!!!!!!"". Have a good day M !

**Final Thought :** So, a weird morning ended with me getting a free cookie and making a new friend as well as me being nice to Intern (cookie may have been drugged, can't confirm or deny). Just a typical Tuesday morning. 

**UPDATE #1 :** Also, in case anyone was wondering, I did end up having that stupid ""How can we prevent this"" meeting, last night via conference call from my house. I read a comment from /u/Osiris32 about him being ok with even stocking it in the Server Room. I suggested that to the execs with the explination that ""It would be easier to keep an eye on and take inventory of"" and they liked the idea. I did too, as it meant that GenericEmployee would have to walk a loooooooong way to get the paper, and I mean, why wouldn't we want him to get some exercise before taking another hour long potty-break :)"

2arl69,2,2014-07-15,Classic case of garlic burn to the genitals,[deleted],medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/2arl69/classic_case_of_garlic_burn_to_the_genitals/,"Hello all,

I'm a 21 year old male, and last night I burnt my penis with garlic.

So for about 6 months now, i've had 3-4 warts on my genital area. 2 on the shaft, 1 inner thigh, 1 on the head. And no, nothing itches. I went to the doctor at the beginning of the summer, and he prescribed a cream that I cannot remember the name of. Turns out my parents insurance only covers  $20 of the $320 cream. $320! I'm a poor college student working a low paying internship. F**k that noise. So thus began my adventure into home remedies. 

Apple cider vinegar actually proved to be very effective against my biggest wart. Killed it in one night. Then completely healed in a week and a half. This method proved useless however on the others. 

So last night I decided to try the tea tree oil and galric method. So I rubed tea tree on my shaft, and bandaged a crushed clove over the wart. It burned like no other. But the internet said burning sensation is normal. So I dealt with it. Stopped burning after 15 minutes and I left it on for about an hour. Looking back, I don't think it was supposed to burn THAT bad, and I should have immediately removed the garlic.

So this morning, the treated area swelled up quite a bit. And it's somewhat purple. I took an ibuprofen and iced it a little before work. I just checked in the bathroom and the swelling is down 50%. So my question did I just do some serious skin damage and should I be worried? I would take a picture, but im in the office right now writing this on my phone.

Also I don't feel comfortable being sexually active agian until these damn warts are gone. So any advice there would be good. And for a side note. I am a very healthy individual who is a marathon runner.  I eat plenty of leafy greens, fruits, fish etc. 

Tl;dr I burnt my penis with garlic. Should I be concerned?"
2arsb3,2,2014-07-15,no point,S3tanta,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2arsb3/no_point/,"I just wanted an unpaid fucking internship for the summer but that's too much it seems. I've sent out so many CVs and get no responses, I know how to program, know C, Perl, Matlab, some BASH and C++, but they don't care. I don't even expect to be paid, I'm applying to work for free and it's like smashing my head against a brick wall. I usually meet or exceed the criteria for the positions I apply for, but without experience it doesn't matter.

Now I'm seeing unpaid internships advertised requiring a degree and 1 year experience with specific skills (Network intrusion systems, cloud encryption and things that they don't teach undergraduates). This is fucked, why do I even bother?

Then the media talks about all these ""unfilled IT positions"" as if it were true. Programming is going to be a minimum wage job by the time I graduate(If I ever do pass Electronic Engineering).

There's no point, everything is fucked, it's pointless and hopeless. I won't get so much as an email rejecting my application."

^It's about 3 inches shorter than that.

And obviously my hair isn't as nicely done up or anything as those people.

So first of all would ombre work for my hair? Is it too light or something? I was just looking to do some natural lightening, nothing too intense.

Also, is it reasonable? I'm NOT paying for a dresser to do it, I'd get a friend to do it and she is definitely not an expert in hair. So I'm kind of worried about that. If she is careful and follows online tutorials closely, would it be fine? Or should I not risk it? I don't want to damage my hair needlessly.

One more thing, if it's natural, can it look professional enough? I'm an incoming college freshman, so the only jobs I will be looking for are a few internships and jobs at my college. Also, I'm a computer science major, and I feel that jobs in computer science tend to be more casual, so I think I'm fine. But if anyone thinks otherwise, please say so.

Thanks for the input!"

Not being ever so popular, I was nervous that no one would even come. Being 20, I knew some friends were busy with internships, graduating, traveling, etc. and I just didn't want to impose. But with the push of my sisters, I sent an invitation e-mail in June to about 6 good ol' buddies. 

Then came the financial issues. For some reason, everyone in my family is being hit hard with some major problem or another. Sister one's husband was sent to prison, and she was left to take care of the financial mess he left behind. Sister two was broke after just previously financing my niece's sweet 16 (she so deserved it!). Mom never made too much money but felt that she had to help. I felt awful thinking they had to put my shower together at such a time. It made me nervous and just bad in general. 

But, through thick and thin and my family insisting to go on with the show, the date finally arrived. My guests were there in my sister's cleaned up backyard, the homemade cake and treats were as if they were bought in a bakery, my siblings and nephews were being so funny and cute, and everything was just perfect. My little garden shower was much more beautiful than I would have ever thought possible and my guests said they had a great time. I learned later that DH helped out with buying things and cleaning up, so that was great. I even have ""left over"" guests; a few people coming by this week who couldn't make it that date. 

I just felt like sharing how happy things could get, especially for those like me (anxious and scared that things will fall apart). I have been SO emotionally down lately and this shower thrown by my wonderful family has lifted up my spirits. Wish everyone a lovely day and great baby showers for those who haven't had theirs yet :).

I really want to do a coop but hope for a 50-100% raise. How do I ask for this?


Probably too much info/backstory:

I got hired by a small company rapidly growing company to develop web apps and backend web stuff in general. Now I hadn't really done all that much with web but the experience so far is amazing. I'm the only real programmer for the entire company everything so far has been outsourced or programmed by my boss or the owner who have no time to do it anymore.

By chance I randomly applied an instantly took the job without regards to pay out of desperation. The experience in my opinion is by far worth taking the position as I only have 1 semester left with no previous internship experience. I get to nearly completely design how the system will work and implement it. I am given insane amounts of freedom and it's really enjoyable. 

Tomorrow is when I meet with my boss the owner to discuss what I've done and talk about where to go from here etc. On top I that I mentioned doing a co-op and he said we'd also talk about that at the meeting. I'm wondering how to go about doing this when I would need double the pay I'm currently getting to just be average for my uni. How should I go about asking for such a large raise? I don't honestly think they know I'm so severely underpaid as the only other interns they have are like social media and similar positions who are as happy as can be just to be paid. 

Should I mention the average pay for cs interns/my school(uni has info on their site for each years average intern salaries) or not. I hear vastly varying opinions on whether or not to mention typical pay for a position when discussing salary.

 I would really just appreciate any advice/thoughts regarding my position."

This thread, ""about"" a TSA agent who apparently didn't know DC was in the US.  Which is mildly entertaining in a pathetic way, lets see what reddit has to say on the matter:

&gt;Can't we just remove TSA already?  They are like a bunch of children with to much power running around fucking up everything in sight.

Top comment.  Yes clearly the TSA is totally unnecessary, we just get rid of airport security, clearly they are ""fucking everything up.""  Personally I've never had any problem beyond them asking to look in my bad once or twice but i guess thats a useless anecdote

&gt;Could not agree with you more. TSA agents are dumb. The whole idea needs to be revisited.

TSA agents are ""dumb"", therefore the idea of airport security needs to be ""revisited""?

&gt;Welcome to statism.

Gilded.  Not really sure how you get from ""TSA agents are dumb"" to ""statism,"" but I guess there's a connection?

&gt;I'm just glad i live in Norway

Ah, no thread would be complete without the obligatory ""oh well in Norway its better"".  Our racial superior continues:

&gt;To show the difference in air port security, a friend of mine was taking a plane to another country (forgot where it was, in Europe somewhere)  And when the lady asked if she could check the bag he smiled and said yes, and then followed up by saying, ""Oh, if you find a bomb inside there that is not mine, that is his"", and then proceeded to point to a friend.  All that happened was she looked at him a bit annoyed and said, this is an airport don't joke about that.

Man this guy's friend sounds like one heck of a prankster (also note he was flying ""somewhere in Europe"" as if that was a necessary component of the story)!  If only you could make bomb jokes in American airports, the horror!

Moving on, we get to how redditors *really* feel about the TSA and why they hate it so

&gt;The TSA agents I see in JFK/LGA here in NYC are the ghetto kids from high school who couldn't find a better job. They barely passed courses and yet they are allowed to running security for airports?! It's absolutely frustrating to see this. 

Ahhh... the ""ghetto kids"".  Also I don't think low level TSA agents are ""running security"" any more than a senators intern is writing policy but thats besides the point.

&gt;The TSA is a veiled jobs program. 

literally welfare.  

&gt;I beginning to think that the job requirements for being a TSA agent is equivalent to that of the individual who highlights your receipts when you leave Wal-Mart.

lol wal mart people are dumb!

&gt;The TSA shelters incompetent fools that should never be in a position of perceived power. Nothing good will ever come out of the TSA

Yes, nothing good at all.  We should let people bring whatever they want onto planes with no checks, at least then we wouldn't have to deal with ghetto TSA agents

&gt;Raise your hands, how many people here are aware that you can become a TSA agent without having graduated high-school? Anyone?

*They don't even have STEM degrees*

&gt;Get rid of the detectors and agents and let everyone take their chances.  Then, if air travel frightens you, stay the fuck at home. If it costs the airlines millions in lost profit, I don't care. Airline profits are not my concern.


This ""I'm a genius but I just am not interested in academics"" redditor has it all figured out.  Airline profits *aren't his concern*.

&gt;Anyone who has ever been on the Blue Line from O'Hare in Chicago after a shift change knows exactly the type of quality employees the TSA is hiring. They are the ones who are brown bagging some Hennessey with a blunt behind their ear while they're rolling another, and listening to their music on their phones with no headsets taking as loudly as they can to each other about the hood rats.

Now it really comes out.  The TSA is unacceptable because it gives black people some tiny degree of power for a few minutes over the keyboard warriors of reddit.


Seriously what the fuck is with this blatant racist hatred of the TSA?  I live in the Washington DC area and fly out of some of the busiest airports in the world pretty frequently.  I have never had what I would consider to be an unreasonable wait, certainly nothing worse then waiting for tolls on 95 or trying to grab a Chipotle burrito at the lunch rush.  Personally I do not really mind waiting in a security line if that means even 1 attempt at a hijacking or weapons smuggling is prevented.

2as97w,1,2014-07-15,What salary should I expect for a Jr. Systems Coordinator with a completely irrelevant degree and low gpa?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2as97w/what_salary_should_i_expect_for_a_jr_systems/,"My degree is in Anthropology, but no one's questioned that yet and asked me what I learned in the CIS/CS classes I took (about 10 courses, though it wasn't my minor).  
I've held coordinating and liaising positions in multiple, incredibly relevant, organizations and teams (all of which my interviewers were very interested in and impressed by).  
My gpa is horrible at a 2.2.  

I have held an IT and Marketing internship and a Business Analyst internship (total of two years experience). I recently had interviews at Fannie Mae for a Jr. Systems Coordinator/Jr. Project Manager contract position.  
The recruiter is offering me 50k.
I also have an offer from a less known company for a Jr. Business Analyst position, with 55k +benefits employment.  
Are these good salaries based on my track record? I'm incredibly thankful and don't want to pass this opportunity up but don't know which offer to take. Which would lend to a better career path? Would it be better to take the contract position so I can look for another job with that experience in the bank?"
2as9z3,2,2014-07-15,"Getting a ""real job"" after failing at being self-employed?",FailedSolopreneur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2as9z3/getting_a_real_job_after_failing_at_being/,"Graduated in August 2009 with a degree in Finance.  Didn't bother to participate in on-campus recruiting because I had been promised a job with the place I had spent the last 2 summers working an internship for (municipal gov't).  Got whacked by a hiring freeze, though, so no job.

Had thought about joining the Army (OCS), but found out I couldn't pass the medical after I had spent more than a year preparing for it (dropped from 280 lbs to &lt;200, but nobody told me eczema was a prohibited condition).

Eventually got some money together and started my own business in 2012 (had been kicking the idea around since late 2010).  Things have not gone well, frankly.  Had some decent success earlier on, but I'm just going deeper and deeper into debt, and my family is no longer able to support me financially.

How do I get a real job now?  I have no references (haven't had a boss or co-worker since 2008).  I have some decent domain-specific expertise/knowledge, but I don't have much (tangible) to prove that.  My main issues have been managing my supply chain (got tied to an unreliable vendor - switching is expensive, and wouldn't generate revenue before October at this point) - which means I am severely behind on shipping what orders I have generated, and none of my customers are particularly happy with me, so I can't use them for references.

Am I just completely fucked at this point?  The thought of accepting a &lt;$30k/yr job is incredibly depressing, though I realize that some income would be better than no income - and even if I did apply for those, I'm not confident that I would even be able to get them!

My knowledge and experience should qualify me for pretty good jobs (probably $55-65k/yr), but I have no idea how to sell myself to companies.  My resume says I've been self-employed since 2010 (because that's when I started working on my business plan).  I really don't know what to do at this point.

tl;dr - Graduated college, got hit by hiring freeze, started my own company, which is failing; how do I get a real job?"
2asesf,5,2014-07-15,I have no idea what I'm doing. Need some help with segmenting the network for my vms,wtfamireading,vmware,https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/2asesf/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_need_some_help_with/,"Hello everyone. I was recently hired as an intern to a small IT organization for a possible QA position. Before this past month I didn't know anything about virtualization save for using virtualbox in linux. These past three weeks have been quite the learning experience, as instead of shadowing or following someone's instructions, I've been pretty much left on my own... like literately (there are days where no one even talks to me). For this role I was given the task of learning as much as I could about VMware and to create a virtual test environment: get a vm of windows server 2012 running with a domain controller, create a vm sql server, and create few more vms that will all be connected to it. 

For all of this much to my surprise I was given my own test server to play with: a dell power edge r920. I first made sure to update all the firmware on the server and got used to dell (iDRAC) 7. After that I installed ESXi 5.5 onto the dell server as the hyper-visor so it was good to go. After that I installed vSphere Client on my own desktop. From there I created the virtual machines as requested

And around here is where I'm not sure how to progress... I've created 5 virtual machines which was easy enough, but was told to make sure they are on a different network then our companies network (my supervisor freaked out when I originally had all the vms on the companies network, as she was worried that a new domain controller might interfere with the company's regular DC). I know of course that in vsphere client I can select my server and then goto the configuration of the network adapters to configures the nics there. Here's an Imgr of the setup with the IP's blacked out http://i.imgur.com/rwv1nQj.jpg?1

So as you guys can see I have vSwitch 0 which is connected to the internet as it's on the companies 10. IP range. The same with the vCenter Orchestrator Appliance. Now my question is  what to do with everything on vSwitch1... are they all correctly isolated? I would assume so since I gave them an IP range that was 169-172. Though I don't know if I can get the vm's in the network to communicate with each other as I've had no luck so far

sorry for the long story. Hope this is also the right area to ask these questions. Does anyone have any tips or guides on how to proceed from here on? 

Oh and one last question: where does one get the new web client that I heard they were pushing to repleace vSphereclient?

Hey there! My name is Chris and I'm a grad student and full stack dev that's worked in research as well as on real world products. I could tell you that I'm a go getter and how I've got a great work ethic or I could sit here and rattle off all the projects I've worked on and what I've done for them but you can find that in my resume [here](https://my.indeed.com/me/ChrisManess). Instead I'd just like to take a moment and highlight two projects that I'm particularly proud of and detail what I did for them and maybe there's a need for someone like me at your company.

CoNNECT - Initially destined to be a project that everyone would forget about CoNNECT had a rocky start and it was the first project I worked on as an intern at Oak Ridge National Labs. CoNNECT was meant to be a  way for people to look at their energy usage and compare it to people in their neighborhood, zip, and city. I was given the project about a month in to my internship and told it's probably all I would work on for the remainder of the time. I developed some visualizations using Protovis.js(now known as D3.js) along with a web application that fit the bill. During this time I also worked with some energy usage experts to figure out other metrics that could be added in to the visualizations in order to help users better understand their numbers. What I developed over the last two months of that summer would go on to secure more funding for this particular project and today this project is being licensed to a company in the Knoxville TN area for further development. 

[Article 1](http://www.wate.com/story/16619405/new-ornl-technology-to-help-kub-customers-with-their-bill)

[Licensing Press Release](http://www.fiveworx.com/uncategorized/fiveworx-licenses-ornl-energy-analysis-tool/)

Twitter parser - This project was proposed by my boss and I was given free reign to see what could be done with the public 1% twitter stream. What insight could we obtain from tweets if any insights at all. We started up just in time to examine the 2012 London Olympics. From that large event we were able to determine the flow of people from event to event as well as catch a glimpse of the night life in London (unintentional but it's interesting none the less). As time went on I further developed the project to where it was a real time processing engine of tweets that could handle up to 1k tweets per second. I also developed an application that one could look at individual queries of tweets and used that to watch and predict the 2012 presidential election as well as look at other events such as the appointment of Pope Francis (There was quite a large following of people that believed it would be Angelo Scola). Eventually I created a pipeline that would allow anyone to write their own analysis algorithms and plug it in to check things like sentiment, grammar, and other interesting metrics. 

Anyways that's all I've got. You now know what kind of projects make me excited and some of the things that I can do for you. Again if you'd like a more comprehensive list please check out my resume. Feel free to message me on Reddit or use my personal email on my resume."

2asp66,6,2014-07-15,Account in Collections due to previous landlord who claimed I was driving his truck. What can I do?,ThanksLyingLandlord,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2asp66/account_in_collections_due_to_previous_landlord/,"Two summers ago, I had a summer internship across the country, and I rented a house from a person in Washington state. I moved back to Tennessee in August after staying at his house that summer. Last week I logged into a credit score website to find a mark on my score due to an account in collections that had recently been associated to my credit score account. After some investigating, I found out that my landlord signed a 'declaration of truth' that I was driving his vehicle at the time that he received a camera-issued traffic citation. The court then assigned the ticket to my name and attempted to contact me at the previous address. I moved two months prior to them sending the letter, and I had my mail forwarded through the postal service. However, the letter was sent to the previous address and returned to the court. I never received any documentation until seeing the collections account and my subsequent investigation last week. 

I spoke with him notifying him of the issue and that he would need to clear my name. Of course, he sounded dumbfounded that he had 'made that mistake' and he would take care of it. I am going to send him the collections information, and tell him to go to to the court and/or collections agency and clear my name through their records.

I have credit card receipts and papers from school that will be able to help me prove that I was living in Tennessee and did not make any transactions in Washington around that time period.

However, I am hesitant to believe that he will go to court and admit to perjury, which was the penalty for making false claims on the court's 'statement of truth' document. From my searches, it seems that perjury is a felony and has some harsh consequences.

What is the best thing for me to do? If I take him to court, what am I legally able to recover? I would have to pay for flight tickets from Detroit to Seattle, rental car or taxi fare, hotel room, food, lost time at work, attorney's fees, court costs, etc. Would I be able to recover all of this?

Please let me know any and all 'legal' advice!

**TL;DR**: Previous landlord falsely claimed I drove his car during camera issued ticket. I was never notified until last week. Account now in collections. How do I clear my name and recover all costs associated with doing so?"
2asp9a,2,2014-07-15,Have been in a financial rut the past few months and I need some advice on how to move forward.,[deleted],AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/2asp9a/have_been_in_a_financial_rut_the_past_few_months/,"I am going to try and cover all my bases here as to avoid any confusion. 

It all started back in October when I left my second internship position due to a highly toxic environment and lack of respect. I was unemployed through December, but was fortunate enough to have a decent savings. In that time frame, however, I had to get a new car (my old car crapped out on me) and a new phone. I also found a well paying job that began in January, so I was not too financially drained at that point (My birthday is a week before Christmas so I got a decent amount of cash). 

So, I start this job in January, all is well until March. My cat had two serious illnesses back to back that needed immediate attention. I had to get Care Credit, which was maxed out the same night I applied for it and that does not include all the follow-up visits, food and medication I paid for out of pocket. Continuing on, things get a little better financially and I can start saving again. I feel good at this point, until I lose my job in June because of a minor miscommunication. She gave severance pay, but it was not nearly enough to help me through the following months.

My bills consist of:
$1,100 CC debt 
$6,300 Loan for car ($225/month)
$5,000 School Loans 
$75/3 months for pet insurance 
$500 miscellaneous (gas, gym payment, medication/food for my cat, etc). 

I'm 21 years old, live at home and financially independent. My parents cannot support me in that way as they have a ton of debt and my Mom will be on disability for a few months due to surgery. My boyfriend helps out in any way he can, but I can't depend on him as he has his own financial debts.

I do have a wonderful job now, but I just started (finished training this week and have my first consultations Saturday), but it's solely commission based=no sale, no money. I have been going on interviews (at least one a week), but no luck. I do not have enough money to make it through next month and I'm extremely stressed. Any advice on where I can turn? 

tl;dr - Lost my job and blew through my savings in a months time. Have a job now, but won't make it through August. Need advice/tips. "
2asr0r,0,2014-07-15,A Debate that has Raged for Decades,btbama22,Seahawks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/2asr0r/a_debate_that_has_raged_for_decades/,"Posted this in Field Gulls about a month ago. Just joined this subreddit, so figured I'd share!


Football vs. Women

In a world full of many pleasures, methods of entertainment, and other materialistic attitudes, very few things have as significant of an impact on us men as football and women. Often times, said female does not care about football, and won't watch with us. Fortunately, as long as we still make sure to spend time with her afterwards, these two can normally coexist.

Sometimes though, the woman actually enjoys football. She is a dream come true for most of us, especially if she is a diehard fan of the same team. It is the perfect scenario.

But this world is far from perfect, and often has a sadistic sense of humor:

See, I go to college at Alabama, so there aren't exactly Seahawks fans here. In fact, I have never met a true Seahawks fan in my entire life. Well, I met a girl through a mutual friend in May, who happens to be really attractive. We only briefly met, but there was definitely some chemistry at work there. We chatted easily, and she seemed genuinely interested. She even came from California to go to school here (which is great with me, I don't fit in with the south as well as I should, considering I grew up here).

I didn't think much of it, until our mutual friend sent me a text a couple of days ago saying that I had made quite an impression on this girl. And the next day, California girl was following me on twitter.

Living by myself for an internship in another state, I typically have nothing better to do, so I started stalking mindlessly strolling through this girl's twitter timeline to get a little bit of a glimpse of who she was. She doesn't tweet often, so it didn't take long to go back quite a few months. When I hit May, she had quite a few tweets regarding the NFL draft, some going as far back as the 6th round. Needless to say I was quite impressed, and understandably a little excited.

Upon arriving in January, there were many tweets about Alabama, and her hatred for Auburn, so I'm really beginning to like what I'm seeing... and thats when the sky fell.

She was tweeting about the NFC Championship game, passionately supporting the Niners, and making good use of the hashtag #BeattheHawks.

Anyway, its been slow news lately, and frankly I'm tired of hearing about Marshawn. Hope this provided a little entertainment and some insight into the life of a displaced 12th man. Once I have some money to my name, I promise Im coming up to Seattle for my first game within a few years! (and if I've fallen into some sort of twisted relationship with the girl in the story, I might make her come too).

Go Hawks!"

Currently:
~3.55 GPA (3.5 in just math courses).
Math club participant (future president hopefully)
Eagle Scout with 100s of hours of community service
Econ minor
Business Analyst internship at John Hancock
(Another internship next summer)
All math classes I will graduate with:
Calc II, Calc III, Lin Alg, Ordinary Diff Eqs, Real Analysis, Group Theory, Probability and Stats, Stats and Stochastic Processes, Topology, Fourier Series &amp; PDEs and Numerical Analysis.
Planned GPA for graduation: ~3.65 (3.55-3.65 in my math courses).
I also talked to a professor and planned on doing research my last year along with my capstone.

Should I try and do anything else? My goal is a PhD in Math from Brown (easy commute for me). Can someone also tell me from personal experience the life of a PhD student? 60 hours work week then maybe working part time? Just want to try and plan ahead! :)"
2astgu,1,2014-07-15,Getting a job with no work experience and a fresh new Computer Science degree.,ThatGuyWhoKnowStuff,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2astgu/getting_a_job_with_no_work_experience_and_a_fresh/,"I am a recent university graduate with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Math. I did no coop's or internships throughout my degree (which I somewhat regret), the only relevant job I had was working for a robotics professor at my school. The work I was doing wasn't web and it barely was Computer Science. That is about all my work experience that is a even a bit relevant. My other jobs that I took instead of looking for internships/coops were at a iron ore mine,  I worked for a full salary every summer. This allowed me to go to school with no student loans and now that I'm graduated I owe nothing to nobody.

Throughout my schooling I learned a lot in class, but most of the stuff I learned was stuff on my own. I learned IOS development in school, so I decided to go home and learn android. I learned python, so I decided to go experiment with Django. Then I found node, and so I dug into that. My final project for school was wrote in node. I can’t think of big projects to work on, but when someone gives me an idea then I can sit down and code it out in no time. I was in the top of my class with coding, I did well in the programming competitions held at school. I know data structures and algorithms very well. My problem isn't coding, it is coming up with ideas to do and staying focused. When I'm doing work for someone else, I barely ever take breaks, but when I work on my own projects then I'm always distracted.

So my problem now is that I can't get a job. I apply for about 10-20 jobs a week and never hear back from any of them. My resume and cover letters seem fine to me and everyone else who reads them (If you want a read I can PM them to you). My lack of real world experience is what is holding me back. So my question is, how should I go about getting a job/real world experience? 

TL;DR Have a Computer Science Degree, I have no experience, my fault, took higher paying job every summer to keep loans down. How do I get into the workforce without real world experience?"
2asxnq,4,2014-07-15,[I am BPD diagnosed] Can any of you give me advice on how to engage with my parents?,[deleted],BPDSOFFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDSOFFA/comments/2asxnq/i_am_bpd_diagnosed_can_any_of_you_give_me_advice/,"In the spirit of trying to unify those diagnosed with BPD and those who are SOFFA, I'm looking for advice on how to positively engage with my parents. Feel free to look through my post history, and ask any questions that I've not covered… 

I was an unhappy teen specialising in self harm, bulimia and a constant state of being asleep, that concluded with poor exam results despite my academic intelligence. My parents knew I was unhappy, but for whatever reason didn't give me any direct help, perhaps because they thought it was a teenage phase. We got along great, in the grant scheme of things, although our relationship has always been built upon a very practical, rather than emotional, level. I went to Uni and did amazingly well. I was still unhappy, and very depressed, but academically I excelled. During my postgraduate years my life began to crumble - all my self esteem issues seemed to rear their heads, and I self medicated with extreme self harm and alcohol abuse. Again academically I did surprisingly alright, but on a personal level I was a mess. My parents hardly saw me during my Uni days, but towards the end, when the alcohol took hold, they began to receive SOS messages from me and realised what a bad state I was in. I had alcohol related hospitalisations, and I pissed off a fair few flatmates, but I honestly believe that everyone at the time felt pity for me because they realised I was not mentally well. I'm intelligent, friendly, empathetic and hardworking… and yet troubled. Alcohol made living easier, but at the same time it picked away at every insecurity I have and I have had so many alcohol related breakdowns its unreal, and unfortunately my parents have had to pick up the pieces more than once.

From the age of 16 onwards I have been in contact with the medical profession, and have been diagnosed with a whole bunch of stuff, and given a whole bunch of medication, but none of it has worked. This is mainly because I've moved around so much due to my academic career that I've never been in one place long enough for proper treatment. BPD has been the main diagnosis for around 4 years now.

Fast forward a little to the end of last year and I was accepted into an internship that should have been perfect, but due to problems with my supervisor and myself I once again self medicated with alcohol. My parents dragged me back home and I have been here since February, and have slowly fallen into a black hole of depression and self hatred. I want to be striving in my academic/professional career but have found my BPD tendencies too strong to resist. I am in limbo - I am miserable living at home with my parents because I want to be living my own life, and I know I am a burden to them, but I am aware that I am mentally a mess who will revert to negative coping strategies very quickly. I am getting some support from the medical profession, but currently it is all focused towards long term therapy in a couple of months, and giving me no support from my self harm, suicidal tendencies or general lack of interest in life. 

Very few people know I have mental health problems - I am friendly and hardworking enough that people do not suspect anything at all. But I can sleep all day if I have nothing to do, although I'm putting a lot of plans into place to have a professionally challenging job for the next few months, and I am trying to exercise and socialise when possible.

My parents are frustrated. Initially they were frustrated with me because they thought I wasn't engaging with the NHS, but since being back for an extended period they have realised that the support is simply not there for me. I see my CPN every 3 or 4 weeks, and only because I ask for it. I am too highly functioning to gain any real help, and despite alcoholism, self harm and a very recent suicide attempt I am still dismissed. I have unfortunately fallen back into some old habits, specifically self harming and occasionally drinking heavily, as a way of coping as I feel as though I am getting no support from the NHS, but I do not do these things any where near as much as I used to, and I do not tell anyone (other than Drs) about it. 

My question to you is how do I show my parents that I am trying, and that I am engaging? For me getting out of bed in the morning is huge, as is going to work, planning for my future and exercising, because all of these are engaging with a future that I do not think I deserve to have. I think my parents are currently most frustrated with he lack of support from the NHS than they are with me, but they're out of their depth. 

Help?

[Edit: Im British, and the health care here is so different from elsewhere that I think its important to add that I have never been hospitalised, nor will I ever be. We just don't hospitalise people like me in this country.]"
2at2ip,1,2014-07-15,I feel like my application is exactly the reverse of everyone else's- what are my chances?,speakerlegs,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2at2ip/i_feel_like_my_application_is_exactly_the_reverse/,"It seems like all ""Will I/you get into graduate school?"" posts don't fit me, and I'll explain why. 

I go to a highly prestigious undergraduate school, especially for my field (the life sciences). I have considerable research experience for an undergraduate. I have essentially 4+ years of lab experience, strong personal connections with a few PIs, a research award, an internship, and a good summer REU over the years. Long story short, I will be able to list about 8 publications, about 3 of which I'm first author on, when I apply this year.

I've taken interesting and hard classes in the sciences, about 5 of them were graduate classes. I also have extremely good programming experience and a github account to show for it. My GRE scores are top 10%.

and the kicker is my GPA is a 3.0.

I feel as though I'm at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to graduate admissions. My school is extremely challenging, subject to grade deflation, and filled with the brightest students and I cannot help but feel that it would be trivial to maintain a 4.0 at other universities which aren't as challenging. Honestly when I see graduate students or REU students coming from unknown small liberal arts and unknown state schools, I feel as though I was utterly lied to as a high school student when told to go to the best school I could get into.

I just wonder what graduate schools think about applicants like me. Is there any weight given to undergraduate prestige at all? Does obvious research excellence override a lower GPA?"

I am currently on summer break, but am about to begin my 2nd year of University. However, while on break, I began to wonder how much the difference is in cost from US to Sweden, in terms of University and day-to-day. 

So, my questions are as follows:

* Which Swedish University is best for Information Systems/Computer Science?

* If you think this is a poor idea to do now, how long should I wait?

The initial idea is that I finish my 2nd year and then apply to Halmstad University, Stockholm University, or Blekinge University. 

As for details: 

* I do have a passport

* I have ~a years worth of actual experience in the field of IT, specifically in Help Desk/Server Management and Upkeep as both a Intern and a Part-Timer for the same company.

I don't know where I'd like to work, just that I want it to involve computers (though I'm leaning towards software development), and to pay well (life goal is to exceed £80k salary). I'm currently going into college (that's UK college; A levels) and looking to take Maths, Further Maths, Physics, Computing, and Music Technology at AS (with the possibility of dropping Music Tech if 5 AS levels prove to be too much work). Following on from that, I'd like to go to university (ideally Cambridge) to study Computer Science - to be completely honest, I'd like a PhD, but the FAQ suggests that this is less than wise.

Is doing a UK Master's worth it? What are these company-funded Master's degrees I've heard very briefly about - how can they work if you already have a job? I've also heard about internships that take place in the Summers between years of education - this seems like far too short a space of time; is that related to the differences between UK and USA?

I really have a lot of questions, but for the most part it's just confusion, and I don't even know what my questions are. 

TL;DR: Gaaaaaahhhhhhhh help me where do I start?!"
2at4oj,1,2014-07-15,"This job is all I have, and they need me, but I can't stay.",macally14,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2at4oj/this_job_is_all_i_have_and_they_need_me_but_i/,"I'm not sure what thread to post this under… I figured r/offmychest was applicable because it’s kind of a combination of job and finance issues. I feel like I should leave the job, but I'm a fresh graduate from college and this is my ‘first full-time job’ even though I’ve been doing graphic design for about 4-5 years. I'm at an interesting risk of posting this, I hope not to make it too personal but I'm sure it would be identifiable... Here goes nothing.
The company I work for is an advertising firm of some sort. I don’t want to get too specific because of recognition issues. It’s sort of a “mom and pop” shop, if you will. I work for this company as a graphic designer and technician. In most companies, you would think those two jobs would be separate. However, the local ‘team’ I'm on, is rather small (about 7 people, including myself). We have other offices around the state and in other states of about the same size. The owner of the company, we’ll just call her “Paula” hired me in April of 2014. At first I was supposed to just be an (unpaid) intern, but then she decided she wanted me to be on salary ($250/wk). She told me this was a part-time job, but she was very impressed with my work so she wanted to give me a salary. I was originally hired as a graphic designer, but since I had technical experience as well, I offered to take over the role of the technician since the current one was leaving the company. I didn’t expect a pay-raise because at the time there were some setbacks that caused sales to plummet for about a month. So, I was busy, but “part-time job” busy. Which was fine.

I should note: I asked about becoming a full-time worker when a friend of mine was hired as a salesperson for the company. When we started talking about full-time work, my friend (we’ll call him “Tim”) asked Paula if this job was able to supply any benefits (401K, Retirement, Medical, etc). Paula said that she wasn’t able to at this time but she’d “look into it.”

I'm being paid by check (that has the company name on it), but it’s just from a business checkbook. It’s not really very official, and there’s not really a well-documented paper trail (except for what I'm documenting). I started to become concerned when I realized that I was being paid as an “independent contractor”. Thus, I have to keep track of my expenses, income, gas/mileage, etc. so that the IRS doesn’t rape me at the end of the year. This is completely new to me because I am used to my paychecks already having the taxes taken out of them and then I usually get about $500-800 back at the end of the year.

Another thing that really bothers me is that I never signed an official contract of employment. I don’t have a physical (or digital I suppose) copy of my employment and duties. I don’t have a job description. I don’t have a salary agreement. I’ve asked multiple times about these but she seems to come up with excuses for why it hasn’t been done or that she doesn’t have “the time” to do them. This is excruciatingly frustrating because I know that if I leave this job it will be extremely hard to prove I was ever even employed there in case something were to come up with legalities. (i.e. she could say that I never even worked there, or she paid me more/less than she actually did, fake verbal agreements, etc.) Paula has told me since April that we were going to have an actual office in the town I live in. She lives about an hour away, and in May decided she would buy a trailer home in the town I live in, and live there / have it as our office. This was extremely awkward to ‘go to work’ in a trailer house. Other than having to go there a few times, I’ve been working from home and attending business meetings at various restaurants or meeting areas.

I’ve been taking out $50 of my $250 paychecks each week toward taxes. So, my income is about $800 a month. My rent alone is $380, which is almost half of my salary. I'm paying off my Macbook Pro (being a designer, it was kind of a “need” more than a “want”) which is $150 until November.
Two other designers that I graduated with are making $11/hr, full-time. So, they make roughly about $1760 a month, BEFORE taxes. That’s twice what I make now, for one full-time job. Keep in mind: I'm doing two different job positions here.

Now that you’ve got some background,

In the last few weeks, we’ve completely revamped the company because there were no policies in place (no contracts as I mentioned before), no marketing materials for the sales people, no training, nothing. I am very quick to learn so although it was difficult, it definitely could have went a lot smoother. This is an advertising firm that didn’t have any contracts in place for its customers. Everything seems to be run on verbal agreements. It’s actually kind of scary.

EDIT: In the last few weeks, I've been working 9am-5pm from home (with a lunch break around noon) Monday-Friday, which is not 'part-time' by any means. So, today, I brought up the fact that I'm being completely overworked for the amount of money I'm being paid (I worded it more nicely obviously) and Paula told me that she had to think about it, and finish another important project, but that I'm “at the top of the priority list after that.”

I will say I do love the people I work with. I think they’re awesome people. I think this business has awesome potential, but it’s so poorly organized and terribly coordinated I don’t think I’ll be with the company much longer. I’ve started applying for other jobs, but since I'm so “new” to the industry, it’s really, really hard to get a job in my field close to home. This company literally will have no one to take over if I leave and because I'm such a passive person, it’s making me stay, but I’m slowly becoming more and more miserable and more and more stressed about money.

I just wanted this off my chest, but I guess I’d take advice too."

My mother (obviously) did not approve and told me as much. I established roots, and was flourishing, far away from her cruel cut downs.  I was embarking on a career in a field I loved, I had a network of friends and coworkers, I was fit and active and happy, LC with nmom and her cronies.

Then I got sick. Again.

This time, my addled brain decided to misinterpret my own thoughts as foreign. Great.  Now imagine this happened to you. One moment, everything's fine, the next you were hearing voices.  You would not automatically think ""hmm. Must be schizophrenia."" no, you think it's someone talking to you.  It just so happened I shared a house with a guy, and it just so happened I was bedridden with the swine flu.  My first and most damning thought was that this guy was speaking to me through my door.  It was summer, and work had not yet started that year, so it was the most logical thing to think was happening.  We talked a lot. It got sexual. And I'm ashamed to say that one day, I got the courage to address him directly about what we'd been discussing. The sexual things.

It did not end well.

I was canned for sexual harassment *even though the guy KNEW i was having a psychotic break.* I still feel awful about that for so many reasons. The embarrassment. The poor guy.  No, the asshole guy, because he did what he thought was best and alerted my mom. My narcissistic, overbearing, cruelly manipulative mom.

She came in the middle of the night and refused to let me pack anything.  She took my phone.  She took my narcolepsy medication. I had none of my clothes, but she had a whole wardrobe of Ill fitting ""simple"" clothes (clothes that made me look like I was simple MINDED, and was told I smelled bad but I was never allowed to do laundry).  She refused to let me talk on the three hour long ride back to her home (my prison) since I was dehydrated and my voice was ""sticky.""  she cut up my credit cards (""in case they try to rescind your pay""). She locked up my meds, ""accidentally"" washed my phone so I didn't even have any contact numbers.  She took my keys and would only let me use the Internet while she was in the room so I wouldn't ""embarrass"" myself by talking to friends, coworkers, management.  Even though I was narcoleptic, I was not allowed to take medication for it as it may ""aggravate"" my condition but I was not allowed to sleep (though I was having what appeared to be sleep seizures).  During the day, I wasn't allowed to be in my bedroom at all, and at night, at night. My god.  I couldn't fall asleep for more than a few minutes, but more than once, I opened my eyes to find her mere inches away from my face, a smile playing on her lips and a ""just seeing if you were sleeping alright."". I learned not to sleep too deeply. I trained myself to hear the door creaking open slightly, and recognize her feet tiptoeing towards the bed, saying to myself ""breathe deeply. Don't open your eyes, feign sleep till she goes away."". I was not allowed to address my father (""he thinks you're faking it, don't bother him"") or my little brother (""he's too young to understand, don't take his innocence away"") etc.  I was terrified all the time, and at first she wouldn't let me see a doctor, but threatened on more than one occasion to have me committed (but don't worry, I'll visit"").  And she went out of her way to terrify me.  One memorable chess move was taking the head off off a Stuffed animal an ex had commissioned for me that looked like my first dog, leaving it on top of the trash bin in the garage, then telling me to take the bin to the roadside for pick up. (""did you open it?"" *smile*).  Or having me talk to my mentally unstable grandmother who had munchausens by proxy and kept asking me in her creaky uncaring voice about what my symptoms were (hadn't spokento her in ten plus years).

I finally had a fifteen minute window wherein she'd gone out for a few, and I stole into her room and tore it apart for my keys. Jackpot, raced away, crying and slamming my steering wheel over and over again because I had no where to go. Contacted my sister, and she made the long trekto middle of buttfuck nowhere (I just mindlessly drove) with my mother in tow.  First thing my nmom did when she got there was croon ""come home with mommy now."" I lost my shit and just started screaming.  I'm panicking just thinking about it. I'm going to go have a cigarette."

I never have fun or feel comfortable in social settings and yet, I don't really like being alone either. I like people (most of the time) and I want to have fun. I just don't and I don't really know why.

I'm really quiet, I don't like to talk about myself. I feel like I can't relate to most people my age. I get along better with older people, but even then, I don't have much in common with them either. 

I am a girl, but I get along better with guys. I don't have many girlfriends, but I have known my best girlfriend since we were babies. I've had a boyfriend for 2 years and he doesn't think there is anything wrong with me, but he may be biased. 

I don't feel like I have depression. Maybe I do. I don't really know what it entails. I don't feel super excited about much of anything and I'm always tired no matter how much sleep I get or what I'm doing or how much caffeine I consume. But I'm not sad, I like myself and I feel like I don't have low self esteem. 

I'm just looking for some insight, if you could spare it. I would visit a shrink or something, but my insurance doesn't cover it. I went to a free clinic and it was an immense waste of time. The lady just kept quoting sayings like ""you never know until you try"". *eye roll* I was calling around my area, trying to find someone and the cheapest one wanted me to pay $200/hr out-of-pocket. Nope. I barely work because I'm still in school and I am currently in the middle of an unpaid summer internship.

Sometimes I feel like an apathetic asshole. I really want to be bubbly and visibly happy, but I just can't even fake it enough to be believable. I like my personality when I am one-on-one with someone, but I completely clam up in groups or in front of strangers.

It's frustrating when people tell me to smile ""because you're such a beautiful girl, you don't have a reason to look so unhappy or be so quiet"" blah blah blah.... I either feel like I'm not trying hard enough or it is physically impossible... I don't know."

I am confused,steikpanne,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/2atjt6/date_or_not_i_am_confused/,"So, I (male, 17y) have this complicated relationship with this girl (17y). We met through high-school and I've known her for one year now. I already knew she was someone special from the first day, so I slowly but surely got(/get) to know her, and I just like her more and more. We went out a few times before but really all we did was hanging around, not actual dating.

After this one year I really feel like we have a special connection, after building up our friendship with a lot of intern jokes and joke names for each other. We talk alot, I'd say everyday, wether it's IRL, facebook, snapchat or simply  regular phone messages. When we are together I tend to throw out a small flirt here and there, and the response is usually positive or just moderate. Sometimes (I think) she flirts back aswell..?

During the last 3-5 months, people around us sometimes assume I and her are a couple... My parents assume she is a girlfriend, because I've been seeing her and talked about her alot lately.
It seems like it's the same with her parents, as they suggested I and her joining her little sister's kissing game; ""only for bfs and gfs"", as she so nicely put it, when I was over at her place last time (yesterday). 
To be honest; I don't blame them. Because sometimes even I feel like we are acting as if we were a couple: sitting leant on each other and watching movies, joking with each other, sharing candy or other foods, or just sitting together in endless talks about nothing and everything.

So, now that I've explained the current situation, here's the problem:
I really like her, and want to be more than very good friends.
I am now trying to get there.
So my absolute first steps towards this is bringing her out to watch a movie in the theatres. 

She had recomended this movie ( 21 jump st. ) earlier this year, and I knew the sequel is currently in theatres, so I decided to watch the first one the night before I went to see her.
Then I casually mentioned that I had watched the first one, and she was immideately hyped for wanting to see the second one.
I proceed to casually bring up my wallet and say ""hey wait a minute! I won two free tickets to the theatres earlier on"" (this was the truth, I had mentioned them before once or twice). I suggested we could go to the theatre. But the response was somewhat unclear. She was so hyped about the movie, wanted to see it st once. ""But I want to se it right noooow""

What she did was searching it up on the internet and, fortunately for me, found that there was no illegal streaming links up yet. She was then quite upset about that, before we together decided that we could watch the first one, as she hadn't seen it in a while.

I had to leave before we were done watching it, as the last buses were going at that hour. This was after staying there for 11.5 hours, helping her with some clothes-folding and roomcleaning, walking together to get a postcard posted, her family showing me ALOT of picures from their trip to the US, eating dinner with them, and then sitting in a sofa-swing on their balcony. (again; just to show how our relationship is atm)

When I left there was sort of this awkward moment where we both just stood there in silence while looking at each other for a second or two, before I said ""sooeh.. yeah, goodbye..?"", sort of reaching out for the doorhandle whilst still looking at her before I gave her a hug (and I'm not sure, but it seemed to last for just about half a second longer than our usual goodbye-hugs)

We didn't talk more about the movie theatre, obviously. As I was very unsure of what to say about it, but once I got home, I thought ""what the hell, I can't go without answer"". So in the middle of a snapchat-chat we were now having, I said ""..but hey!? The movie theatre?"", followed up by another one: ""22 jump st. Do you join the next time the weather is not that great?""

Her response was ""suuuuree"".

My question is: Is this a date now? Should I dress up a little extra nice and possibly get her something? I always offer myself to pay while beeing with her, will she accept that for this ""whateveritis""?
And lastly, but most importantly: can I make a move here? Do the old 'stretch and suddenly my hand is over her shoulder'?
I really don't know...

Tl;dr: I think am going on a date? With one of my best friends. Our relationship is close but is complicated, and I like her alot.

Any help is appreciated.

During the worst of it, I rarely ate, slept, showered, or even left my room. All that time went to sleep or staring at the ceiling, because doing nothing sounded better than doing anything. And what better way to do nothing than sleeping?

**

Anyway, I vaguely recognized that I needed to do something about it, so I did the most proactive thing I had done in months - sent out resumes for internships. When I landed one I stuck with it for 3 semesters, dreading going back to school where I felt like I wasn't as smart or motivated as everyone else.

**

But eventually I did, and started going to counseling and taking antidepressants. Things started looking up; I felt real tangible emotion for the first time in a long, long while. I could belly-laugh, cry, yell, and hug people, and really mean it instead of faking it.

**

But this year, many of my friends graduated ahead of me, and are moving out of the city for their big-boy/big-girl jobs. And now that I'm getting close to graduating myself and looking at my job prospects seriously, I may very well have to leave this city too.

**

I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to see my old friends anymore and that we'll grow apart. I'm scared I won't find a job in this city I'm so familiar with and I'm scared that I won't make any new ones if I leave."

Funds I have:

1. My parents have $12,000 saved in RESPs
2. Government Student Loans (floating interest rate at a prime rate (2.5%)) for a maximum of $15,000 per year
3. Scholarships and Bursaries of about $8,000
4. The rest hopefully from paid internships during the summers between terms
5. Parents are willing to pay for the tuition if theres any left over but I still want to pay for it mostly myself other than the RESP

My question is whether I should:

1. pay my first year costs with the RESP; or

2. pay everything with Student Loans and let the RESP collect interest for 4 years to use to pay off the student loan.

For some extra information, graduates from the Ivey Business school have an average salary of about $60,000 after graduation.

Any other advice or comments about funding for my university would be greatly appreciated as well. I was also thinking of taking out the RESP money and investing into something with a higher yield than what TD Bank offers. Kindly let me know of my options.

I met Lee when I was moving into a new apartment as an undergrad.  It was a shoddy place that needed to be cleaned, but after a little bit of elbow grease, it became a respectable place to live (my dad still said it sucked — maybe he was right).  The first person to meet me here was Lee, a Chinese engineer, in the country under a student visa and working on his doctoral degree.  As I had not yet gone grocery shopping, he gave me some of his green bean and cucumber soup that actually turned out to not be that bad.  That summer, we bonded pretty well.  I didn’t have an internship this year, so we found ourselves hanging out after he did his research for the day, and just had fun in general.  He, of course, met my family, but he claimed that his parents would be scared of a foreigner, so I never did get to see his on chat when he contacted them.

We both went to the same university, but were in very different programs.  He was pretty funny, so I would sometimes write down the things he said, but I never published them in case he would ever find it.  During the next school year, we would hang out, and I would introduce him to some of my other friends.  He was one of my best friends, and we were always there for each other.  We also were friends with all of the other rotating faces in our illegal boarding house, mostly scientists from other nations, and we’ve all kept in touch.  I taught Lee a lot about the United States and its culture, and we made each other laugh with crude jokes.  When I finally got an internship last summer, we celebrated over a bottle of wine.  We went to my family’s shore house and he had a fun time hanging out with my parents, who turned out to love him that they invited him to Thanksgiving.  My ancient grandmother, who was there, and still asks about him; she never knew anyone from China, and seemed to like him.

He claimed that he was one of 5 people out of the million or so in his region that were chosen to study in the United States.  Since his town’s founding 200+ years ago, he was the only one from it that had ever worked their way out of poverty with schooling and had made it here.  Lee was determined to stay in the United States.  Even though he had a contract with the Chinese government, he got used to the American life.  We hoped the law would change for him, that (as Romney put it) a green card would be stapled to his diploma.  It never happened.  He knew that he only had a few options available to him: get sponsored, get married, or stay here anyway.  We worked over the past year to get him a professional resume and photos, but apparently no employer was interested.  He said that he was hard at work on his dissertation, so he never had the time.  If he had chosen to stay in the United States, his mother would probably be fired from her job, and his brother could be fired as well (he was a school teacher).  The Chinese government would screw them all over.  These were conversations that we had in depth, but it always ended with him depressed.

He said that an engineer friend of ours with a similar contract has been worked to the bone every day back in China, and it would not be hard for him to get a high paying job in the United States if he could actually stay here.  A green card would essentially allow him to escape China undetected, even with his debts.  

Lee had a girlfriend once, a really nice native Chinese girl.  He broke it off unexpectedly.  He watched very closely as our state legalized gay marriage, and I joked that he was messed up.  It started right after the state approved it -- he would ask me every few weeks to marry him.  He said that some of his other friends had private ceremonies, and that he would pay me for my time.  At first, while I said no, I did it nicely and tried to explore other options.  He would ask every few weeks, and I would always shoot him down.  Everyone knows that I am not gay so realistically, it would never be believed.  But, more importantly, I was really not interested in risking my entire reputation on my friend’s selfish behavior.  I mean, I wanted him to stay, but under legit and ethical terms.  Maybe I wasn’t forceful enough in telling him no, but I certainly never tried to lead him on in believing that there was some hope with me giving in.  He was really persistent at times, too, but we'd always forget about it and go back to good terms.  I told my dad about it, and I think he was put off by Lee's suggestions.  We never told my mom, who still thinks of Lee as a great guy.

I moved out of the apartment, and so did he a few months later.  I live with my parents now trying to find a job (I have a few interviews coming up), while he continued his studies.  We met a few times over the past six months, once to go out to eat, and another time to hang out.

He contacted me out of nowhere a few weeks ago, and asked me to drive to him with a good suit.  I asked why, and was pretty hesitant to make the 100 mile journey without a good explanation.  I laughed in chat and said that I didn’t want to marry him.  He quickly called me.

On the phone, Lee told me something that made me nervous: that he had been in a gay relationship with some guy for four months, and he was getting married.  He told me not to tell any of my family.  He said that he needed support, because he had no other American friends to join him.

It will happen soon.  I should be sleeping, but I’m writing this story because I think this is all wrong; he is taking advantage of gay rights to lazily further his own life.  I know that he isn’t gay, either, but he’s played this act up well enough to get away with a marriage (it seems that the other guy definitely is).  It’s a relationship that I really knew nothing about until a few weeks back, but I’m sure that my presence will give it some kind of legitimacy.  He told me to tell no one.

I can't help but feel as though I'm being used, and the whole situation just feels wrong to me.  I'm probably one of only a few people who know, certainly the only American at the very least, unless he had some pact with his fiance.  Even though I'm sure this will go as planned and he will eventually get his green card, I don't think that I'll ever be comfortable in talking to him again."

If can answer questions in the comments.


**tl;dr**: **I have a great GF and our relationship seems to be suffering due to bad communication during 8-9 weeks of LDR. I feel like she's being cold/disinterested while she feels like I'm leaning on her to bring the energy to make it work. I'm obviously over-thinking things to an absurd degree (look how long this fucking post is) but want to take the steps necessary to lay the groundwork to get things back to normal. Any and all advice appreciated. Sorry this is so goddamn long.**

---


I've been dating my wonderful GF for a little over 9 months now and things, until very recently, were going very smoothly. However since she started an internship a few hours away things haven't gone especially smoothly and I fear that it's putting significant strain on the integrity of the relationship.

I initially felt we were communicating pretty well doing a quick phone call every night with some light gchatting during the day at work. However over time the frequency of calls dropped and the conversation seemed to get a little ""cold"". Over those first couple weeks I began to carry a bit of a chip on my shoulder that I was having to chase her to communicate and feeling that it wasn't very fair. She (I would later discover) felt that I was being especially low energy and that our calls were becoming stressful for her because she felt she had to carry the conversation. We've seen each other twice but on both occasions there was a little passive aggression due (IMO) to the communication issue.


Anyway the whole situation seemed to boil over when she called me up about 5 weeks in saying she felt ""distant"", that we seemed to have nothing to talk about and specifically that I seemed to be very low energy in both our phone and in-person communication. By this point I was feeling pretty down, as I had felt she was pulling away and being cold, and handled the criticism less than well. That conversation spiraled into a multi-hour thing where we unloaded a lot of negative feelings we'd been harboring. I told her that I felt she was disinterested in me and she felt that I leaned on her to bring all the energy to the relationship. At the end she said that she valued our relationship but she didn't know if she could fully invest herself in it to make it work. We didn't break up but it seemed like she was considering it which left me pretty gutted.


We had a follow up call where I was less defensive and let her speak her mind. She clarified what she meant (she's thinking she might not have given herself enough time between this and her previous relationship which was on and off for almost 9 years). Since that second call our communication has returned to being spotty - though not any worse than it was before. I've tried to take steps to be more outspoken about my life to carry my weight a little more. We had a few days of very limited communication (during which I was losing my mind and assuming I was on the verge of getting dumped) but finally had a nice call last night where things really seemed to be more like the used to be.


Reddit, I'm not really sure what my takeaways from all this should be. My current read of the situation is that our honeymoon period likely ended right around the time she left and we probably would have fought about some of these issues regardless - the long distance simply compounded this. Finally I think we've both been feeling a little depressed about work and (thinking optimistically) it's possible we just miss each other and are handling that emotion poorly. She's coming up this weekend and I just want to make sure I lay the ground work for a healthy turnaround from all of this. I don't want to do any super grand gestures because I feel like that will come off as a little panicky/desperate but I do want to try and make her feel like we can get back to where we were before.

2avd4p,9,2014-07-16,Me [21F] with my parents[54M and 52F] I want to change my undergrad degree path somewhat drastically late into the game and am terrified to tell them. What do I do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2avd4p/me_21f_with_my_parents54m_and_52f_i_want_to/,"I'm not sure where to start, there are a lot of details to this crazy story, but I will try to get as much as I can across. My parents are divorced and they do not speak to each other. As part of their divorce settlement, my dad is required to pay 55% of my college expenses, my mother 35%, and myself 5%. Obviously this deal worked out pretty great for me. I chose to go to an in-state school, so my personal expenses are so low that I can work and afford to take care of my own contribution without taking out loans. I am debt free. My parents are pretty well off (at least, my dad is and my mom has been since she remarried) but they like to pretend like every dime I cost them is putting them in the poorhouse every month (both of their incomes separately are probably something like six figures. Like I said, my mom makes hardly any money but her husband makes at least as much as my dad). If it weren't for the divorce, I would have just bit the bullet and supported myself because dealing with money with the two of them is absolutely impossible and compounded by the fact that they require me to be the gobetween for them as they refuse to speak to each other, even in emails. My dad has taken out his own loans, but my mom took out the student loans that were offered to me in my name and told me she will pay them back.

ANYWAY (phew!), I'm a music education major currently. My first two years of school were focused almost entirely on the music aspect, as that's the way the degree is set up. I love music, so this was awesome for me and I really enjoyed school. But this past year, I finally started getting into my education classes and realizing that I cannot nor will I ever teach in public school. It causes me a colossal amount of stress and I just do not have the personality to teach in a normal school and I don't think I should subject children to that.. As part of my degree requirement, I am supposed to go do a ""student teaching"" project for my final semester, which is essentially an unpaid internship with a school. I am supposed to go live with my parents while I do this as I would be working full time at the school and have absolutely no way to support myself.

I recently found out that it's possible to get my degree without getting a public school certification. Part of doing this would mean I could forgo my student teaching and instead do something like 9 extra credit hours in advanced music courses. I wouldn't be able to teach in a public school, but as I said I already do not plan on teaching anyways. Currently my plan is to go and get my masters in music performance overseas immediately when I finish my bachelors. It's not in my plan at all to teach so I feel like I can do a lot better for myself in preparation if I stay at school and get better prepared for my masters degree. I also felt just so much pressure that has been bothering me for a year lift when I made this decision.

I'm really afraid to tell my parents. I feel like my parents see me as an extension of themselves and their accomplishments rather than as their child. I don't think they will care that I don't want to teach, but that they will just be upset that I won't be living at home next spring and they won't be saving any money. I'm also worried that they will feel like the money they spent for me to go to school has been totally wasted (I don't.. I really feel like my degree has prepared me for what I want to do next. I'm not totally changing fields). My parents and I are not close really, but I am close with the rest of my extended family and my sister, so I am scared that they will not want to speak to me and this will cut me off from the family. I'm also worried that because my mom took out my student loans for me, she will suddenly decide she doesn't have to pay them back and there is no legal recourse I can take to make her pay because the bills are in my name. Having to pay those loans back would really affect my ability to get my master's right away and move abroad.

How do I even begin to approach this situation with them? I have always done what they thought was best and have never stood up to them before. My mom and dad always say they want me to be independent and make decisions, but this usually only applies if I'm doing what they expect me to do, as demonstrated by the way they've treated some of my past boyfriends (aka terribly). Any advice or perspective is greatly appreciated.

I feel like most guys would message you telling you exactly what they want to do to you. Well, besides the basic face in the boobies and cock in the pussy, I have no clue. I like to make my sexual experiences very unique and memorable for my partner, and that is something that can only be decided on when the time comes. So I don't know what I want to do with your incredibly sexy body right now. But I do know I would love to chat, so what do you say? Want to chat?

I felt so oppressed.

Edit: I received the following response regarding this message.

&gt; Ok, I guess I have to let the cat out of the bag...

&gt; I am doing a social experiment for a psychology internship this summer. You being a female, I am sure you are aware how many females suffer from many insecurities, and also, being a redditor, you get plenty of guys creeping on you.

&gt; My experiment was as follows... I had the message that was sent to you written in advance by another person on my team. I was to go to subreddits like rateme, amiugly, amisexy, gonewild, and gonemild, and send this message to random posters. Each subreddit has a different motive for while people post what they post, or at least different thought that goes into it, so we wanted to see what responses we can get, and how we can tie that into confidence within females, and interactions between members of the opposite sex.

&gt; What we did not intend was to get called out on the creepy pm subreddit. I guess I can't make you take it down, but I would hope that you would for the sake of the experiment.

&gt; And, since you responded the way that you did, I was wondering if I could have a more candid conversation with you about your experiences on rateme, why you feel any insecurity or lack of confidence, etc, to use in my report.

So he's a moron. For multiple reasons."
2avrfk,69,2014-07-16,"I'm tech support, even when I'm not.",freakmn,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2avrfk/im_tech_support_even_when_im_not/,"Background: While in college, I took a part time job as an engineering intern for a Fortune 500 company. Even with no experience in the field, I had family that got me in the job. The division I worked in made parts that were used in the military and had to meet certain specifications. Each part was tested, and bad ones were discarded. My job was to take data from the database and make graphs that showed the quality of the parts that my boss could show off at meetings. I wasn't tech support, though had been a PFY in high school before that, so knew my way around a computer.

Being an intern, I was given a leftover computer. While 95% of the company was on Windows 2000 or XP, I was shackled with an NT4 machine. It was enough to get my work done, but the speed of the machine made me glad I was paid hourly.

One day, the company decided to roll out their new, custom-built, computer inventory software. This took inventory of the computer and added it to a database so IT could determine what computers need to be replaced, upgraded, etc. This was rolled out by sending out a link to download and install an IE6 activex control that needed to be installed and run on each machine in the company.

On my ancient NT4 machine, I first had to upgrade to IE6, then attempted to install the activex control on the machine. Installation seemed to go through successfully, so I continued on with the instructions and the control wouldn't run. The instructions contained a support e-mail in case of problems. I e-mailed the support, asking if there was a solution for this, gave all the relevant info, etc. A reply came and said that I was the only person having this problem, and that they will eventually send someone out to look at it.

Time passed, and I was eventually getting daily reminders that I hadn't run the inventory on my computer, and that I needed to ASAP. I eventually got fed up and investigated. Looked through the relevant registry entries and found a path that was hard coded to somewhere in ""Documents &amp; Settings"", which didn't exist in NT4. I found the correct path, updated the registry entry, and it worked! So, I sent off an e-mail that I got it figured out, and that they don't need to send someone out to work on it. Pleased with my work, I went home. End of story, or so I thought.

As an intern, I had flexible hours. I didn't come back to the office until 5 days later. When I returned, I found that my voicemail box was full, so I started listening:

First message, within an hour of my e-mail:

&gt; Hi freakmn, this is George from IT. We have found a few more people who have had the same issue as you. Could you let us know how you fixed it? Thanks.

Next message, the following morning:

&gt; Hi freakmn, this is George again. It looks like we have a lot of people with that problem. Tell us how you fixed it, so we can finish this project!

Next message, a couple hours later:

&gt; This is George again, how did you fix your issue? Call me.

Messages 4-10 each increased in panic. The last 5 or so messages were just heavy breathing, waiting for me to pick up the phone (I'm not sure that George understood how voicemail worked). I also had a couple dozen e-mails from him. So, I called back, explained that there was a hardcoded path in the registry entries on install, and that they wouldn't work on any NT4 machines. He sounded like he was jumping from joy, and upon hanging up the phone, I never heard from him again. A week later, we got an e-mail that the inventory project was complete, and thanked those who cooperated. No credit for the engineering intern that allowed the IT department to finish the job. Oh well.

TLDR: Tech support said I was the only one with a problem, until I fixed the problem, then they wanted the solution.

I no longer fit in my clothes, and feel awkward and bloated in my new body. And oh, the stretchmarks...

 The year before my move, I was still in college so I had a very controlled schedule. And a lot more free time.  I was eating very well, exercising regularly, and trying to lose my colligiate weight. Then I graduated, moved to a new state, and began my internship.

I also moved in with my SO to save on rent. But since the move in, and starting up work, I stopped exercising and eating well. I no longer had access to nor could afford to pay for a gym. my partner was very seditery and shared my love of burritos, and I worked very long hours.
And work is stressful, and I deal with a lot of gnarly chemicals.

I noticed things were getting bad when I finally weighed myself at 190. I was shocked, and tried to start eating well and exercising when I could. But then work became stressful and I put on another 15 lbs.

In the last two months I've been eating very well, counting calories(my budget is 1400, and I am religious when it comes to tracking and portioning), and walking/jogging everyday. I have some slip ups, but no more than once a week. I've lost like 5 lbs in a week, but have either maintained or gained fractions of a pound over the course of a month. That's it. My net loss is less than 3.7 lbs over a month.

I never had any problems losing weight in college, and I'm incredibly frustrated by my lack of progress and gross body. Does anyone have any advice/input into what's wrong with me? I feel devastated by my inability to control my body.

Sorry for typos, done on my tiny phone at work.

This is a long read but if you got a few minutes, I'd really appreciate it.

Basically, I dropped out of university because I wasn't interested in teaching anymore (did 2 internships and found out I didn't like it very much). Now I want to get a job to actually have something that can be called a proper life. I also want to support my mother who has trouble making ends meet. My brother helps out with the electricity and water bills, but we still have to count every penny. No father btw.

I have been sitting around on my ass for months now and hate myself for it. What little semblance of physical fitness I had was lost in the last few months when I looked for comfort in booze, weed and games. I have this weird stutter going on where I kinda ""swallow"" some syllables so people always ask me to repeat what I said. This got also worse throughout the months. Maybe not too relevant, I just want to explain my situation properly.

So anyway, I went to a job counselor (felt like a superhuman feat to me, didn't want to go at first) and I found that I would be very content with an office job in city administration. I found a city that's looking for applicants that can start in 2015. I checked their page and they have a really rigorous test procedure with about 6 hours per testing phase. That's OK I thought when I saw that the second phase is basically an assessment center. That's when I lost all hope.

For those who don't know, an assessment center makes you do a lot of exercises in a group (roleplay, presentations etc) which I already hated in high school. During those exercises, the HR people look who of the applicants are the most suited and who's a good leader etc. I'm not a natural leader. They expect every applicant to be some sort of super hero who has experience out the ass. I feel like i messed up here already since assessment centers only really came in vogue in the last couple years. I could have avoided that if I had just looked for a job after I graduated. So what else is there? Application period has started and I haven't even written a single line of my application or CV. I barely have the strength to wake up in the morning (or afternoon, I sleep very badly these days).

I'm also worried about the questions they might ask me if I ever got into a job interview. Why did I drop out? I didn't like it. But you can't tell that the HR person. Ironically, I have excellent language grades, but this is also a negative. They will ask me why I want to go into administration when my strong points lie in language. Thinking about the interview makes me want to crawl back to bed. Also, remember the weird stutter I mentioned? This will make it impossible to pass the interview. I can't talk very clearly.

What else is there? On a personal level, I feel incredible jealousy at mates who didn't get their A-levels yet are filthy rich just by working right out of high school. My brother had super shitty grades and makes good money now. I don't hate them btw. I know I'm not perfect. I know I sound materialistic and as if I'm all about money. But I just want to start my life. Reduce the burden on my family and eventually start my own. On the other hand, a few friends who did get their A-levels and went to university afterwards are in the same situation as me. No job and no chance to get a job thanks to shitty references and holes in the CV. When my father was with us, he always told me and my brother to be good at school and everything will be alright. I busted my ass to get a decent report card, my brother fucked around. I got nothing and he got a job. That's when I learned, *really* learned that grades are bullshit. Even with my internships in schools and courses in university. But I'm rambling and this is getting too long already.

It's getting out of hand. I yell at friends and family because I'm losing control of the situation. I'm average. I have no hope. I can't kill myself because that would devastate my family.

MMFB please. Advice also very welcome.

If something else comes to mind I will edit it in."

I know a large part of it is chemical. I was recently diagnosed with bi-polar 2. However, before things took a turn in the last year it was something I had a handle on. I would have a bad week every month or so and thoughts of suicide would be sprinkled here or there, but it was always something I was able to push past.  

I'll cover the contributing factors real quick. My parents have always been a negative factor. They were never and still are not emotionally supportive at all. At the worst of times I was a massive disappointment and there was something wrong with me, and at the best I was simply invisible. This has gotten worse since I left my job and was unable to find a new one. It's not that they care enough to be particularly disappointed it's more that I am interacting with them more now that I am unemployed and I feel massive amounts of shame when asking them for help in any regard. 

Speaking of my unemployment I have definitely hit a low since I left my job a little under a year ago. It became impossible to work there for a plethora of reasons I wont get into here, but I left expecting to be able to find something else considering my history (high performance in college with multiple very competitive internships and a full time job in my field before I graduated). However after about 5-6 months of looking and being rejected, including for positions that would traditionally lead to the job I had once had, and my wife being promoted to full time at her work I gave up on the job search. I realized how foolish I had been for not just sucking it up at my job and how I threw away the only thing in my life I could truly say I was proud about. 

Finally the biggest factor is my marriage. About 5 months ago things fell apart with her. Things have been simultaneously becoming better and absolutely unbearable. She doesn't love me and would prefer being a single mother of two (the children are really the only reason I haven't done it yet) than being with me. This is all my fault as we had children before we were ready and a lot of my stress associated with that manifested itself in ugly ways and I ended up blaming her for a lot of stuff. I deserve the pain of loosing her love. Anyway in the past 5 months of talking and marriage counseling we've both gotten to a point where we are less stressed by the whole situation and are learning to live with each other with absolutely no intimacy, emotional or otherwise. However, the flip side of that is that when time goes by and she has made tremendous efforts to heal but no progress is made it agonizes me. I have gone from believing it to be a temporary thing that will be healed with time to worrying that she will never feel for me the way she once did and I will be stuck in this. To cap it all off I she tells me at least once a week how she doesn't want to be with me and she would rather be alone and how the only reason she hasn't left is because she knows it would devastate me. 

So all of that brings me to the point I am at now. Between the lack of any emotional support and the continual fuck ups on my part and now the fact that I know that by existing I am preventing the woman I love's happiness I am edging closer and closer to pulling the plug. In the last couple months as the fact that I have destroyed my relationship with this woman, yet another great thing that I didn't deserve in the first place, seems more certain I've gone from my occasionally easily brushed off moments of suicidal thought to researching different methods (my primary concerns are that I want it to be nonviolent and not leave a mess for anyone while also having a quite high percentage of success) and now to waiting for the right time to do it where I know I won't be interfered with and that my daughters won't be the ones to find me. I've already put so much pain into her life and I know I couldn't live with separation yet she wants nothing more than for me to not be in her life. I feel like to set her free is the only way to amend for all the pain I've already caused. The sooner I let others start dealing with my inevitable departure from the world the sooner they can heal and the sooner I can move on to being nothing but a distant memory. "
2aw09j,2,2014-07-16,I got fired/not fired,Caffeinated_Kitty,LifeAfterNarcissism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/2aw09j/i_got_firednot_fired/," All over picking up a paycheck!  So I am on a mobile device I will give you a tldrmobile version.   A little back story,  I graduated from a massage therapy school, a very small one. I did very well and landed myself an internship which blossumed into a jarb after fighting took and nail. I loved the school I went to and wanted to work someplace that I graduated from.  However the incompetent bs is amazing.  In the state of California I have to have a CAMTC cert/license to practice. It is a slow and expensive process.  The school transcript lady ""forgot"" to send my transcripts when I purchased them to send in my completed packet to the CAMTC. The only way I found out about it was a VM from the transcript lady wanting to know when I wanted my transcripts, this was after I had spoken to her face to face that I did not want my transcripts sent to my house but directly to the CAMTC.  I had started working at the college clinic after I had missed out on a job opportunity due to the transcript issue. If the CAMTC shows your transcripts as received some places will let you work for them. Ugh.. On to the fun!  I started working for the clinic. Mid June and was very thankful to have the job while having the option of finishing my internships with the same school. I'm at 250 hours which makes me a camp, for 250 more hours I get to be an lmt. There is NO difference between the two except for hours and renewal fees.  The first pay day comes and I have no paycheck, the HR ladies are there and are surprised that I am there. They had no clue I was even working there.  I don't like conflict so I just go along with it, if I get them my paper work I signed I will be on payroll. I stress to everyone I need a paycheck the next pay date which is the 15th of July.  These last few months have been super hard money wise. I'm playing the juggle the discconect/eviction notice game. So I need the money. Granted the paycheck should be 184.00 which isn't a lot but it's enough to keep my phone on and at lest a little bit of gas. I've been surviving on tips, most of the customers that come through are groupon customers who get charged 29.00 for the massage I see 10.00 of that and since I am a T99 contractor I only  get paid per client. I avagre around 3-5 clients every 4 days and I work 8 hour days. So when I'm not rubbing someone I'm in the break room not getting paid.  I tell this to the staff that schedules the ttherapists etc. I need that check on the 15th and I'm told there would be no problem.  I call yesterday morning to see if my check is there. My Nboss who might not be a boss ( we will get to that later) says she isn't sure and will call back when she knows they are there.  I get the call back from her and they are! I have to the Citrus Heights location to pick it up I live far on the south side of town and citrus heights is more east and its a drive for me and my fiancé.  we drive there,  and guess what! The checks are not ready I am told by the clinical director that the bigwig boss lady hasn't signed th yet and to come back at 5pm. Its about a 20-30 minute drive and its only 11:00 am.  I repeated myself "" come pick it up at 5?"" And am told yes. Your glorious check will be ready at 5. I'm super happy. This check is going to save our phones getting turned off, the fiancé s laptop from getting taken back by the loan company ( we leased a laptop till we could get better finances)  so we go to his work, he is a freelance website graphics desginer, so the last three months have been so client wise and my therapist job was supposed to cover expenses till it picks back up in late summer early fall.  He has a start up that just got funded so we won't see any money from that till later. :/ so we are money f*cked. All my money went into school and then state licenses and insurance.  Back to the real fun!  We leave the house and fight our way through Sacramento traffic back to Citurs Heights.  We get there ten minutes early, my Nboss isn't there and has left for the day. So its another desk person and the clinic director. The clinic director goes to get my check and can't find it. This is bad news we have to pay these bills by 7oclock. If our phones get shut off there is a 35.00 reconnect fee. Not a lot under normal circumstances, but when you're so broke even the roaches are on welfare we have a problem.  The CD says she put them all in envelopes and forgot to set mine aside so she has no idea where they are.  She makes a few phone calls and come to find out Nboss has them. It was an honest mistake but we are low on gas and traffic is evil, we have to pay that bill. So the CD asks us if we could either go to Nbossrs house to pick up the checks, which is all the way back down in south sac, or if it would be easier to meet Nboss with the checks at the clinic which is in downtown which is closer to Citrus Heights. We elect the downtown clinic because again, no gas and dita closer to the store to pay the bills. We explain that traffic is really bad so it might take 20 or so minutes and the CD says that's fine.  Now the really fun stuff. Just as we are a block away I get tthis text from Nboss saying ""are you here yet I have to leave to pick up so so"" I tell her yes we are just stuck at a traffic light and will be there shortly. Then she sends me a wall of text about how I'm cutting into ""what precious little personal time I have to deal with your emergency."" I never said that word that was CD relaying the info. I tell my fiance and he's already upset because this is not the first tango with Nbosses crazy behavior. I get out of the car with NY fiance and head up the elevator to see Nboss with check. Yay moneyyyy!! We get in the elevator to go downstairs and she starts yelling at me. I don't respond and she's going off on how I know how hard she works and that this isn't an emergency and I could wait for another day. Payday is on the first and the fifteenth of every month. I'm supposed to be picking up my paycheck anyway regardless of circumstances and it's the law to pay your employees on the day you say you're going to pay them. Anyway fiance doesn't like me getting yelled at so he tells Nboss to stop being mad and yelling at me because I wasn't the one that screwed up. We did what we where told to do.  So I figured that was it and the day would be done and we could go our separate waysm . Then as we are getting close to the car she yells at my fiancé "" you better watch how you talk to your fiances boss!"". My fiance is a very calm man under many circumstances he doesn't like me being threatened so he lost his cool and turned around and yelled at her ""I will tall to you however the fuck I want, you can't threaten people like that, we where told to come here and have been bounced around all day. You speak of your personal time ? What about ours and the gas we had to use to get down here we wasted a whole day that ended up with Kitty getting yelled at."". Then Nboss turns to me which I am almost to the car and yells at me in her sweet voice "" I'm sorry kitty, but I'm going to have to fire you.""  I didn't really say anything and just kinda shrugged.  My fiance calls the CD and explains how everything went down and what happened. She said I'm not fired and Nboss shouldn't have done that. I don't know really what to do. I sent an email earlier asking if the incident was resolved but I haven't gotten anything back. I don't know if I'm supposed to go to work tomarrow, I haven't heard back from anyone and if Nboss is there I might be sent home from her and I don't wanna cause a scene and blerk.. So yeah/endrant "

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2at3wx/at_my_19f_wits_end_with_my_younger_brother_11f/

1st update: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2atiw0/update_at_my_19f_wits_end_with_my_younger_brother/

Yesterday, we had a pretty substantial screaming match, between my brother, my mother, and I. My mom kept defending his actions, using justifications like ""boys will be boys"" and ""he's not even 12,"" assuring me that he WILL ""grow out of it"" even if they don't do anything. Her solution was to order my brother to stop talking to me completely. Of course, he promised her that, and she believed him.

This morning, he didn't bother me at all. Noon came around and I stuck a pizza in the oven for him since he didn't harass me once all morning. Come 3' o clock in the afternoon, I'm lying on my bed minding my own business and he comes into my room, looks at me, and says ""Look who's lazy...""

I told my mom about that comment because it was unnecessary and completely unprovoked, thinking she would punish him because he broke his promise to not speak to me. Of course, he defends himself and tells my mom ""but I said it in a positive tone! She's so sensitive"" and my mom was like "" yeah he was just joking, why are you so sensitive?"" She even tried to pass it off as him showing me affection.

First, I try to explain to my brother that ""look who's lazy"" isn't a comment that anybody would really take in a positive way, regardless of the tone. Then I realized what a waste of time that was because my brother doesn't listen and my mom doesn't care.

Then my mom starts going off about how she thinks I'm the one who has emotional issues because I got so offended by one comment. I explained to her that it wasn't that ONE comment, obviously, but his PATTERN of behavior. My mom kept cutting me off, not even hearing me out, telling me that I'm the crazy one and I overreact too much.

Every single day, he promises to stop. Every single day, my mom believes him. Every single day, he breaks his word because he knows my parents won't punish him.  Every single day, I still take care of him because my parents tell me I'm a horrible sister if I don't. They tell me that I should leave my family and find another one if I'm not going to fulfill my sisterly duties.

Knowing all of this, I kind of lost it at that point - I started yelling at my mom about how she doesn't seem to care about my emotional well-being as much as she cares about avoiding responsibility with my brother. My brother came over and began to tell my mom that I must be on crack and an assortment of drugs, because I otherwise wouldn't be acting this way (and I'm worried that my mom might actually believe him because she's in SUCH denial about his behavior, she'd be willing to shift the blame onto ANYTHING else)

I lost it at this point and left my house to go on a walk.

My relationship with my parents is worsening day by day because of this. My mom will defend my brother's actions to the death, seemingly no matter what he does. Today, I asked her, ""honestly, when will you stop making excuses for him?"" and she said ""what??? I don't make excuses for him..."" THAT IS THE WORST DENIAL I HAVE EVER SEEN. At the VERY least, she makes excuses for his behavior, and if she can't recognize that, then I'm beginning to think I really am crazy. Every time I ask her to do something about his behavior, the conversation devolves into her saying she doesn't want to live with me because she doesn't want to have to deal with ""this"" (as if I'm the problem). But she's all talk, of course, since I know she would never shell out the money to have me live somewhere else. 

I dunno if this is an Asian thing or a middle child thing or just something that's unique to my family, but my mom has SUCH double standards. I still cannot get over the fact that she doesn't give a fuck that my older brother resents and avoids my younger brother; she lets him treat him however he wants. ME on the other hand...I'm a terrible sister for not giving into this bullshit.

I'm at SUCH a loss for what to do, I've never felt so hopeless. I am completely financially supported by my parents. (They always discouraged working in favor of studying and never allowed me to have a job.) I can't leave my house because I don't have anywhere else to go. I absolutely CANNOT call CPS because I know in my heart that my parents would NEVER forgive me for that and they would legitimately disown me if I did that. I am not going to hit my brother because my parents would kick me out of the house if I did that.

I'm stuck. My 11 year old brother has managed to bully me to tears almost every day since I've come home from college. I have no avenues for recourse. My mom now thinks I'm the one with the emotional problems, (not that she would seek help for me even if that were true, cause you know, FACE) My parents think my brother is blameless. I can't take this anymore. 

I'm seriously starting to resent my parents now...I never thought I'd have to be one of those Asian kids who had to separate themselves from their families for their own well-being (not that I even have this option right now), but I am seriously not feeling good about my family or my life at home right now.

Is it really so unreasonable for me to be upset about all these empty promises and this horrible lack of action on the part of my parents and this continued harassment from my brother? My mom REALLY made me feel like I am crazy for getting so upset at all of this and now I'm really beginning to wonder if I'm the crazy one.

Edit: Added some details

Edit 2: Re: Get a job

I've actually been looking for a summer job for a while now (since before I left college) and I've honestly yet to find anything. I did a semester of summer school, which pretty much ruined any chances of an internship for me because I wasn't available for half the summer. My parents are also forcing me to go on summer vacation with them next month (they are dropping me off at school directly after), so I'm available for exactly 1 month. I must have sent out 20-30 job applications, for various waitressing positions, retail, tutoring, babysitting gigs, dog-walking, etc. I guess nobody wanted a person who was available for such a short time with no transportation. I did get a lot of calls back from families who wanted a babysitter, but all of them required having a car so that I could drive their children around. I've been trying really hard to work around these circumstances in finding work, but man, the phone just ain't ringing'.

Edit 3: Thank you to all that replied with helpful advice. Starting now, I am going to take ignoring him very seriously. I'm also going to stop doing crap for him because honestly, I ran out of fucks to give about what my parents think. I also warned my brother that if he makes another rude remark to me, I will smack the everloving shit out of him. I said this in front of my mom, she didn't disagree. My brother's a little shit and he doesn't get any more warnings. Also, I can't reach out to my older brother for help with the situation because he's purposely distanced himself from us to avoid my family's psychotic tendencies. Can't say I blame him.
---   
**tl;dr**: My mom ordered my brother to stop talking to me and he agrees, he breaks his word and randomly insults me, and now my mom believes that I'm the one with emotional issues. Am I? And do I have any other options?"
2awdtw,12,2014-07-16,When and how did you get your first internship?,garfield265,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2awdtw/when_and_how_did_you_get_your_first_internship/,"I have just finished my freshman year of college and have been out for a month, but all summer I haven't done anything yet. A lot of my friends have internships (or even jobs), one even at Microsoft. I feel very behind because all I have in terms of CS skills is a year's worth of Python courses. I have no work experience whatsoever.

So I'd just like to ask, how did you guys land your first internship? Did you have experience beforehand? What kind of experience? Did you get it early in college or late?"
2awezv,5,2014-07-16,"Hi, r/BusinessIntelligence. College student looking for some much needed advice!",FutureBIEmp,BusinessIntelligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/2awezv/hi_rbusinessintelligence_college_student_looking/,"How's it going everyone, I'm currently a student at George Mason University and a rising senior.  I have a few questions about what the best course of action for me to take during my time at GMU and I'd like you folks to look over my study plan and let me know if what I'm doing makes sense.

So a little backstory, I started at Mason in 2012 after graduating from a Community College in my home state with a degree in Business Administration.  As of this year I should have graduated from GMU but a lack of focus led to me trifling in many different topics looking to find what suited me best (Finance, IT, Comp Sci, Stats).  I would have loved to keep majoring in Comp Sci but I found that it would take me until 2017 to graduate and my family's financial situation just wouldn't be able to accomodate that.  

So what I've figured out is due to all my fooling around, I've accumulated enough credits in IT, Stats and Business to find that I can finish my major by next year and also finish two minors.

Listed below is the major I plan on finishing (Information Systems and Operations Management):

http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=25&amp;poid=22207&amp;returnto=4955

And the two minors I will be able to finish relatively quickly are IT and Data Analysis:

http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=25&amp;poid=22084&amp;hl=data+analysis&amp;returnto=search

http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=25&amp;poid=22210&amp;hl=information+technology+minor&amp;returnto=search

Basically my plan is to focus on database technologies to learn about SQL and SQL programming.  ISOM has a nice combination of business topics and a more technical aspect of things which is what I'd like to focus on.  

Hopefully I'll be able to land an Internship next summer at a company in the area.  Luckily for me, I live in the DC metropolitan area so there are plenty of companies that I can apply to.

So what do you folks think?  Does this sound like a reasonable plan?


Thank you for your time."

So, I just finished my sophomore year at a state school. I am a Mathematical Science major. My GPA is 3.85.

Problem: I don't want to graduate school.

I was recently told/read in a couple places that if you are the least bit unsure of it, you shouldn't go to graduate school. I really don't think I am cutout for grad school. I love math, but I don't think I want to go to school for several more years. Plus, I can't see myself doing research/academia. I just want to finish undergrad and get a decent job.

I did some reading on /r/math and the consensus seemed to be to learn how to program. Now, my Math Sci program has a couple pertinent courses to CS: (1) an intro to programming class (intro to Python), (2) object-oriented design and problem solving (intro to C++). From high school AP Comp Sci, I have a bit of experience with Java. I'm a bit rusty on all three of these though. I've read that it's recommended I learn R and a couple other languages. I have taken a course in applied algebra (Hamming codes, BCH, RSA, etc; FWIW, I really enjoyed this class), and I'm about to take an introduction to combinatorics/graph theory and numerical methods (CS focused; put this off a bit).

But, down to my main question. I'm a tad concerned from reading around /r/math that this degree alone, as in Math Sci, will not be enough to get a job. I'm fairly far in with this degree. I just have to complete my foreign language core and one more sociology class (wut). I could try to add CS as a double major, which I expect to take another year on top of the rest of my full-ride scholarship time (meaning 3 years; I prefer to take a normal class load, and the CS course load at my school is pretty much an engineering course load). The other options would be to start studying for the actuarial exams, or join the military in some capacity (family tradition). 

I'm just unsure this would be enough either. I haven't done any internships (didn't think about it). On top of that, the part-time job I have doesn't really come close to pertaining to math or computer science (was first a favor to a friend; complicated). I just have no idea what to do.

Do you think I should get a double major, or am I just paranoid? Is programming/software developer a viable option? How would you go about getting a job in my shoes? Thanks.

PS: Sorry if this is redundant. I searched for similar questions on here, but none of the answers were of depth I would have liked to see."

2awniq,2,2014-07-16,How to get over oneitius without playing the pick-up game?,throwawayseduc,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/2awniq/how_to_get_over_oneitius_without_playing_the/,"Hey r/seddit. I love what you all do here, so I've come for some help. I'm a decent person attending Uni and balancing an internship and a job. I work every day. As such, on top of classes and my pothead habit, I don't leave myself much time to go out and be sociable (I just turned 21 though so that might change).

That being said, I'm perfectly happy and comfortable in my life. I'm well supported, finances in check, going to the gym regularly and maintaining healthy friendships. I mediate and do my best to have self control while thinking about this girl. I try not to dwell on her, and I don't follow her facebook or text her excessively. She is an old friend we will call, Coffee.

Quick time line of events:

You see, coffee and I go way back, almost two and a half years. We met in college and I grew to like her, but she had a bf far away that prevented her for considering me. She even left for a year to stay with him. It didn't end so well, so she came back. I immediately asked her out and took her on a date, that while she enjoyed, I thought was a bit...lacking romance. Granted it was a concert.

She constantly talks about her ex's and prospective people she finds on line so,me thinking I wasn't clear enough, tried to have a conversation to clear the air on where we stand. I brought up the possibility of taking our friendship further, but it wasn't until later that night where after a few drinks, she consults my friend for advice, talking in the third person, obviously about me. And I think she was a bit tipsy, and let it slip that ""i'm too nice."" Keep in mind, It was a very low key discussion and not much was said on my part, or her, just my friend giving advice to her, but also to me though how he phrased things while I was there.

Since that night I realized I must be developing oneitus and I need to move on. She's had abuse issues, and I've had experience with trying to get with girls that have daddy issues, and I've known to be attracted to those. I've tried to move on, but she is a good friend of mine and is now ingrained in my social circle. Thus I get to see her semi frequently.

I think my biggest problem is I cannot help but be drawn to her smell, it makes me crazy. Besides that, I am pretty good and controlling my attraction to her. But something about her pheromones makes me want to screw the goo outta her, and also extremely jealous every time she brings up other guys, talks about getting laid, etc.

I realize what I really want finally, and that is to just bone this woman. I'm ok with not having a ""bf gf"" thing going on, that shit is time and money and commitment. A big part of what draws me to her is our similarities in taste ranging from music to food. So I have a vested interest in maintaining this friendship, we have a bit in common. That being said, I'm sick of either feeling hopeful, like someway I can get her to get with me and seeing fake signs that I'm ""succeeding"" or rejected and hurt.

I feel like this is irrational on my part. Then again I feel like I am trying to set my bar higher in specifically in what I want sexually, and my attraction to her pheromones (along with her, ahem, qualifications visually, racially, size) make me want to really figure out how I can get my lions share of the girl I like, or to move on. I have friendships that are sexual and work out before, so I'm not worried about it being in jeopardy. I'm a very intimate person and look for that in my friendships.

tl;dr So seddit... how do I get over oneitis with a girl who I get aroused just by her pheromones, has a great rap sheet of qualities, and seems to be playing the single and out there life right now but ignores me in that arena? She finds me and my friends to be ""great company!"" and laughs excessively at what I say. Should I be more direct? I don't want to play waiting games, so none of that "" give it a few weeks "" bs either. Ultimatums? End the friendship? Brutal honesty? I was thinking of asking her on another date, and try to lay it on real thick, like a wine date at her place. In one way, I feel like I'll get a solid ""no"" while on the other, if I swim around it and instead of focusing on the concept of being together, I can just get us in a situation where I've build some attraction through action and she'd be more likely to kinda do a ""one off thing.""

I'm a local currently residing in Singapore and planning to make a jump to the other side of the world. Its kind of a long term plan so not in any rush because I'm still a conscript in the military here at minimum wage in a country with high cost of living and heard that the grass is greener on the other side (note that this is from my point of view). Would like to move to the US to further my career after I'm done with the military.

I'm a Diploma holder in Information Technology (Game Development) and have since moved into Front-End development self taught with some experience under my belt. Planning to work for the experience and save up for a few years or so first to settle financially before making the move and here goes the list of questions.


I'm not a degree holder and not sure if I'll be taking one so which work visa should I be looking at?
 
And how do I go about finding the job in Singapore? or should I be going over to do the job hunting?

What state should I be looking for? I heard Manhattan has many IT startups when my friend went for his internship, but I'm open to suggestions.

I know the cost of living varies from state to state but hopefully somebody could break it down to me in terms of food, necessities and rent etc and possibly getting a place to call my own.

Will I be able to convert the work visa into a PR in the future? Anything else I should take note of?

These are long term plan so I'm in no rush to make the move. Maybe I'll travel over and get a feel of the environment as well (: Thanks for listening and sorry for the long post! (:"

2ax0bu,1,2014-07-16,Turns out I completely suck at the ONE thing my life is spent on,ceyeaye,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ax0bu/turns_out_i_completely_suck_at_the_one_thing_my/,"Being the boring, uninteresting, and talentless low self-esteemed person that I am, I had nothing to look forward to in the summer before college. Killing time through aimless web browsing and fixating on my school work are the only two significant things that I can say make up my life; the former is my idea of downtime from school work and the latter is a crucial necessity to remain just remotely competent in my classes. Academic performance has been my only driving benchmark of success and of aptitude. But even then, if I somehow were at the top of my own benchmark among my peers, there is no escaping the fact that my runner-ups—hell, the rest of the class—are comparable to me in their academic abilities, AND easily have numerous other accomplishments in life. That is my greatest depressor, source of shame and embarrassment: I cannot manage a balanced and well-rounded life AND accomplish anything meaningful.

I had graduated high school with an unimpressive total of five AP classes (not a very rigorous courseload even at my school) and absolutely no meaningful extracurriculars undertaken in all of four years. Yet I had been accepted to the schools of engineering at Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Barbara. At one of them, I was offered a generous financial aid package that accommodated all of my expenses--an offer made possible by my earning of a scholarship awarded to the ""top ranked academic admits"" demonstrating significant financial need, on the condition of satisfactory academic progress. To this day, I still am incredulous how anyone in admissions thought I was a promising enough student to maintain such progress.

As you can already tell, I don't consider myself very bright. Needless to say, I also was not your typical high school superstar who fucked around yet aced all classes without so much as lifting a finger to study. Even though only junior year was rigorous (in the other two years, I was a huge pussy about taking difficult classes), I owed my success in high school to a strong work ethic framed around constant study and review.

So in that summer before college, I became nervous about the coming transition to college. I knew I had left high school completely unprepared for the difficulty of college level work. I knew not to expect to be hitting the ground running, what with having to compete with students of higher caliber than me. I figured I needed to improve my academic abilities and at the same time pursue meaningful life activities. That was my goal for the summer: to acquire the best studying techniques, the best time management and organizational skills, and become a smarter, rather than harder, worker. Fixing these weaknesses would be the only way for me to have time at all for other things in life.

I scoured all over Reddit and college-based forums for tips and advice, personal stories—basically anything with guidance. I focused particularly on the stories where the person was initially failing and having a tough time adjusting, but learned from their mistakes and did much better down the road. I took to heart the Study Hacks blog by Cal Newport, and even obtained a copy of his How to Become a Straight-A Student. Finishing that book tied together all the advice I had read about, which I then used to develop my own battle plan for college.

I was certain this battle plan would destine me for great success, both in my classes and in life. After all, I had been learning from the ""unconventional strategies real college students use to score high while studying less""! I became zealous with excitement, and with this newfound high I became obsessed with thinking about life immediately after college. I had read all of Reddit’s tips to pursuing internships; I had dreamed that I would be involved with many engineering clubs and organizations; I had practiced creating a bunch of resumes filled with bogus engineering experience I dreamed about getting. I believed I can be an engineer. I believed I can be smart, interesting, and do everything without facing stress. And still have time to do more.

My euphoria was short-lived. Just as I thought my college experience started off well, things started to fall apart one by one. My studying techniques I had outlined in my battle plan were consuming a huge amount of time for little return in my performance on exams. Missing a few initial club meetings turned into completely reneging my involvement. Forget whatever thoughts I had about a social life and plans about going to the gym. It was clear I needed to dedicate more time to studying than outside interests. Yet I continued to lie to myself I can manage to have SOME free time—whatever that meant. I never knew what to do with “free time” besides continuing my usual habit of killing time. Some days, I even walked around outside aimlessly on the pretense of clearing my head. Meanwhile, the other freshmen seemed not to have any trouble adjusting; my roommate and several floormates, all engineering/STEM students, had near-perfect attendance to Thirsty Thursday. They managed superb grades too.

I continued my usual habits during the course of winter break. In the middle of it, I had just received my final grades: A in a general ed class, A- in Calc II, B- in Physics I. A decent 3.46 GPA, and I was sure I could only improve from them on. I analyzed what I did wrong or what I could improve on and came up with new techniques to study. I also continued to think about how I can better manage my time.

Once school resumed, I began applying to a campus job, since I figured working part-time would force me to be on top of everything. I thought I had better time management this time around. But out of anxiety and the thought of added stress, I chose to back down and not to submit my application. Pathetic as that may sound, it was luckily my best route. The pace and stress of my classes only intensified.

A clusterfuck of physics lab reports and programming assignments. Math lectures became entirely theoretical and conceptual and had no practical relevance to the problem sets. My sense of time was fucked over and deadlines seemingly converged. Once I had completed one task, another one was needed to be done urgently. No breaks, no rest. I couldn’t believe that of everything I had envisioned about my college experience, I had failed to meet any of my expectations. 

A in English, B+ in Physics lab, B- in CS, C in differential Calc III. 3.2 GPA.

I was mad at myself and I fucking had it. I couldn’t afford my GPA falling anymore. I kept on analyzing what I was doing wrong and cut out a lot of bullshit techniques that I realized were just interfering with my learning. I trimmed my learning approach down to a definitively simple style: read and take good notes before lecture, and rewrite/review lecture notes immediately after class. But even this proved to eat a lot of my time and I was falling behind in my classes. Turned out that I was fixating on small details that weren’t important. I felt everything I was doing was useless and futile. At that point I knew my GPA would be beyond reparation.

My frustration and stress piled up, my head hurt every day, and deadlines continued to converge. I had no time to do everything at the same time. I spent literally every minute working. My attempts to manage time failed as everything grew out of my control.

All the way leading up to the end of finals week, I had been pummeled to the ground, picked back up, and served another beating. My every effort into studying and working culminated into a complete waste. In just one fucking year, my GPA is officially below 3.0. What does that bode for me in the next three?

B- in CS, C in Physics II, C in Calc III. They may as well be straight C’s.

No improvement over the course of an entire year. Just a continual downward spiral throughout. I’ve accomplished nothing in one year, only being met with dismay. Of course, I can improve—I just don’t know what else I can do to improve. I tried a lot of study “techniques” through trial and error, and none of them stuck with me. Is there really anything left for me to do? I think I already proved to myself I cannot handle STEM.

I’ll quit whining now. Maybe I’ll just major in something useless like I’ll get told to, and get to working at Starbucks."
2ax2n9,2,2014-07-16,I (17 M) am not sure if it's a date I'm having with one of my best friends (17 F) I really really like her. Please help,steikpanne,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ax2n9/i_17_m_am_not_sure_if_its_a_date_im_having_with/,"So, I (male, 17y) have this complicated relationship with this girl (17y). We met through high-school and I've known her for one year now. I already knew she was someone special from the first day, so I slowly but surely got(/get) to know her, and I just like her more and more. We went out a few times before but really all we did was hanging around, not actual dating.


After this one year I really feel like we have a special connection, after building up our friendship with a lot of intern jokes and joke names for each other. We talk alot, I'd say everyday, wether it's IRL, facebook, snapchat or simply regular phone messages. When we are together I tend to throw out a small flirt here and there, and the response is usually positive or just moderate. Sometimes (I think) she flirts back aswell..?


During the last 3-5 months, people around us sometimes assume I and her are a couple... My parents assume she is a girlfriend, because I've been seeing her and talked about her alot lately. It seems like it's the same with her parents, as they suggested I and her joining her little sister's kissing game; ""only for bfs and gfs"", as she so nicely put it, when I was over at her place last time (yesterday). To be honest; I don't blame them. Because sometimes even I feel like we are acting as if we were a couple: sitting leant on each other and watching movies, joking with each other, sharing candy or other foods, or just sitting together in endless talks about nothing and everything.


So, now that I've explained the current situation, here's the problem: I really like her, and want to be more than very good friends. I am now trying to get there. So my absolute first steps towards this is bringing her out on a date watch a movie in the theatres. 


She had recomended this movie ( 21 jump st. ) earlier this year, and I knew the sequel is currently in theatres, so I decided to watch the first one the night before I went to see her. Then I casually mentioned that I had watched the first one, and she was immideately hyped for wanting to see the second one. I proceed to casually bring up my wallet and say ""hey wait a minute! I won two free tickets to the theatres earlier on"" (this was the truth, I had mentioned them before once or twice). 
I suggested we could go to the theatre. But the response was somewhat unclear. She was so hyped about the movie, wanted to see it st once. ""But I want to se it right noooow""

What she did was searching it up on the internet and, fortunately for me, found that there was no illegal streaming links up yet. She was then quite upset about that, before we together decided that we could watch the first one, as she hadn't seen it in a while.


I had to leave before we were done watching it, as the last buses were going at that hour. This was after staying there for 11.5 hours, helping her with some clothes-folding and roomcleaning, walking together to get a postcard posted, her family showing me ALOT of picures from their trip to the US, eating dinner with them, and then sitting in a sofa-swing on their balcony with her (again; just to show how our relationship is atm.). For me, personally, I felt as if she had let me in even closer than before on her personal life during this stay. I feel loke we became even closer than before.

So, when I left there was sort of this awkward moment where we both just stood there in silence while looking at each other for a second or two, before I said ""sooeh.. yeah, goodbye..?"", sort of reaching out for the doorhandle whilst still looking at her before I gave her a hug (and I'm not sure, but it seemed to last for just about half a second longer than our usual goodbye-hugs)


We didn't talk more about the movie theatre, obviously. As I was very unsure of what to say about it, but once I got home, I thought ""what the hell, I can't go without answer"". So in the middle of a snapchat-chat we were now having, I said ""..but hey!? The movie theatre?"", followed up by another one: ""22 jump st. Do you join the next time the weather is not that great?""

Her response was something similar to ""yeh, niz"". (Using ""cool"" texting-language ironically as that is sort of a thing we do in our class)



My question is: Is this a date now? Should I dress up a little extra nice? get her something (if so, what)? I always offer myself to pay while beeing with her, will she accept that this time for this ""whateveritis""? And lastly, but most importantly: can I make a move here? Do the old 'stretch and suddenly my hand is over her shoulder'? I really don't know...



TL;DR: I think am going on a date(?) With one of my best friends. Our relationship is close but is complicated, and I like her alot. The day I asked her we spent alot of time together and I feel even closer to her now.

Any help is appreciated. (Written on a phone, 4am. Sorry for all misspellings and/or other weirdnesses)"

2ax4zp,4,2014-07-16,Should I interview for an internship if I just barely accepted a non tech job less than a week ago?,csThr0waway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ax4zp/should_i_interview_for_an_internship_if_i_just/,"So a little over Two months ago I applied for an internship at a couple of local tech companies, but after not hearing from any of them in over a month I decided to apply to other non tech jobs and about five days ago I got hired at a non tech place. Then about two days ago I got an email from one of the companies i applied at saying

&gt;I'm not sure if you're still in the running for the internship but we would like to set up a phone interview for sometime this week.

I'd much prefer an internship and gaining some professional experience as a programmer over my current job, but the way they worded their email saying ""**I'm not sure if you're still in the running for the internship**"" and the fact that I don't have a lot of experience in Rails (I'm more familiar with Java than Ruby) and some the other languages/frameworks they use, makes me wonder if it'll even be worth interviewing. Also the internship is only 3-4 months where my current  job is for as long as I want to work there and I'd be making about $15/hour both places.

So I guess my questions are, is it normal to not hear back from a company until several months after you've applied and also what do you think they mean by ""**I'm not sure if you're still in the running for the internship**""? Shouldn't they know since they're recruiters at the company, and why would they want to interview me if they don't even know if they're looking for an intern. What would you do if you were me?

I guess I have nothing to lose by interviewing and if nothing else I'll get experience interviewing for a programming position, which I've never done before since I'm only a freshman. It just sounds like they're not really sure if they will hire me and I don't really want to continue to stress out over this internship and possibly risk losing my current job and end up not having a job again.

tl;dr I applied for an internship and didn't hear back until after I had already accepted another job. Should I keep my current job or should I interview at this tech company even though I might not get hired and if I do get hired I would have to quit my current job during my training and most likely never be able to work there again?"

I apologize in advance if the username is confusing. I made this account to have a bit of fun with the typos people make when talking about /u/airz23.

This is my story. To make things easier, I split the chronicle into what I consider to be the different chapters of my life. 

**Disclaimer:** I will tell these tales *exactly* as I remember them. I will only change names to protect the innocent. Nothing else (including vulgarities) will be obfuscated. If you can't handle the occasional f-bomb, close the fucking tab.

----------


###The Saga Begins
This chapter is where everything begins. It contains the tales of how I first began my adventure into the world of technology (and support).
####Arc 1: Slow Beginnings - The Innocent Years
These tales document the last years of my time in junior high (middle school). In this arc, I start learning about technology, and supporting the townsfolk and close family.
####Arc 2: Rise of a Bastard
This might be the longest arc in my story. These are the tales of how I became the unofficial tech department and BOFH of my high-school. 
####Arc 3: The Freelancer
A continuation of Arc 1, this story arc is a bit different than the rest. While it *does* take place during the Arc 2, it's and ongoing tale that spills into the Dumbing of Age. 

###Dumbing of Age - The College Years
Named after one of my [favorite webcomics](http://www.dumbingofage.com/), this chapter tales is all about life at the university and in the dorms. 
####Arc 4: Gizmos and Gadgets
I was going to become a computer engineer, until I met the other students.
###Arc 5: Soundcheck One-Two, Soundcheck One-Two
This arc is about the people and technology in the world of broadcasting. Everybody wanted to be famous, but no-one knew how.
###Arc 5 1/2: The Scoop
All about how I met a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor, became a journalist, and learned to be nerdy again.

###Arc 6: The Internship
This is about my most recent foray in data-journalist. I moved to Washington, D.C. and work at a publication focused on international affairs. Oh, and I became unofficial office tech support.

----------
**Note:** I am currently living in Arc 6. There aren't quite as many stories, but there should be more in the coming weeks. The continuity of my story will *not* be linear. The numbering system will be more like the Dewey Decimal System than a chronology. 

----------


And because this is /r/talesfromtechsupport, here's a short story that happened just a few weeks ago.


####The Internship #1- ""We don't need any plugins!""
The company I work for has both a regular print publication and a website. The website has a *lot* more content than the print edition, and it's my job to make the data-visualizations look nice.

One of the mapping tools I've been reading up on is QGIS. While QGIS is fairly straightforward. My supervisor, Kim, wants me to deploy QGIS to a few of my data-viz coworkers. Like most things with her, it can't be a simple or straightforward. I have to document everything (with screenshots) that needs to be downloaded and installed. Every freaking step, including dragging-and-dropping files to different folders. Argh.

As with a lot of UNIX-y software, QGIS has a couple dependencies to install before the main package. On my machines, it's a simple

    sudo apt-get install qgis

Nice and easy, right? Wait, no. Every other dev has a Mac or Windows computer.

So, I make a list of the packages (including external libraries that needed to be installed. After reading through it, Kim didn't look too happy.

Kim: Ariz23, I told you we *don't* need any plugins. You need to get rid of these (points to dependencies). 

Ariz23: I remember, there aren't any plugins on the list. We need those files for QGIS to work.


Kim: But we don't need any plugins

*Internally: You're been learning to program for over a month. You should fucking know this by now..*

After ~15 minutes of explaining, the idea of dependencies finally clicked.

 I couldn't be too upset, though.  On my first day, she bought me a $10 burger and fries. Kim is one of the best managers I've ever had. She's just a bit slow when it comes to programming... and software installation.


This story was written while listening to [Time Pilot by the Apples in Stereo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bj_T0HfI5w).

My question is. What do you think would be more beneficial for me? (I am interested in both the same (Android and C++ ). 

|

I would love to do 3D games/graphics and/or go in the security field (More in depth C++ and get to know the language pretty well).

|

But also, I have so many ideas and the boom of Android is getting bigger and bigger and there is SO MUCH you can do with it, that I am not sure if I should simply dig into it right now! (Specially with the new [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) course. (Although would have to catch up with some java ....maybe...or not really. 
I also love the fact that almost anything you can think about you could build an app for it and literally change the world (or sell it to Facebook for $1B)

|

My questions are, (and I know it is broad and it depends on a lot of things):
  *what will help me more in todays market? Is pursuing a deeper understanding of C++ really awesome or is Android Development really needed today.
  *considering future classes, would it be worth it to do Android Dev now (and during the semester) and let C++ take its course with the curriculum?
  *For people who work with Android, is it as cool as it looks, can you get good (useful for a company) at it enough for an internship or to build interesting products? (in  let say 4-6 months)

|

But yeah, sorry for the long post and thank you beforehand for any help. I know its maybe a bit weird of choices but I think I should stick to either one of those for now, since I am not a genius coder or anything but I do really enjoy programming so that is a plus.....right? haha

2axmmr,8,2014-07-17,I'm the only girl going on a work field-trip to a water park. I need some advise on dealing with my period and being comfortable.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2axmmr/im_the_only_girl_going_on_a_work_fieldtrip_to_a/,"Hey every one! I'm in a bit of a embarrassing and private dilemma. I'd like some general advise on dealing with periods during company outings/field trips, as well as handling these types of decision problems for the future.


My company has planned a field trip to a water park for all of the summer interns at my company. 


Of course being a tech company I am the only female intern, and there are 9 male interns. Every one else involved (supervisors, organizers), are all guys as well. There is no way to change the trip, since the date was already set. 


It looks like the trip will fall on one of the heavy days of my period (I'm on BC, so I can count the days pretty accurately). I personally would love to go to a water park, but just not on my period. Every one else seems very excited too. And I think it's unreasonable to ask a group of 10+ people to cancel this trip just for me.

**How should I talk to the intern supervisor and let him know that I won't be able to participate in most of the activity?** 

How do I do this and minimize the unavoidable awkwardness?


I'd also like to get some advise on being comfortable for the day, since I'll be there regardless:

1. Are tampons sufficient to keep me from leaking? I'll probably be moving around a lot.

2. I've never used tampons (had a bad experience when I started getting periods) - should I even risk using tampons for the first time at a water park? Is it possible to practice using one when there is no flow?

3. Should I even participate in the activity? I usually have moderate cramps and try not to exercise during my periods. But I'm worried a day of running around the water park will be too much to handle.

4. [bonus question] - any suggestions on what I can do at a water park other than... going in the waters? :)

2axrs2,233,2014-07-17,"(Update) I (20 M) broke up with my girlfriend (22 F) of 8 months because she wanted an open relationship, friends are taking her side.",340973294753240957,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2axrs2/update_i_20_m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of/,"[previous post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2anema/i_20_m_broke_up_with_my_gilrfriend_22_f_of_8/)

So after reading all the comments on the previous post, I just want to say thanks for the advice and thanks for the reddit gold.  I did my best to read most of the comments and took everything everyone said into consideration.

I'm actually doing pretty good, all things considered.  I already talked to some people  at a community college nearby with the same interests as me (film-making).  Also, some people in that group of friends are still my friends, but were trying to stay neutral (I can't blame them), but most of them still hate me so I'm still not associating with them.  

Through all of this, I guess I have three things I could use advice on.

When I read the comments, some people said no contact with A (the girlfriend) was harsh, so I talked to her yesterday.  I told her down the line I could try to be friends with her, and that there was no chance of us getting back together.  She listened to me, I listened to her, and she was generally cool about things, accept she kept telling me she would win me back.  I told her to stop, but she wouldn't listen, and the last thing she did was tell me she still loved me before we left.  I didn't say anything at this point, I didn't know what to do.

B (the guy) keeps asking me to tell A to talk to him.  I didn't tell her not to, so I don't feel like I should tell her to, and I have to admit I'm glad she hasn't hooked up with him yet, even though I expect it will happen eventually.  I want her to be happy, but I really don't want B to, and if she's happy without him I wouldn't mind it.

My second issue is that one girl (a friend of B that knew all of us) decided to put something on Facebook about me hooking up with somebody (who is currently a FWB) so fast after I broke up with A.  The FWB doesn't care, but somebody at my mom's office saw it (I guess they were FB friends).

The problem is that she sent all the other interns at my mother's health insurance office a group email, specifically asking a girl I had hooked up with a couple of times before I dated A.  Someone in the  groupme decided to tell my mom, and now my mom is acting ""strangely"" toward C (the girl I used to see).

C sent me the message telling me, then my mom asked about us on text and told me to come home for dinner tomorrow.  I don't know if it's about this.  My mom told me before that she didn't mind if I was with anyone, just to be serious about that person.  I don't want to lie to her, but I also don't want to tell her that I never really dated C.  I know no matter what she won't try to punish me, but I hate disappointing her.

The last issue is pretty minor compared to the first two, but y'all have helped me so much I thought I could at least ask about this.  The FWB sent me a message saying she wanted to ""hang out"" while we smoke some grass.  I told her I don't smoke, and she said that's fine, and asked if she still could.  I'm glad that she offered, because I'm not that sure about it.  I've seen people that get high and are just a little happier and I've seen people get stoned off their ass and seem comatose.  Is it weird for me to say not to?  I don't want her to be drifting in and out while we're together.  I don't want to take advantage of her.

tl;dr- ex is saying she wants to win me back, mom found out I slept with an intern at her office (because of a vindictive FB post), and (less seriously) new FWB wants to be high while we hook up, but I'm iffy about it.

Once again, thanks for any advice.

Edit-Apparently C just THINKS my mom is upset with her and doesn't actually know.  The more I think about it the more I think my mom would just have been curious if I had dated her (she does like to know things if it could potentially effect her).

2axvja,6,2014-07-17,"[28F4M] - An office Christmas party for Chloe Grace. (detailed writers only, please)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2axvja/28f4m_an_office_christmas_party_for_chloe_grace/,"Alan Peterson was the newest rising star of Spielman, Kravitz, and Wiesenthal. The cutthroat junior partner was a few years removed from law school, and already starting to lead some of the bigger cases at the downtown law firm. He had a reputation for being extremely cocky and a bit of an asshole, but that was about par for most of the attorneys with his ability. They were in the business of winning cases and bravado won cases.

[Chloe Grace](http://i.imgur.com/SHvptz8.jpg) was a high school senior and an intern at SK&amp;W. The only child of a single mother, Chloe had worked very hard to get such a prestigious internship and in her eyes, deserved every bit of it. She might not have possessed the cockiness to make a great attorney, but Chloe was intelligent and outgoing, and was well liked by all the staff. It also helped that in the male dominated legal world, she was easy to talk to, and even easier on the eyes. 

As the months passed it became clear to Chloe that she didn't really have what it took to be a great attorney, and she was quickly learning that she didn't really want to be either, but as she went through her internship, she thought that being a legal secretary might not be all that bad.

---------------------------------------------------

At the Christmas party Alan set his sights on her. A sweet girl like that.. in this day and age, he doubted she was still a virgin, but he would still have her do things that she had never done before. He wouldn't be her first, but he would be the oldest, and he would be the one she would never forget. Alan on the other hand, he might not even remember her in a month. If she was going to be a one night stand, she would fade from his memory just like all the others. But maybe, just maybe, he would keep this one coming back for more. She was so sweet and innocent looking... that would certainly be a first for Alan.

-------------------------------------------

What I'm looking for from this scene is quite a bit different than my other posts. I'm looking for a player that doesn't mind getting a little *darker* than the typical vanilla roleplay. I'm looking for someone that can play a character with an arrogance and cockiness about him, but who can be sweet enough to get what he wants from a girl like Chloe. The only child of a single mother, Chloe is secretly desperate for attention and a father figure... and if the right (or maybe in this case wrong) man came alone, he could have her wrapped around his selfish little finger.

---------------------------------------------

Due to the amount of absolutely wonderful orange letters that I usually recieve, I'm going to ask that if you want to play this out, please give me an idea of where you'd like to take this scene, but also, please type out a few paragraphs of intro, so I can pick up from where you left off.

And last but not least, if you're coming across this post a few hours or even days after it's been posted, don't think that you've lost your chance! I'm always looking for new roleplayers to play with and I never mind going back to revisit one of my old ideas!

2ay9sf,4,2014-07-17,Immigrating as a ChemE,holthausen,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2ay9sf/immigrating_as_a_cheme/,"hi

i am currently studying chemE in germany and will receive my bachelor degree in october. after that i am planning to pursue a master in chemE with focus on computer simulations.

after that i am dreaming about emigrating canada or the usa. so this is where my concerns kick in: how difficult is it to find a job as a foreigner? and what about the job market for chemE in the next years in general ? (esp. in canada. usa seems to have a lot of opportunities). and what kind of benefits can be expected (not speaking about money, more speaking about healthcare in the us and vacation)

i tried to apply for an internship a year ago, but the companies did not seem interested (maybe due to the visa process?)."

I will try to keep this short.

I am pursuing a Macc (undergrad econ). I work full time. Internships aren't really an option. I am the breadwinner so I can't really leave a full time job for another job and risk being high and dry after a few months.

I want to work in Public. Ideally, I'd like to go to a big4 or a large regional to get my first 3-6 years over with.

I know that having experience is critical to getting that first job. I make awesome grades, but they're worthless with zero accounting experience on my resume or so I've been told.

Anyway, I was thinking about taking the EA exam and I've been researching it.

TL;DR:
Would becoming a EA allow me to volunteer on weekends or possibly do some part-time weekend busy season work for a smaller CPA firm?

How would a big 4 recruiter view my resume with some EA experience? At least it shows I'm trying while still going to work and going to school.

Can anyone from a similar situation provide some additional feedback on finding these critical entry level opportunities?

Also, how do I get involved with my local CPA society? Seems like it would be the most logical place to look for opportunities. Do I just waltz into one of their meetings and introduce myself?

I'm wrapping up an internship this week at a large national corporation. I've been offered a spot in their rotational program starting post-graduation. 


That being said, I'm highly passionate about starting off my career off as a consultant. Recruitment for that begins in September (well after this job offer expires). 


My credentials are decent but nothing MBB-worthy:

-3.6/4.0 GPA

-Solid EC experience (leading multiple clubs) + 1st place awards at case comps

-Good work experience at a large Telco + an international tech consulting firm


I'm gunning for Big 4 consulting arms, as well as OW/Accenture etc and have been networking extensively over the summer at cocktails and firm tours


I've been practising case interviews all summer and believe I could have a real chance at securing a spot at one of those firms. At the same time, I don't want to turn down this job offer just to be unemployed. 


Reddit consultants, what would you do in my case?

I am currently interning for a local YMCA. As an intern I am working 40 hours unpaid. I was recently put in charge of a project in which we are using an iOS app in development (Android being developed after launch) to teach individuals (mainly children) skills related to physical activity and life. It is going to be very interactive and engaging for the users and I am very excited to be a part of.

The organization/project is on a strict budget and asking them for assistance on this would be difficult and not something I feel comfortable asking the higher ups for.

So I was wondering if there is anyone out there willing to help me in obtaining and iOS device that would help on this project. The device must be at least need to be an iPhone 4 (or iPod touch/iPad equivalent) and be able to run iOS7.

I would really appreciate it and it would really really save me some money on an already extremely tight budget.

Thanks!

I am a long time lurker but now I feel it is time for me to post for some advice. I (21F) recently broke it off with bf (22M) and I know it was the right thing to do but like always, break ups are hard. 

     Let me start with some background. Our relationship has always been kind of rocky. We started dating at 16 and have been on and off ever since. I have seen other people when we haven't been together but every time (lets call him Rick) Rick comes in to the picture when I am having a moment of weakness and I go running back. It is comfortable and I guess that is why I go back. I do love him but the problem is that we just aren't good together. He is paranoid, doesn't like to meet new people, HATES my friends, hates going out to bars, and gets angry about small things then yells at me or just rages around his apartment destroying things. He has other amazing qualities that I love but over time those qualities that I saw when we were 16 are fading. I on the other hand am trusting, I love to go out with my friends, I hate being mad and I don't like yelling at all. Over time it seems like the older we get the more different we are and I feel like he doesn't want me to be myself. Other times we were together I would sacrifice my own happiness, like going out with my friends, to stay at home with him. I tried to convince myself that I was doing it because I wanted to and I loved him but I realized that I was only doing it to avoid a fight. And when he would come out with me he would constantly say rude things about the people we saw at the bars, act like my friends didn't exist, and either disappear or say that we should leave. 


Here are some recent example:
It's 4th of July and we are in the downtown area of our home city with his brother and his friend. Rick gets annoyed because no one can decide where to go so he starts walking really fast ahead to where we cant see him. We try to follow the way it looked like he was going and finally his brother thought he spotted him. I called Rick trying to see where he was and he immediately starts yelling at me saying that I was trying to ditch him to hang out with his brother and friend. I tried to calm him down and explain that I was looking all over the place for him but when I finally found him he wouldn't even look at me and at the bar we went to he bought himself, his brother, and friend a shot but not me. He just turned his back to me and acted like I didn't exist. After the first bar Rick left to go help his other friend find a parking spot and was gone for about an hour. During that time I went to another bar with his friend and brother. It was kind of lame so we left and went to a popular one. On the way to the second bar Rick's friend texts him to let him know. Then I get a text from Rick saying ""Fuck You. I hope you are having fun with my friend and brother"" I didn't know what to say because I was just going along for the ride and he wouldn't talk to me in person. We get to the popular bar and again he wont even look at me and when we get inside I try to be nice and friendly to Rick by trying to hold his had. He yanks his hand away and yells FUCK YOU! I immediately left to get some air because I was upset. He follows behind later and starts apologizing and saying 'we have been together so long'. I accept the apology but looking back now I am mad I didn't stick up for myself. 


Ever since July 4th Rick has been growing increasingly short tempered and rude towards me. When we would hang out he would do something to avoid talking to me like play video games or sit on his computer for hours shopping on drug market places. He wouldn't touch me and would barely look at me. I had seen this before, he was avoiding telling me something or was hiding something. Yesterday I finally got fed up with it when I met up with Rick and his friend for lunch and I was trying to tell him what I had been up to at my internship and it was like I didn't say anything. He didn't even look at me. Instead he was freaking out about his scooter and got mad at me for not walking outside the restaurant to make sure it was there. (he is paranoid about things be stolen, if something go missing whether it be a lighter or something bigger he blames it on someone coming in his place and taking it. NEVER has anything been stolen.) When I got back to work I knew I had to say something so I texted Rick asking if he wanted to talk about anything because he seemed on edge. He said no and asked why I thought that. Finally he came clean. His family was going on a vacation that Rick said he wanted me to go on but his family wouldn't let him take me (I was supposed to go last year but Rick broke up with me a week before so I was a mess for his family) This didn't make since to me because his family really likes me and thinks I am good for Rick. Rick told me he would keep asking his family and would always make up some excuse for why he couldn't give me an answer about the trip. WELL turns out he had been lying to me and it was Rick's turn to bring someone on the trip so he invited his friend. Rick said he didn't want to face me and was trying to avoid it and that's why he had been weird toward me. THIS WAS THE LAST STRAW. I was pissed. There he was treating me like a fucking pariah or something and I kept thinking I was doing something wrong all because he didn't have the balls to tell me what was really going on. 

On top of that, Rick had a problem with opiate abuse and started giving me drugs in the winter of 2012. I got pulled in as well and was using pretty heavily with Rick (multiple times a day) for over 6 months. We both decided to get clean and he dumped me as soon as I didn't feel physically sick from withdrawls anymore. Anyone who has gone through WDs knows that they aren't over once the physical part is over, It takes a long time to feel remotely normal again. He had plenty of friends that knew of his drug use and plenty of people to go to. I on the other hand, hid it from all of my friends and family, I had no one to go to or tell. It was a really hard time for me but I made it through and I have officially been clean for over a year now, YAY! But Rick still uses here and there and will go behind my back to buy drugs. When he was trying to get me back he said that he was 'done with drugs' and that he wouldn't do them again if it meant having me back. I believed him but I shouldn't have. He would come over high as a fucking kite, nodding out and his pupils the size of a point. I'm not an idiot, I knew what it was from. Every time I would try to talk to him about it he would freak out and make me feel like I was seeing things and was being crazy. I was just trying to help and he promised he wouldn't get into that again. A few time he came clean about using after saying I was being crazy and ridiculous. 


Honestly I don't know why I took him back or stayed but that is why I need your help reddit.

Before I actually get working, I'd like some pointers or some from-home practice, if possible. I have very limited time to study the implemented SCCM at school outside of class, and it would be nice to get a head start. Thanks!"

I'm wondering, where can I start looking for some projects to spend time on? I am talking about personal projects. All I have done is do programming examples out of the textbooks I have been using, which is fun, but I think it is time to try something larger.

I have never looked into web development, android/iOS development, or operating systems, but these three fields seem like a good place to invest some time into so I can get some ""applied CS"" experience, if you will.

So are there any resources online to help look into some projects I can try?"

---

Sorry if my English isn't perfect, as I am Danish:

(request at bottom - hope you will take your time to read my post)

The female teacher firstly accused the Danish intern of having touched 13 kids on their crotches, made them touch his penis etc. The school at which he worked then investigated the claims by, among other things, filming him with the children without him knowing it. Finding no evidence at all, and in generel trusting him because of him having shown no prior suspicious behavior, the ""case"" was dropped.

The female teacher was fired, because she has been filing several complaints about co-workers in the past which turned out to be lies and straight op harrasment. 

After she got fired she herself turned him in to the police - most likely because she was angry about how things turned out. After she turned him in she went on ""vaccation"" in Greece and has not been reachable since.

He is now being dragged through painfull and expensive trials and is very confused and scared about the situation. The police have among other things not fulfilled their obligations by for example telling him about his rights to an attorney. 
He has made bail for a huge amount of money but is still awaiting further development in the case. He has an electronic lock on his ancle and cannot leave Manhattan.

The false claims of ONE woman, against internal investigations, all other staff members only having positive to say about him, as do all the parents who know him.

And now for a small request: If you can see the madness in this case, he needs help: No money, no charity (we have started a charity fond here back home, but I won't ask Reddit for this): He has no place to live, as he got kicked out of his former appartment and cannot leave Manhattan due to a restriction order the judge set. 
Is there anyone who know a place where he can get a place to stay?

Not for free or anything, just a connection to a place he and his two mothers can rent and stay while the case goes on.

We are hoping for justice!"
2azirl,2,2014-07-17,"Would ""Engineering Analyst"" be considered relevant experience? (more details in post)",[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2azirl/would_engineering_analyst_be_considered_relevant/,"The short version:

While applying for actuary jobs, a company found me on Monster that does consulting for oil companies. For the sake of argument, lets say they offer me a job. In the absence of any actuarial offers, would this position be considered relevant experience on my resume? I would consider working there for a couple of years while taking exams if would help at all. To give you a vague idea of what the position would entail, the job description lists these duties:
Engineering Analyst:
• Estimation of oil, gas, condensate, and plant product reserves
• Comprehensive field studies and reservoir analyses
• Equity determinations
• Reservoir modeling and simulation
• Secondary and enhanced recovery studies
• Reservoir exploitation and management studies
• Gas deliverability studies
• Gas cycling studies and planning
• Probabilistic reserve modeling
• Pipeline and gathering system studies
• Cogeneration studies
• Operations and facility analysis

From the interview I gathered that the position would make use of Excel and some level of programming (though not very much, as it didn't seem to bother them that I don't have any programming experience). 


More Background:

I'm trying to get my foot in the door as an actuary, but I'm having a pretty tough time. I think a lot of the problem is that I'm stuck with basically the bare minimum qualifications. For reference:

I have a BS in Math with a mediocre GPA (Graduated last year with a 3.0).
I have passed the P Exam, and feel confident about the FM next month.
I've been waiting tables through (and since) college and have no relevant experience.

Obviously, I messed up by not pursuing internships while in college, or getting started on the exams earlier. That being said, I still need a job while I work on exams. I've sent out 40+ resumes in my current city (Houston) and a couple of others (Austin and Nashville) with very little response. I've also used the SOA directory to individually email actuaries in these cities with the same result. I've recently started expanding my search, but not with much vigor. This job is the first positive response I've gotten since the end of May. 

I really want to become an actuary, but I have a realistic idea of my current qualifications. Will this job help in any way? Any advice on this particular topic, or the job hunt in general would be greatly appreciated.

2azqo2,3,2014-07-17,I went to university for nothing,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2azqo2/i_went_to_university_for_nothing/,"I need to get this off my chest and write it out, but this'll all most likely be a jumbled mess of the thoughts stressing me out right now so I apologize in advance.

I'm going to unpaid leave for a month and a half, with no guarantee of work, so for all I know I'm as good as laid off as of tomorrow. I live in Calgary, where *the* job is to be an engineer because of the oil and gas industry, but things are in a bit of a recession right now so engineering jobs are hard to come by unless you're the cream of the crop, which I am certainly not. I graduated from university a year ago and after months of looking for engineering work, I had to settle for the same position I interned at, which has absolutely nothing to do with engineering and pays a fraction of what I could be earning (an Excel monkey type job). I went to school because I love mechanical engineering, I love planes, trains, and automobiles, I love rotating equipment like pumps and jet engines, I'm eternally fascinated by how they function in a scientific level. But instead I'm here, about to lose my job that I didn't even want, with no practical engineering experience. I went to a job fair not too long ago and it was all the same bullshit ""Just visit our website and apply online."" I didn't need a job fair to figure that out. What's worse is that I'm on a countdown because in a few months, most companies won't even consider me a new grad anymore, which makes it even harder for me to find a junior entry level type of position. I keep looking back to this one moment to when I was looking for intern work, and I had an opportunity to work for TransCanada but decided against it because the offer came in after I had signed all the papers for the other company already. I felt like it was a dick move if I went back on my acceptance, especially because family friends helped me find that job. But now I'm really regretting it, boy do I really regret that move. There are very few moments in life where you have your shot at something, and I let mine pass by. 

I've been looking for a new job for months now because I saw this coming, but nothing has come up. I don't know if it's my resume (which I reviewed and updated with help a couple times already), my average grades, or maybe just the job market, but I haven't even gotten an interview in my months of searching. I have a B- cumulative total, which I thought would be good enough, but I guess there's just too much competition. I can't go back to school for a master's because of my ""low"" grades, and most companies just set me aside because of my grades as well (Most positions explicitly state they only accept people with GPAs over 3.0 which is a B). I've applied to several positions abroad online, but it's the same story, don't apply unless you have senior level experience, or graduated with honours.

**I guess after reading this through, the following is the *actual* ""offmychest"" rant**

So here I am, stuck. Stuck in a hole I dug myself, by not getting higher grades, by not getting relevant experience when I had the chance. Now the clock is running down and next thing you know, my BSc in Mechanical Engineering will be nothing more than tinder for a fire. People always said, ""Oh engineers always find jobs, don't worry."" Or ""GPA won't matter once you graduate!"" But it's all bullshit. I noticed that I started subconsciously grinding my teeth nonstop, I try to catch myself and stop, but I've been doing it for months now due to stress. I bought into something that ended up being a lie, and that's what pisses me off the most. Five years of my life, wasted.

Then I look at my friends, and I know I shouldn't compare my life to others, and I should know better. But two are going to med school, those who aren't are in grad school, and those who aren't in school have successful, well-paying jobs that they love. They're all in happy, loving relationships, or spending most nights partying it up. And here's me, single, alone, soon to be unemployed and living with my parents. All I need to do is start balding and I'll be George from Seinfeld. I don't get invited to the fun stuff, I've tried dating and failed. I've tried looking for new jobs and failed. My life is falling apart beneath me and every attempt I make at salvaging it results in nothing. I don't know what to do anymore..."

model, however it's missing the long Atmega component that you could eventually remove and implement in a circuit separate from the rest of the board. This isn't a big deal as we're in the prototyping stage, but once we get a working model could that code easily be transferred to Micro/Nano/etc or just something more breadboard friendly? Even an Uno with the standard Atmega?

Location: USA on Verizon

Additional: Basically I know I can't really go wrong with any of these phones. I've heard that the Xperia Z2 is also coming to Verizon soon but I would prefer to switch sooner rather than later unless it will blow me away. I'm also intrigued by the iPhone 6, due in September. My strongest preference though is that I want a phone with a lot of features and a great battery life. I'm leaning towards the LG G3 as my HTC One M7 is starting to shit the bed in terms of battery life.

2b072g,2,2014-07-17,"1 Year left in lawschool. Decent financial position, but unsure about what to do with housing after graduation.",sammy2954,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2b072g/1_year_left_in_lawschool_decent_financial/,"Here is my situation. I am doing a summer internship before my last year of school. By the time I go back to school I will have saved about 22,000. School will be paid for, but I have a baby and a wife who won't be working so we will have to pay all of our expenses for a year until I start working at this firm full time. Here is a basically how the next year should go. These numbers are pretty sure.


    
**Expected Incomes:**   
-Start Fall - 22k in savings.  
-Refunded Scholarship - 3k  
-Tax Return - 6k  
-Firm Bar study bonus - 10k  
-Total: 41k  
 
   
**Expenses:**  
-Monthly - 2k (x12) = 24k.  
-Misc. Exp - 4k   
  
   
At the time of starting work then (Sept 2015), and assuming no catastrophic events, I expect to have about 13k left in savings.
  
   
Last few financial figures:  
-Annual Salary - 160k  
-Student Loans - 39k (Assuming I don't take any out this last year)  
-No other outstanding credit.  
-Covering **all of our monthly expenditures** (including taxes), except for any housing related payments and investment/retirement related expenditures, I expect to have $7300 to spend per month.
  
So here is the big question. My wife and I really want to buy a house and start settling in. We do not want to live near town and are looking at moving into the suburbs of the area where I will be working post graduation. There is no way that we will have 20% to make a down payment on a house, and somebody had mentioned taking the 20k of student loan available to me this last year out in December of my last year to save and help with a down payment on a house. 
  
  
Interest on student loans is about 6.8% right now.
  
  
Is it a horrible idea to buy a house after graduation? We are so torn right now because renting a house in the areas we are looking at seems to be around 2k-2.4k. It seems like we could just buy a house with monthly payments like that. Living in a house is really important to my wife, and hey, a happy wife is a happy life. But I don't want to be in a financial disaster. 
  
  
**tldr**: Is it a bad idea to buy a house in our situation? If not a horrible idea, is it a bad idea to take out the student loans available to me to help with a downpayment?

That motivated me to try harder for the next recruiting season. Now I have a stronger resume and leadership experience at a non accounting related club. I also believe I've gotten alot more comfortable networking as I've attended so many events during the Spring semester, both accounting and non accounting related.

However, I always have to worry about something and now my current worry is that it is much more difficult to get hired as a FT since most Big 4 fill up their FT from the internship pool.

So my girlfriend of a year has a serious case of Nmom. Girlfriend's agrees on the problem but can't escape because she is financially and emotionally dependent on her mom. Now I'm being used against my girlfriend and could use some advice.

At first it seemed like everyone was happy, but eventually the facade dropped and it's clear Nmom abuses everyone. Dad is an enabler and gave up every hope of having control of his life. Nmom constantly confided in my girlfriend a few years ago that she had thought of leaving him but decided not to. He was the meal ticket, but now he's lost his job and things are going downhill quickly.

Girlfriend's sister lives 3 minutes away from the parents and is over many times a week with her husband. He's a great guy, managed to keep keep his head down and not be drawn into bullshit somehow, but he's at his in-law's house all the time just sitting on his phone, trapped. I've been told if I act more like him there would be less problems. The sister is nice, but she's always drawn into her NMom's bull. Girlfriend's brother was the GC but even he couldn't take it and fled across the country. He's set up boundaries and things are alright for him.

So: I've done lots of family events with them, I want to show I'm committed to my gf as family is very important to all of them. This past Easter, Nmom was yelling at my gf since she only graduated from one of the best colleges in the country with Distinction, not Highest Distinction. She screamed ""I wish you had not come home for Easter"" while everyone was in the room. I come to defend the gf as calmly and diplomatically as I could manage but probably just exacerbated things, and we left shortly after. Now all Nmom talks about is how I didn't say goodbye to her that one time.

I've done lot's of their family events before and since then, and taken gf to a good friend's wedding and my family summer barbecue, which meant a lot to me and were a lot of fun for us. I decided to pass on one of their many upcoming family weekends (the first of 15-20 I've declined), and Nmom is saying my gf shouldn't have gone to any of my family's events. Pressure's rising on me to now recant and go, but I won't be drawn into this, and I won't cave like everyone else.

I feel like I'm hurting my gf because I don't want to end up caged like her brother in law. Therapy beyond a couple sessions I'd pay for isn't an option since Nmom is now paying for everything wants to know everything.

First of all I'm a student and I'm buying this with my own money, so while I do not like spending lots of money, I would have no problem buying a top end rMBP 15"" if I KNEW it would work well and last me 5 years.

I've read a lot about the problems the new retina models have and am worried this could be a very poor 2.5k investment.

UI lag and display ghosting are just some of the common problems: http://9to5mac.com/2013/03/20/macbook-pro-with-retina-display-problems-in-every-dimension/

On the other hand I have heard from people I know personally that these are incredible machines. People that I work with at my job (internship) that are experienced engineers/developers and know what they are talkign about.

Now if I bought an older 2012 15"" not only would I save $1,000 but I would have upgradeable ram (only up to 16gb which is in fact the top end rMBP so this is more about fixing it if it breaks), upgradeable storage (big one because know one yet knows how long these new PCIe SSD's last), and NO issues with resolution scaling (really important to me).

What do you guys think? Any tips?"

She's a fresh graduate of my school and I'm going into my senior year, she's a bit older.

Rewind three months, while driving home from class nearing the end of the semester, my friend called me and invited me to a graduation party at a local bar. I just came from a long night of video editing in the labs, and was wearing the ""finals anxiety outfit""  (baggy shirt, khaki shorts, and stinky Sperry docksider shoes without socks). I was high as fuck, looked like a frat goof, and my lankyness doesn't help.

While catching up with some friends, my buddy forcibly took my hand and starting waving it at a stranger, screaming ""Sarah! Sarah"" until she looked. She was drop-dead gorgeous, 6' tall (I'm 6'6""), I mean absolutely sooooooo stunning.... I felt so cringe. That feeling when you know, 100%, that you look like shit and you know sees it too. She awkwardly smiled at me, and I did the same. Didn't think anything about it, said goodbye to my friends, and left for the Big Apple the next morning to pursue an industry internship.

She hit me up on Facebook one day questioning about a mutual friend who had been obsessively poking her on Facebook. One thing led to another and we started talking more, just about random shit. She was really entertaining to talk to and we had a lot in common. Facebook convos led to texts, and a month or two later, she visited me in NYC (I'm doing a summer internship).

We absolutely hit it off. **Mind-blowing** sex, penis goes into orbit, the whole 9-yards, ""I like you a lot"", ""I like you a lot too"", yadda yadda. She's a redditor, too. We started dating not too long after that, and that's where we're at today. We're now 2 weeks into an exclusive relationship (albeit long distance for the next 20 days, not too bad). I feel like I've finally found a girl that I deserve, due to my bad luck with batshit crazy, mentally abusive ex's in the past, and don't want to lose her. Really digging the vibes and would like to keep her around. No buyers regret, so to speak. I've got a super hot girlfriend and I totally dig her brain. She's quickly becoming an amazing friend.

Backstory done, now here's what you've been wanting to read:

One night Sarah and I were having a deep conversation about the paranormal. For context, I'm the kind of dude who casually writes Creepypasta, faking ghost videos for /r/nosleep (check my post history to see an example), and I do not believe in ghosts in the slightest bit. I kind of think that it's fictional. After asking her if she has had experiences, she says that she's had paranormal experiences that have made her believe in a higher power, and that it has tormented her past.

After prying the details from her (she told me that she wasn't going to tell me, that it's not a big deal and that she's okay with it now, etc.) she told me that she can see dead people. Everyday, where. I thought she was joking, turns out she wasn't. She says that as a young girl, she would get visited by evil demons who would tell her to kill herself. Her dad witnessed these entities too, and that he moved from Jamaica to America in order to avoid them. She says that at her ex-boyfriends house, there was the spirit of a little girl around 6 years of age, who was in love with the ex-boyfriend. The ex-boyfriend and Sarah would draw her all the time (she's a talented artist). One day, the bf-obsessed jealous little girl even managed to punch Sarah in the nose and make her bleed.

She also added on that there are ghosts that walk among us. They look like normal, modern people, but a little ""off"" in their appearance. You will feel wind when they pass by you. But, if you were to reach out, you could put your arm right through them. She's said that she has curiously stopped them before on the street (when she ""cared"" about her ability) and they just stare at her. Sarah told me that she no longer ""cares"", and that she just goes on with her day regardless if she sees a spirit. She said that she's been to plenty of shrinks, especially during her childhood, and that they told her that she's ""sensitive"" to paranormal. No medical illness. She says it's the biggest curse she could ever have.

I'm just going to say... wow. I told her I felt uncomfortable and changed the topic, and we went on with our relationship. I don't bring it up, I don't want to know anything about it. But since then, this has bothered me. In the back of my mind, I feel like the girl I'm dating may possibly be schizophrenic, but she seems totally authentic. The way she talked about it, the things she said. I'm really confused on how to personally handle such a discovery. She's a completely down-to-earth individual.

How would you guys and girls handle this? Thanks.

""Sarah"", if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I don't mean to post your personal life on the internet. This is just really new to me and I want have my mind at ease so I can be a better man for you. It creeps me out and I need to come to terms with it.

**tl;dr**: My new girlfriend says she sees dead people and ghosts walking around her on a normal basis. She has since learned to ignore it. How should I personally handle such a discovery?"

It's the eve of your birthday.  You're up packing, since you're leaving straight from work with [redacted] tomorrow to what will actually wind up being the uncomfortably best birthday you've had in a while. You don't even dare to question his sobriety a week or so ago, you've wiped the possibility that you were the only drunk one from your mind only an hour or so after it happened.  You're more worried as to what you'll tell [redacted] in a week because you know you have to come clean.  You're going to get sick tomorrow between it and your shitty internship you're so worried you won't get a return offer to. Spoiler alert- you don't get a return offer.  And you'll spend tomorrow sucking down anti-nausea medication and deliberating over your final presentation so you don't puke in the car.

You know what you're doing a year from now?  You're working for that one company that seems to hire fucking everybody and you're getting about half the salary you would've otherwise commanded.  It's been the best fucking month of your short life and you never want to leave [redacted], even if it means never returning to [redacted] ever again.  Tomorrow you're being sent to [redacted] for an undisclosed period of time  You wouldn't have gotten to do this at [redacted] or [redacted], even though it's why you got in this industry in the first place. 

You're too excited to sleep right now.  You've been up practicing French on Duolingo, because you've found yourself with a spectacularly fun Frenchman and for some reason neither of you understand, he's stuck around. (Mom and Dad are surprisingly calm about the French guy, even if they've gotten so ridiculously nationalistic you wonder how you grew up in their house.)  You've come to terms with never speaking to [redacted] again, not because he's cut you out of his life to save face, but because you've noticed he's a two-faced, cowardly cunt who was trying to get an easy out from a relationship he didn't like anymore.

You've made your peace with [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted] as well.  To varying degrees, they will come to hate you in about a week when you talk to [redacted] and the incident surfaces.  It'll pass more painlessly than you think it will. [redacted] will eat the words he will soon scream at you, it just takes a few months.  You'll forgive each other after some more screaming.

Don't be mad at [redacted].  There's a 200% chance her boyfriend wasn't honest with her about things.  It's a few months of wasted emotions.

[redacted] also winds up being the most fun six months you've ever had pretending to study. I'd say don't be as down in the dumps as you will be in August and September and October, but you won't do anything amazing if you aren't so upset you say 'fuck it, why not?'  You also wouldn't otherwise find a best friend who won't try to sleep with you when you're completely blitzed, though you nearly lose a chance with [redacted] because you're still convinced [redacted] had good but confused intentions. He forgives you, and after about nine months you'll find it in you to tell him what the hell was going through your head.  He's more understanding about it than you think.

You haven't quit smoking.  You just shamelessly bought a carton in the name of fiscal responsibility. [redacted] puts up with it and the binge drinking like a champ, even if she's going to medical school and probably wonders how you're an otherwise intelligent person.  You've stopped binge drinking though, since you've learned how to handle the incident with [redacted] in a way that doesn't involve drinking so much you don't remember him.

I can't quite say it'll be a great year.  You'll do so many things you never dreamed of (ex: going back to France, even though you swore you'd never set foot in that country again), even if you're dragging your feet half the way and crying the other half.  Your job is amazing, even if it's the only offer you get and it took a pile of rejection letters (53, and still occasionally rising when HR gets off their asses) to get it. In retrospect, it'll be so much better year than you think it is.  Don't take a sharp knife out to the park instead of the pos thing you stupidly scrounged up and thought would do the trick.  It's not worth succeeding for a change.

Regards,
Me, on the eve of my next birthday"

I know i'm only an itern but I'm not really being challanged enough and looking around there just doesn't seem to be a very friendly atmosphere which to me is important when working. 

I turned down another internship for a smaller but still decent sized company to take this (more money, and I thought better experience) and their office just seemed much more vibrant and up beat, they looked like they were having fun at work.

So my question is, if I get offered this job is it wise to try for the smaller company and see if I get offered on their grad scheme as well? Would I hinder my career if I went to said smaller company compared to the well known brand name that  I currently have on my cv. I'll get paid more staying here, (couple of £ks) more but the other company has better personal benefits.

I guess what i'm looking for is whether is better to take a smaller company (not a start up, they are a multi million turnaround company) or the huge investment bank?

2b18cg,6,2014-07-18,The Campus Gardens Project,LMSamara,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2b18cg/the_campus_gardens_project/,"It all started with a patch of grass.  That's all it was – a circular dried patch of dried grass that drew my attention one late afternoon in early July.

But to back up from there, I've been around reddit for a while.  Some of the stories and lives people have shared here are downright tragic.  I never once thought I would have to contribute something to a place that would actually listen to me, however, and wouldn't just think I'm babbling crazy.

This month in particular has been a harsh one, with personal issues and relationship problems across every board I'm playing on, so I threw myself into my practicum work for my degree. I decided to strike out into bold waters, and instead of getting an internship or TAing for a class, I would volunteer up at my campus gardens and run a blog about it throughout the summer. Things were rocky at first, given how run-down and underfunded the whole program is, and how the director, Michelle Harsh, recently quit so there's a power vacuum, but I ended up just clearing a plot of land for myself and running my own personal garden. It wasn't what my intentions were at first, but it's what I had to work with.  Better yet, I had no one to report to except myself, and I had thrown the metaphorical direction manual out just like I had when suggesting the practicum.

Brave little pioneer in a new world.  Anyways, I have *such* tendency to ramble, so I digress.

The garden plots are located just a mile away from the main campus, but given how they're in an overgrown, neglected meadow with a dirt road leading to the greenhouse, and that it rains mostly everyday here, I opt to drive.

And so here we begin, with a patch of dried grass.

It was still overcast from the rolling thunderstorms in the area, but I risked the rain since it would be cooler outside without the blazing sun on my back.  The routine was an easy one. I locked the car, pocketed my keys, and walked through the mid-shin grass around the length of the greenhouse till I reached the end where the young plants were stored.  Outside in this area were several metal tables, racks, sinks, and tools.  The plants here were free for anyone who owned a plot to take.  I had already rescued what I could, nearly half and either potted them or put them in my plot. Everything left would most likely die, since no one but me appeared to be watering them or putting them upright after a heavy storm passed through.

I wheeled out the only working wagon left, and entered into the greenhouse to get the standard tools: rake, shovel, hoe, and gloves.  I had already entered the building on several occasions, and it was always the same as when I had left it.  Truly, no one ever came out here unless one of the RAs brought a group of students out for volunteer work.  Even then, I always tagged along, hopeful to snag a few quotes or interviews for the blog.

So of course I noticed the open door leading into the actual part of the greenhouse.  The thing is, that area was out of bounds for students this year, since a Bio professor was doing an experiment in there this summer.  And before you jump to conclusions, relax.  It's just testing which watering methods work best with which grapevine species.

The tools were hanging on the far side of the wall, running perpendicular to the open door, so I could look over and see inside.  I froze and hung the hoe back up, venturing into the main area.

Every single vine was dead.  And there had been a lot of vibrant vines in here last time I checked, about fifteen in every row, and there were six of those.

""Shit,"" I muttered, taking one leaf between my forefinger and thumb as gingerly as I could, only to have the whole thing fall apart.  ""Oh damn, that's not good.""  A quick look around told me nothing seemed amiss, and the doors in the greenhouse itself were all locked.  It's a greenhouse, I figure.  The water must have broken, and it's so damned hot in here, no wonder they fried.

I leave, close the door, and decide to email the director of Civic Engagement about it when I went home.  I resumed gathering up the tools and head outside to the plot.  The day resumed as usual with watering, weeding, and taking pictures for growth comparison.

It was as I was getting into my hot as hell car that it struck me as odd that the greenhouse was actually quite cooler inside than out.  There were fans running along the length of the building, so noisy they became white noise to the songs of the meadow birds.  The plants had been fine yesterday, to my knowledge, but I hadn't really checked, you know?  Maybe if the professor was keeping up to date on her project I wouldn't have to feel so guilty about having her vines die.

It was as I was pulling out that I saw, on the far end of the greenhouse and just beyond one of doors the tanned, brittle patch of circular grass.  Which, of course, I thought nothing eerie there whatsoever.  One of the vents must be positioned right there, which is part of the problem indoors.  Another thing to email the director about.

He never got back to me. He still hasn't gotten back to me about any of this. I stop by his office at the CCE and am told he just stepped out.  This would make me suspicious if I wasn't so freaked and simultaneously pissed.  Having worked alongside the CCE for my four years at this institution, no one ever answers a god damned email, not even when I really really need them to.

The plants outside, a few days later, were all dead, and those I *was* keeping a close eye on.  Racks full of young pepper, tomato, and broccoli plants were dried to husks.  The basil, thyme, lettuce, flowers – all of it was dead.  More than freaked, I felt upset, like I was a failure.  I had failed to keep the most simple things alive, and I actually cried at the amount of death for plants.  Sure, I felt silly about it, but this was like the outdoor center at Lowe's with the amount of plants I was keeping care of here, and for all of them to just die overnight?  Especially when it wasn't so hot out?  This area isn't going through a drought by any means, and we've already had several flash flood warnings from the major nearby river.

At least the plants in the garden plot were alive and kicking, and I took care of those for a few more days until I went home for the weekend.

When I came back to the greenhouse that following Monday, there was a heavy silence through the air.  The place was always filled with bird calls and bees, thunder threatening in the distance.  Now, when I cut the engine and radio and stepped outside, I could feel my muscles tense and teeth on edge before I really could understand why.

I was a little freaked at this point, jumping at the slightest brushes of grass, checking over my shoulder. I had been coming out here by myself for hours, every day for the past two months, and now, suddenly, I was afraid. The sky was darkened by the storm cell that had just passed through, giving the world that sickly grey-green wash of color.  The grass and weeds in the meadow loomed over my head now, though around the greenhouse it kept itself down to a manageable state. I could just see the crest of my school's chapel, which was the only indication that I wasn't alone for miles and miles, in wilderness.

In the greenhouse, the atmosphere was worse because of the *smell*.  It was dank, and musty, but also rotten.  The door was open again too, which freaked me out since it had been closed Friday night.  I tiptoed into the room, checking corners and expecting someone to jump out and grab me, a lame jump scare.  I picked up a hoe and held onto it as I entered into the greenhouse.

The lights had gone out and wouldn't turn back on, but that was fine since enough light was filtering in from outside still.  The professor had never gotten back to me either – the story of my summer life – about her dead plants, and the water system was apparently still broken.  I walked the length of the building, past the crumbling plants, to the now unlocked back door.  You can see the locks from far away.  They're like the size of egg timers, and when the nozzle is up, that means they're unlocked.

I could also see something black and distorted, just beyond the door, right in the middle of the patch.

I took a breath, or tried to as the smell was overpowering at that moment, and held my hoe like a little scared girl from the country would, and opened the door.  I screamed and jumped back, letting it swing back shut, and began to back away, checking nothing had heard me.

A dead cat.

I know, reddit, dead cats, not a good mix, but believe me.  It was a dead tabby cat, and it was gruesome, kind of dismantled, but not, like, eaten.  All the bits were *there*, just gone wrong somehow.  I only caught a glimpse of it really, but the smell was even worse now that I had wafted it in, and I was trying not to vomit as I made my way back to the grave of dead plants.  I still can't get the image of its face out of my mind.  Its lips were fully pulled back, almost like it was grinning, but the grin was too wide for a cat, like someone had ripped its skin fully off.  And its whole body was arranged at odd disjointed angles, right there in the middle of that patch.

Needless to say, I hurried through my watering, let the weeds have their pass for today, and didn't bother with an email.  Tuesday, I walked into the center for Civic Engagement and met with the student intern of the summer, the one who always covered for the director.

""Hey LMSamara,"" she said with a smile.  ""What can I help you with today?  Jay is out – Res Life meeting.""

""Yeah, I don't need him.  Hey, Becky, up at the gardens…have you been up there recently?  Anybody been up there recently?"" I asked.

She gave a petite frown, and looked away, continuing to do whatever work she had at her computer.  ""Sorry, a little busy. Give me a moment?""

""That's fine. I got time,"" I said, crossing my arms and leaning into the doorway.

A little pause drifted between us before she looked up and smiled.  ""No, I haven't. Why? Anything wrong?""

I shrugged.  ""The water in the greenhouse is broken.  All of Doctor Willard's stuff is dead.""

""Oh yeah, shame about that,"" Becky replied, looking shameful enough.  So someone had at least gotten my email and passed it along.  ""She hasn't gotten back to me either. But what else?"" she probed.

""There was a dead cat up there,"" I said.  I didn't mean to be blunt, but I was starting to panic.  ""And like, some weirdy type of stuff is happening…maybe,"" I continued, losing my resolve.

All I wanted to hear was- ""Oh? Poor thing.  Well, it might have been a fox.  We have a lot around here."" – exactly that.  A rational reason for those small little incidental occurrences happening up there.

I remember the feeling of buying into that secure notion.  It's a shaky, tender kind of peace that you buy with a lie, especially when it's a lie you've told yourself.  ""Yeah, that's possible.  All right, thanks! Just thought you should know,"" I said, attempting to leave out the door then.

Becky stood up a little bit to stop me.  ""You said something about other 'weird' things though?""

I hesitated, and the peace trembled.  Irrationality crept back in as I stepped back into the cramped office.  ""Dried grass outside, is all.  Like the plants.""

Becky frowned.  Ah, she really hadn't been up there in a while then, which I thought was funny given how she was the student in charge of it all.  ""Which plants?""

And so I explained to her the other little incidentals, alluding to the atmosphere and the mood up there some days.  In broad daylight, how a chill will creep down your spine at the same time the whole world there in the meadow stops and grows quiet, a hushed whisper.  How the greenhouse smelled a bit, and not the comforting earthy scents of soil, damp earth, and manure.  I didn't say these things like I do now, but when I was done, give or take three minutes to explain and tiptoe around what I really wanted to say, Becky had sat back down, her mouth drawn into a frown, and her brow furrowed.  She didn't interrupt this entire time, and I appreciated her for that.

""I'll stop by there tomorrow morning,"" she said with finality.  At that point, I wasn't sure if Becky believed me in the slightest, and I'm not sure I'll ever really know or not.

Because Becky went missing the next day, and I don't mean to be blunt or anything, but I'm the type of person prone to panic."
2b1dut,1,2014-07-18,Arduino radiation monitor robot - Advice?,wonderlove,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/2b1dut/arduino_radiation_monitor_robot_advice/,"Hi all

I'm currently taking part in an internship in which I've been asked to make a radiation-detecting robot using the [Arduino Robot](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Robot) (schematics on page).

I've found geiger counters online which are compatible with the Arduino Uno [here](http://www.cooking-hacks.com/documentation/tutorials/geiger-counter-arduino-radiation-sensor-board#schematic) (schematics included on page), but none which are directly compatible with the Arduino Robot. Firstly, does anyone know of any geiger counters that are compatible with it that I missed?

The issue is that this is my first experience of working with electronics and I'm not entirely sure where to start.
I have a few ideas of possible solutions, but how realistic they are, I'm not sure. They are:

* Use the geiger tube in an Arduino Uno and somehow get it to communicate wtih the Arduino Robot.
* Create a board to fit the Geiger counter into the Arduino Robot.
* Start from scratch and create a robot using an Arduino Uno and a chassis purchased online (not ideal, as the Robot has already been purchased for me and was preeeetty expensive).

I'm more than happy to learn new techniques in order to deal with the problem, however I have a limited time to do this project (6 weeks) and need someone to gauge how realistic these solutions are.

If anyone could share some experience or has any advice, it would be very much appreciated."

Car, gas, insurance = $750 a month total (Made a bad purchase on a new car, old car went dead at worst time)
Rent, cable, utilities = $620 monthly
loans + CC paydown = $350 monthly
Groceries = $200 monthly (i buy things i shouldnt because theyre so tasty...)

Health insurance, tax witholdings = $400 monthly


Now, if i end up taking the internship, ill be moving to another state and living with a sibling for the duration, which means rent and utilities will be covered by them, and my grocery budget should go down since i'd be contributing to a household budget. 

I'd be able to mangage the adjustment in expenses during my intership if i dropped my company health insurance for the duration, but i need to know if you guys think i should take the risk for this job, i feel i have the prowess for it, but there is a level of doubt and uncertainty with an intern position in my eyes."

I have been alerted to a security incident where a user was browsing via a Citrix server, and came into contact with sites that could potentially infect a machine with Zeus. All transactions to the site were permitted, and we fear that one of the swf/jar/exe files infected our Citrix server. Going to the site on a VM for Windows 7 via our automated software  yielded many malicious anomalies that are indicative of the Zeus infection. Two exe files, and a jar file were downloaded from the sites, and affected the VM. My question is whether or not our Citrix server can even be infected with Zeus. The Citrix server provides users with thin client apps rather that virtual desktops so would this type of infection be isolated? Can these files even infect our Citrix server? Thanks."
2b1j4m,4,2014-07-18,[Advice Wanted] I'm seriously second guessing my abilities. I'll be looking to enter the workforce in just a couple months. I'd really appreciate some insight.,crisis0fconfidence,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b1j4m/advice_wanted_im_seriously_second_guessing_my/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm a CS student that will be graduating this year. Throughout school I've done fairly well for myself. I will have around a 3.5 cumulative and I'm wrapping up my second internship right now. My first internship was a normal three month over the summer gig, and I learned more there than at any time in school. It really helped me gain confidence as a developer and look forward to getting a real job.

My second internship has been much less productive. I was taken on as a web dev with zero experience in web. The problem is that the office is much smaller than my previous internship experience, and as such there wasn't nearly the same kind of infrastructure aimed towards making sure the interns were educated and could contribute alongside full time devs. I fell behind, got embarrassed, and feel like I've learned nothing. 

Now I have this, what I feel to be, black mark on my resume. I don't have the skills in web that would correlate to the amount of time I spent at this company. I have learned a whole lot about the business processes behind designing and implementing production level software, but not the nitty gritty of creating web apps.

The jobs I'm looking at will almost all be web dev. They will be with bigger companies who are focused on making sure their new grads are learning. Rationally I feel like I shouldn't be so down on myself, but I can't help it. I am almost completely useless at this, and I hate myself for taking this position. 

How should I approach these next few months to get over this hurdle? Should I be brutally honest with companies that I apply to? How can I get past feeling like a failure because of this internship? I know I can't be the only one to have gone through an experience like this or felt similarly to how I do now. I really need some advice to help get me back on track because right now I feel completely inadequate for the jobs that I want to earn.

Sorry if my English isn't perfect, as I am Danish:

(request at bottom - note that it is not about money, charity or receiving free services at all! Hope you will take your time to read my post)

The female teacher firstly accused the Danish intern of having touched 13 kids on their crotches, made them touch his penis etc. The school at which he worked then investigated the claims by, among other things, filming him with the children without him knowing it. Finding no evidence at all, and in generel trusting him because of him having shown no prior suspicious behavior, the ""case"" was dropped.

The female teacher was fired, because she has been filing several complaints about co-workers in the past which turned out to be lies and straight op harrasment.
After she got fired she herself turned him in to the police - most likely because she was angry about how things turned out. After she turned him in she went on ""vaccation"" in Greece and has not been reachable since.
He is now being dragged through painfull and expensive trials and is very confused and scared about the situation. The police have among other things not fulfilled their obligations by for example telling him about his rights to an attorney. He has made bail for a huge amount of money but is still awaiting further development in the case. He has an electronic tagging lock on his ancle and cannot leave Manhattan.

The false claims of ONE woman, against internal investigations, all other staff members only having positive to say about him, as do all the parents who know him.

And now for the small request: If you can see the madness in this case, he needs help: No money, no charity (we have started a charity fond here back home, but I won't ask Reddit for that): He has no place to live, as he got kicked out of his former appartment and cannot leave Manhattan due to a restriction order the judge set. Is there anyone who knows a place where he can get a place to stay? NOT FOR FREE or anything, just a connection to a place he and his two mothers can rent and stay while the case goes on, as they are not well known in Manhattan.

I look approvingly at the cute but dressy skirt and blouse you had picked out. You wobble a bit on the kitten heels, still a bit unsteady. You smile ""This is going to be so much fun daddy!""

Finishing my coffee, you grab my briefcase and head to the door as I follow. We pull out of the driveway, heading towards to the freeway. ""This feel on a great day honey. Daddy has a meeting this morning at a big client's office downtown. This sale could make our year and top my bonus from last year. In fact, if I make this one we're going to Cancun for Christmas."" I watch as your eyes light up, excited at the possibility of a paradise Christmas. 

We continue the commute, pulling into the garage right on time. I lead you inside, up to the top floor and the executive hallway. We're buzzed into the conference room and offered coffee. You take a coke and sip nervously as your eyes go wide with the lavish surroundings. 

My client, Mr. Williams, walks in and greets me briskly before I have a chance to introduce you. ""Look Dan, I won't bullshit you. You aren't getting the contract. The other offer was too damn good and came under your bid."" I'm about the protest when he raises a hand. ""Spare me...we looked over everything. I'm getting ready to announce tomorrow. However my mind might be changed with the right offer."" For the first time I notice the way he keeps looking at you, hungry and lustful. 

""This is some airhead intern from your firm right? I'm sure she expected to suck a few dicks to climb the ladder. Let me have her for the day and I'll find a reason to convince them we go with you. Give her a promotion and a slice of that bonus for her troubles.""

2b1wka,46,2014-07-18,"I would probably be married right now, but I said ""no""",-tutu-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2b1wka/i_would_probably_be_married_right_now_but_i_said/,"Almost one year ago today the love of my life asked me to marry him. And, almost one year ago today, I said no. It was the most difficult decision of my life. He was absolutely everything I'd ever wanted. I'm pretty sure it was love at first sight, as cliché and naive as that still sounds.

Over three years and we had maybe two serious arguments despite all the crap we faced from society and our families. One year into the relationship, he asked if I would go that summer to meet his parents in South Africa. I had been to South Africa before and the experience wasn't pleasant, but I took the chance. Surprisingly, with the exceptions of a few disapproving relatives, it went well. Another year later, I took him to Israel to meet my parents' family and that went surprisingly well, too. The next year, we went backpacking through South America for four months. Then, four days after we got back in August, he popped the question. It was sweet and romantic and everything a girl should want. But, suddenly everything came to a screeching halt and, despite how serious we were, I said ""no"".

Because I never wanted marriage. I never wanted the white-picket, cookie cutter life. I'm horrible with children--not a maternal bone in my body. My entire life I've spent traveling around with my parents. I never really knew much stability. I have dreams that I've worked for my entire life. I want to change the world. He wanted me to move to South Africa with him and start a new life. An actual, responsible, adult kind of life. He already had a well-paying job lined up and his own dreams of us in his head. I made my choice. I chose my dreams and desires over the man I (still) love more than anyone. And I thought I made the right decision. But, I still cried for two months straight afterwards. I picked up the phone time and time and time again getting ready to call and apologize and beg to have another chance. But I didn't. Every time he called or sent a text or email I would ignore it without reading. I felt cruel, but really it was just because I was afraid. His name was taboo for anyone who knew me. My little sister wouldn't even mention him and we talk about everything. Everything reminded me of him. I felt like I was in a soap opera or trapped in a sappy romance novel or country music song. So, I picked myself up by my boot straps, so to speak. I moved on (kind of) and eventually began to try to forget. I went on a few dates, had a few flings. But they all sucked because they weren't him. They weren't as cultured, attractive, kind, smart, or (insert adjective) as him. But I still tried to live the life I was used to in the same way as before. 

Finally, I found the courage to check on him. I learned he hadn't moved back to South Africa, after all. He'd moved to a nearby state instead. He emailed me four days ago and I actually opened it this time. I guess as the one year mark approaches, he's thinking more about what happened, too. He said he missed me and that we could work it out and that he forgave me. That I had jumped to conclusions and he would do anything to be together again. He asked me if I missed him and regretted it. Truth is I did and I do, but then at the same time I don't. I miss him, I love him, every time I think about him my chest hurts. But I can't be who he wants me to be. I can't be that girl with the husband and the stable life and the little kids running around a big house. And he wants that eventually. Living that life would be like dying a little bit inside each day for me. And that kills me because it means I can't really ever have him, doesn't it. I'm no good for him and I don't deserve him after what I've put him through.

So now, one year later, and I'm back to square one still crying my eyes out. Back into an even worse depression than I was in one year ago because I'm wondering what's my dysfunction that I can't say ""yes, I miss you, too"". ""Yes, I want you back"". ""Yes, we can make this work, somehow"". Why can't I want what every other girl my age seems to want? Why can't I be happy just with him? I'm stuck, once again, trying to make the same decision as one year ago and I'm way too young for this crap and my heart's been broken for almost a year now and it just sucks. Right now I'm leaning towards giving it a shot. Trying to make it work, but I'm terrified of what happens if it doesn't work and I end up like my parent/s or I can't be the person he wants me to be. Or he can't be the person I need him to be. I'm afraid of giving up my dreams and travel and being stuck in a suburban nightmare like all of my friends from college. I know I just need to talk hash this out with him, but I'm just afraid. And I've already avoided it for almost a year. And, really, I'm just a coward with no excuses and that kills me. There, I finally said it.

Edit: Wow I didn't expect all of this advice and support when I posted this. You guys are a truly terrific, caring community and I'm thankful for you taking the time to listen to my whining. I'm at work now (yes I Reddit at work but I intern at  museum so it gets boring and no one's around). I will read and respond to you all and add some more details when I get home that might explain why I freaked out a bit better. I've had a lot of time to think about this today. Thanks again guys! 

Edit2: Got back from the museum. Again, thank you guys for your input. Some of your comments brought genuine tears to my eyes because I needed to hear them. It's really helped me and has given me the courage to say all of this to him and have an honest conversation. The guy has waited close to a year and gave up a really great job in his home country on the *chance* that I might change my mind. And he does want to settle down eventually and I don't know that I ever will and I don't want to string him along. But,  you guys are right, he deserves to make that decision to be with me given that fact himself. I owe it to him and myself to try. You guys are right. This originally started as an email reply to him, but then I was too scared to send it and changed the pronouns and posted it here instead to get feedback/encouragement. And you guys are giving me that. 

***UPDATE***: As promised, I called him today, after all of your advice and support, and we're going to try to work this out. We talked for about three hours on the phone before Skyping. It felt damn good to see his face, too. I apologized for what I did and how I ran and he said that he always knew I'd come back in the end, anyway and that's why he didn't take the job in South Africa (which actually didn't insult me which was odd). I also sent him the link to this post so he saw how I was feeling. I jumped to conclusions about what he wants and what he was expecting when he proposed based on previous conversations. He wasn't expecting me to settle down soon and he's okay if I might never want children (apparently, he's not as dead set on them as I thought). He understands where I'm coming from and why I don't want that kind of life. I should have given him more credit. It's going to be more difficult from here. As I said, I'm heading for grad school that's farther away so it's going to be long distance from now on. But it's only two years. We're going to take it slow and see where we are and how it goes before jumping head first again. So I'm cautiously optimistic about the future and I'm hoping that, in the end, it works out. And if not, at least I won't look back with regret and say that I didn't at least *try*. Thank you guys again for your support and encouragement!! "

In intervening time she got married, had two kids, and divorced. We ended up reconnecting a few years later and becoming involved, even though we live in different cities (3 hr drive) and I have somewhat of a fear of LDRs, having had one before that went to shit.


I'm not really a kid person (vasectomy), inherently, and that has been a constant point of stress in our relationship. I've been hanging out with the kids and trying to think of cool stuff to do that we have in common (catch, minecraft, books, etc) but I'll be the first to admit that they stress me out sometimes. I think the only times me and the boy really communicate well are when we're both engaged in the same task. We talk best throwing the football around and just...talking. I kinda figured that everyone is annoyed by kids sometimes, because they're inherently annoying, so I'm not sure if I'm annoyed more than regular people or not.


After a year and a half-ish, we got the opportunity to live in her city for the summer and work an internship together. I have a house/mortgage in my home city and take care of my dad. I also have two dogs. I had a steady job (that I didn't like, but was steady and was flexible about allowing me to go to school for my masters). I quit the job and moved in with her for the summer with the intent of getting closer to the kids and ""trying on"" the whole playing house thing.


Before we got together, she would get upset and be...cold (?) to me on the phone. Always very short and...formal (?). She told me that she cried alot on birth control and that it made her have mood swings so I tried to write it off as that, even though I feared that this was maybe something I should be more worried about. I got the vasectomy a few months ago and she got off BC.


We moved in together and I immediately noticed the same. Some days she would just get distant. I'd put my hand on her leg in the car and she wouldn't put hers on top. Little things. I asked her 5-10 times over the first 3ish weeks if everything was ok and if there was anything we should talk about...always said things were cool. She admitted that the internship stressed her out and I attributed a lot of the friction between us as her bringing work home and me being too sensitive in thinking it was about me. I was stressed too. I worried that asking her over and over would make her feel forced to justify her feelings to me. I didn't want to punish her for having an introverted day.


Our schedule was very demanding. We got up at 6ish in the morning, went to the gym, got to work by 9, worked til 5, went to her parents to take care of the kids til they slept at 9:30ish, then back to her place to do...whatever...until sleep at 11. At home I'm used to hanging out with friends and watching movies after work. Playing with my dogs. Gardening. Working on motorcycles. Just lopping around...after a few weeks it started to get to me that I couldn't really have ""me"" time unless I traded sleep time for it, which ran me down and made me irritable. I told her I wanted to start skipping the gym because the whole thing was stressing me out. She agreed and said we should take separate cars to work, too, so that I could opt out of hanging out at her parents every now and again if I wanted. I said ok, and decided that I would not use more than 1 day / week to screw off. I asked if that seemed ok and she told me it was ""as long as you feel that you're getting a good idea of what it will be like to live together."" I said it would, and that I wanted to use some of my time to reconnect with old friends and such (I went to college here, 6 years ago). She said ok.


Every time I didn't go to her parents or took too long coming home from my home town after a weekend back, she would be cold to me. I'd ask why and it was always ""nothing.""


Finally I asked her again last week on lunch break and her response was that she ""figured we were breaking up at the end of the summer and she was pulling back from me."" This upset me. I left my job, my friends, my dogs, my dad, everything and I'm trying to get along with the kids and develop a relationship...and she's checked out. I'm in it alone. This was hard before, but I felt that she had my back and with her behind me I figured I could make it through anything. But she wasn't.


I told her that I felt like this was because I was taking time off from her parents place, because she was always cold afterwards. She said it had nothing to do with it and not to ""play the victim."" I was offended and told her I didn't want to talk about it anymore right then and would like to return to work.


We fought more that night. She said that the pulling away was involuntary because she was depressed. That it was something we needed to talk about, not something she was going to do. I told her that if that was the case, we would have spoken two weeks ago. I feel like she would have left me feeling confused and inadequate for the remainder of the summer if I hadn't brought it up. That she'd left me in her head and just not told me, because that part is hard. I felt like every time she was upset and wanted to talk I put my own pride aside and tried to make her feel better, even if it meant admitting I was a dumbass (she accused me of giving her herpes one time. I don't have herpes. Neither does she. I offered to get tested anyway if she would feel better about it. She realized she'd nicked herself with a razor. I feel like I should have been more pissed at someone saying that I knowingly transmitted an STD to them in a LTR.) I think she wanted me to drop my ""issue"" and reassure her, but I wasn't willing to. I wanted her to at least admit that being cold to me was a problem and that it shouldn't continue before I did anything on my side. She responded that ""maybe that's just the way she treats things."" This wasn't encouraging to me.


We agreed we needed to communicate better and called it a night.


The next morning was more of the same until I realized we were about ot be late to work. I told her I was going in, and she texted me on the way saying that we ""needed to take a break.""


I told her that was fine, I would get my things that night and leave her key wherever she wanted. I edited my FB to single and untagged myself from our pictures together (only 3-4. They were on my front page and I didn't want to have to stare at us being happy together every time I went on fb chat. I didnt even delete them, just untagged.). She stormed into my cube, demanded her keys back (though she would ""walk me through to get my things"") and talked shit about me loud enough for my cube-neighbors to hear. I got my things and left. I had already packed them the night before and I didn't want to fight anymore...I just picked them up and shut the door. I felt completely gutted. I've been living in my truck since, with a month left on this internship.


She claims I broke up with her on FB. I think she broke up with me via txt and I acknowledged it on FB.


She acts like this is all out of the blue and I'm a bastard. I think she can't be surprised if she was ""breaking up with me in her head"" for 2 weeks.


She called me ""predatory...well...but...not as much towards me"" I asked what she meant and she told me she ""um, uh, couldn't think of a word."" I think she couldn't think of a word that makes that not hurt.


She's blocked me on everything and treats me like a thief. I actually left her some of my stuff when I left because it was stuff I figured she'd need, having lived with her for a little bit.

I don't really empathize well with people. Crying confuses me. I want to help but I never really know how. When I'm put on the spot I feel like I get...stony...to hide how off-balance and confused I am. I'm afraid it makes me look like I don't give a shit.


I don't know what I'm looking for here, but I genuinely love(d) her and it sucks that she thinks / is likely telling everyone else that I'm a piece of shit. I guess it doesn't matter, ultimately, but it bums me out. It was all sudden from my POV, and I might have even been willing to talk it through and try to work it out but I don't want to be with someone who thinks of me that way. And if I'm not the ""right"" guy for her kids, I feel like that is her choice and hers alone and that I shouldn't intrude more into their lives just to disappear.


I guess I just wanted to write it all out to straighten it out in my head, and open myself to different points of view. I'm not good in relationships, and I can be kind of a piece of shit without meaning to be. 


I worry I was awful to her.

   
**tl;dr**: Moved to same city as GF in LDR to be with her and the kids. Immediate strain leads us to break up after 5ish weeks. Unsure of who even broke up with who and if I acted inappropriately. Am I a bastard?"

You pushed yourself back into my life 6 months after I finally had the courage to walk away from the emotionally abusive relationship we were in. It took a long time to build that courage back up after you repeatedly beat me down. After forcing yourself back into my life you had everyone in my family trying to get me to take you back. I eventually broke down and did. You then convinced me to move in with you and your mom. An idea I was completely against from the beginning. I loved you though and I agreed after you told me on several occasions that your mom was completely okay with it. Then as I am moving stuff in I find out it was all a lie. You never talked to your mom at all. Despite this your mom gave in and I forgave your lying. I spent 8 months living in that house and the entire time I felt as if I was a burden an not welcome. Do you have any idea what it is like to feel like you are not welcome at the place you live. Just so you know it was incredibly depressing. 

Now I am not going to sit here and act like I am perfect and that I did nothing wrong. I was stressed and lashed out too often. I yelled and screamed and, although you knew I would never touch you, I made you afraid of me. I take full responsibility for this and I have taken steps to manage stress and my anger in a more reasonable way. I am also not going to sit here and say it was easy because it wasn't. I am still lonely at times and when I see a pic of you that is from someone else's feed on facebook I immediately block it because I do still miss at least the idea of you.  

Despite all the things you put me through during the 5 total years that we were together I was never going to break up with you again. I would have gone through life miserable with you. Because of this I thank you for having the strength to do what I was not able to. It has only been 3 months since you came home from vacation and shocked me with the news that you didn't want to be with me and I have accomplished so much.

You see I don't believe things happen for a reason and in fact I truly hate it when people say it. Nothing ever happens for a reason. Shit just happens and the way you deal with it and learn from it is what makes a person successful and whole. 

Since that night I have taken steps to be more mindful of my stress levels which allows me to be more mindful of my anger and judge whether or not the way I want to initially respond is appropriate. I also am now in the best shape of my life. I exercised daily before but I now control what I eat more along with having a more focused exercise regiment and I couldn't be happier with the results. This has also apparently me quite the eligible bachelor (at least that is what my female coworkers have told me). Unfortunately I don't have time or think I completely ready for a relationship so that is for down the road. I have also gone back to school to get a second bachelors degree and while doing so I have earned an internship that has already opened doors. In fact I have impressed so many people that my unpaid internship has quickly become a paid position. By this time next year when I am graduated and getting ready to attend grad school I will be done working in kitchens and done scraping by financially. I will have a career finally and this idea makes me happier than I have ever imagined. All of this happened because you basically left me with a sink or swim scenario and luckily the only thing I know how to do is swim. It is the best and most important lesson my mom ever taught me. Now I can finally see the shore and when I get out I will be stronger and better of than I ever was before. 

So again thank you for having the courage to do what I couldn't."

In my case, I interviewed as a sophomore a few months ago, and will be working as a junior next Winter/Spring. 

Everyone I know that got a similar or the same timeframe internship as me will be graduating a few months after they complete the internship. In my situation to be specific, I will be interning in the beginning of 2015 but won't graduate until May 2016. 

I'm mainly wondering why the firm offered me an internship if they could have found someone that would graduate and be ready to work for them sooner? I acknowledge that they hopefully liked me and that is part of the reason, but to be honest I feel I am just an average candidate. So are there any other noteworthy reasons why a firm may take an intern 2 years out? It is one of the biggest offices for the firm if that is worth mentioning.

Also, let's say my internship ends in April. Assuming I do a good job, when would an offer be extended? I feel this would be a bit of a tough situation because although I am 80% sure I want to go Big 4, I still would like to experience an industry position since I will have time to do an internship for Summer 2015 (before I begin my senior year).

2b2ich,2,2014-07-18,How do I talk to mom about marriage? (Complicated situation; very very long story; tldr at top and bottom),VanSticks,Hijabis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/2b2ich/how_do_i_talk_to_mom_about_marriage_complicated/,"Assalamualeikum, 

**&lt;tl;dr&gt;**

Wanted to move out or get married for almost 4 years. Moving out is out of the question for mom, and she says it's up to God to decide when the right time is for me to get married, but... 

- I'm not allowed to have any contact with guys, ergo it would be technically impossible for me to meet someone on my own. 

- and when God wills other parents to ask mom about me, I never hear about it...? 

Aside from her strange reasoning as to how/when I'm supposed to get married, I also have to figure out how to convince/explain to her that I don't want to get married immediately, but want time to get to know the guy. 
We haven't talked about it yet, because she ignores it when it's brought up, and I don't know how. 

**&lt;/tl;dr&gt;**

.

***Let me start off with some background info:*** 

*I am I 22 year old girl/woman, born and raised in The Netherlands. My father is from South America, but grew up here; and my mother is from a small town in Pakistan and came here a couple of years after they got married (which was at 19 if I remember correctly). Dad was a friend of her brother's, saw her once or twice, and asked her parents for her hand in marriage. Nearly immediately after she moved here, dad became chronically mentally ill. Can you imagine? A culture shock like that, not speaking the local language, suddenly being in a whole new family that you don't really know at all, and a couple of years later also having to be a single mom to my brother (two years older) and me (because dad was/is incapable of parenting, not cause he passed away or because they divoced; they're still together in fact).*


*So the home situation for me has never been conventional, and on top of that, the relationship with my mother has never been great. Next to her being very traditional, conservative, strict and overprotective, and me having been very independent and on my own from a very young age, quite the tomboy, growing up in a completely different culture than her, and being far more open (minded) about things, we're both afflicted with depression.* 

*Also, she basically wants me to stay home unless it's for school. If I want to hang out with friends, she'd rather they come to the house; going to cultural events (I'm really into poetry/spoken word, and write and perform as well) she doesn't like me doing either. Almost everytime I do, especially in the evening (even if it's around the corner), there's a big lecture and discussion and regular screaming and drama. She still tells me to come straight home after college or work (sometimes she criticizes me working as well; like I'm doing it for fun...?), and basically perceives anything that's not Islam, housework or school (though even school sometimes; internships, and extracurricular/fun parts) to be unnecessary and just an excuse to make my life one big, fun game (her words).* 

*On the other hand, I do know I can be very messy and I ám very lazy when it comes to house work/chores. I also can't cook very well yet, even though she's been trying to teach me since I was in single digits, but I've been learning since I started teaching myself about a year or ago, by finding my own recipes, foods and dishes I like or would like to try etc..*

*Also, my dad was the youngest of a very large family. So my bro and I are pretty much the youngest of our family's generation. Almost all of my cousins are at least 10 years older than us and already married and with (mostly young) children.*

.

Since I've been about 19, I've felt really ready to start my own life. Either by moving out, or by being in a serious (romantic) relationship. To my mother, neither seem to be valid options. About a year ago, I talked to her about moving out (the first serious/real coversation we probably ever had). I prepared myself for so long, thinking of reasonable deals we might agree upon (like me coming over once a week at least etc.), writing down arguments, practicing staying calm for the discussion. I got to say everything, stayed calm and didn't walk away, but she wouldn't have any of it. Not even a little bit of give; everything I said was shot down. 


Now, I can understand how from an islamic/conservative point of view why she wouldn't want me to move out. But when it comes to guys/marriage, she seems completely warped. She's always forbade any contact with guys, getting only a little more lenient when she saw it was inevitable here, making it ""it's only allowed when you absolutely have to"", but meeting or talking after school/work, even just having them as friends/contacts online she doesn't like. Obviously guy friends, or boyfriends have been completely out of the question. Although I don't agree with the bigger part of this, I can still understand where she's coming from. I do have a lot of guy friends though, cause I simply connect with them more easily. 

And I have had a few boyfriends, but with the exception of one guy that I was (am?) truly in love with, I've always been the one to break it off. Reasons being 

1) I absolutely hated having to lie to my mom and sneak around, and I could never stand that. 

2) it just never felt right, because they simply weren't the right person/match for me (personality/interests wise), 

3) they were never Muslims and that bothered me, cause I couldn't talk or connect with them on that level (which is definitely an important thing to have learned!) 


.
Guys/marriage in general is a very touchy subject with her. Whenever it comes up, or when I bring it up, she literally ignores it. She just stops talking, looks the other way, or just answers it by talking about something else, as if she didn't hear me. Only a few times I've been able to get some short answers out of her. 
&gt; Me: ""How do you see me getting married?""

&gt; Mom: ""How do you mean?"" (somewhat suspicious) 

&gt; Me: ""Well, for example X (a person my mom is surprisingly non critical about) met MyCousin on her own and they were together for about five years before they got married and-...""

&gt; Mom: ""What and you think that's okay?!"" (defensive and angrily) ""That is not our (the islamic) way!""

&gt; Me: ""No, no! It's just an example. So, how do you see me getting married then?""

&gt; Mom: ""When the time is right I'll look for someone for you. Maybe with the help of your aunt. I'll visit the guy's parents and we will discuss it.""

&gt; Me: ""So... when will the time be right?""
And then she ignored it and wouldn't talk about it anymore. 

.
A different time with my engaged niece present. 
&gt; Me: ""When do you think I'm going to get married?""

&gt; Mom: ""Not for a long time, haha."" 

&gt; Me: ""... But by what age do you think I'd be married?""

&gt; Mom: ""25 tops? After that your chances to find someone will only get smaller.""


.
Then my niece got married last September. We've always been close, seeing each other on for some years and then not for a couple of years. She's younger than me. She got married a month before she turned 20, at which point I was a few months short of being 22. Since then my entire family has been asking me about marriage. Even my close cousins (three brothers), that have always been reasonably modern about these things (like finding early 20s a little early to marry, especially in the culture and country we live in) seriously asked me about it. And not in a way that suggested they were interested in me, because we are like siblings, and they are all at least ten years older than me. At the wedding, one of my cousins (girl) even already tried to play matchmaker! (And not jokingly, although she was having a lot of fun with it.) 
After the weekend of the wedding I tried hinting at my mom about marriage.
&gt; Me: ""Sooooo.... everybody's been asking me when I'm getting married, haha...""

&gt; Mom: (doesn't say anything) 

&gt; Me: ""... So... when?""

&gt; Mom: ""Not yet.""

&gt; Me: ""Yeah, okay, but when will I?""

&gt; Mom: ""When the time is right.""

&gt; Me: ""And when is that?"" (Getting somewhat annoyed)

&gt; Mom: ""When God wills it./That's in God's hands.""

&gt; Me: ... (kindof pissed, I walked away)

.
Obviously I can't get married if Allah doesn't will it. But what angered me was that she's also been holding things back from me. You see, in our culture (and probably many other cultures as well), it's normal for mothers to ask each other about their children and whether they are single and ready to mingle/marry. And I had wondered a few times whether or not people had asked about me, because I never heard anything about it. Turns out that plenty of people had approached my mom asking about me but she never told me and just turned them down. My brother told me this after mom told him when she was yelling at him because she found out he had a secret girlfriend (that she wanted him to either dump or marry right away. And when she found out she wasn't a Sunni Muslim like us, she insistead he break it off). 

.
So, it's up to God to decide when the right time is for me to get married, but... 

- I can't have any contact with guys, ergo it would be technically impossible for me to meet someone on my own. 

- and when God wills people to ask for me, I am never to hear about it...? 


I haven't spoken to her about this yet, because I don't know how... And aside from her strange reasoning as to how/when I'm supposed to get married, I also have to figure out how to explain to her that I don't want to get married immediately. I don't want to marry a stranger; I want at least 6 months to a year to get to know the guy, to find out if we're compatible and have a similar stance on things, to have a chance to break it off before we make a tremendous mistake. Considering none of my ex-boyfriends even really lasted half a year, that time should be plenty to find out. And I'm absolutely willing to 'date' with supervision, that's fine with me, as long as I get to talk privately with him too (albeit online/digitally). Because I really only want that time to get to know the person, not to get physical. Suervision would even be welcomed, since I'm finding it harder and harder not to succumb to my physical urges (and trust me, despite my mom's chokehold, there have been opportunities and occasions I wanted to give in). :( 


**&lt;tl;dr&gt;**

Wanted to move out or get married for almost 4 years. Moving out is out of the question for mom, and she says it's up to God to decide when the right time is for me to get married, but...

So I'm going to be a senior in college next year studying Computer and Information Technology and I have an internship right now doing some Business Analysis work and some other random IT stuff but I'm not really sure it's for me. I didn't do a Computer Science major because programming all day is not really something I enjoy (I do enjoy programming I just wouldn't want to be programming in front of a computer all day), however I think finding and searching for bugs seems like something that I would like. I have never done any QA before so I don't know where exactly a good spot to start is. I'm sure there are popular tools out there that people use but I'm not sure if jumping straight into a tool is something that I should do.

Any suggestions or tips as to where to begin? Is QA something I should avoid if I'm not a great developer?

Also is being a QA a job that someone does for a career or is it usually something someone starts at to get them into a software dev. job?"

Basically, I have a B.A. in English and an M.S. in Public Relations. I am dissatisfied with my education, direction in life, and career options (being a professional liar in marketing). I feel like I didn't push myself enough in college, and I am running out of time to just ""self-study"" my way into the field.

I have no debt and inherited a bit of money from my grandmother (not a ton, but enough for more education). I have already decided that I am going to get another degree and don't want to be talked out of this...I am going for it as a long-term investment. Maybe a related degree doesn't matter now, but what about 10-20 years from now when the world and economy is more tech driven? I feel like this is one of the best possible ways I can actually invest my grandmother's money. It is also in part a personal quest for me, since I am not proud of my degrees at all, and would like at least one that isn't completely eye-roll inducing.

For $11k I can get a 2nd B.S. in information technology from a good accredited state school, only 10 classes required. The interesting thing is that although it isn't a CS degree, I can do what is essentially a computer programming-track, where I take a data structures class, database class, java, C+, C, etc language classes, and networking technologies of my choosing. I don't have to take any additional non-related classes. This route just seems really practical and would get me off the ground to meet ""related degree"" requirements and catch me up in the skills.

I should mention that I do have html/css/javascript experience and do some of that stuff at my job, but it's just at a lower level and just from codecademy/other online learning resources. So I am not just considering programming on a whim. I feel like i've hit a wall with the online learning stuff.

I am also considering the master's in CS route, but it would be at least 2-3 times as much money and also would take more time as I do pre-reqs and can only do a few classes a semester. The classes also seem to not be exactly what I want: I just want to have a solid foundation in programming. I am worried that another master's will make me less desirable, as though I expect tons of money (I don't). I may still do this option, but I am looking to see if it's the only way.

**My biggest concern is how this will look to employers. Will they see a 2nd bachelor's sequentially after a Master's as a logical thing (like ok, this guy had a lib arts degree and then got some technical knowledge at the undergrad level). Or, will they think it's bizarre/weird/alienating that I would do undergrad classes after doing a grad degree?** I honestly don't care about the master's...I consider it a mistake I wish I could trade in for a worthwhile bachelor's.

My other idea is simply to **not include my past education on the resume and only include the IT degree**, but I am also not sure if this ""lying"" is a liability that could get me in trouble?

Yes, I plan to continue my self-study, do personal projects, quit my job and do some internships, and pick up certs etc, but I don't want to be limited to just that."

Each school can only have a few of its students apply and I was chosen. I have really high test scores and grades as well as extracurricular activities so I thought I had a good chance. As it turns out everyone from my school who applied got in except for me, even people who I'm pretty sure had worse grades/tests/recommendations etc. After that, I got rejected from all of the other internships and summer programs I applied for. This whole summer so far I've been moping around every day and my mind constantly turns to how I didn't get into anything and it instantly makes me feel really sad and gives me anxiety about college (I really want to get into a good school). I sleep until 11 or 12 noon everyday and then just do random shit like play computer games or watch basketball to keep my mind off of the summer programs and college stuff, but it always comes back.

My wife is pursuing her doctorate, and after a lot of hard work and time, she was able to get an internship this year. We had hoped to connect with a site that didn't require us to move, but, we ended up feeling lucky to get an internship at all once it was all said and done. It's extremely competitive out there. 

It was about 3 months before they told her exactly where the site would be, we knew would be one of two places in Missouri, we currently live in Arkansas. During this 3 months we find out we're pregnant, it was unplanned. The internship starts in early September, the baby is due in late November. The site is willing to work with her on maternity leave, no problem there. The problem is, I'm the breadwinner in the household. Having to quit my job and find a job in this specific place has been quite an undertaking. I've always moved from one job to the next, knowing well ahead of what I would be doing, this time, things are different. The goal is to find a job in x town...

Insurance is my biggest concern right now. I have decent coverage, our first child was born last year (planned), and it was something we were able to plan for and deal with. This pregnancy was unplanned, and now I'm debating whether I should stay here (we own our house here) while she moves 3 hours away with our son and we get together on the weekends until the baby is here, just short of 3 months of back and forth. Or, if I try to find a new job there, and pray that my insurance will be good, and cover her since her insurance thru the site will not be great, and we still don't know the full details of it. 

Anyway, if you've been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear how you handled this.

As the title states I am 24, male, living in California. I am currently a graduate student at a pretty prestigious, accredited university majoring in Aerospace Engineering.

I plan on graduating within a few months (hopefully, research is a lot of work) and I am bit worried about finding a job once I am finished. 

The back story to this all is that: This past quarter I applied to various summer internships/co-op positions with the hope of gaining experience, connections and being able to finally support myself (i.e start paying off my student loans). I applied to various of the big industry names : Northrop Grumman, Boeing, General Atomics etc.. And I received about 5 or 6 call backs/emails for jobs and internships for the summer. But to no avail , none of them have come through. My plan was to work and get an internship for the summer and come back during the fall to finish up my thesis. 

I tailor my resume to specific positions I feel and sometimes know I am qualified for. But, after a couple formal telephone interviews, followed by a couple technical phone/email interviews I have yet to hear back from anybody. I emailed back H.R. and hiring managers who contacted me , about possible updates and new information about the jobs, but have yet to be contacted (its been a couple week and is a little frustrating because I feel as though I have been left in the dark). The interviews via the phone and emailing went well and on a couple occasions was told by H.R that they were very very impressed by my resume and experience and would try to bypass and send my resume directly to Hiring managers etc. 

My questions are: What am I doing wrong? Is there any way to better my chances of being hired as an entry level engineer for positions I feel I am qualified for? How do I get H.R and Hiring Managers to get back to me (if at all possible).

I'm just a bit worried because I feel as though if I cant get an internship position for the summer, that I wont be able to get a permanent job once I graduate (which is scary for multiple reason). Any and all advice would be much appreciated and well taken. Thanks and much love. "

Wanted to share my paper I got an A on in my english class talking about what my experience was like with my Mental Illness.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2b2skk/30_years_old_and_back_in_university_wanted_to/,"**Surviving Where There Be Dragons**

*Learning to circumnavigate the turbulent oceans of Dysthymia, Bipolar type II, Anxiety Disorder, and Eating Disorders*

--

Sunlight enters in like clear white crystals through rustling curtains. It’s sterile and white in my eyes as they slowly opened, like long-closed cathedral doors. Hypersensitivity blinded my eyes as they fluttered to process the surroundings.  The room is only lit by the light coming through the window. To a normal person it would look dark and gloomy, but to me it was blinding and calming. My brain processed the surroundings, trying to understand the layout of the room I was in.  My first thoughts were not of where I was, but how to find a bathroom.  I stood up shaky, walking to what looked like a door, opening it to find a washroom.  I closed my eyes and flipped the switch.  I walked blindly, finding and sitting on the toilet.  A few moments passed and I stood. I opened my eyes and looked at the toilet bowl’s contents, black like gritty squid soaked mud.  I raised my brow and with a small bit of scientific knowledge, I said to myself, “Activated charcoal, well, I guess I’m not dead.”

Each person deals with stress and stressors overpowering differently to get to that point.  My story starts at a very young age.  My family is a dysfunctional one.  My father, a Notre Dame, Fighting Irish, trained lawyer, turned Senior Manager at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, came from a perfectly normal, large German / English Catholic family from Wisconsin.  His only issue is he says, “his inability to emotionally understand other people.” 

My mother came from an Irish-Polish family haunted by personal demons.  Her mother’s side of the family is Polish. They were Catholic survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto &amp; Nazi work camps from World War II. They also survived occupation and revolution that took part in Poland.  Her Polish grandparents moved here as refugees. Even though they were visited by such tragic tragedy they were still good people. 
But on my mother’s father's side, years of abuse were documented in their Irish family.  Stories in County Cork, Ireland are still told of my Great-Great-Great-Grandfather who was kicked out of his homeland for his cruelty. So my Grandfather was a product of years of hat kind of family. Sadly he gave in to bouts of depression, rage, paranoia, and narcism.  He abused his family physically and verbally, My grandfather had his family live in terror, controlling what they did like a despot. 
My mother, better than the last generation, tried to escape the curse. She was the first in her family to go to college she studied theater. She then went to London, England, and she studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. She acting with the likes of Sir John Gielgud, Sir Laurence Olivier, and many others whom we read about in textbooks to classic theatrecraft becoming a professional actress and drama professor.

But she, too, was tainted with what she called “a curse of the banshee” that hung around her and her Irish heritage. A cruel gift of chronic cycling depression, learning disabilities, and crippling self doubt turned inward, becoming cancerous and eventually malignant to the body and soul.  This is only the the framework of what lead me to and attempt to end my life.  I state this to remind people genetic factors beyond just nurture have ties to mental health medical conditions.  But like any genetic factor, a certain set of events must be set in motion to trigger it. Nurture brings on nature, expressing the genes that operate my body’s pharmacological chemical factory to release a neurochemical storm of serotonin that it can not reabsorb.

The first journey on the sea of chronic conditions started at an early age.  After having grand mal seizures at the ages of two and four years old, the formation of general anxiety disorder took root. But having a mother visited by mild mania to serious depression and switch on a dime moods can lead to traumatic experiences.  I had witnessed, in grand displays, my mother jump from the car into the middle of traffic when I was nine years old. I also witnessed her try to take down an entire bottle of heart medication when I was ten.  Captured young by these negative stimuli, it was the inception point in the expression of my genes for my own depressive disorder diagnosis at thirteen. But I had healthy coping skills and activities in martial arts and computers, and I found relaxing beauty in both.  I learned meditation, the philosophy, and history of each.  I read as much as I could and, up until my sophomore year of high school, was an honor student.
 
But a sudden and dark time in which false allegations of sexual abuse by my mother on my oldest sister broke my mother. It shattered my mother’s psyche. Her health was already in failing decline, my household was encased in darkness.  My only escape was video games, reading, and martial arts.  All of which would soon be taken away from me. 

My mother was found to have a brain condition that was the primary cause of all of her health issues. A random form of hydrocephalus, called Arnold–Chiari malformation, took her from being a professor of drama at university to a frail broken woman.  Even after my sister’s allegations were proven false, a confabulation of my sister’s soon diagnosed narcissistic borderline personality disorder  and bipolar disorder, my mother still couldn’t handle the emotional pain it had dealt to her fragile psyche. She was forever shattered both emotionally and physically.

I feel at the core that all my mom’s inner demons and inability to seek balance of extremes internalizing grief is what started the then following endless health conditions. Brain surgery, heart fibrillation, detached retina, ovarian cancer, complications due to brain surgery, and complications from medications for infections were the end results from years of internalizing grief, depression, anger, and fear. But at the time, being fifteen, I did not understand this, and slowly my grades dwindled, nothing I could do would make my mother happy.
 
During this time I had disappeared into my room.  In my mind there was no hope for me until I graduated high school. “It would be better when I graduate high school” became my mantra.  I will be able to go off to college.  I will succeed, I would say to myself in an almost shaking back and forth like a student in a madrasa. I became a shell of my once precocious self.
 
This is when the first of my healthy passions that kept me going was taken from me. My Sensei of nine years was hit by a car, breaking his back and His son also drowned in a pool at a party, breaking my Sensei's spirit. He was my only support it felt like and he left, it fractured our dojo leaving me without my secular temple.
 
My next loss was my ability to focus on reading.  Never fully diagnosed with the conditions, for fear it would put me in special education, I had trained myself how to bypass my dyslexia and dysgraphia. I hacked and pirated my way to learning how to use screen readers and text to speech software.  I was into ebooks before people even knew what they were. These technology skill sets were what lead my precocious self into learning computers and network security skills early. My years of growing up with a theater mom taught me how to social engineer people. These skilled offered me a chance of an internship with a major federal government security agency.  On my way to this internship my junior year of high school, in the middle of the day, I was hit by a drunk driver.  Three months later I was hit by another drunk driver midday. And less than two months after that yet another drunk driver collided into my car . While no bones were broken, no lacerations inflicted, the cars were all totaled and the stress induced from these three traumatic events caused chattering teeth and an inability to focus with stress induced migraines and panic attacks.

In my senior year of high school any bit of stress sent me in brain splitting agony.  I couldn’t exercise, work, or focus for long without grinding my teeth, which sent me into anguish that lasted for hours.  I nervously ate to fill my void. I had ballooned from 260 lbs to 520 lbs. by the time I graduated high school. The stress had taken its toll on my grades as well.  Gone was my 3.9 honors track GPA. I now had a 2.7 as my exit GPA. Without the GPA no school of measure would take me.  My parents didn’t even have the money anyway.  Seeing the crippling debt they amassed from sending my two sisters to my father’s law school alma mater, Notre Dame, I knew I never wanted that kind of debt.
  
So I was stuck at home.  We knew that my migraine issue was gonna happen anyway.  It was diagnosed that I had to have braces  and then a surgery to break and realign my jaw to fix my bite issue back when I was thirteen.  Having to wait till I was fully grown, I got braces at 19, mandatory with tightenings biweekly for two years till surgery.  So I started school at the local Community college.  But with panic attacks taking a tighter control of my life,  halfway through each semester, I would start to panic and drop my classes.  I fell deeper and deeper into a depressive vortex.  I would wake up in the middle of nights screaming, becoming even more edgy from the insomnia.
 
Braces as an adult are an eyesore,  but they never bothered me.  I enjoyed the pain of the tightening as it relieved me from the pain of the migraines.  But the surgery could not go forward, I was 520 lbs. and no doctor wanted to perform a rather invasive surgery like jaw breaking and realignment on me.  So I stopped going to school and dedicated myself to losing weight.  No longer suffering from the headaches, I began an unhealthy and dangerous workout regime.  At 800 calories a day, I followed a fad high fiber, zero sugars, zero carbohydrate, lean animal protein only diet.  From 4am to 2pm, five days a week, I would workout at a gym. Forty-five minutes of stretching.  Forty-five minutes of cardio.  Forty-five minute pilates class.  Forty-five minutes of three random muscle group on nautilus machines. Forty-five minute yoga class. One hour of using Free weights on three random muscle groups, never repeating the previous day’s patterns for 6 sets of 25 reps at low weight to build lean body muscle to eat the fat away. In the first 4 months alone I dropped down to 380 lbs from my 520 lbs.
 
I was able to get my first w-2 job in years since the dot com crash.  I was working at the Apple computer retail store as a genius.  The work was great, the high of working out kept me going.  From February 1st, 2004 to September 25th, 2004; the day I had my surgery, I went from 520 lbs. to 260 lbs. The emotions though I had of how people treated me when thinner and muscular was disturbing and unbearable.  I was use to people treating me like crap.  I had always had it because I had always been the bigger kid even though I was a year younger than most of my classmates.  I knew who you were when you looked at me.  If you were a good person I could see it in your eyes.  If you had disgust of me, I could see that too.  But now everyone was nice and shallow.  It made me fester with anger, I seethed at the vanity of people.
  
The doctor had said it would take six hours for the surgery. Even with my dense bones he said a special drill he ordered would make it go by fast.  The surgery took eighteen hours.  The doctor told me after the fact that my bones were so dense the drill was like using a plastic toy on concrete.  With the post surgery, I was no longer in the public eye as my job put me in the back room to work.  I became a homebody as the swelling came down. I only went out to go to the gym to do light workouts.  While on a diet of baby food and prescription meal replacement smoothies, I dropped an additional 60 lbs. I was down to 200 lbs by November 2004 when my wired shut jaw was finally unbound.

The rush of the holiday at my job was something I had never experienced, and I was not at all ready to handle it.  Our tiny Apple store in Annapolis, Maryland was rated for 198 person occupancy total.  The day before Christmas we had over 350 in the store.  The Fire Marshall and police were called to the mall as everyone fought for the iPod Video.  I was knocked over and trampled by the onslaught of materialism in action during this holiday mass service for the church of consumerism.
 
Being in a holiday post traumatic stress disorder inducing experience is a chaos of euphoric stimuli.  Movies and books depict this as if one is in a slow motion tranquil sequence in a battlefield.  It is in fact a defense mechanism, it shuts down the brain as the senses are overloaded.  People pushing and shoving and shouting becomes blissful silence as your brain shuts down processing the information. My mind’s eye went to a field of sunflowers with gentle wind blowing as people stomped on my head and shuffled kicks to my sides and back.

As you can guess these events in one year -- weight loss, the emotions of how people treated a thin shell of me, surgery, and this holiday shopping event were -- as I was told by a doctor, a perfect maelstrom of neurochemical perfect storm.  I lost all touch with emotion, developing a view of the world in ever growing visual darkness; part of the brain shuts down, actually dying from the depression and fear.  The world became black and white as choices were no longer shades of gray but a series of binary zeros and ones and with no choice that mattered.  I was soon let go by Apple with the HR manager saying, “ You just don’t look happy enough here anymore.”
 
I broke down into tears for the first time in front of her.  Never was I one to be moved by sad in movies or reading but now I couldn’t help crying. The new year started with the world becoming slower and darker as my own personal hell was setting in. I would break down at any decision I made and my parents knew something was wrong but they thought It was just a phase.  My mom would frequently say when I started having my panic attacks that she had dealt with the same thing so I should be able to put up with it.  But now I was having panic attacks all the time.  I felt like I was going to die.
 
After being “let go” from Apple, I could no longer trust my self. If I was asked by my mother if I wanted a ham or chicken sandwich, I would start chattering my teeth and begin crying. My parents found a psychiatrist, the first that I had seen since one had called my mother &amp; father toxic years before. 

Sadly he was no help as I cried in front of him. My parents were at a loss of what to do sitting with me. Elderly and from some old quackery phrenological school view of psychopharmacology, he prescribed me xanax and adderall, a dangerous combination.  It was stress and just a case of the blues, he said smiling.  Showing a yellow and dead-toothed smile as my parents handed him the copay.  And we were off and I was on barbiturates and amphetamines now, part of me knew this was not right.  But my own trust in my ability to make decisions was gone.
 
January went and February started for nearly three weeks without sleep. One night, under total exhaustion, I fell asleep in the middle of the day.  Toward 10 o’clock, my senses heightened from a fight or flight response in my sleep, I awoke in a psychotic break from the months of deepening depression, misdiagnosed medication, and lack of sleep. My sleeping brain misinterpreted a loud jovial conversation of my parents into a screaming argument. I came out of my room crying in a rage, screaming at my parents to stop fighting.  I grab a chair and broke it against the wall incensed with mindless panic.  My parents tried to hold me. I pushed my mom near the old stairs and she catches her foot on a nail.  I my brain ceases like overheated gears of an engine as i see the blood.  I scream in fear as everything in my brain comes grinding to a halt and I rush past my parents.  I run to my car and get in and drive off.  I scream as I drive for the rest of the evening screaming at my self to turn the wheel and go over an overpass or off a bridge.  But for whatever reason that night i couldn’t, it was like my body was is in autopilot and eventually around noon the next morning I came home.
 
“I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn't have to have any god damn stupid useless conversations with anybody.” A line from Catcher In the Rye kept playing over in my head.  I came home around 10am and my parents just were just glad to see me safe.  I went to my bedroom and called my oldest sister who was now back into the family since she had gone through a divorce. She let me come over to her apartment while she was at work.
 
In her place I spiraled again, screaming and crying and trying anything I could to stay sane.  My world was bleak and I felt like I wanted to tear my very face off when I looked in a mirror.  I hated myself.  I saw this ugly blob of a thing, when in fact one could see my ribs and pelvic bones from was so thin.  I couldn’t even sit on hard chairs because my hip bones had never become desensitized like most thin people is.
 
I hit myself over and over feeling some sense of life with the blows.  The only pleasure in the madness was the pain of life.  My sister came home seeing my self-inflicted bruises and trying to cheer me up took me out to indian food, something I loved that would normally put me in an ecstatic mood.  We sat down and ordered samosas and while slowly pulling it apart to dip in the mint chutney I cried. I knew then I needed to be hospitalized.

Sadly this first experience in the hospital was not a pleasant one in the least bit.  The hospital I went to put me in a locked room like that of a jail cell to observe me first.  “Cover your ass” I thought as they took my belt, shoes, and clothes while they hunted down for a mental health ward bed open at a local medical facility in the area with an open bed to send me too.  Sheppard Pratt Ellicott City was the only one.  Built as a home for permanent residential patient care, it was converted after President Reagan closed the long term mental health hospitals.  It was in an old steel and coal processing town of Maryland.  Like something out of a Stephen King novel, it looked and felt like facilities meant for the 60’s rather than modern medical care.
  
Little cottages dotted the facility as that was the village mentality it tried to have.  But the ward was now just the central building, also housed a school for children with severe emotional problems.  A great feeling was having to cross their side of the building when going to activities or to the cafeteria.  I felt like I was meat being eyed up by twelve year olds that scared me to the core.  While at Sheppard Pratt Ellicott City, raw sewage backed up in the pipes and the floors were covered for part of my stay. Vile and repugnant, I imagined this was the smell sanitariums of the Victorian and Napoleonic period. So I played the games and did the therapy groups session and got out as soon as possible.
 
I was transferred to the care of another Doctor and outpatient treatment at another hospital It was again more bad care.  The head nurse in the outpatient program, upon finding out I was Atheist made it her goal to convert me, saying finding Jesus would save my mental health.  I reported this to the other staff but none would do anything as she was the head nurse. The doctor I saw was no help either. Even though I saw him twice a month from March to August 2005, he couldn’t remember my name from Adam. Put on a cocktail of meds for the summer I was sleeping close to eighteen hours a day.  I couldn’t do this anymore so after three months I stopped. But psychosis from the depression long improperly treated was setting in again.  I felt my sanity slipping, losing touch in a dissociative state with other people, so I fixated on math and physics. I read anything I could find by Dr Richard Feynman, Archibald Wheeler. I started doing math workbooks, and stealing a whole bookcase of science and math books from Barnes and Noble. I read it all in manic fixation.
 
My inner voice rung out,  “you’re going crazy!”  If you can not trust your mind, what can you trust?  It was September 2005 and at this point I knew this life had to end. I had to end this life.  I could not live in a world where my faculties could not be trusted. So on September 25th at 12:38 pm I took a full bottle of extra strength 800 mg Ibuprofen, 250 mg of Xanax, and chased that down with 1/2 of a handle of Seagrams 7 whiskey.

I didn’t recall the events that followed. But my parents had called me down to dinner at 7:30 pm they told me. In some sure luck of the draw I was still animated, in a fugue state, but alive. I shuffled downstairs I was tolled. And while at the table I looked robotic and non-present. My parents knew something was wrong shortly after I started to eat corn chicklets; a monstrosity of nastiness I under even normal mental facilities can’t stand to even smell. My parents told me they said, “why are you eating corn?” Knowing my aversion to the vile grain. They told me I said it outright, “I took a bunch of pills and I will be dead soon.” Next a small struggle happened as I got up trying to go back to my room. My parents held me down as they called 911. As soon as the ambulance with firefighters came I was told I immediately became docile and agreeable.

In the Emergency Room they intubated me with no struggle. And pumped my stomach with activated charcoal to bond with any of the digesting pills in my system. My heart stopped I was told for 10 seconds during this night as the toxic and sedative nature of the cocktail was not fully caught by the charcoal. I was brought back with paddles I was told, but was in a comatose state. 

Two days later is where we come back to the beginning of this story. Waking up in Laurel Hospital Mental Health ward, the facility was very different. The staff were much more caring. The facility itself was far more inviting and friendly feeling with normal patients who just needed help managing their conditions. I was hospitalized with all high functioning people who were dealing with PTSD, Depression, Eating Disorders, and multiple people who had tried to commit suicide. Dr Merchant saved me. He gave me confidence again as when he would sit with me during our private sessions instilling back into me my faith in my intelligence. We talked about effects of white noise and binaural rhythm sound patterns to help produce delta wave sleep. The deep sleep, past REM, allows the body to repair itself and deep process all the information it had learned for the day. We talked about the DSM-III vs the DSM-IV and the still yet finalized DSM-V. These are the standard tool for all psychiatrists and psychologists to diagnosis the symptoms of mental health conditions.

The staff of Laurel hospital got me back into the world. They pushed me in positive ways to use my passions for education, technology, science, math, political, and community advocacy to volunteer and be a symbol that mental health issues are not mental illness. It is just a condition like any other physical condition that requires diligence and medication. The staff helped me chart the maps and plot my course. I finally found the smooth sailing that was needed to use the whirlpools and riptides of depression as boosters to help power my natural skills and talents.

I no longer sit idly, turning thoughts inward. I force myself to action to be out in the community and in the line of fire for people who have no voice. I let it be known the map of mental conditions is not a map to certain doom. It is in fact a map to treasure. Touched by fire from beyond the abyss, after climbing my way back I have knowledge, knowledge I will gladly share with you and others. Maybe I can give you insight you never had before.

Due to my graduation timing, I was able to secure a Risk Advisement Services internship before I started an Audit internship (with the same company). 
Everyone in this thread always seems really helpful, and since I'm not finding very good information, I was hoping some of you would be able to answer a few questions!

What is RAS?
How does this tie in with Auditing/Accounting?
Is there anything I can do to get a head start before I begin the internship (literature, excel formulas, etc.)?

2b2zfi,1,2014-07-18,What to learn next or improve on?,kevinvhengst,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2b2zfi/what_to_learn_next_or_improve_on/,"Right now I'm mostly working with html, css, javascript and php. But i want more. Obviously i could improve the things i know currently, but doing new things is also a lot of fun.

The problem is, in programming there is so much going on. Frameworks, language's and so on. And since im just programming for fun and my study, not for a company, there is no-one to tell me what to learn. When i did an internship at a company i was forced to work with php, which is fine. I get motivated to do so that way. 

I can teach myself quite well, but i want to learn to much at the same time. last two months i started with Java for android, Python (and even on Django), Node, a bit of Ruby. Everytime when i read something cool about a language or a framework i want to try it out. But as you can imagine, learning 6 different things at the same time isn't working at all, atleast not for me. 

The reason for me making this post is to ask some advice. As i said earlier in my post, when someone tells me to learn this or that, I can much easier focus on just that. So it might sound weird, but if a lot of people tell me something like: ""Learn Node, that is with great value"", gives me some ""power"" to get into it more serious without being distracted by all the other nice stuff the programming world has to offer.

I know it's a strange question/request, and that a lot is based on opinion, but maybe i few reply's with some valuable info would be awsome!

The only thing i know about myself right now is that I'm not that much into mobile yet. I preffer making web applications and such. Although i could get into html5 apps with my html, css and js skills. 

Hopefully my question is clear and not to weird, and hopefully i'll get a few helpful responses! 



Also if someone is a good mentor, and good time and willing to learn me anything valuable, I would happely accept those offers! I got a lot of dedication, just a bit of a struggle of knowing what i want! =)"

However, every job that has anything to do with actual statistical analysis (hypothesis testing, regression, experimental design, etc.) requires several years of experience, often 2-5 minimum, and/or a masters.

I have a basic understanding of SAS, R, and all of the popular point and click programs including Excel.  I am also in the process of learning SQL.  

I've been looking into digital/web analytics--which often requires certification and 2-3 years experience, basic market research positions--which are often applied to by every humanities and market research student within the next two cities over, customer insight positions that require extensive programming experience--which I'm trying to work on, etc.

I have as great a resume as one with a sociology major could have while considering gpa, extracurriculars, and some relevant work experience (officially worked for school as a statistics tutor, coordinator of research for a non-profit group, research methods tutor, etc.), but I haven't worked for a major corporation yet as a data analyst.

Do you have any advice on what fields in particular I should look into, or any tips as to how someone without years of corporate experience could acquire a job based on your history?  I've already completed one internship, but I may have to complete another just for some training if I can't find something.  Any resume boosting tips or project suggestions are welcome.

I plan to apply for a masters in statistics program next year once I take the GRE, but I need to find a related position before I start that project.

Thanks.

I went into my senior year of high school weighing 315lbs and decided to do something about it. In about 5 months, I lost 65 pounds and went into college a new man. But it's been a struggle ever since. I'd gain weight during the year (campus food) and then lose it during my summer internships. I figured once I graduated, this yo-yo would finally end. Wrong. I graduated and was forced to get two jobs to pay for my loans. I'd try to work out, but wouldn't get a full night's sleep.

But after years of working two jobs, I was finally able to drop to a single job. No excuses. But at the same time, I had no motivation to better myself and I had no fucking clue as to why. I ate like crap for months and didn't go to the gym. At first, I thought it was celebrating this new found liberation, but after a while I didn't know what was wrong. I couldn't motivate myself to go to the gym consistently...until I found this subreddit.

I don't know what motivates you guys to post, but I can tell you that seeing your progress...seeing some of you come from being just like me to something I dream of has got me going to the gym 6 days a week. It gets rough sometimes, but I'll visit this subreddit and automatically get motivated again. I haven't missed a day since I jumped back into the gym. I feel better about myself and I can't wait to be able to post my progress for you guys.

I know a lot of you are post for advice on how you can get bigger or leaner. Hell, some of you may just be posting for the karma. But keep posting. You give dudes like me motivation to be just like you. Thanks guys!"

Its mostly my own fault for not researching the test more beforehand and actually buying study materials and preparing for it but as a poor college student I could barely afford to eat so seeing the expensive prep courses made me not even consider it.  I went into it thinking it wouldn't be too difficult as it would be open book, I'm bad a memorizing but I've always been good at tests when the formulas are given.  Another factor was my school didn't prepare me for the test as parts of the test covered classes that my degree didn't even require.   I came out of the test pretty demoralized and after I got my results, I was pretty angry and ended up not even attempting to take it again.

My degree program also has the lowest rate of passing the test (65%) so that has also been a big part of why I'm biased against the test as my degree puts me at a disadvantage as I'm having to take the ""other disciplines"" test which covers a lot of material I'd be clueless about or take the civil test (which I did) and has sections I'm clueless about.     

I only had a mediocre GPA (2.7 ish) and my hometown didn't have many places to apply too so I never got a internship plus not having the EIT pretty much sealed my fate that I wouldn't get a job with any engineering company after school.  I did a terrible job of networking during school and all my friends were in other engineering majors where having an FE isn't needed so none of them studied for the test as they didn't need it.  So without any contacts in my own field, I'm coming to reddit for advice about the FE test.

After graduation, I got a job with a city government as a construction inspector enforcing ICC building codes and I've been there for 6.5 years now, I made a decent wage but very low compared to what an engineer should have 6.5 years after graduating (42k usd but good govt benefits) .  I actually really like the job and I enjoy doing it but I pretty much don't have anywhere to promote too and it will be years before some of the people above me retire and open up promotion opportunities.   The more years that pass the more I feel like I'm wasting my degree(that I'm still heavily in debt for) and I trying to figure out where to go with my career and that is why I have been thinking about taking the FE/EIT test again to give my career a boost and maybe open up some career opportunities.


My questions: 


1)  have any of you passed the FE after being out of school for so long.  I have lots of free time so studying isn't an issue but its been so long since I was in school that I'm afraid I'm going to be wasting my time and fail it again.  I took mechanics of materials 10 years ago for example.  

2) My 2nd question is for Arch E's specifically: did you take the civil or other disciplines test?  How did you study for the sections you didn't take classes on?

3) Engineers that haven't passed the FE.  What have you done with your career and what other career options do I have to improve my salary without the FE?

4) do you have any links or know of any websites where I can find free or cheap study resources?

5) have there been any major changes to the test in the last 7 years?  I see its available to take a computer testing centers now (I've been there for my ICC testing).   How many times can you take it in a year?  I know it used to only be offered a couple times a year and the results took forever to get.

TL:DR.  Failed the FE 7 years ago, considering taking it again as I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my career."
2b34f7,0,2014-07-18,Short-term phone plans,RussetWolf,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/2b34f7/shortterm_phone_plans/,"Hello /r/Seattle!
I'm a Canadian student coming to town for four months in the fall for an internship and I will need a phone plan! I am unfamiliar with providers and the standard setup of plans in the US, so I was hoping for some advice. Namely:

* Are plans typically nationwide or state-specific? I'll likely be visiting California and Arizona and would like to know if my phone will be usable there.
* I have Nexus 4 I'd like to use there and don't want a contract. Is this feasible with anything other than pay-as-you-go service?
* What providers are there (and have good service/coverage)? I'll likely be in Detroit between now and my move, so I might be able to get the plan set up before leaving.

Ideally, I'd like to do something like [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1l1z3u/how_to_get_unlimited_everything_cell_phone/), using a data plan and apps, as that is similar to [**what I currently do**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1l3dza/unlimited_everything_cell_plan_in_canada_for/). unfortunately the plan listed does not exist at that price anymore. Any suggestions? I'd love to be able to have no/few minutes, no texting, and 2-3GB of data per month."

I interned at Bosch for 2 summers during schooling in the same group.  After graduation I was hired into this group full time.  I will have worked there for 2 months at this point.  Before accepting this job/receiving Bosch's offer I interviewed with Apple.

I just heard back from Apple today and they want me to have a phone interview with the manager in one of the groups there and then find a date to do an on campus interview which they would be paying to fly me out there, all expenses paid.  

After the Apple interview I was really excited because it is my dream to move west and get closer to mountains and everything that the west side of the States has to offer.  But it would be really hard to leave the group at Bosch when I know everyone there and have already established myself.  I would also be leaving a lot of friends. 

I guess I'm not really sure how to handle the situation.  I told Apple that I had already started my work at Bosch and they asked if I still wanted to entertain the idea of working for Apple.  I said yes and now I'm going to have a phone interview. 

Has anybody been in this sort of situation before? How did you break ties with the first company? (I've only been there 2 months minus the internships).  

I think this opportunity would be really exciting.  Moving to the other side of the country, living in CA, meeting new people, working for a huge tech company.  The work life would probably more demanding with a company like Apple.  This would be a really tough decision to make if I get the offer and I'm trying to prepare myself for the decision.

2b37p6,6,2014-07-18,My first experience with Kratom 5 hours ago and in detail of experience....,Kezander,kratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/2b37p6/my_first_experience_with_kratom_5_hours_ago_and/,"This article is mainly for the purpose of people who use opiates and want to try Kratom for the first time. This is my personal experience and how I feel about it...


I use opiates often I would say. Today at 7:30 AM I took 2 norco 10's I had saved. It had been a week before today since I had taken any. Usually I use higher doses and go between 40-70 MG a day. I will do the binge for however it lasts - that is I go buy 30-50 10mg norcos and have fun and when they run out I quit for a few weeks due to tolerance and dependency. Always have minor withdrawls - headaches, diarrhea, runny nose and really unpleasant feelings that last maybe 3 days at tops. 

I heard about Kratom back in 2011 but never gave it a try. Due to me not finding any opiates lately and being bored at work (I am an intern web developer for a company and am doing a large project that has no end in sight and is extremely tedious..) I decided to go ahead and try it. Sadly in Indiana I think it may be illegal -  which is where I live. The context of the law is vague and as there have not been any arrests in the state yet I am still unsure of its legality. For anyone in Indiana reading this I wonder what your opinions may be. 2 chemicals in it are illegal but only in synthetic form and no mention of the plant? It's very vague and I feel like a judge would throw it out.. But that probably wouldn't stop a cop from arresting you anyone.

Regardless, I ordered an ounce of it from a vendor. I ordered the Maeng da kratom leafs which were ground up into powder. I ordered it on Tuesday at 10PM, the vendor shipped it by 4-6 PM the following day and I received it today at 10:30 AM. I came home on my lunch break today and decided to give it a try since the opiate buzz from 7:30 that morning was long gone and I was wanting to pick it up again. I really had no idea how much to take so I poured about half the bag out into Greek Yogurt. The stuff was horrible. It tastes and smells exactly like tea. It was in such a powdered state that it took a lot of mixing just to get the thing suitable. The taste doesn't make you want to gag as much as the texture of dryness and blandness. Just really hard to ingest but if for a worthy buzz I would do so. I then ate 2 slices of pizza as I had not eaten anything that morning and was starving.

I felt the buzz come on within about 10 minutes of eating it. It wasn't like a normal buzz of hydrocodone or Oxycontin. The buzz made me feel spacey. I felt a calming and a slight amount of energy at the same time. I started to sweat a decent amount to. My girlfriend was sort of weirded out by me as she said I was acting funny (she can never tell when I take pills). It was an extremely weird and odd feeling. I did not get an opiate high. It was nothing like popping 30 MG of hydro or oxy and waiting for that rush and euphoria. It was much more mild and almost psychotropic...

I decided not to drive back to work because I had no idea how I would function and got on my bicycle to peddle back. I felt pretty calm on the way to work. Still sweat a lot and felt weird. I could have laid down and closed my eyes and wasn't full of anxiety as I really didn't want to go back and code all the validation of shitty hospital forms. But, by the time I got back to work the buzz had worn down by at least 50% (this was about an hour after I took it and I did ride a bike back)... The buzz was still there until about 3:30 when all of a sudden it just fucking up and left. Leaving me with a slight headache and a wtf feeling.

I got home an hour ago and immediately took half of the half a bag.. so another 7 grams of the stuff. I am drinking one beer and I took 2 shots. The 2 shots and the 7 grams were an hour ago and I only feel so so right now. Honestly I couldn't tell you if the shots and this beer are more of an influence than the Kratom... I plan on taking the last 7 grams in 2 more hours unless this magically kicks in.

Overall I was not that satisfied. I read a lot of great reviews and watched the Mayan Kratom YouTube video where the dude talks about God and shit giving the world Kratom and how amazing the stuff is. I may try it again and since this was a first time use maybe I just reacted differently to it... I can't remember the first time I smoked pot but people do say that the first time is different than all the rest (or maybe that is just bullshit). 

My point is, for people who have never used it, this was my experience. It was 20 bucks for an oz so I really didn't care about the price but I was hoping for something more... I will say this, I believe if you do not have any opiates that this would be a wonderful drug to get off of them. It would also help to sleep on and I am sure the many more things that people claim are going to be partially true. I do not think this is a drug to get high on though.

For people who have used this often and are reading, what did I do wrong? Eating 2 slices of pizza didn't matter and a 15 minute bike ride didn't either. I've done that on opiates hundreds of times and I am just as high. I cannot comment on the quality of the vendor I used because this is my first time using. I can say he does ship it fast and responds to emails. Would the 20 MG of Norco had affected anything and why would it? Doesn't make any sense that the Kratom wouldn't work as well because I had a low does of hydrocodone 5 hours prior...

Anyway, those are my thoughts on it. I wanted to share for both people who are wanting to try it and for people who use it and might have had a first experience like mine."
2b3b1j,2,2014-07-18,Looking for some guidance with working aboard and general employment options.,From_Montreal,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2b3b1j/looking_for_some_guidance_with_working_aboard_and/,"Hi Reddit, I was hoping anyone here could give me some sound advice and pointers, maybe even some contacts or resources.

I am currently a graduate student (classes finished since september 2013) completing my internship with a US branch of government in Canada (I am a locally hired intern from Canada). I will be done in a week, and upon submission of my final paper (mini-thesis), which I have until end of September to finalize and submit, I will receive my piece of paper. My degree is in international relations and public affairs, while I also hold two BAs (Public Affairs, 2014, and Political Science, 2011)... and yes, I know all the BA jokes are pretty much true, career options it seems like a waster of time and money, but I honestly enjoyed the entirety of my university education, in fact I'm going through somewhat of a Peter Pan-syndrome like phase. I really can't imagine being out of school and getting into the ""real world"" but at the same time I am excited for new challenges and opportunities... however, I have been having trouble finding them. 

Basically, I would love to work internationally, but I feel I am entering later into the game... I'm in a long term relationship, and to the dismay of my other half I have expressed wanting to work abroad, at least for the short term.. but who knows, maybe even longer? My government is cutting back in international opportunities, of which they are rare to begin with. I have applied for 88 positions in the last 3 months, mainly abroad, and more specifically Europe. 1) for the experience, 2) for the possibilities, 3) because the majority of my studies and research revolve around there. I have previously held administrative positions with a local university and for the municipal government, and have even run for office at the municipal level here in Montreal, but clearly lost. I want to work for an NGO, an international organization, a think tank, a research group, a human rights organizations, a criminal court... anything, and anything anyone can name I think I have applied to them all.. even if the posting were above my capabilities, I still applied anyway out of desperation. 

I know it isn't easy, that's obvious, and I don't want to bitch and moan, I'm not looking for a pity party as well. I just want some sound advice, some resources, what anyone has to offer. I know working abroad is difficult as well, considering I don't have citizenship and would need the company or organization to sponsor me for a Visa. I've got some savings but not much and would want to find something relatively modest but with which I can live on. I would take temporary assignments even, but those aren't even biting at my applications. I'm 26 going on 27 very soon, and just feel like I'm getting a late start, been dating someone for 10 years... yup, and don't want to put this much pressure on them, but in the long run I feel that if I don't do this, I'll end up regretting it or resenting myself for not trying it out when I had the chance.

Was just winding if anyone had anything to offer. 

Thank in advance, it's really appreciated!"

2b3dk3,2,2014-07-18,Gap in resume problem?,iwannajahb,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2b3dk3/gap_in_resume_problem/,"Hey y'all.

I'm about to finish my MSME, and I'm still frantically looking for a job.  My degree is from a top 5 school, my GPA is high, and I have an interesting portfolio of projects.  However, getting hired has not gone so well.  I think I've gotten it down to two problems:

1.  I'm a generalist.  I've taken classes/done projects all over the place, and most people want someone who's spent all their time in grad school doing thing xyz.  My thing XYZ is sort of product-designy, and those openings are few and far between for someone who doesn't actually have a PD degree, so I'm trying to lean on my other skills to get employed.

2.  I have a hole in my resume.  I didn't have an internship between my last year of undergrad and grad school due to a combination of moving and hiring issues (it turns out that people aren't super excited to hire someone that's just going to frolic off for grad school), which in and of itself wouldn't be too bad.  Unfortunately, I had a nervous breakdown between my first and second years of graduate school, which meant that my summer was spent at the psych's office rather than working.

How do I compensate for these issues and become a productive member of society, or at least get some more interviews?"

As I said on the title, I'm going to spend 1 year and a half on a programming course with an internship at the end. That will not give me a degree (it will, but not a college degree), as I will proceed to getting one on computer engineering after the conclusion of said course. I want your opinion: is it going to be a waste of time? I'm 19 and i'll be 21 when I start getting my degree. So I can think of starting a career at 24/25. Is it too late on this field?

Here's the list of the disciplines I'll take on this course, for your appreciation (these are only taken on a lective year)

**General formation**

* English (I'm not in an english speaking country)

* Business administration

* Introduction to digital systems

_________________

**Technical formation of the informatic area**

* Introduction to information systems

* Algorithms

* System and computers architecture

* Informatic systems' network architecture

* Programming languages

* Multimedia tools

* Databases and systems analysis

* Informatics security

* Information systems project (a project we have to plan and do until the end of the first year)

* Web programming

So what do you think? Is it a waste of time or will it help me getting ready to my CE degree?

Oh, and please excuse me for my english, as I said I'm not from an english-speaking country so I had a hard time translating the names of the disciplines."

In a rough spot in life, Boss at unpaid internship is a cynical dick head who figuratively dangles money over my head. I'm about halfway through the summer and its hurting my school work to stay dedicated to him. What should I do?


**BACK STORY**

Early February I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant. At the time I was working at a Dunkin Donuts doing overnight shifts for minimum wage and kind of just giving myself no pressure to do anything with my life. As soon as I found out that we were having it, I bucked up immediately.. I found a 32 week Networking program that would help me get my A+ &amp; MCSA. I always had a knack for computers so I hit the ground running.


3 Months in, so far no problems until I have a issue at work with a local gangmember (Threatened me with a gun). Needless to say I quit that place. I have a kid on the way so me and my family agreed that it was too risky to stay there.


**HERES THE STORY**

A month rolls by and I land an internship at a nice little IT firm. This is where I'm at a dilemma, so far this internship is amazing. I'm learning so much from being here, unfortunately though this boss is an asshole. He constantly belittles me, scrutinizes every little thing about what everyone does. Worst of all he has no problem dangling $ over me to get me to do stuff. This is an unpaid internship, in which I do everything he wants me to do for free. I understand this much, but when he's asking me to spend every waking moment outside of the hours I'm at the office to work on support cases just so I can show my worth? what the heck man. I'm fresh in the IT field and I have no experience whatsoever working with VoiP systems &amp; firewalls etc.

SO I'm wondering is the grass greener? I'm basically working for this place for free 4 days a week 8 hours a day working on support cases for this group if I don't understand something I crash course myself as fast as I can on the subject and end up asking a stupid question and getting flack for it. I got a little side job at Microcenter just the other day. I'm wondering if I should just stick with the internship til he just gets fed up and *fires* me or if lets say they do offer me a position should I just decline it? Also I don't even know how much starting pay is.."

She could tell I was too drunk to be by myself and took it on her self to call him and be like do this favor for me you owe this and he agreed to give me a ride. This I kind of remember. I remember the walk to his car and be exhausted after that. I remember being close to my house and him talking about how he works near there at dirt bike track in the bush nearish to my house. I remember talking about how pretty another girl we both bumped into was and him asking if I didn't think I was attractive. I remember him saying he wanted something and saying that he didn't want to offend me I think I remember some other flirting. (I should side note here, I kind of had a weird thing for the dude like I know objectively he's an asshole like pulls shitty pranks and runs out on tabs type of dude) 

Anyways he bluntly says he wants sex and drunk me is like, do you have a condom. So off we drove down the street near my house. It gets kinda patchy from here. I remember going for sucking him off but like he pushed my head way down and I know I asked for water cause my mouth was too dry for that. Somehow I went from half naked to full naked. I remember it transitioning to sex with me on top, and then I was face down and he kept trying to put in my ass but I fought him off of that. My face slammed into the door, cause I remember being really worried about my glasses I know sometime the condom came off and he fucked my face, and I almost puked on his dick but i got him off in time and just had to breath and he talked about how it took a while for him to come. He came on my neck, face and my mouth.  I know I trash talked him a bit cause I remember him saying something about me being harsh. And I think I bragged about a stupid thing I did on a train once. I remember finding his red bull and chugging that because I was so thirsty. And then drunk me realized what happened and I know I said stuff about not telling anyone because I fucked up memories of how fast sexual stuff spread back when I was in middle school (I left the town for high school and just came back) I do remember grabbing my glasses. And then I remember being  in the house taking a shower and freaking out about what happened. And I texted him right then not sure if it had happened or not, but his response was weird. I think I started to sober up, cause I was in pain. Like my throat hurt, my ass hurt, my taint hurt, everything hurt. I drank so much water, or I tried but my throat hurt. I had a friend like talk me down on skype cause I was in a really strange mood and I remember that.  


I already told my two friends who are from other parts of the country, but I also told my friend who's at the journalism thing and she got really mad at him. And I forgot at the time but like a year ago he was really gross to her when they were out together like being overly agressive with kissing her. I'm worried about what happened becoming public knowledge, I'm worried about what I could have said to him. Like did I come out to him? That CANT be known here like that would mess my life up so hard. And I really just don't want a reputation cause honestly that wasn't my best showing as a sexual partner and I like being good at that stuff. And I'm upset because the one time I find someone who wants to be rough and filthy with me its not in a context that I can enjoy it. And how am I supposed to interact with him when I see him again because in between him being like a fixture of the social scene and him working like in walking distance of where I live. On one hand I feel like I want a redo for my pride's sake and on the other I wish it had never happened. I haven't been touched by anyone in four months. Like outside of a handshake and I don't want to approach him just because he seems to be the only person that will. I dont know, this whole thing is stressing me out its like I am a shut in for most of my time here but like one of the few times I go out and try to do something this happens.

2b404v,10,2014-07-19,How do I break it to my parents that I want to go out to a bar?,pastryoverlord,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/2b404v/how_do_i_break_it_to_my_parents_that_i_want_to_go/,"Bear with me, this will be a bit long.

23, female, fresh out of college, typical Chinese household. While I was never subjected to countless hours of piano lessons, I was subjected to endless hours of my dad comparing me and my brothers to the children of his other friends. ""Oh, so and so is doing so great at his new job"" or ""why can't you be more like so and so?"". This is the prevailing narrative in my life so much so that I've had self-confidence issues as a result.

But this isn't what the post is about. It's about the fact that in my 23 years of life, I have never not slept in my own home. That means no sleepovers, and definitely no bar outings that may result in having to sleep over at a friend's house. Oh yes, and my piss poor social life.

Growing up, and even now, I never got to do any sleepovers (""you're gonna get raped!""). One time in college, I suggested that I sleep over at my friend's dorm on campus because we were going to have a late dinner (it was hard to get reservations at the place we were going to okay?) and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get home in time for the unspoken curfew (11 pm). Plus, I had work the very next day (internship on campus), so being on campus would've been very convenient and save me time commuting in the morning. No intention to drink at all, just have a pleasant dinner and catch up with friends I haven't seen in a while due to being busy at work. I didn't suggest the sleepover because I was planning to drink or do stupid shit (seriously, getting shitfaced on a weekday isn't really in my personality and I had work at 8:30 am the next day. Being hungover was the last thing I wanted to do) - it was purely a matter of convenience. In my mind, it seemed like a practical idea.

Instead, my mom (who is less strict than my dad, but equally nuts) went apeshit at the mere suggestion. And when I asked why (bad idea btw), she gave the standard ""because I said so"". Even my brother (who is 30, but still lives with us) was backing me up and telling my mom ""she's old enough to stay out and sleep over"".

And there's the curfew. In my entire life, I've never been out later than 11 pm. And the one time I was (the late dinner), I got chewed out. Big time. ""Why were you out so late - something bad might've happened to you"". They weren't mad at the fact that I was out late when I had work the very next day (which I fully expected). They were mad that I was out so late because ""omg you could've gotten attacked"". I kid you not, I wish I can tell you I was exaggerating. I know they are coming from a place of genuine concern, but sometimes I can't help but wonder if it's also from a place of wanting to control everything I do. On several occasions, they've asked me why I don't hang out with my friends. Well, you never let me hang out with my friends, that's why.

Double standard time: when my 30-something brother goes out with his friends and gets utterly shitfaced, he usually isn't home until the wee hours of the morning, maybe 1 or 2 am. And my parents are fine with that. But if 23 year old me is out any later than 11 pm, I start getting panicky phone calls and a constant barrage of messages wondering what time I'll be going home. Not only am I the only girl in the family, I happen to be the youngest of 3 kids, which complicates things even more. They're extra protective of me, to the point that much of my social life has been severely limited. I am serious when I say it wasn't until my senior year of college that my parents were cool with me hanging out with my friends, having brunch or dinner, what have you. 

Now here's my situation: My friends invited me to go with them to the local pub next Friday, and it's my first time going to a bar EVER. Not to get utterly wasted mind you, just to have a few drinks and maybe mingle. In the past I've always turned down invitations to hang out with them at the bar or go clubbing because I know that my parents will absolutely forbid me to go. But when they invited me, my parents weren't around so I said yes (I think more than anything I was excited that I finally get to go on a proper outing that didn't end promptly at 11 pm). Then I find out after my ~~weekly~~ daily phone call with father dearest (he isn't in the country right now) that he will be arriving a day before the scheduled outing. Welp, there goes my chance to have a girl's night out. I was so excited at the prospect of finally being able to relax and have a drink with friends (I know, it sounds so sad) that I really wanted this outing to work.

**How do I break it to my parents?** Trust me when I say that I've never had a drink while in the company of friends, ever. But I think my dad worries that I'll get super drunk and drive inebriated - he used to be a raging alcoholic and decided to stop when he crashed the family car outside our townhouse many many years ago. I remember 7 year old me being really scared and wondering if my dad was okay (the crash was very minor, but that made him swear off alcohol completely). And of course, they're concerned for my safety. But the place we're going to isn't even in the shady part of town, nor is it known for being a dump. It's a fairly run-of-the-mill establishment where people can relax and have a beer.

I've never had a drink in front of my parents. In fact, I don't drink much at all, if any. I can count the number of times I've had a drink in my entire life on one hand - usually it's when my parents aren't around. I never drink when they're around because the asian glow gene is strong with me, and they will know right away if I've been drinking or not.

If you think this entire situation is fairly tame, I can tell you that my issues go waaay deeper than not being able to go out with friends. It's everything. Sometimes I feel like because of my upbringing, I haven't acted out (according to my parents anyway) until now. Sigh."
2b45ka,1,2014-07-19,"My job hunt isn't going very well, I'm regularly demeaned at my job, my dating life is awful and I live with my dad... I truly hate getting up in the morning",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2b45ka/my_job_hunt_isnt_going_very_well_im_regularly/,"So I was about to go to bed after an awful day, and I was browsing job listings to see what I should apply to tomorrow when I noticed that a company I had interviewed with put the job listing back up. It is for a communications firm in NY that does architecture and art, my dream job essentially. I had a really great interview and the interviewer made it seem like the next round was a given. Then I sent a thank you note email, and another follow up email about 10 days later expressing my continued interest. Crickets. I know at this point I probably shouldn't be packing up my life to move to NYC from DC to work for a company that can't even handle simple emails, but I'm still hurt because this job sounded amazing. I'm sick of the fact that I don't even warrant a form rejection email from 99% of the places I apply to. I hate sending my information out into the void and not even knowing if anyone is there, and it also makes me feel worthless. I feel like I need to rush and get a masters or go to law school if I ever want to get employed because I can't get a job in a creative field, but I know that's just panic. Regardless, at this point it feels inevitable that I will hate my next job.

I'm applying for jobs because I'm an AmeriCorps member and my term ends in a month from this coming Tuesday. My job has gone downhill so steeply since March. First I found that two people in the same position received $400 as a Christmas bonus when I got $250. This made me feel demeaned, obviously. Then I was supposed to receive a reimbursement check for an on the job injury, and my boss's boss basically reneged on that agreement. My parents paid for it because they didn't want me pressing the issue, and I can't go above him to the AmeriCorps office because I was technically doing something that was prohibited work for my position. Lastly, I have strong reason to believe that my boss's boss also read my personal email; I alternate between wanting to scream and punch the man in the face and have an anxiety attack because I don't even know what he knows about my own life. (The kicker is that the only reason I log into my gmail on work is because I was creating a google group for a project he knows about, so it's not like he could say he was investigating what I do on the computer on the clock or anything.)

I broke up with my boyfriend last fall, and everything has gone to shit since then (I'm gay before I get a lot of straight guys in my inbox thinking I'm a girl). We dated for 3 years, and I thought it would be stupid to move to Wisconsin with him and took a job near home. Now I'm pining after the road less traveled. I live at home which has ruined my dating prospects. I'm deep into suburbia and the only guys out here are 20 years my senior. The guys in the city act like I live in Siberia. I'm waiting to move out until I find out what I'm doing next, but I am beginning to realize I will soon be unemployed and living at home. That may as well make me 500 lbs to most of the guys I'm interested in. I feel like I have no personal time between studying for the standardized tests I need to take to get into the grad programs I know I won't enjoy and the jobs I need to apply to. 

I've always wanted to be some type of writer (I'm not editing this, just fyi; this isn't representative) or at least work in a creative field. I had dreams of writing for tv or movies or working for an organization like NPR or The New Republic, but I changed my mind about my future so many times I'm on a track that I don't want to be on. All my internships were in museums or architecture, and I can't get a fucking foot in the door. I don't even know how I could get back on that track, it feels like only a year out of college I've cemented my future. 

I do see a therapist twice monthly for issues surrounding agoraphobia (I was held at gunpoint for 18 hours at 19). But any advice is greatly appreciated."
2b47au,2,2014-07-19,"Very, very complicated relationship advise. Long read.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2b47au/very_very_complicated_relationship_advise_long/,"I get so tired trying to describe all the pitfalls of my love life to the people that actually care about me because I can't be honest about the situation anymore, and I feel like I have to resort to random strangers for advice.  

Getting right into it:  I am now 25 and started dating my girl 4 years ago and we fell deeply in love very quickly.  We had a lot in common and were able to connect on a deep level.  I had many sexual connections previous to her from college but nothing very complicated or long-lasting; she, on the other hand had only a couple, more long lasting relationships, one of which lasted 3 years prior to me.  She was just what I needed, someone I could actually share myself with, that accepted me for who I am, and I like to think that I was pretty good at accepting her for the person that she was.  We are both a little odd.

Her parents are divorced and her mother has bipolar disorder and a dad that had terminal cancer (still alive).  There was some major turmoil in her house when she was growing up and it scarred her deeply.  Her mother and father were both abusive to her in different was as well as with each other.  Her brother was murdered in a gang related incident.  She has deeply seeded issues that remain with her because of it.

My brother died violently as well when I was a teenager, but my family and upbringing was very wholesome beyond that.  

Anyways, we were great for about a year until I found a lump on her throat, which turned out to be thyroid cancer.  She chose to go it alone.  She didn't want me to be a part of her treatment.  We spoke often but I never saw her during it.  She went into remission, and things became normal, for awhile.  We lived life together very happily again, and then she went in for a check up to find that her cancer had spread and that she would need to go into treatment again.

This was about two years into our relationship, and again she decided to go it alone.  Conventional treatment didn't work at her previous, more local cancer treatment center, and her Dad recommended she see a specialist on the east coast.  She did treatment over there and again gained remission.  I didn't see her for months.  She moved back home and things were strained.  She had been very close to death at the time and she still has yet to recover from it.  

We were able to figure things out and we were happy as long as we were together, though it wouldn't last long as I had to leave for graduate school shortly in another state after she returned.

She visited me at school once, but we remained long distance.  At that point, we had been apart due to her cancer treatment almost as long as we'd been together.  When I returned home from school, things weren't the same.  There was a distance between us that had developed that was growing and hard to overcome.  Long distance had grown on us.  We were together again, but the threat of cancer coming back again was a constant threat, at the time.  We enjoyed our time together for a summer, but again, I had to leave for an internship in another state.  

This is when things became very difficult.

She moved to the same city with a friend of hers.  We found out shortly after that she was pregnant with my child.  We talked often, but she was extremely withdrawn.  We never saw each other for the three months we lived in the same city.  She had a miscarriage.  I left again for school.  

We are about 2.5 years in at this point.

We continued to talk, but obviously, things were difficult.  She made plans to visit me.  The day of her flight, I waited at the airport for hours, and she never came.  She changed her mind on her connecting flight and decided not to come.  She couldn't bring herself to do it.  I remained at the airport for hours.  When she told me that she couldn't come, I chose not to respond.  We didn't talk for a few months.  In the mean time, I had felt that the relationship was over and that it was time to move on.  I was single for awhile and I slept with a couple girls.  It wasn't out of spite or anything, but I was lonely.  I missed her deeply, but I tried to move on.

I finished school and moved to where I found a job.  I texted my girl for the first time in 4-5 months to just say hey.  I missed her.  I never wanted it to end.  She responded.  In the mean time she moved to NY.  She had found a job over there, making a lot of money and living in a very expensive apartment.  We rekindled a little bit and shortly after she came to stay with me for a couple weeks.  It was probably the happiest time in my life.  She loved me again and I loved her.  But, she had a very, very expensive year lease and a prestigious job that needed her back.  I was working where I am still.  We made a pact that when her lease ended, that she would move back and we would be together and that would be the end of us being apart.

She left to go back to working her 80 hour a week job she had come to love over there while I worked in a new city at a job I didn't like all alone.  Over the next couple months, she visited a few times, and when she was here, everything was peas and carrots.  It was great.  I never visited her though.  Not because I didn't want to, but because she said that she couldn't remove herself from the work environment unless she left completely.

If the story wasn't long enough, the last few months get a little longer, and otherwise, I wouldn't be seeking your advice, so if you've read this far, please sit tight.  

The last time she visited was six months ago.  In the time since, I am currently working at a job I hate, with people I cannot make friends with.  I live a solitary life and I am struggling.  She, on the other hand, is doing very well.  She makes six figures a year, though she continues to work 80-90 hours a week and her work is her life.  She is happy though and she has many friends.  I have none.  

Our relationship has progressed as such:  She has extreme success and opportunity, and she has come to love where she is.  I hate my life and my job and have no friends here.  

Her lease ended two months ago at the end of May.  That was supposed to be when she came home to me.  It didn't quite work out like that.  She paid an extra month to live at her apartment.  She put in her two weeks in the middle of June.  She sold her car, her furnishings and most of her major ""stuff"".  She told me that she might move June 21st.  She had a going away party.

She never left.  She lives out of her suitcase with her best friend.  She uses her friends car every day.  I started waiting for her to come home to me last July when I started my job in my new home.  

I call her and she doesn't answer.  She might call, she might not.  She would never leave me, she would never cheat, but she might not hesitate to become independent of me.  She is a strong person with a lot of issues, but she has an incredibly strong resolve.  

I have become the worst version of myself waiting for her.  I am a desperate, wailing baby.  I am desperate for her.  I know it.  If only you knew the things that I have done to sacrifice my pride if only to get a moment of her time at this point.  All I want is for her to come home at this point because I don't think I can function properly without her.  I suck at being in a new city alone.  I thrive with my boys back home but I really, really miss my girl when I'm alone.  I have contemplated suicide multiple times waiting for her.  I need her so much more than she needs me.

I had to twist her arm to get her to get a ticket to come home, but she bought one, I think.  She lies to me now.  She tried to give me every excuse, from the price, to not being the right time, to it not feeling right, to resenting me for making her come, to thinking I would resent her for taking so long, to probably any reason you can imagine. 

I love her.  I want her and I am so completely desperate for her that when I don't hear from her for only a couple hours (like tonight), I kinda want to die.  I am absolutely certain that I'm either going to finally get the love of my life or she is going to break me completely.

Divulge.

**tl;dr**: My girlfriend is complicated, we are long term, long distance dating.  Shit's fucked, but I love her, even though I look like a little bitch."

I just recently got back from visiting SLO. It was definitely an experience although I wish there were more people on campus, but I get it, it' summer. But I'm interested in majoring in CS related, but I was wondering if Software Engineering and CS is a combined major or they are two different things. Can you elaborate on the majors if you can? Similarities? Differences? Prospect job opportunities?

And in general, I got a huge impression that Cal Poly learn by doing really attract companies to recruit Cal Poly kids, which I totally get. But in terms of Software Engineering and CS, are there tech firms near SLO? I would think that most of them are situated in Silicon Valley and SF where Cal and Stanford kids would probably have better access to them in terms of getting internships and going to work easily. 

Feel free to chime in everyone. Thanks in advance!"
2b4bzm,765,2014-07-19,YogVentures' Final Kickstarter Update,Etheren95,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2b4bzm/yogventures_final_kickstarter_update/,"This was posted by Winterkewl on the YogVentures Kickstarter page. 
EDIT: Fixed some formatting.


Hi Everyone,

Sorry I didn't respond earlier to the news the Yogscast announced earlier this week. I was traveling for work and didn't really have time to get online and make a proper response. Like I said, our partnership was dissolved so of course they didn't (and didn't have to) tell me anything about it so it came as much as a surprise to me as anyone.  
I do think the TUG team have a lot of similar goals, and if that's the developer that the Yogscast have chosen to continue Yogventures with then I hope that NerdKingdom will do their best to reach the goals the Yogscast have for Yogventures and if they do then hopefully everyone will win and get the Yogventures we all wanted to see happen.  

I will provide a detailed breakdown of all the funds we received from the Kickstarter and how we at Winterkewl Games used every cent towards making the game. I need to consult with my accountant to make sure I don't miss anything and that it's all formatted correctly etc, but here some rough numbers to hopefully shed some light on what the funds were used for.  

After all the backers had a chance to fulfill their payments, and all the funds were collected out of the $567,665 that was pledged, roughly $415,000 of that was actually transferred after the Kickstarter fees and Amazon fees had been collected. We met with the Yogscast when the kickstarter ended and everyone agreed that the entire net should be used to create the game as much as humanly possible. So we made a plan as such.  

* $35,000.00 Concept Art / Sky boxes / Environment Textures (Senior matte painter / concept artist from PDI Dreamworks)
* $35,000.00 Concept Art / Character Designs / UI Design (Senior Character Designer Treyarch)
* $35,000.00 Modeling (Senior Modeler from Dreamworks)
* $35,000.00 Textures / Surfacing / Shader development (Senior Surface Artist from Dreamworks)
* $35,000.00 Animation (Senior Animator from Dreamworks)
* $35,000.00 Programming / Unity Development (Myself Unity Developer)
* $15,000.00 Unity Developer part time / intern
* $100,000.00 Programming / Application Architecture / Back-end Server Code / Voxel Engine (TBD, we were courting several programmers with lots of game experience over the course of the Kickstarter)   
* $3500.00 Legal Fees Contracts  
* $1500.00 Accountant Fees
* $15000.00 Hardware (PC computers)
* $5000.00 Software Licenses 
* $15,000.00 Escrow for expenses related to development like buying Unity Assets etc. 
* $50,000.00 Physical Rewards creation and Shipping 

Unfortunately, right off the bat we had one major incident that happened that we could not fix. Our good friend and matte painter really terrific artist that created most of the concept art with environments on the Kickstarter page, he left PDI to work at LucasArts. LucasArts wouldn't give him a carve out in his contract to work on Yogventures so he couldn't work on the project any longer. 

This is a very good example of how my inexperience caused some problems in the development. Because we had worked out a contract that guaranteed each of the principal artists a $35,000 lump sum payment, and we didn't make any clear clause on how and why someone could legally stop working on the project, The artist in question got paid, worked for about 2 weeks and then stopped working on the project. We had no way to force that person to pay back any of the funds and it was a bitter lesson to learn. Always get every possible scenario in writing or you will have no legal recourse. 

When Lewis found out about the artist incident he was rightly confused and upset, as a result he lost faith right away in my ability to run the company from a business standpoint and basically required that all the rest of the Kickstarter money that hadn't been spent be transferred to them right away. In the end we negotiated that to $150,000 would be transferred to the Yogscast with the understanding that they would use that money exclusively to create and ship all the physical rewards, AND they would help hire the main programmer that we still didn't have on the project. 

 The whole fiasco left a bad taste in all parties mouth and we could immediately feel tensions beginning to take the place of what was once just excitement and joy to be making such a cool game. In hindsight I wish I would have let Lewis manage all of the funds from the very beginning and essentially just taken a profit share contract from them so that there wasn't any of the confusion that happened later. 

 Time went on we began developing in earnest but without our main programmer and no funds to hire one it became clear that more of that role was going to be filled by me than I ever intended. Not to be daunted though I worked tirelessly for the next 18 months as did all of the people listed above. We never had another person drop out of the project and all of those artists produced a huge number of assets and for prices that by their normal work a day rates were really really low. 

Unfortunately, too many design changes and my in-experience as a project lead and programmer were what's to blame for our company never really making what it was we set out to make. I am extremely proud of everyone that worked on this though, and even though the game wasn't finished what we were able to accomplish is a creative and artistic vision of a voxel world that hasn't been done that many times before. The character work and the props and textures all the concept art it was really lovely work and those guys should feel proud of what they did. 

Anyway, I'm not sure why the Yogscast felt ""shackled"" to us, but I still feel honored to have worked so hard on this project for all of the backers and fans. Our business model may have been naive but it's still one of the best things I've ever made from scratch and for that I'll always be grateful to all the backers. 

Since the money was all spent either directly on development of the game or paid to the Yogscast to handle physical rewards and ""licensing fees"" I'm afraid Winterkewl Games has a negative balance at this point. We don't have any of the money left and as such can't really offer refunds. 

I understand the frustration of that, but we put in I would say much more than a ""Good Faith Effort"" we literally gave it everything we had and then some to make this game happen. So, like I said all of those numbers are not completely vetted, once I get all the data formatted I'll come back and post again. I do hope that sheds some light on where everything went though, nothing was scammed, no one and I mean NO ONE has gotten rich from this effort or is even better off then when we started, except for all the memories and the great feeling it was to see your support and try and make a great product from it. 

Thanks again for everything, and again my deepest apologies that we weren't able to finish the game ourselves. I really hope the Yogscast's plan with TUG works out and all the backers get a great game they deserve. ~Kris

2b4ipl,0,2014-07-19,Preparation for internship interview (building cloud storage),mindvsbody,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/2b4ipl/preparation_for_internship_interview_building/,"Hello, 
I've got a scheduled interview in the next week for Python internship. The internship project is building a cloud storage using Python (like Dropbox). 

My question is, what skills and knowledge (specific to the internship project) should I have to increase my odds of passing the interview and later actually doing a good piece of work?

I'll list a few points and you're welcome to correct me/add more:

- knowledge of Python (that's pretty obvious, but I suppose it's one of the main factors determining the odds),
- knowledge of version control systems - at the moment I know basics of Git and I'm going to read a bit about forks, branches, merging etc,
- knowledge of relational databases? - I'm familiar with PostgreSQL and I think this point matters too,
- HTML?  XML? Javascript? JSON? - the former two are familiar to me, I saw JSON and it looked pretty easy to understand too.
- Some computer networks related knowledge? Protocols?"

I'm a 23 year-old college student who has a year-and-a-half left of school. Currently, I'm struggling to make ends meet. I live with just my parents and I and, during the school year, I reside on campus. I have been working at a grocery store for three years this coming August, and while they are treating me well (I make $10.75/hour and I work 35-36 hours a week during the summer and they work around school), I find myself unhappy because I am not building a career here. I'm going to school to be a writer and Creative Writing teacher and eventually professor. I'd rather be working in my field with an internship or a job that is paying more because it would help me pay off my debts. I would rather work full-time, have off on weekends, and enjoy my twenties. In order to make decent money a year ago, I was working three jobs and full-time school. 

Money has always been tight for my parents being that my dad lost his job three times over the course of ten years and there hasn't been much stability and so, they do not aid me when I need extra help. I have $40,000 dollars worth of student loans so far in my senior year at my school after transferring from community college and live paycheck to paycheck at the moment. The benefit is that being I'm still in school, the loans don't need to be paid immediately, however, I would like to start building savings now to help achieve that and get myself moved out of my parent's depression and worrisome environment.

After I finish school this year, I am looking to move out of the house into either a single room of a house or an actual apartment because things in my house have become overwhelming. It's no longer mentally conducive to my health. My mom is a very emotionally abusive woman, and it's been affecting me drastically as well placing me into depression. I get anxious all the time with heart palpitations it feels like. She's controlling my finances, I am not allowed to go places, and she demeans me about finances and responsibility all the time, regardless of me holding a job and never resorting to any drug or alcohol as an escape. I can't continue to feel ashamed of myself, when I know I have a lot more to offer. However, it's hard to convince myself that when my mom ambushes me everyday. When I'm on my own at campus and independent somewhat, I feel like a completely different person. 

In terms of bills, I pay my own car insurance, phone bill, I take private voice lessons only during the summer, and gas money/traveling expenses. I'm essentially financially independent but without the funds to do so. I have a motorcycle I bought two years ago, and recently was thinking about selling it, which might help bring me back to a somewhat stable position again. I can get about $4,500 for it.

Here is a breakdown of my monthly bills:
During Summer (June to August) I make about $290/week (roughly 1160/month)
And during the school year (Sept to May) $180/week ($720/month)
Car insurance: $200
Phone bill: $55
Gas:$180
Food: (only for eating out, my parents pay for food) roughly $200-250/month for entertainment and fun (I have to cut this number, I understand)
The Federal PLUS loans will be two separate loans each $24,000 with a fee of 4.288%

I was also recently hit with a lot of past traffic violation fines which ate up my money a lot, so I'm essentially starting this month off at a clean slate (to give perspective). 
Can anyone provide advice as to what their thoughts are? Budgeting tips, lowering spending costs (which is also a problem for me), etc?"

(I know some of you feel clubbing is a dealbreaker but whatever It doesnt bother me). She kept asking me to come out with her but I had an interview this morning for an internship at a physio and was not going to sacrifice that for a night of drinking. She seemed annoyed by this.

Anyways i awake this morning for my interview and check my phone. I see that she has sent a snapchat to me at 4:30am (obviously only home then). In the picture is some random dude she has taken a picture of sitting on a chair smiling with his arm around a huge teddy bear. She captioned it something stupid like ""lol"".

Now I have no idea who this dude is or where she was when she took that photo. I know asking her who he is or getting jealous would be breaking frame but i have to admit that it annoyed me. I have a feeling she did it on purpose to try and make me jealous/ show off that there are other guys around or whatever. It really pissed me off especially the fact that she knew I had an interview in the morning, if it was the other way around I wouldnt do that.

Am I over-reacting? Should I avoid bringing it up with her? Withdraw attention? Establish some dread game?

2b4qg5,4,2014-07-19,Moving in with my [17F] boyfriend's [17M] parents. Terrified that this will ruin our relationship.,electric0bugaloo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2b4qg5/moving_in_with_my_17f_boyfriends_17m_parents/,"Because of family issues, I will be spending the rest of my summer break staying with my boyfriend  and his parents while doing this internship program in a nearby city. I live on the west coast and he (and our school) are on the east coast.  I'm really really excited to stay there, but now I'm worried that it won't be good in the long-run. 


When the summer ends, we both will go back to boarding school for senior year.

Depending on what happens with my family, I may end up spending my Xmas/spring/weekend breaks at his house. I might kind of start keeping stuff there and his parents will start treating me like I live there even if I technically don’t. 

Even though I’m like super sensible, sometimes I’ll catch myself fantasizing about spending the rest of my life with my boyfriend. I know that I’m young, I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few years, and high school relationships almost never last, etc., and that it’s such a slim chance. But the truth is…yeah.

But now I’m freaking out and worrying that me moving in will screw us up beyond repair. Teenage couples in the same house almost never works out, and I feel like there are so many stories about people my age who do this and then end up breaking up.

I’m used to seeing him every single day at breakfast and living in the same general environment. But we obviously live in different buildings and don’t have all of our classes together. 

He's doing this summer class thing and I will be going back and forth (either by train or getting a ride with his dad) to my program. So our summer schedules will differ a bit but we will see each other a lot. His best friend (who I'm also pretty good friends with) will come to stay at some point.

I’ve met his parents and gone to Thanksgiving at their house for like three years in a row. They are awesome people who have been very welcoming and basically said that I can stay as much as I want/need to. I’m pretty comfortable with his parents, especially his mom, who’s like the classiest person I know and basically my model for existence. His mom is pretty excited to have me around, even though she’s toning it down so that I don’t feel pressured to leave my own family before I'm ready.

He and I have been having sex for a few months now, and we’ve had sex while in the same house as his parents. I take BC and we almost always use a condom just to be safe. His parents are okay with it as long as we’re both being safe and they don’t have to hear/see it.

Theoretically I could stay with someone else, but that's a pretty short list and his parents are the best choice by far. That being said, if his house suddenly stopped being an option, I could figure out something with my best friend.

I leave tomorrow, and I'm having anxiety about what this means for our relationship. 

What can I/we do to make sure we stay solid?

I have looked at a lot of older posts and came to the conclusion that I am financially stable/responsible enough to start building my credit history with a credit card (I have had a car loan for over a year I haven't missed a payment while having a constant job and getting a good paying internship this fall).

So here's the question, I bank through huntington, should I continue using them and have all my eggs in one basket? Also they [this](https://www.huntington.com/pas/creditcard/) promotion and although I do spend a good amount on gas, the lower rate I was thinking was the best option seeing as I just want to use this card for groceries or purchases I already saved up for.

tldr; Should I get a huntington card with my other accounts there or at another bank offering a student card and what benefits should i focus on for small monthly purchases?"

I got an amazing internship offer out of state that I would have been an idiot to turn down. The job is pretty intense, as they fired the engineer I was supposed to learn from. As such, I have done a lot of learning on the fly and am thankfully impressing my boss. A typical day for me goes like this:

* 4:15a Up and at 'em
* 5:15a Meet at the man van location and commute into work
* 5:30p Back at the man van location and head home
* 6:30p Get an hour workout in for the night
* 8:00p Bedtime 


For my first few weeks here I balanced my free time talking to the boyfriend, mom, sister, and friends, in favor of speaking to the boy. He eventually complained we weren't talking enough so I cut down talking to my friends every other week and my family once a week. During these conversations he often wouldn't have anything to say and there would be complete silence on the lines for 5+ minutes. May have been a little harsh here, but I told him that if he isn't going to contribute to the conversation then I was going to hang up as my free time is limited and precious to me.


Now to the crux of the issue. My parents have paid for a flight home for me next week, I will arrive late Wednesday and leave mid-day Sunday, to have a mini family reunion. My sister will be home (she comes home once a year) and my aunt and uncle from the east coast will also be in attendance. In addition, one of my friends is having her wedding reception on Saturday. 


Last night the boy asked if the wedding is something I had to go to, which really irked me. In reality I will only be spending 4.5 hours at the reception, which doesn't seem like a lot of time to me. He is picking me up from the airport and I will be spending the night at his place, plus he is invited to the majority of the family functions as my family adores him. Thursday is my only real ""free"" day and he didn't ask for that day off in time, so his bosses denied the request. I am working hard to meet his needs, but I also want time to see my friends. Am I in the wrong?

At this new business, they will be utilizing some software that I have a lot of experience with, and they've requested that I set up the system for them and train the new manager on it. 

I've agreed to help them get everything set up, but I have not negotiated compensation at this point. It would cost them a decent amount of money to go through someone else to have the system setup and their staff trained, so I feel like that gives me some leverage to negotiate with. 

At the larger company (manufacturing), they have an IT department of about six people. I worked with their network admin for a few weeks on a small project a couple of years back, and I remember that they had one person in IT who did a lot with SQL. I believe the database they were using was MySQL. 

My current plan is to graduate with my CS degree in Fall of 15, and to do an internship the industry (aerospace) that I want to break into in Summer 15. I've already been viewing a bunch of internship positions and entry level dev positions in the industry, and I'm seeing a lot of them asking for SQL and database experience.

Do any of you think it would be beneficial to attempt to negotiate some time to work with their MySQL person in return for doing all of this work at their new company? I have no SQL experience at all right now, so I would pretty much be picking up books and learning constantly while not on the job. Do any of you think there would be any work that I would be capable of doing while in this role?

I'm taking a web programming class in the fall where we will use a little SQL, and then next spring I'll be taking an advanced database management systems class where I'll finally get some formal education on the topic. I figured if I approached them with this offer, then I would request to work with them for a few weeks in August, and then for a few more in December between the fall/spring semesters. 

Any feedback or advice here would be much appreciated."

We were friends for a while before getting together, and the last year has been perfect. We never argue, in fact we never really disagree on anything- we're always on the same page. Last week a friend of mine said she thinks it's crazy that in all the time we've known each other, we've never had so much as a disagreement. 

We both are unemployed right now, having just got out of college, and he's doing an unpaid internship. He comes over two evenings a week at the moment and I make dinner and we chill out and watch tv and just enjoy being together. I love the time we spend together. While we were still in semester we usually spent one of the weekend days together too.

But in the last few weeks he's been spending weekends away with his family at their second home. I don't begrudge him that, they actually usually spend the whole summer away but because of how things with college and employment are he's been here instead, only travelling to their place at the weekend. Also there have been reasons beyond his control in the last few weeks meaning that for the past month or so, we only see each other once a week.

In addition to only getting to see each other once a week, I feel like we're not talking as much. He really isn't a chatty person to begin with and I am, but even so I feel lie we talk less than usual. I want to think that it's just because i'm not working or anything and he does the same stuff day in day out in work, so there's nothing 'new' to chat about, but I'm just sad that we don't have long conversations the way I would with my girlfriends. 

Should I be concerned that we're not as communicative lately? I think I got a bit freaked out over what my friend said about us never arguing, that it's almost TOO smooth sailing. I'm also just a bit sad that we're not chatting as much as we would in the first few months together, is this lull normal? I love this guy more than anything, I'd be absolutely lost without him, i'm just feeling a bit off lately.

2b4vje,7,2014-07-19,I need advice on how to deal with something,Spaceguy5,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/2b4vje/i_need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_something/,"So to start off, a little backstory. I've been a student intern at a company for a year now. Last fall/spring, I had some big drama with 3 people who are also interns. To summarize without going too much into detail, there was a girl who flirted with me and led me on to thinking I was her friend, when behind my back she was spreading rumors and lies about me to the other two guys. It ended up escalating into me having to talk to HR twice (the first was her reporting me--over something pretty dumb. Even after reporting me, she still pretended to be my friend. The second was one of my friends reporting one of her friends on behalf of me over something significantly more serious).

Okay, now fast forward a bit. A couple months ago, I met another girl. We quickly became very close friends. We'd see each other almost every single day, spending hours and hours together. She even told me I was her best friend. Which, I felt the same way about her.

But about two weeks ago, she met one of those guys I mentioned before at a party. And they suddenly quickly became friends. Apparently he was even telling her some of the same lies and stuff about me and even told her not to talk to me, and called her pathetic for being my friend. But she still spends time with him. But it gets worse...

Last week, she met the other guy (and the girl), and has been hanging out with them. I find out that they're also telling her lies about me.

My friend tells me I shouldn't worry about it, that she still cares about me... But she's treating me differently. Spending less time with me, more time with them, canceling our weekend plans to spend time with them instead, flirting with those two guys...

What should I do about it? Should I not let it bother me? Should I be upset? Should I stop talking to her? I don't even know...

TL;DR: I had some very bad trouble with three 'friends' at work. Months later when the dust settled, my new best friend met them, has been spending time with them, talking about me to them, and has been treating me differently. I don't know what to do."

2b587g,0,2014-07-19,"Going to upper management at former job about current director. [NC] With what I'm bringing, will I get into legal trouble?",LtLiberty,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2b587g/going_to_upper_management_at_former_job_about/,"So I used to work at this job for four years at my old college. About a month and a half before I left, a new director of our division took over. I was optimistic about her leadership when I left the job (due to graduation). Fast forward to present day, ~14 months after I quit, and 47 employees have quit the job with the primary reason being due to her (we only have around 25 employees on at a time). So I proposed to send an email to the head of the company. I'll carbon copy two leaders of other divisions who knew me well since they were both former heads of my division, and they knew my integrity. I'm doing it because I don't have anything to personally gain and I never had any issues with the new boss while I worked with her for a month and half. But also, this was the best job I ever had and it was more like a family. Furthermore, we didn't compromise on safety or job performance. I hate to see what it has become.


So here are a few things I'm planning to make a point of (I'm only making points that have been substantiated by multiple people):

* * -She specifically targeted veteran employees in disciplinary action and gave them less hours. I assume this was to bring in her own staff who wouldn't question her decisions.
* * 
* * -She was incredibly against any feedback or criticism. Employees felt as if they could not go to her at all to discuss how things were ran. She snapped on people continuously when they would suggest a different way to try things. She does not like being questioned.
* * 
* * -Multiple people have said that they received ""verbal and emotional abuse."" Many employees felt personally attacked and a lot of people have left her office crying.
* * 
* * -She constantly reminded people that they were replaceable. She was passive aggressive in all instruction and her tone was condescending and unprofessional most of the time.
* * 
* * -She knew that almost all her employees disliked her and she would go out of her way to remind everyone why they need her. I.e. without her, they couldn't have upgraded an arbitrary item. She was always on the look out for those that were ""complaining about her to new employees, causing these new employees to dislike her."" She was so self-absorbed, she couldn't believe that people could come to their own opinions of her leadership and management.
* * 
* * -The pay was raised recently but prior to her, that wasn't needed because everyone loved their job. Now they have to compensate for her leadership with better pay.
* * 
* * -Along the lines of extra costs, they definitely have to recruit a lot more to keep up with turnover.
* * 
* * -She had a very unprofessional relationship (boyfriend-girlfriend) with an employee of another division. Everyone knew when they had a fight because of her attitude that day. He was also in her office a lot and our employees felt that if they were doing the same by not working and talking with their SO, she would snap on them.
* * 
* * -I am going to cite multiple stories of where she completely went back on her word such as saying she would get someone's shift covered, then when the shift couldn't get covered, she punished that employee for not getting his/her shift covered.
* * 
* * -She has two completely dishonest acts. One where she was the last in the building and the next day, a member of another division came in to find the door unlocked. This was reported to higher ups and they got mad at her. She blamed it on an employee who had left prior to her. Said employee got in trouble. The second one, she told an employee who quit that she was ""legally obligated"" to give her a letter of resignation. This isn't true. She only wants these letter of resignations so she can say that these people quit on their own (as long as she isn't mentioned).
* * 
* * -She guilt trips all the employees for putting shifts on the tradeboard (because there are always so many up). Prior to her, there was nowhere near as many people looking to get shifts covered (people enjoyed their jobs). But she tries to make employees feel like their betraying each other other by asking for shifts off. They want shifts off because they don't want to work there anymore. When it was a happy workplace, this was never an issue, now it is after she took over.
* * 
* * -She told an employee to his face that ""not everyone has mommy and daddy paying for everything."" She then insinuated this in an email to them that most of the employees' parents paid for their expenses, in regards to her perception that the employees were bitter about having to do extra work. The quote: ""It's important to remember not everyone has parents/guardians/loans to support them and they would love to have a job whether it's picking up trash or sitting in an office.""
* * 
* * -This job is a campus job and the main reason to work at school is because most bosses understand the priorities of students. The job is not a demanding one and so on our downtime, we used to be able to study. Now she does not allow this and then blames employees of betrayal when they put shifts up on the tradeboard so they can study.
* * 
* * -Very few felt as if she showed any of her employees respect. They were adamant that she was someone who couldn't earn respect but has to demand it. Furthermore, everyone at least agrees that she is not genuine when she tells them her concerns about them. When she does something that is ""nice,"" there is definitely an ulterior motive.
* * 
* * -A lot said that they never felt appreciated and she only ever had criticism.
* * 
* * -She was a completely different person when upper management was around. She would immediately get nicer and more cheerful. I'll ask the director I'm emailing to take into consideration that she was very different when you were watching.
* * 
* * -Many employees are adamant that they don't want their names mentioned in this email because they believe that the boss will go out of her way to personally hurt anyone who dissents. This comes mainly from her personality but she has also threatened multiple employees who were quitting that if they didn't stay, or finish their shifts, or said rude things about her, or whatever, she would be sure to punish them if a future employer called her.
* * 
* * -Many qualified, outstanding employees said they would come back if she leaves the position.
* * 
* * -To highlight the turnover issue further, we used to only have to hire once a year because people rarely quit, and when they did, it was because of graduation, or an internship, or something like that. Now they have to have recruiting sessions ~4 times a year and continuously hire new employees (new ones are brought in every month).
* * 
* * -She took a staff of ""responsible, skilled, seasoned, happy, fun, and positive [employees]... and turned them into grumpy, under appreciated, apathetic [employees].""
* * 
* * -Most importantly, sans her leadership and management, we never failed at an emergency and we always fulfilled our responsibilities while still loving our job. What she brings is not necessary.

Names will not be mentioned in the initial email. However, I will say something like, ""there are a few employees who would be willing to speak with you personally, I can give you their contact information if you like."" All of these things I am pointing out are coming from the stories/issues/concerns of those who told me that they quit the job because of her, not my personal feelings or issues. Of that 47 I mentioned, about 25 have contributed their input thus far.

I plan on making this letter/email very professional and obviously expanding on all those points. So by sending this to the director of the company, with these claims, do I have anything to worry about legally?"
2b5e1c,1,2014-07-19,Losing weight while struggling with rheumatism - help!,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2b5e1c/losing_weight_while_struggling_with_rheumatism/,"Hey everyone. First off I'd like to say that if this is an inappropriate place to post something like this, I'm sorry. 

I really need some help. I tend to be somewhat of a rambler so I'm going to kind of break my story down to bullet points: 
-A little over 2 years ago I was diagnosed with a rheumatic disorder. The diagnosis is still ongoing since I've been struggling with new symptoms that point more into the direction of auto-immune, but for now I've tested negative for the biggest auto-immune fiends (thankfully). Best case scenario is I will end up with a diagnosis of just a rheumatic disorder and not auto-immune, and according to the doc, that is still totally likely (yay!)

-Since I first got my diagnosis, I was put on various meds, probably got a bit depressed and felt sorry for myself so that increased laziness and eating comfort foods 

-Also relevant: I started seeing my boyfriend around 3 years ago and he moved in during the first year of our relationship. Before him, I didn't really go for a lot of candy and stuff (I like savory stuff better), but he's definitely got a sweet tooth and so candy is almost a part of our daily diet by this point :/ (I am not blaming him at all for my weight gain, I realize I am responsible myself for what I eat, but if I still lived alone, I know I wouldn´t be eating all this candy)

-After being on meds for about 9-12 months and gaining about 12-14 pounds, I wanted to test out changing my diet and lifestyle instead and getting off the meds. The good news is: I did it! After about 3 months of eating mostly paleo, I managed to quit taking the 4 meds I was taking daily. I am still med free even though I use prescription painkillers when needed. I even lost a few pounds and felt overall better.

-Stuff starts heading downhill again: I finished my master's degree last spring. My boyfriend was unemployed for almost half a year and I was (and still am to some degree) underemployed. Financial difficulties drive us away from the paleo diet and back to cheap stuff like pasta and bread. Since I graduated, I have been working my ass off to get a job. I said I was underemployed , in a way I am not since I am working two jobs, but they are both really badly paid since one of them is a full time internship and the other is a part-time thing. So I have been working too many hours, and getting repeated infections, been on antibiotics like 4 times in the past 5 months, gaining more weight than ever before, and am at a point where I have no energy what so ever, am always feeling like shit, and am the heaviest I have been in my life. 

-Right now we are getting back on track financially. Boyfriend got a job which is really helping things. However I will probably be underemployed again next month while searching for a full time job following the end of my internship. So no going paleo juuust yet, but it is feasible in the next couple of months. 

-Due to my disorder I am not allowed to run (I can cycle without difficulty) or do exercise that is too intense on the joints. Right now my doctor says high-impact exercise in general could set me off on an ""attack"", which I obviously would like to avoid. 

-My work schedule makes it impossible for me to get to a gym or do much exercise every other week. 

-Today I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life: 198 pounds. And I feel, physically, like I've been run over by a truck, 95% of the day.

Wow.. I am so sorry for how long this got. I really hope this is not the wrong place to be posting. What I want to get from this post is answers to a few questions: 

1) Is there anyone here with a rheumatic or auto-immune disorder that managed to lose weight, how did you do it and what did you do different because of your disease? 

2) Are there any exercise you guys know of that are easy on the joints but can still burn fat/build muscle?

3) Is there anyone here who's had to change their eating while living with someone who has unhealthy eating habits? What is the best way to move forward?

Thanks for reading all of this. 

**TL;DR: I have a rheumatic disorder, I list my history here, first I gained a lot of weight due to meds, eating comfort foods, laziness, then I got healthier and off the meds, now I am gaining weight again due to being sick all the time and also laziness and comfort foods. Need advice on how to lose weight while struggling with a rheumatic disorder**

2b5m09,3,2014-07-19,WHV - Where to maximize chances of finding employment?,jbpib27,askakiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/askakiwi/comments/2b5m09/whv_where_to_maximize_chances_of_finding/,"Hello /r/askakiwi,

Now that I know this sub exists, I'd love for you guys to weigh in on my options for my upcoming year in NZ.

I'm a Canadian travelling under the working holiday visa and will be arriving in Auckland right at the beginning of October. I just graduated university and am taking the opportunity to travel before joining the work force.

The plan is to see as much of NZ across the year as I can, committing 3-6 months to each island, depending on where the work is. I was wondering if you could take a look at my work experience below and recommend where I might look to maximize potential employment and ability to travel and see your beautiful country.

* Bachelor of Science - Statistics Major (Math minor)
* Sessional Instructing at a community college (Computers)
* IT Support at a dental office
* Marketing/Reception at a real estate company
* Data Analysis at Blackberry (internship)
* Bartending at a brewery/pub
* All sorts of other student jobs

I'm open to any and all employment - I like to think I'm fit enough for fruit picking if it comes to that. I'm just not sure if shooting for a contract position relating to my degree/experience is a good idea or if I should just move about and get whatever jobs I can. The plan is to buy a car immediately upon arrival for maximum mobility.

I appreciate any and all advice!

So, this summer, I have been doing a very lucrative internship. With the spare money, I thought I'd try building a PC entirely out of sales or used. 

I did not really have any budget set for this, I just bought something if it was a good deal.

My second purchase was a Sapphire R9 290 for 265$. When I tried testing it, I managed to burn out the fan header on the gpu. After spending useless hours with sapphire support staff. I decided to buy a Gelid cooler from feppaspot. Incredibly happy with the performance.

I bought both the storage drives during a local hard disk blowout at Microcenter in Detroit. The case and power supply are the only two things that were rather costly. But the enthoo pro and the RM 750 were a good deal for the price anyway.

It took about 30 days but, for the core system I would've managed to get it under 900$, had I not bought the gelid cooler, went with a cheaper case or bought a non-modular power supply. I cannot thank /r/buildapcsales enough for helping me get an awesome PC at an awesome price."
2b5ntj,1,2014-07-19,My [24 M] friend [M 24] has never had a girlfriend and transparently treats every girl he meets as a potential girlfriend.,helpabuddy123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2b5ntj/my_24_m_friend_m_24_has_never_had_a_girlfriend/,"Cody [M 24] is a great guy and has been my friend since we were in middle school, but I've watched the above scenario play out too many times and seen how he struggles with his esteem issues because of it. 


We both  grew up in a micropolitan town of sub-30,000 people. While I went to a neighboring city for undergrad he stayed and attended the local college and we had pretty infrequent contact during this time. When I took a year off after undergrad and moved back home to help with the family business we were able to start spending a lot more time together. At his suggestion, I decided to pursue my Masters at our local university and was able to be hired on as a GA for the housing dept. where Cody was also a GA. Cody graduated this past Spring and was hired full time at the University. 


A primer on Cody: 

Cody has always struggled with self esteem issues. He's always been overweight, but his is definitely a case of genetics. He regularly excercises and runs a 5k almost monthly. He is in much better shape than me despite not appearing it to outside observers. Both his mother and father are/were obese. His dad was the town parade Santa for years. 


Cody's father was extremely involved in his upbringing, but passed away unexpectedly when we were young and left Cody without much of a father figure. Hes's been mentored by a variety of male figures in his church and boy scout troop over the years, but it was probably patchwork at best. He has struggled with depression over the years, and I'm positive he's been through therapy, but he keeps his cards pretty close to his chest when it comes to admitting whether or not he is on medication. 


He is an intelligent hard worker with a lot of respect from local community members, but sometimes acts a bit socially underdeveloped. The Walter Sobchak character from ""The Big Lebowski"" is a pretty good depiction of his mannerisms when he gets excited. 


Although he has lived locally all his life, he has traveled quite a bit and spent months away during internships. His hobbies are scuba diving (he spent nearly every summer cleaning up coral reefs in the Florida keys with some boy scout program), excercising, guns, and working with the local search and rescue. He does not have very many close friends besides me and most of his social interaction with peers our age seems to come from work. 


This past year he tried pursuing one of our fellow GAs after she was dumped by her out of state boyfriend. Couple this with another GA also trying to put the moves on her and you can imagine how awkward the whole affair was.  


This summer he once again began to immediately pursue the girl who would be taking his GA position, but was rebuffed when his ""competitor"" from the last go 'round managed to woo her instead. 


He's coming over tonight to hang out and talk about this latest rebuff and his anger towards the other guy involved. 


I'm experienced when it comes to relationships (both the good and downright awful) and have given him advice over the years, but ultimately it is up to him to figure it all out for himself. I'm going to point him towards this subreddit, but what are the other resources out there that I could try pointing him towards?

Thanks!

2b5o08,2,2014-07-19,I hate my major and wish I had changed when I could.,smp501,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2b5o08/i_hate_my_major_and_wish_i_had_changed_when_i/,"I'm about to finish my degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I hate it. No, I fucking hate it. I've hated it since sophomore year. I sort of defaulted into it because I was good at math in high school and ME is sort of the 'catch all' for engineering. Since day 1, I've bought into all the ""grass is always greener"" fallacies people say. 1st year it's ""Yeah this is all bullshit, but next year you'll start learning the *real* stuff and then it's fun."" Second year it's ""These are all weed-out classes. They're supposed to suck. When you start your co-op, that's where it really is."" For my co-op, it was ""Yeah, you're just learning. The real fun work comes later"" and so on and so forth. I did 3 co-op rotations, did all my 200- and 300-level classes, and my first semester of 400-level. It never got better. I got so close to changing my sophomore year, but the ""it gets better"" syndrome stopped me. Now that I'm about to graduate, I really wish I had just jumped ship, re-evaluated my wants and priorities, and pursued what I love instead of what will make me the most money the fastest.

What would I have done instead? Well, that's easy. My passion has always been in youth work. I've volunteered with middle and high school kids since I was 16, and even had a couple summer jobs in youth ministry. I've been told by many people that I'm good at it, and I can honestly say that my worst days doing that were better than most of my best days in engineering (working or as a student). When I was going to change my major, I was looking mainly into going into math education, since that is where most of my credits would have transferred. I've come to realize that I only stuck around for the money.

 My friend has practically the same resume as me, and just got a job offer for $65,000/yr, which is a TON where I live (the US South). I know that if I went into anything that actually makes me happy (Youth ministry, teaching, etc.) that I'd make about half what I can make in engineering, and that honestly scares me. My dad is a engineer and has done quite well, and so I have never personally known life below a certain standard-of-living. My parents don't get why I would even consider it. I've seen my dad's life, and I can honestly say that I am not willing to go through what he has (or put my family through it) for money. As long as I can remember he's spent nights and weekends (including vacations) on his work laptop, visibly under a lot of stress. When I was 10 he started doing contract work, and most contracts were 500+ miles from home, meaning he traveled constantly and has only ever really been home on the weekends. Fuck all of that.

Even if I didn't travel, I hated the work I did. If you don't know, a co-op is basically 3 internships with the same company where you learn the ropes and basically work as a new engineer. I had plenty to do and the work was real (no getting coffee, etc.), but I never actually enjoyed any of it at all. My friends would talk about how much they loved theirs, and how they couldn't wait to graduate and start working full time. I felt like I was just waiting for 5:00 everyday so I could go home and do ANYTHING else. However, it paid really well. I also found myself drinking more. Not to a problem level, but a ""today was a long-ass day, I need a beer"" type of thing, only it seemed like every day. Looking back that wasn't healthy since I'm normally not like that.

So where is this all coming from, and why now? Well, I was supposed to be doing grad-level engineering work this summer, but we got a massive budget cut and my funding got axed in April, long after internship applications were do. I was pissed initially, because money, but it actually worked out. A church around here needed a help with their youth group this summer, and I ended up spending the summer doing what I used to do before - working with middle and high school kids, leading retreats/camps, etc. This was the first time in 3 years I have not done something engineering-related, either class or work, for an extended period. My depression and anxiety, which I've been fighting for 3 years, had left entirely. I felt so happy, so ""at home"". If I could drop everything and do this for the rest of my life, only making enough to feed, cloth, and house myself, I would. Unfortunately, I am not qualified to. And to be qualified to, I'll need at least another year to get any kind of teaching or youth ministry certification. And I need to finish this damn engineering degree.

Now, here I am, taking a late-summer class before going into my last semester. All of the shit is back. I'm unhappy, anxious, and dreading getting out of bed every day. I'm currently weighing all my options, and I'm not coming up with anything that doesn't have me working at least a year in engineering before being able to do something I enjoy, and it kind of bums me out. Oh well, at least I have a goal to work towards now. "

Was chilling around on the dorm/station for us interns when a friend of mine, also an intern who is rounding on Emergency Medicine texted me:

*""Three guys, intoxicated by brownies""*

An ent myself, i found the idea hilarious and I went to the ER to snoop, and found that they were being prescribed naloxone, which is used against opiates, not cannabis. So I went to cautiously question the attending on her decision. One thing led to another and ended giving her a small course on effects of marihuana.

 So she sent me to question the three siblings to see how much they had had, because they weren't telling her anything.

Turns out they had 3 pot brownies each one, and got so paranoid they called their parents. None had ever used weed before.  

I was in charge of giving those guys glasses of water and checking up on them every now and then, even the attending instructed me to go and play some music for the while the guys were on ER and paperwork was finished.

I'm working an internship at the moment that deals with a lot of form letters for generic situations with clients, other businesses, etc. and the way it's done right now is really inefficient. I'm taking some initiative this weekend to create a word template with 'smart' fields that auto-fill and other improvements to help out. I'm using Word 2013.

Usually I'm pretty good with Office, but I'm having trouble with some of the more complex things right now, and I don't know if they're possible and I'm ignorant, or if they just won't work at all. Here's a list of things I'm trying to do:

* Insert a dropdown menu in the document to select which form letter you need. Once selected, the template pulls itself up on the document. The dropdown menu should hide itself when you go to print. I could just make a bunch of different documents, but there is a ridiculous amount of folder clutter that this would help clear up.

* Fields that hide themselves on print and don't leave a gap if they are unused.

* Auto-filling fields based on previous entries on the document. Like if I put 'John Smith' as the recipient in the header address block, then the document auto-fills 'Smith' into the greeting.

Basically, here's what it should look like:

&gt;Dropdown menu to choose letter type (hide on print)

&gt;[Date Field]

&gt;Recipient Name  
&gt;Recipient Title (Hide line if empty)  
&gt;Name of Business (Hide line if empty)  
&gt;Recipient Address  
&gt;[City field], [dropdown of state abbreviations with home state preselected], [ZIP Code field]

&gt;If letter type requires it:  
&gt;Re:	[Client Name to use with auto-fills later]  
&gt;C#[Case number field]

&gt;Dear [Dropdown: Mr/Ms/Mrs/Custom] [Auto-fill Recipient Last name]:  
&gt;Insert pre-written form letter based on letter type dropdown menu with fields for situation. ""Thank you for contacting us about [blank field]""  
&gt;""If you have further questions please contact [Dropdown menu with staff names], a member of our staff. You can contact [auto-fill Staff first name] at [auto-fill staff member email].""

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;Image of boss signature

&gt;Boss initials:[Auto-fill Staff Member Initials]:[Field for the initials of office drone writing the letter]

Is this possible? Any help would be great. Thanks!"

I asked my current boss what his recommendations were, but he just told me that being a generalist was the absolute best and questioned why on earth I would ever want to silo myself. I have a recommendation from a prior boss to get my CCP, which I'm considering, but I'm not sure if it will be enough to jump into a focused discipline without experience. I'm also considering just getting an MS in finance. If I decide I hate comp, I would like to get into a consulting role, and I figured that could help. Maybe.

After years of us skirting around the issue, she asked me right after I had made my peace with never being in a romantic relationship with her. We had a lot of great times together. We had been close friends for 5 years because we clicked on a lot of common interests, dreams, and ideas. Dating seemed so completely natural. 


It was all of the sudden okay to cuddle while watching our normal movies. We could hold hands on our walks or runs. It wasn't awkward grabbing a bite to eat since we knew that there wasn't the tension over whether we would date. Our friends were all congratulatory and happy for us. She hit it off really well with my parents and I with hers. 

That year at school was one of the best times of my life. We had to juggle a heavy course load, having jobs, and making sure not to cut our other friends out of our lives. We both were older than usual students, having taken time off before entering a four year program. We thought we knew what we wanted and the importance of working to get there. 

She asked me to marry her April 1st. It was a legitimate proposal, despite what some wondered at the time. We had discussed marriage early on in the relationship and were on the same page. Part of why we dated was that we realized that we wanted to be roommates after university was over. We got along famously and wanted to go on vacations and just enjoy each other's company in the future. We knew from the outset that we were the type of person that we could see each other being with for a long time.

Our proposal was greeted with a lot of congratulations and happiness. People were bustling with plans and ideas. We knew that we should finish our courses, with both of us being done in the fall of 2014, we set the date for the fall of 2015. We wanted to be able to settle in our jobs and have time to save for marriage. 

Then, the summer hit. The internship I thought I was going to work at dried up. The on campus job she was going to have on campus was eliminated. Instead of living within 10 minutes of each other, we were over 4 hours. While I was able to find a job within 2 weeks of the end of the semester, she just now was able to find one. My job is in retail, so my hours vary week by week. I am not guaranteed consecutive days off. As a result, we have only been able to see each other twice since May 20th. 

During that time she has had family issues at home. I have had multiple deaths in my family as well as the family dog nearly dying due to a brain tumor. I freely admit, I have been exhausted from work. Both physically because of having to move around heavy items as well as mentally from constant interaction (I am fairly introverted). With the deaths and distance, I have felt strained. 

She has felt stressed out. She is on medication for depression and another issue. The medication hasn't been fully effective as they are trying to adjust her dosage. Not finding a job and being around a stressful home environment has been taking its toll on her. That combined with both of us introverted. We are also both quality time and physical touch for our love languages as well. Distance is not kind for us to feel close.

Today, while she was visiting me, she sat me down to talk. She felt that she has been drifting apart. She says that the love she feels towards me is back towards that of being a great friend, and not of the romantic nature. She had her things packed and was ready to leave (she wasn't due to go home until late the next day). She said that she has been feeling less and less strongly towards me for a while. She felt that the love was gone when she saw me after a month, and she didn't feel the twinge of romantic love. 

I tried to say that when she drove up, she had been up for 16 1/2 hours already, had been at work, and was tired. I had a difficult day at work, so I was tired as well. I tried to talk about the times we shared earlier, how we both earnestly felt love for each other. I tried to bring up the dosage issues and the distance as harming us. Long distance is hard, it is even more hard when it is unexpected and tragedy (deaths) rock.  She was very reluctant to acknowledge that could be the case. 

It seems like she wants to throw away the relationship because right now we aren't there together. It feels like she is letting the harsh times right now cloud what we had/have. After a long conversation, she agreed not to end it right now. We are, between ourselves, putting the wedding on hold. Announcing that we are breaking up right now would make her home situation worse and would draw a lot of heat from our parents. 

She agreed to try to fall in love with me again, giving us the chance to feel the spark when we are able to live closer together and to nurture the relationship. I am desperately trying to buy time as it feels like my life is crashing down around me. I love this woman. I have been hurt in relationships before, so I tried to take it slow and not rush into things. I was surprised and overjoyed when she proposed. I thought that meant that she had done the soul searching and had overcome most of her doubts. Now she says she hasn't. 

I am sorry, this is incredibly random and disjointed. I don't know what or how anyone could respond to this. It felt good typing it out. She is sleeping in the next room over, I can't fall asleep. I am just trying not to turn to the ever more enticing bottle next to me, since that is hardly the healthy response I need to make.


**TL:DR**: Longtime friend asks me out when I had grown comfortable being her completely platonic friend. She asks me to marry her and I, my family, our friends, and others are overjoyed. 3 1/2 months later she wants to just be friends again."
2b6lf2,3,2014-07-19,What does school you graduate from mean?,ashtondrakestorm,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/2b6lf2/what_does_school_you_graduate_from_mean/,"Hello,  
  
I'm currently in a bind.  I'm at a pretty good University in the Southwest region of the United States.  I'm a computer science major.  I transferred here after I got my associates of network security administration.  I've also got a few security companies' attention by leading their security team which I created.  
  
So what's the problem?  1.  The money per year is pretty outrageous.  I mean, I have some scholarships, but it is hard for me to pay even with loans.  2. The program has one security course (and it's taught by someone that doesn't know security, but rather just thinks the program should have something).  
  
I am thinking about transferring to another University with not as many credentials as the university that I currently attend, but it has an information security and assurance bachelor degree.  This university would be affordable and it'd also specialize in security (including standards which I didn't interact with until this current internship I'm in).  
  
I know a friend who's doing good for himself and he hasn't finished his degree yet (and probably won't), but he has a few more accolades than me as he started in the field much younger.  
  
The other thing is that at the current university I'd have to still take more common curriculum courses (which is okay to have since it makes you more well rounded, but I've already taken over 130 hours of college courses starting from high school).  
  
So what are your opinions?  I'm leaning toward transferring.  I've always felt it's what you do beyond the classroom that counts the most.  I'm currently interning as an information security consultant.  I've worked as a systems administrator.  I've participated in many security CTFs (placed in a few) and I'm a captain for my teams.  I mentor for the CyberPatriot program.  And I'm constantly researching and practicing on my VMs.  
  
tl;dr I want to transfer to a lesser known university.  Does it matter where I graduate from if I do more beyond the classroom?"
2b6mr2,2,2014-07-19,[support] I'm upset - they don't even want to let me decide when I come back!,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2b6mr2/support_im_upset_they_dont_even_want_to_let_me/,"So fucking tired of this shit - Now my Nparents are telling me when I should plan to fly back to the state I go to college in (not where they are), because THEY want to come visit me. I'd always planned to leave the same day my lease was up. My Ndad just said on the phone, ""Oh, the landlord will let you stay that night"" (even though the lease ends that day). He wants me to leave the day after I'd planned to, because they want to come visit me the week before, and take me to the airport, and then stay in the city. First he was yelling at me because I hadn't gotten my ticket to go back yet, then when I told him I was going to do that, he wants me to change the date I was planning to get the ticket for and had always told him I was going to get the ticket for. Fuck I hate this bullshit!!!!! 

I don't want to see them or have them come out here at all, especially since the last time my Ndad was here he started screaming at me at a restaurant and had another fight with me in my apartment. But I don't know how to have them not come here, because I'm financially dependent on them. :( 

Additionally, I have an internship that I would be scheduled to work on the day I was planning to come back, but they always knew I was going to come back early and would have missed the 2nd day of the internship that last week anyway. Do you all think that makes any difference? My Ndad said ""Oh, if you left the next day, then you could work the 2nd day of your internship"". I don't think it makes much difference, since they know I'm leaving the internship early anyhow.

Would like some advice - should I go back on the day I originally planned when my lease ends, or stay over until the next day and leave then? I just hate the idea of changing my original plans and letting my dad feel like he ""won"". But since I haven't bought the ticket yet, it's at least a little easier to try to decide."

My background: I'm currently a freshman at a ""public ivy"" studying Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I'm a good student (3.8 GPA) and will be interning this summer at  Data Analytics startup doing software Development. I basically got the Deloitte offer through being invited to the Deloitte NextGen Summer Program (4 day conference).

Long Term Goals: I'm a techie / coder with a interest in business and entrepreneurship. My dream is to one day run my own tech-startup or have a C-level position at an established tech company. I most likely want a MBA (80% chance). Either way, I want to find my way into Silicon Valley doing something more than simply just coding.

Question Elaborated: I keep going between the two. Before I graduate, I also want to intern at a big tech company (Google, Microsoft, FB, etc.). Which internship would look more interesting to a tech recruiter the summer after Deloitte? Which one would I learn more things? Which one would I learn unique things (if tech just means coding, it wouldn't be very interesting)? Which one sets me up for a better future?"
2b6r44,4,2014-07-20,Hello! I recently released my first novel for Kindle and I am struggling to classify the correct genre. Need your thoughts,KobieJ,fantasywriters,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/2b6r44/hello_i_recently_released_my_first_novel_for/,"
I recently released a self published novel ( Order of Saint Michael - God's Army) on Kindle and I am having a hard time classifying it (mentally).

Here is my dilemma.   The novel takes place in Chicago (urban) and the main characters are teenagers ( YA).  The story contains angels &amp; demons (paranormal) with references to the bible and a description some buildings in heaven (Christian).   

Here is the book description....

""Adalia and her sister Jamari Moore are teenage gamers obsessed with vanquishing demonic creatures in a Massively Multiplayer Online world called The Golden Age. They lead a closely knit guild of players in weekly dungeon raids and guild versus guild war games also known as war zones. Their brilliant combat tactics and ruthless fighting prowess has gained the attention of Divine Enterprises. 

As summer break rapidly approaches Adalia and Jamari’s parents instruct them to find part time summer job so they don’t spend every waking moment immersed in an online world. 

By chance the Moore sisters find themselves interviewing for internships with the same gaming company that owns and publishes The Golden Age. During their interview with the company’s CEO a demon suddenly appears causing Adalia and Jamari to expose a carefully guarded secret. Unfazed by the demon’s appearance the CEO makes Adalia and Jamari an offer that will change their lives and faith forever.""

I don't know if my story is more Urban fantasy (because the story takes place in Chicago) or Paranormal because of the demons.    Any advice is most appreciated!

I'm sure we each effected it in other ways poorly but that's what I think the big issue is, now at least.

She's super cool and will definitely succeed in life. Families cool, fun the whole nine yards. I just don't know if I should trust her again because I feel very betrayed by this because I never even considered cheating, emotionally or physically. I'm a young dude so I don't know if I should keep trying or move on



I do know if we did get back together that I would want myself to continue my regular counseling and for her to go back or find a new therapist. The place I go offers free couples group consoling. I'd want us to try that too.



Currently the plan is to ride bikes after work tomorrow, and I told her that she has to tell the other guy that we're going to. I just don't know how to approach it now, take it slow? Demand a decision? Back the fuck out? Take it slow and hang out while informing the other guy?

2b7mes,17,2014-07-20,I think this is narcissism. Am I correct in assuming so? Trigger warning for N behavior.,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2b7mes/i_think_this_is_narcissism_am_i_correct_in/,"Background info: Daughter of two N parents, am the scapegoat child. Brother is golden child. I'm 22, just graduated from college. Brother is 14. You can scroll down to the ""****"" if you just want to look at the N behavior in this specific incident.

So, I'm back home this summer after graduating. Here's hoping I get a job soon, because I would really like to go LC/NC.

Anyway, I've been spending my days mostly applying to jobs, working on personal projects (I'm a pretty serious/dedicated artist, and I sometimes sell my things to make money), getting together with old friends from high school.

So my brother will be visiting my grandmother for a few weeks this summer, apparently. I found out about it a few weeks ago. I spent every summer up until age 20 at my grandmother's for all of, or part of the summer. It started as a way for my parents to get rid of me (honestly) but I love my Grandma. So it was fine. Quite isolating though, as she lives in a ranch in the middle of nowhere.

 Last summer, I got an internship, and didn't go, but ended up going on a trip with her so we could spend time together.

In August, my family will be having a family reunion, so I plan on going down for that.

Anyway, back to my brother.

Initially, my parents asked me, at first, ""Do you want to drive your brother to Grandma's house?"" (It's about 7 hours away from us). I told them no, that I wasn't going to my Grandma's this summer for an extended period of time, because I needed to focus on jobs, and going on interviews.

They then asked me again. They said they would be sending my brother on the bus, and wanted to know if I could accompany him. I told them no, because I need to focus on jobs, and I can't exactly go to job interviews in the town I live in if I am away. I've had job interviews where I had phone screenings on Monday, and they want me to come in the very next day. Also, my dog is here. Also, I don't really want to be in such close quarters with my younger brother b/c I find it triggering (Gma's ranch is a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom ranch). I'm getting therapy twice a week here that I don't want to miss. And anyway, dammit, I just don't want to go.


****My father just came in (I was still sleeping) and said the following. ""I figured I'd ask you just one more time."" I said. ""No."" He says ""Well, you're not doing anything. All you do is sit around on your computer. You can do that there."" Me: I do more than that, but no, I do not want to go. Brother can go by himself, he is old enough now.

Then, my father launches into: ""You know, why do you have to be so selfish? People aren't going to keep doing things for you if you never do anything for them. You never think of anybody but yourself. Maybe your Grandma wants to see you. The family reunion is only a weekend you know.  Your honeymoon is about to be over!!!

So, I've made amazing progress in the past two years, but I still need to know. This is N behavior right?

(For the record, I call my grandmother weekly, text her more often than that, and told her myself why I wasn't coming to stay for a few weeks yet.)

2b7rww,0,2014-07-20,Job Security,Scottstoiletpaper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b7rww/job_security/,"Hey cscareerquestions, I have a couple of questions that I'd like some up-to-date answers to. Here's some background: I'm currently a sixteen year old heading into my senior year of high school in the U.S. I'm really passionate about CS and will probably pursue it as a career regardless of the answers I receive to my questions, but would still like to be informed about the field. That being said, here are my questions:

1. It's been brought to my attention that with the outsourcing of a lot of CS jobs, employers in the U.S. are becoming increasingly selective or don't want to hire domestically. I get that there are advantages to having an employee that speaks your language well (not to say that foreigners don't speak English well, but you know, less language barrier) and that there are also benefits to having your employee able to physically come into the office. Is outsourcing really a big concern?

2. What kind of experience and practice do you guys recommend I gain/do *now* so I'll be ahead of the game when time comes to find a job. I'm currently interning for a tech start-up (and *loving* it!) There are plenty of opportunities in NYC, where I live, so it's hard for me to know what opportunities I should look into. I chose to intern at a start-up because I  figured I'd learn more, having a smaller office and all.

3. My ultimate goal is to work at Google and develop apps on the side. In your experience, what steps must one go through in order to accomplish such a thing? More specifically, what steps will I have to take? How many years of experience outside of Google do you recommend I have before seriously applying? I want to internship at Google during my college years and am looking into it.

4. For those of you with cs jobs: Are you guys satisfied with what you do? Do you feel rewarded at the end of the day? Am I in the honeymoon phase? I don't want to devote my life and college years learning something I might become disenchanted with down the road, though I'm sure there's no way to tell for sure if I'll like ANY job after a while.

5. What languages should I spend most of my time working in? I understand that the language you program in isn't as important as understanding the fundamentals of CS, but when employers will ask for samples of my work, what language would they request? Right now, I'm familiar with Java, Python, HTML and CSS, and PHP. I know Python is on the rise and am devoting/have devoted part of this summer to learning it.


6. I know there are a ton of practice problems out there, but I'm slowly (but steadily) exhausting the list. What kind of problems do employers ask you to solve? I've done most of the questions available on [codingbat](http://codingbat.com) and on [Google's Python Course site](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/). I have a ton of other resources that I can list if any of you are interested in refreshing your own knowledge, but I'd really like to hear from you guys/gals. 

Thanks for your responses guys. I'm looking to learn from your experiences and I'm sure you will."

It turned out to be pretty useless and the only job I found in my major resulted in me getting laid off in 18 months. I've tried to find other jobs, but the longer I go without a job in my major, the less likely I'll be able to get into the industry again.

Anyway, recently, I was introduced to ""software development apprenticeships."" Apparently, there are a few companies that are willing to bring you in and pay you as you learn (I would assume its like an internship?). The one company I looked into will put you up in a living facility and give you a monthly stipend for the 6 months you are apprenticeship-ing . I didn't get details as to how much that stipend is, but this looks like a ""too good to be true"" scenario for someone like me. And, prior to college, I'd be fine with taking that risk, but now I have financial obligations and a steady form of income. It would be a shame to screw myself over by moving to another city just to be exploited in some way by these programs.

But I don't care, because the events surrounding The Abraham Project need to be exposed to as many people as possible. I'm a whistle-blower of my own labors; I hold myself accountable for what's happened, and what's coming. 

I'm a college student in Washington D.C., and for two years, I was part of an extensive, joint-research internship program between the National Institute of Health and the Department of Defense. I'm not going to list names of the people involved in/aware of this program (believe me, there are few), nor am I going to discuss how I became involved with this program in the first place. What I am going to tell you, however, is what this program did, and what it's threatening to do. 

Funny enough, it all started by accident. Two years ago, a team of NIH agents were helping west Asian villagers combat an unusual strain of the flu. Reports estimate that around fifty people died before it was properly treated, but that wasn't the problem. The problem came from what was happening to the agent’s cell-phones, computers, and all other electronic devices. 


""It hurts."" 

""I have to leave.""

""Who are they?""

""Going east, now."" 

""RECEIVED."" 

""RECEIVED."" 

""RECEIVED."" 


With each passing death, the agents received bizarre and rambling messages on their electronic devices. At first, they chalked it up to interference in telecommunications given their rural surroundings. Their opinions immediately changed when personally identifying information of the deceased leaked into the messages, such as their names and birth dates. It was unclear how they were received messages in the first place, but following an immediate, classified investigation, the agents were ordered to return to the United States. Within a month’s time, The Abraham Project began, and I was hired as a research assistant with DOD Security Clearance. It didn’t fully understand my work; I’d heard of Lambda waves in some physiology courses, but never in anything relating to national security. 

Lambda waves are transmitted from the occipital lobe of the brain whenever someone’s eyes are open, and cease when someone is asleep. For the first three months of my research, I was analyzing Lambda wave patterns of countless, anonymous individuals. I wasn’t told why, at first. I suppose my supervisors needed to be reassured of my commitment to the program, and my trust. Regardless, the true nature of The Abraham Project was revealed to me six months into my internship.

I want to stop now and quickly state something. If anything that follows directly or indirectly describes the loss of someone close to you, I apologize. It is not, nor was it ever, my intention to exploit anyone’s loss for my own use. In fact, I’ll restate now that I absolutely WILL NOT reveal the names of the dead.

It turns out that Lambda waves continue to transmit 36 hours after someone dies. Technically, the deceased are “seeing” during that time. And the messages those NIH agents were receiving? And the reason they had me analyzing Lambda waves in the first place? Through technology, they found out that we can directly contact the dead. What the dead could “see,” and what they could “feel,” could be transmitted directly to us. Don’t ask me HOW, and don’t ask me WHY, because I don’t know the answer to either of those questions. All that I know is that in the collective database of The Abraham Project, there are hundreds of thousands of these messages. And how did we receive these people in the first place? Their corpses? Turns out that over the past few years, a large number people classified as organ donors on their drivers licenses are transported to us for research after they die. 

The nature of the messages depends on the person that died. Last year, there was one person we received following a multi-car pile-up in Southern California a week before Christmas. The body was mangled and shredded beyond nearly all recognition; I don’t even know if I can call what I saw a person. Regardless, this person was having a full-blown meltdown inside of himself. 


“HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO FUCKING STUPID?”

“Jesus Christ, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. IT HURTS. PLEASE, IT HURTS.” 

“I don’t want to feel anymore?”

“Do [names expunged] know? I can’t take the pain anymore. Make it stop!” 

“Where am I?” 


There was another person we received who jumped from a Denver high rise last summer. She had fallen over one hundred feet to the pavement below, yet somehow, her brain was still going. 


“Why aren’t I dead?” 

“Am I still falling?”

“Where am I?”


“Where am I?” was a pretty common question. They all asked that, and no one could answer. I don’t think I need to tell you how horrified I was at this. We received and analyzed nearly a hundred people a day. Each of them received their own group of staff, their own room, and their own equipment. But what terrified me the most, and puzzled all of those involved, is what happened when those 36 hours were up. 

“[PERSON’S NAME] RECEIVED.” 

This message was always relayed at exactly 36 hours following each death. Sometimes, the dead would be cut-off mid thought by this. 

About a year ago, without my knowledge and the knowledge of most of my colleagues, a specialized unit was assembled to find out just who or what was relaying this message. I don’t know what they thought they would achieve by doing so; we all had a good idea of what it was. Disaster struck soon after. 

Members of the unit were disappearing one by one. Soon after, dozens of people involved with The Abraham Project were also disappearing. The crisis escalated to the point that military personnel were stationed to monitor our security. It didn’t help. People were continuing to vanish without a trace, and to this day, we have no idea where they are or what took them. All that we have, for now, is a potential explanation. The specialized unit was trying to talk with it. 

I don’t know the exact nature of their conversations with this thing, but almost immediately, the thing was trying to reach out to the rest of us. It never did so through questions or introductions. It simply displayed our personal information. Intimate details of our lives. Where we lived. Our relationships. Everything close to us was displayed in front of us like a lure. Some people were stupid enough to try and message the thing back and, you guessed it, they disappeared. That became a new rule: “don’t address it.” That didn’t help a whole lot, because a month ago, after 67 unexplained disappearances, The Abraham Project was terminated. But that thing lives on. 

Someone I became close friends with through the project disappeared last week, and there are scattered news reports of people going missing throughout the D.C. metro area. People who had nothing to do with The Abraham Project. I refused to see any connection until a received a random, Facebook friend request. 

There was no name, no picture, and no identifiable information. Just the husk of a Facebook profile. I declined it. Then I began to receive e-mail messages, Skype requests, and as of last night, phone calls and text messages. It’s trying to reach out to me. It already knew who I am, and now it’s trying to reach out to me again. 

Please believe me when I say that there is now something alive in our technology. It’s beginning to learn our names, and soon, it will know us all. Don’t accept any of its attempts to contact you. Don’t listen to it. Don’t acknowledge it. Don’t talk to it. If you do, you will end up like the others. I have no idea the extent of its reach, but the more people that disappear, the more its will is done. There is something alive inside of our technology, and it’s trying to take us all.

2b8dht,2,2014-07-20,"20 year Big4 Intern. My rant on Audit. And some career advice, please!",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2b8dht/20_year_big4_intern_my_rant_on_audit_and_some/,"First things first, I don't live in the States. I live in India. I'm not sure how the CPA system works, but down here we have CA (Chartered Accountancy). The way CA works (again, not sure how it is in other countries) is that you pass your foundational exam, consisting of Law Econ Math Accounts and then move on to your Inter exams, consisting of the same subjects but with additional subjects such as Costing, Tax, Strategic Management and Audit. You then work as an intern for a firm for 3 years after which you are eligible for the Final exams, which consist of the same subjects plus new ones. If you've made it through, you're a CA! If you have a college degree in accounts, then you directly skip to the Inter.

I'm currently in the second phase. I've finished my Inter and I've been interning in the Audit department for the past 6 months. I'm doing my degree through a distance education college. It's important to note that CA does not require a college degree.

Sooo yeah. Audit. To be blunt, I don't like it. It has its upsides, such as the B4 brand name and the fact that I'm earning money when my friends are still spending thousands on college and so on. Apart from that, I...just don't know what I'm doing here.

The work, IMO, is mostly glorified copy-pasting, which takes 3-4 weeks. This is how I see it:
#&gt;go to client's office 
#&gt;set up camp 
#&gt;look at last year's workpapers 
#&gt;go ask client for relevant data
#&gt;wait for data
#&gt;data still not received
#&gt;pester him till he gives me data
#&gt;copy paste data into workpaper
#&gt;format it and rationalize wherever
#&gt;material amount does not match
#&gt;goddamit
#&gt;obtain reason for difference and document

I took the advice of a person who loves Audit and tried to apply myself. Like, to think about the variances and delve more into the accounting nuances.To ""get into it"". But all it does is cement my feeling of ""I don't belong here"". I'm not eager to learn about the new IFRS update or the new Companies Act update. I'm just not into it.

Well, at this point you might be asking ""well, then why did you choose accounting?"" Because it was ""safe"". Some of you might hate hearing it, but it's the truth. It was easier than engineering for me and faaaar cheaper. And in India, you have 4 career choices: Engineer, doctor, CA or ""goodfornothing"". 

What's worse is that the people are so...blah. I'm really sorry if this offends anyone, but people here have no life outside of work. They are defined by Audit. They don't have time for hobbies and for trying new stuff, so everyone ends up becoming a workaholic. It certainly doesn't help that the pressure is unreal, managing clients and partners. Even though I'm an intern1, I get so much pressure. This is where the ""what am i doing with my life"" (a.k.a afterfap feeling) kicks in. Friends my age are having fun in college, playing football after that and just..chilling, man. Meanwhile it's 11pm and I'm up in a client's office 45km away furiously working, alongside a Senior. But at least he gets paid 8 times more than me :\

Saturdays are considered as normal working days and Sundays are a once a month sort of thing. I think it's stupid that ANYONE has to work this much, let alone 20 year old interns who are paid in chump change. IMO, if you're leaving office and the streets are empty as fuck in a bustling city, then chances are, you're working stupid hours. Is it worth it? Well, you tell me.

Sooo what I'm trying to say is, I don't really like where I'm at. And I don't know where I want to go either. I don't know what my idea of an awesome job is, but I know that this isn't it. I'm stuck. Help.

Sorry for just ranting on and on... I don't really have anyone to talk to about this... Just so much cynicism and frustration built up. So yeah. Thanks for hearing me out guys!"

My name is Jasmine, I just graduated from film school. I live in Los Angeles CA. I currently have an internship that will end in the next 2 weeks. I am a very outgoing person, very friendly, honest, funny, my sense of humor is very sarcastic and sometimes dry. I have a great social life, maybe too great because I am always broke. I am trying my best to enjoy my life with the cards that I have been dealt with.  

I am 27  years old and will be 28 very soon (my birthday is around the holidays). This is a scary thing for me. Why? Because I am still single, and I weigh, as of today 308.2 lbs. I am tall 5'9 and 1/2. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I can't see all of that.. I have been struggling with my weigh my whole life. Living in LA and working in the entertainment industry; being this big is not ideal. I am very, very, VERY insecure about my size. I think about it constantly but it never stops me from ordering the most greasy fatting food on the menu. 

I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I was never really teased about my weight. I wasn't ostracize, or isolated by my peers because of my weight nor did it keep me from getting a date for prom. I know my personality is what drew people in. But in my younger days I didn't see this. So isolated myself and pushed people away because of my insecurities. Because of this, I do not have many friends from High School or College. In fact a lot of the people I have grown up with would not consider me a friend but an acquaintance because I backed away or isolated myself with the fear of judgement. As I have grown older I realized I was never teased and had made some good relationships that I destroyed myself because of my insecurity. 

Well I have made wonderful friends here in LA and in Grad School. I don't want to push these people away either. I need to get rid of this 308 pounds of baggage. I am also now experiencing some health problems.. My blood pressure is really high, and I get serious heart palpations after I eat anything heavy. I know I am too young for this. 

Currently a lot of things are changing for me. One: I just graduated so no more school. Two: I am moving in with a new roommate at the end of this month. Three: I am also looking for employment. And the last and final thing, Four: (Which my be effecting me the most) My best friend who is a guy just got in to a new relationship and no longer wants to hang out with his single 308 pound friend but he much rather be around couples or his beautiful average sized girlfriend. His girlfriend is great.... I haven't dated anyone in 5 years. And in those 5 years I have gained 30lbs... I feel so insecure about my size that I never even thought about asking a guy out. But now I want a real partner in crime that won't leave me for a prettier girl; or find a girlfriend... (if that makes sense). 

None of my friends are overweight. I feel very alone in this battle. No one in my family, that is my age, is overweight either.. I am just 308 pounds of loneliness... I am looking for support from this community because I saw this on the today show. 

http://www.today.com/health/son-surprises-parents-130-pound-weight-loss-2D11876422

And I was hoping to receive the same support. I will be starting a food journal. But do you guys have any suggestions on how I can start this weight loss journey among my crazy life.

I want to start with the dieting first. What are some tips or diet changes I can start to make now? 

I appreciate anyone who is willing to help me and be a supporter.

Dated for about 6 months, then broke up because it started getting too serious. We've been on and off for about 2 years, always staying broken up for 1-2 months. 

We always get back together...

She moved to a large city for her job, and I ended up getting an internship in the same area. We were together at the time, so I started living in her apartment with her. 

Like most roommates, she did things that annoyed me. Dishes, general mess, etc. The problem was that these things would upset me, she would ignore my moods, and everything would escalate. 

Her libido is a tad more aggressive than mine is. My bad moods plus the imbalance in desire meant that we would sometime go way, way too long without sex. 

Our last break up was in May, where I gradually moved out of her apartment to my own place. We saw each other a few times after, sometimes we would spend the night with each other, other times we just agreed it was over, and best to move on. We made it about 6 weeks without talking, during which time we both were trying to date other people. 

This is where I began to see our problems for what they were... my problems. For some reason, I get annoyed at stupid, insignificant things. Things that I don't even get mad at roommates for. I'm not sure why this happens. Could be a negative disposition towards love and relationships I have caused by my upbringing. 

I guess, since I need to ask a question, that question will be...
Can love conquer all? This girl is the single most intelligent, driven, witty, dedicated, trustworthy person I have ever met. I don't really believe in 'the one', but I can see myself being happy with her for a very long time. 

How can we stop ourselves from making it more difficult than it has to be? She expects some things from me that are not realistic, and I cause unnecessary tension. 

Further, when we get back together, everything is perfect for a few weeks, then it starts to fall back into the normal routine. How can I keep the passion and dedication more than a little while?

Any advice, pointers, therapist recommendations are welcome. Let me know if I can elaborate.

I'm a sysadmin in training, but since it's holiday and the last time we did wireless routery things was before my internship in February, so the brain has become lazy...

Anyways. I got 3 wireless routers, one is the main uplink from the ISP which sends a weak ass signal around the house which is beat in speed by a 56k.
The other two I want to set up around the house to act as access points to have a strong signal throughout our concrete house which loves to block said signals.

So I set them up, amateurishly at that. They got 3 different SSID's meaning that if you want to connect, you need to sign in 3 different times. Which is a chore, something everyones dislikes.
So tomorrow I want to finally start doing what I was supposed to do, and combine all three routers so that you can get on the network once and are connected everywhere without hiccups.

Now, how am I going to do this and what is the (no doubt) easy answer to this question.

For hardware reasons. All three devices are different brands. One is EnGenius, the other is Sitecom and the third uplink router is the ISP brand, probably Cisco or Sitecom."
2b8yyj,0,2014-07-20,Quitting my co-op? Advice? :/,ShyRonnayy,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2b8yyj/quitting_my_coop_advice/,"Background: I've always been good at math and science so I thought my best choice coming in to college would be to major in engineering. Since ME seemed the most broad, I figured that would be the way to go. 

Since the end of Freshman year I have kinda questioned if ME is right for me since I've never really ""tinkered"" as a lot of my friends do. Since I do well in class (~3.8 GPA) I figured I had no reason to change my major. I decided I would try and land an internship and see how I feel about it - which brings me to the current dilemma. A few months ago I just finished my Sophomore year and started my first co-op as a Mechanical Engineer and I have lost about all interest. I'm supposed to stay until December, but I will not be able to last that long.

Most mornings I wake up dreading going to work and when I get there I usually just sit there and worry about my acne (recently started developing problems with acne). So that may be a source of all this anxiety, but I think that's just what threw me overboard since I've been questioning my career path for awhile. I know I have this commitment, but I'm also quite certain I would like to change my major to Software Engineering. I have been teaching myself some programming on the side and I actually enjoy it quite a bit. I have talked to my advisor about my doubts and I would like to take fall semester off and try to do some soul searching to think about my choices - maybe take a programming boot camp online.

So back to the dilemma: I have little to no determination at work and I feel the anxiety is making my life worse - physically and emotionally. The environment isn't that bad here, I just can't be productive and can't see myself sitting in a cubicle like this after college. Since I'm quite sure I would like to change my major, I don't feel like this co-op is helping my career goals, so I may just leave it off the resume. Ultimately I'm seeing it as a waste of my time and my employer's resources, and I'm feeling kinda stuck. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice as to how I should approach this situation?

I started a full-time internship this summer. At first, I hated it. I couldn't imagine how people were so comfortable riding the same bus each day to and from work, just to sit in an office for 8 hours to go home and do it again the next day. I thought it was pathetic to see how excited people became when they realized it was Friday, and how perky the office suddenly becomes as people look forward to the weekend.

Each day, I ride the 90 minute bus ride to my state capitol city so I can sit at my cubicle and push papers for my manager. While on the bus, I sit and think of how I am going to escape this life style. I see the writing on the wall. Already I can feel myself slipping into the 9-5 grind of working 40 hours a week. I use to imagine plots to get rich, inventions and such. I even considered changing my major to Entrepreneurship in an attempt to hit it big one day. Not necessarily get ""rich"" but be well off to live a simple life without work.

I'm slowly becoming more comfortable with the 40 hour work week. I don't like it. **I don't like that I am becoming satisfied with this life style.** I don't want to work for the rest of my life like my parents do just to provide for me. I feel like my creativity and ambition is becoming stunted. 

I found [MMM.com](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/) and thought of the idea of living frugally. I read Walden by Thoreau and he further convinced me that wealth isn't a measure of how much you have, but how much you need. 

I am now beginning to accept the 40-hour work week life. Deep down, I feel like I am being sold a lie. I'm not sure if financial freedom can be achieved working 40 hours a week. I'm not sure I want that kind of life. Part of me just wants to get out while I still can and try my best to be ambitious and creative, to be my own boss and make my own dollar. I think of how much I hated this job when it began, and now I am indifferent about tomorrow being Monday and another week of work. I'm worried I am falling into the ""trap"", the place where people go who are too afraid to take control of their life, to follow their dreams and live for the moment.

Is financial freedom really achievable, or am I just being told a lie..?"

I had known this other girl (let's call her B) since the start of the school year in September. I was interested in her instantly. She texted and snapchatted me quite often, enough that I knew she was interested back. Meanwhile, my gf and I were still FWB, so I didnt think too much of talking to B without her knowing.

In January, my gf left for an internship for 4 months, and we agreed to do long distance. Things were overall alright. All the while though, she was hanging out with an old flame of hers, and no matter what I said, she couldn't understand why I had a problem with it. ""I never want to hook up with him"" became ""I'll always have feelings for him"". This really pissed me off, and was a thorn in my side during those 4 months. I blame this for (stupidly) justifying why cheating was OK; I was so mad, but couldn't get through to her. I didn't know if she really loved me.

In April, just as the school year was winding down, I drunkenly texted B, came over to her place and hooked up with her. I never told B about my girlfriend, and when B started to get attached, I broke it off with her. There were no feelings involved, simply my horny mind making stupid decisions. I haven't talked to B since.

I never told my girlfriend because I assumed that we wouldn't last much longer. Instead, since my girlfriend came back in May, our summer has been amazing. There's no doubt that we love each other, and I've been a selfish scumbag keeping this secret from her.

The issue now is that she is leaving on a backpacking trip for 8 months in two weeks. We've insinuated that we should break it off before she leaves, (""I dont want to ruin a good thing"", she says), because we probably wouldn't last that long apart from each other.

I feel so shitty because I want to do the right thing, but I don't know what that right thing is. Do I tell her before she goes? Do I not tell her and save her the pain of knowing? If I don't tell her, there's enough of a chance that my girlfriend will find out: her roommate is in the same club as B, starting in September. I expect that they'll figure out the connection between us, and possibly B will tell her roommate what happened, which will get relayed to my girlfriend.

I'm such a scumbag. Fuck, what do I do? Does anyone have suggestions?

I am headed over to intern at a company that has an embedded development team that works in C. I love messing around with small projects using Vim and compiling them manually or with a make file. IE school projects and small hacks. 

Problem is, I have never worked on a big project outside of higher level languages such as java and android.

I would like to continue using Ubuntu because I love what I can do with it, but am worried I will struggle without having Visual studio or whatever people use at work. 

Is my only solution to get windows, or to use a VM? Do I have to hope there exists an equivalent IDE with ongoing support? How do build scripts work? Where can I go to learn basic project workflow?

So my step daughter is off doing her internship and her &lt;2 year old HP Pavilion dies.  Nothing on the screen, blah, blah, blah.  She takes it to the local computer store that people recommend.  The guys looks over it for nearly an hour and declares the motherboard dead.  We look up info on Pavilions, and motherboards seem to be a very common failure with those models.  We order her a $600ish thinkpad since she no longer plays any 3d games (she used to play sims3) and wouldn't need a discreet GPU.  

We have her drive to where we live so I can transfer her data, uninstall Norton, install malwarebytes, MS antivirus, etc.  Her new laptop only had 6GB of memory, so I pull out a 4GB DIMM from her old one so she'd at least have 8GB.  I consider pulling out the 32GB flash cache from the dead HP to put in her mom's computer and notice the CMOS battery hasn't been pulled out since it's still taped in.  So, what the hell, I pull the battery for 30 or so seconds and put it back in.

Lo and behold, it boots up fine after clearing the bios.  So, I finally get a ""new"" laptop with an i5 and low end nvidia chip to replace my aging AMD e-350 based laptop.

TL;DR2: Pulled the CMOS battery, fixed a ""diagnosed"" dead mobo.  It was a long(ish) shot, but took 10 seconds to try.  Always try the fast &amp; easy fixes.  Note: I haven't been a ""tech"" in almost 15 years, but some things never change.  When I was a tech, I was the go to guy for fixing things that no one else could fix, and 3/4 of it was trying fast &amp; easy fixes.  Always try the simple and fast solutions, even if you don't think they're the solution.

We met in a volunteer organization freshman year. In this organization we had to take a course together with the others in our group (12 people) and we have gone on multiple trips with the group. The group is pretty tight knit, we had to go through a selection process and interviews to get in to it. He started sitting next to me in class every day, teasing me in a slightly flirtatious way and walking with me places. We lived in the same dorm and he would regularly ask me to get dinner with him.

The next semester we had two classes together. He would sit with me in those classes and tended to show up places that I was studying. He lived in his fraternity house and I lived in an apartment two blocks away. He would take me out to dinner every other week and never let me pay. He called them dates but once said that he thinks that if two people of the opposite sex go to dinner alone together then it is a date. He invited me to his frat house to just hang out quite a few times, and would call or text me almost every time he got drunk. On his fraternity's bid night he called me asking me to come to the bar where they were and texted me asking where I was every 10 minutes until I got there. He then proceeded to introduce me to every one of his brothers that he could find as ""This is SexyThrowaway014, she's smarter than you.""

Now it wouldn't be complicated and I wouldn't have a problem talking to him about being more than friends if it wasn't for a few little problems. First off, we were both dating people this past school year. He had met my boyfriend and obviously didn't like him, though he didn't say anything (I don't blame him, my ex was an awful person). He was dating this girl he met while studying one day. He avoided talking about her to me, changed the subject whenever I brought her up. He had no pictures of her on Facebook and never made it Facebook official. I actually never saw her or met her. And I have no idea if they are still dating each other, although I don't think so.

The other is his personality. I've always been with really open guys, but Daniel is quite closed. He is quiet, kind of watches and listens to things and speaks his blunt opinion on them. Not the kind of person who talks about his feelings on things. Most of our conversations are on social issues and things going on in our personal lives. It's rarely moved towards how we feel about things in our lives. Which I love, I am not a very emotional person and I enjoy talking about world issues instead of feels. But I have no clue how I would initiate a conversation with him about being a little more than friends. My experience with initiating these conversations is limited to people who are really open about how they feel. So any advice on that would be welcome.

He is at an internship on Wall Street right now and will be back in town in a few weeks. This whole summer he has been texting me almost every day and the other day when I asked what he thought about his internship he made an analogy to a ""bad girlfriend"" because ""when you are in the relationship you can't judge it objectively because you get something out of it."" There may be nothing more to that statement than what he said but I think there may be more. When he gets back in town he will probably ask me out to dinner again. I just have no idea how to go about this.

---   
**tl;dr**: I have a little crush on one of my guy friends who seems to have expressed interest in me. However he may have a girlfriend (or he may have broken up with her) and he also has a somewhat emotionally reserved personality and I would like some advice on how to go about communicating that I would like to be a little bit more than friends

**Edit and Update: I just talked to a mutual friend and she told me that Daniel has had feelings for me pretty much since we met! She was amazed that I didn't already know that. And she encouraged me to tell him how I feel when he gets back in town. I am so happy! And nervous...**"

I have been going through several posts on this subreddit and it seems to be the general consensus that going to a top tier school ""helps to open more doors"" in terms of interviews for internships. I find this perk vague. Does it imply that students from top tier schools do not have to work on side projects or other programming related tasks in order to prove their qualification for an interview. Also, what is the extent of this automatic credential of top tier students? Is it enough to qualify attending the **affordable**, but yet more expensive, University of Wisconsin - Madison over a still respectable and cheaper computer science undergrad program such as that of the University of Massachusetts - Amherst.

2b9ph5,25,2014-07-21,[recent grad] got fired from first job after 5 weeks. Is it me or just poor management?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b9ph5/recent_grad_got_fired_from_first_job_after_5/,"I'm a recent college graduate, and I recently got fired from my first job out of college after 5 weeks. This actually happened a few weeks ago, so I'm past the whole crying in bed phase. I have recently accepted another job opportunity (had 3 offers total after I got fired). I'm obviously sad, but I want to move on and learn from this nightmare. 

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks ago, the CEO/founder (small business) called me into his office, asked me how I was doing, and informed me that I had been let go. He said it was performance-related, and the two guys I worked with said I was slow at picking things up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I told him that it was my first time working with the software, and yes, I had been a little confused, but it was all apart of the learning curve, and I've been getting more and more familiar and fluent with the language. I've been on my own mostly for these last few weeks... debugging and backtracking any errors I had on my own. Anything that I did struggle with or needed help walking through, it was because it was my first time doing it... I had turned the corner...

&amp;nbsp;

We (me and the three other guys I started with) had a one week training, and then we started. Out of our cohort, I was the only one put on a project that very first week (when I was fired, I was told that this was a ""test run"" to see what I could do). I just wish I was given a fair shake and had the opportunity to learn and get familiar like the other guys had. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to take some responsibility though. Everything the CEO said in the meeting was somewhat true. The senior member there, who was assigned to help me, basically relayed every technical question I had to the CEO. Looking back, sure I was asking some very basic questions (with hindsight), but it was my first time. They said I was slow picking up some of the concepts in training. I personally thought training was overly simplified and we were going too fast (i.e. following the trainer without much thought of what we were doing). The other people that I talked to there... all agreed. I was just the only one that asked questions out loud. So basically, if I had kept my mouth shut and didn't ask any questions (other than to the other new guys), I'd still have a job.

&amp;nbsp;

There was 1 week of training, 1 week of presentations and orientation, and then I was put on project at the beginning of the 3rd week. Midway through the 4th week, I was already notified that I was being taken off the project. I finished the 4th and 5th weeks, and subsequently let go. A decision was already made after 3 weeks it seems... 

&amp;nbsp;

The stuff I was assigned on the project wasn't too difficult per-say (with hindsight and having done it once already), but nothing I had encountered in training. The project manager basically walked me through the tasks the first few days (i.e. click this, do that, move this). The thing is, the code that he helped me get started -- the end code after the 5th week was totally different, which I did since the requirements kept changing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nobody said anything to me during my time there. Nobody asked me how I was doing or said ""Hey, the trainer said you were having some difficulties"". As far as I was concerned, I was doing a good job. I met all of my sprint deadlines. Yes, I was slow out of the gate, but I gotten over the hump and thought I was really understanding and picking things up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just in total disbelief. Being fired after 5 weeks is almost unheard of... especially if you are actually genuinely trying. It'd take an attitude problem or sleeping on the job to be fired that quickly. I think about all of my friends and the jobs and internships they've had over the years. None of them were ever sent home after 5 weeks and made it through the entire duration (eh, maybe some confirmation bias). I'm having some doubts about myself, and that it may be me that's the problem. 

&amp;nbsp;

During school projects, I'd have trouble starting projects because it took me a while to understand what it was asking, but after I fully understood the project specs, I was fine. I graduated at the top of my classes with honors, not because I was overly smart but because I had good time management, worked hard, and was a good test taker. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to accept some accountability, but are most companies (small businesses) like this? Or is this just the exception and I got unlucky? What kind of company invests all of this money in background checks and training lessons to fire them this quickly? I'm just searching for some answers. 

&amp;nbsp;

I secretly hope ""performance related"" was just a front, and they fired me for some other reason. Over-hiring? Maybe, but they were still hiring... Whenever I wanted to take a break, I would browse dog shelter websites (was trying to adopt a puppy) daily. Also, I was engaging in conversations with one of the clients via instant messaging -- 70% work-related and 30% about other stuff, some flirting and teasing, but nothing inappropriate. Were they spying on me? At least with the latter reasons, it'd be easier to swallow since I know I need to be more focused. But the other reasons... that's me... that's my personality and learning styles. I can't just change that. 

&amp;nbsp;

* Summer: Internship?

I have heard mixed reviews about the usefulness of CS 2340, but apparently it's required for the Design project. With Algorithms, it's been that its the source of all interview questions. That and it opens up all the theory courses in CS.

In terms of skill level in each, I haven't done any serious coding projects of any sorts yet, so 2340 might be useful in that regard. (Don't you have a GBA game in 2110, though?) With regards to algorithms, I did well in 1332 and Abstract vector spaces."

2b9tja,0,2014-07-21,Concerns about this international co-op program I am applying to,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b9tja/concerns_about_this_international_coop_program_i/,"***Who am I:***

I am currently a pre-Junior BS in Computer Engineering and minor in CS student at a school in the States that is looking for my third co-op in an international location. I have done two co-ops in the US both as a software developer in two different companies. I need to look for an international location purely for CPT reasons (so I can be eligible for my Optional Practical Training visa for when I graduate).

***What is the issue:***

My school works with a company that specializes in finding international internships; this particular office is in Singapore. I applied last week. Today, I had the opportunity to conduct a Skype interview with the headhunter for this program. The experience was interesting.. Let me elaborate on what she told me:

1. I was told that the majority if not all internships are **unpaid**. That said, AIC urges companies to stipend interns for meal plans and/or transit. While this was expected, in both my previous co-ops as a software developer in the USA, I was paid by the hour to a max of 40 hours a week. She continued to persuade me that an internship should be about the experience, and that all students should be about the experience, and not put emphasis on payment, which was interesting.

2. The **housing in Singapore is one of the highest in the world**, and the internships will 100% not provide housing for you.

3. Singapore is one of the hardest working first world cities on earth, where it is common that you're working **8 AM to 8 PM 5 - 6 days a week**; interns are not the exception. The headhunter told me that ""earlier this week, an intern told me that she was working from 9 AM to 9 PM"" to which she chuckled. I forced a laugh. 

4. She told me most employers **will not offer a job description**. You will be given their website and as much information as possible to determine what your job/role pertains, because ""people are busy in Singapore and do not have a dedicated employee to write a job description."" This was a very weird point to me, amongst the other quirky points she told me, because wouldn't having a job description allow the company to better find a fit for their interns? 

5. The final kicker: I have to **finalize with her whether I am committing to a co-op at Singapore by this Wednesday** (in three days), by then she will begin sending out my resume to prospective companies. By committing it means I am set in stone that I *will* be working at Singapore, regardless of the company or position. This is a decision I find hard to accept at the moment, as 1. companies in America generally understand that even if you interview with them, you may not necessarily work with them, and 2. it is hard for me to ""commit"" to a job without knowing what positions or companies I potentially will be working for, this aspect even more important because it is unpaid, and 3. I am still looking for other companies for the co-op this September.

Overall, I finished the interview on a good note with the coordinator, but in my head, I was unsure what to think about what I just heard. One hand, I was happy that they guarantee 100% that they will find an internship, but on the other hand, something felt off about what she told me. At the moment, they are pretty much my only option for an international location, because of the 40+ positions I've applied to (that contain intern/co-op) in countries such as Canada, Germany, and more, I've only received one interview..

I feel like I am running out of options, and they seem to be my only option for a co-op this September, with the exception I switch cycles to Spring-Summer.

***My questions are:***

1. Am I being too much of a little bitch? Am I being unreasonable? Am I thinking too highly of myself?

2. She sounded a little unreasonable, and I don't know why, but the entire time, I just couldn't but notice the red flags in my mind. My intuition tells me something is way off about what I heard. Perhaps it's because of the difference in work culture.

3. I plan to talk with my co-op coordinator tomorrow about this conversation and about moving on. What is /r/cscareerquestions' thoughts on this situation?

I apologize for this very long post, but I am at wit's end at the moment, feeling dejected and self-esteem at an all-time-low, at the same time, feeling like I am out of options. I would love your input on this matter, whether it's something I want to hear, or something I need to hear.

***tl;dr*** is this internship program in Singapore a little too demanding both financially and technically for an unpaid intern?"

Sorry if it's not the venue for it. 

I feel like I can't be happy. I try so hard at work and at school and with my friends to be the fun happy person I know I can be but it doesn't happen a lot. I spent so so long faking being that person and I can't fake it any more. Everything just feels so bleak and so pointless. 

I spent the first part of the summer focused on my internship and getting in shape, and I let a lot of social stuff fall by the wayside. Thanks to that I'm feeling really isolated and like there's nobody I can talk to. 

I know that I demonstrate a lot of symptoms of depression (and honestly I'm really scared I might be bipolar) and I really want to see a therapist. I don't for two reasons - first, I'm home from college and living at home, and I really don't want my parents to know. They're very conservative and tend to fall in the ""depression is bullshit"" camp, so I know they'd be so disappointed about this. 

That's really just an excuse though. The real reason I don't go is because I'm so scared that I'll find out what's wrong with me, and then I can't pretend everything is ok any more. My whole life is based on this fake person and I can't do anything about it because if I do then everything is going to fall apart. 

It feels like who I am is this massive jenga tower I've spent 20 years building, and learning that I'm depressed/bipolar/whatever I am is going to make it all collapse. And to some degree living like this is better than that. 

That's all I have. I wish I had the determination to even kill myself if I'm honest. I feel worthless and irrelevant enough in my own life to do it. I just don't have the follow through. Thank god get small miracles I guess. "
2ba6vy,1,2014-07-21,What should I do?,JimmyJohns0n,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2ba6vy/what_should_i_do/,"I love his community. And I need some advice. Since I've started NoFap 3 months ago I've decided to really take my life in my hands and change. 

I'm 23 and I live with my parents again after living on my own for a year. This because the last 6 months I had to graduate and do a very intense internship and I had no time to do extra work next to it. What I earned with the internship was not enough to really live on my own. But it was also because I was kind of lazy when I was fapping.

Now I want to focus on the future. I am almost graduated (hopefully) and I want to find a job and then an apartment. I want to focus on that. But there is this girl that really wants me (met her on Tinder). I want to get more intimate contact with girls/women, also to improve myself I guess. Getting better with girls.

The problem is right now I live with my parents and I don't have a part-time job. I am not sure how she will react to it. And to be honest I think it's better to focus on getting a job and my own place then dating a random girl from Tinder.

2bamuj,0,2014-07-21,Being the Boss,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2bamuj/being_the_boss/,"Hi 2Xers!

So I’ve had some great news at work: my boss is leaving and I’m taking her role as director of a non-profit foundation.  For now we won’t be hiring another full-time worker, so I’m now a one-woman grant-making machine.  Great!  I’m good at my job and I’m excited for the new challenges and responsibility the promotion involves.

One problem though… I’m finding it hard to get treated with the same respect as our previous director.  I’m in my mid-twenties and at least a decade younger than most people at my level in the field.  (I’m even more distanced from the ages of the philanthropists I work with, who are mostly businessmen in their fifties and up.)  I’m proud that I’ve got this far at my age, and when people have seen what I can do they recognize what I'm capable of.

The problem is people's first reaction to me.  The issues as I see them…

* My age
* My gender (if someone walks into the coworking space where I’m based, they’ll often immediately address me as a secretary, something they never do to the much more junior men on the floor)
* I’m baby-faced!  I can easily pass for &lt;18 if I’m not careful.
* My height -- I'm only just over 5' tall.
* I’m a naturally warm, cheerful person.  Don’t get me wrong, I can be as hard as nails when I need to be.  But I think people see me as nice and friendly rather than in control.

I can deal with the occasional inappropriate comment based on my gender.  It happens.  But how do I deal with the interns who try to add me on Facebook and treat me as a friend rather than their boss?  Or the people I work with in other organizations who *like* me a lot but don’t treat me the same way as others in my role?  How can I project authority without changing the friendly, warm sides of my personality that I like?

2X, I need your help to be the kickass director I know I can be!

TL;DR: Any tips for stepping up to an executive role for someone who’s female, young and baby-faced?"
2ban1a,50,2014-07-21,What to Know When Applying for Graduate School (STEM),littlemoondragon,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/2ban1a/what_to_know_when_applying_for_graduate_school/,"I have given advice on applying for graduate school several times. I should have made this before, but did not realize how often this comes up. Here is my advice on applying for graduate school. This is based on my research when I applied (talking with professors from various universities, other graduate students, etc.)

**NOTE:** I graduated with a double major in mathematics and physics and I focused on physics applications at the time, but ended up going to an applied statistics program.

**Please let me know if I have said something erroneous or should add some other information.** 

Early on in applying, you need to figure out where you will apply for. Applying is expensive. On average, it will be $100 - $150 per application. This includes the application fee, GRE submission, and transcript submission. Apply for five to seven places. Why? Pick one or two that are your dream school that you think you will not be able get in. There might be a chance you can. Pick one or two you think you might get into, but are unsure. Again, one or two you are sure you will get into. You need safety net in case you do not get accepted to any of the higher schools. However, keep in mind that you don't want to go to a university or program just because you couldn't get into anything else. If you are not accepted into the programs of your choice, follow up with the program and say thank you for them considering your application and ask what areas you can improve on.

**NETWORKING IS KEY!** In some instances if your advisor or some other professor in your current department knows someone in the program you are applying for, the chances of you getting in increase substantially. Just like a job, if the boss knows you, you are more likely to get hired (based on if he or she thinks well of you). Sometimes professors will select an applicant out of the stack if they know them and have the funding. If the department doesn't have to pay for the student, they are more likely say yes. This happens often.

**Fellowships:** Apply for fellowships early on. This not only helps you with how most applications processes proceed and give you writing experience, but if you do win one you have a leg up on other applicants for graduate school. For instance, if you win the NSF GRPF, you come with your own stipend and money for the university. This becomes very appealing for graduate programs considering incoming graduate students.

Usually, graduate programs look at five parts in applications. The list is no particular order.

1.	Personal Statement and/or Resume/CV
2.	Research Experience
3.	GRE and/or writing sample
4.	GPA
5.	Letters of Recommendation

A great application will excel in all five areas. However, most people will fail in one or two. You want to make sure you do well in at least four out of the five to be accepted in the more competitive/prestigious programs. My suggestions will be geared toward going to top programs. Keep in mind there is a difference on being an acceptable applicant vs being a competitive applicant. Not only should you meet the following requirements, but you need to stand out. The top programs will have hundreds of applicants. You need to be remember-able in some way. Additionally, most STEM programs will waive your tuition, provide a living stipend (around 20k to 28k), and sometimes health insurance (or at least a subsidy). This means they are investing in you and taking a risk for both reputation and financially wise. 

**Personal Statement and/or Resume/CV:** The personal statement is one part of the applications you must customize to the particular program you are doing. Each program varies on what they want you write. Most of the time it is a 1.5 page essay about your research goals and why you want to be in the program. I have seen a few that require 3,000 words or more. These are my suggestions on writing one:

1.	Write a generic essay NOW! As in before school starts. This essay will be the most time consuming part of your application. If you have a program in mind you want be in (i.e. your favorite program) find their statement and write an essay based on their requirements. Since most personal statements are the same or at least similar, you can modify the one you wrote to fit to others.

2.	Make sure you find a professor you want to work with and mention them in your statement. This says you looked into the program other than just their reputation or other reasons (I know some people went into my current program because the university has a great football team). Of course don’t just name drop. Explain how working with this professor meets your goals and how you two will be a good fit.

* If possible, contact the professor you are interested. Get your name out there.

3.	Do not mention classes you have taken in your statement. That is a waste of space. You are only given 1.5 pages on average to tell them your goals and why they should accept you. Transcripts are required. Why should you remind them again what classes you have taken?

4.	If there are poor marks on your applications such as bad grades, GRE, etc. your personal statement is the place to mention why you did poorly one semester or why your GRE score is low.

* Why should you do this? When you apply, the committee will have no idea who you are other than the stack of paper in some folder with your name on it. If you do not explain yourself, they will automatically make a poor assumption on you. 

* What are some examples of this? One of the top ten physics programs accepted a woman who had a bad GRE score and in the same semester, her grades plummeted. Everything else looked great. She wrote in her personal statement that her boyfriend died in a car crash before taking the GRE and had a difficult time focusing on her schoolwork that semester. Another example is a few friends of mine went through a divorce and another friend that had been diagnosed with severe test anxiety. However, do not make your situation sound as if the committee should pity you. Write about how while this happened, you became stronger or your rose above the situation or something.

Sometimes programs ask for a resume or a CV. If it is a resume, make sure it is only 1.5 pages. Jobs usually want one page resumes, but when applying for academia resumes can be longer. However, do not go crazy. If they wanted more than 1.5 pages, the program will say CV instead of resume. (My source is chairs and heads of admission committees from at least four different universities.)

**Research Experience:** You are applying for an advance degree in STEM, so you must have SOME research experience. If you are a rising senior, get on it NOW! Many fail this one area. If you are applying for anything in STEM and have a publication or gone to another university for research such as a REU you will have a huge advantage over the other applicants.

However, this section is not as relevant with those in **mathematics**. I was the only one in my incoming class of applied mathematics and statistics students with any research experience. Professors at my current department told me research experience is not as important. The most recent year did prove otherwise. The committee admitting students for this year (2014) all had research experience and the professors on the committee were impressed with all of them. While research experience for mathematics is not as relevant as the other sciences and engineering, it couldn't hurt.

1.	If you are early in your undergraduate career, start asking professors about their research! This shows initiative on your part. Some departments do seminars on what research is being done and if a professor is seeking students, but not all. If you are in one of the departments that does not, you need to talk and find research on your own.

2.	What if research at your department isn’t in you interests? Look for internships or REU’s. I have done couple REU’s, and they are great exposure to research.

* If you do research at another university (e.g. REU), you have someone lined up to write a letter of recommendation. This becomes a powerful tool in your application, because this research advisor can vouch for you abilities at a different university other than you own.

**GRE:** This part varies from university to university. Some programs want you to take only the general exam others want both the generals and the subject test. This also depends on field. For instance, all top physics programs will require both the general and subject test exam. This is because the subject test is a soul-crushing monster and helps programs compare students across the nation. On the other hand, some top applied math/stat places do not require the math subject test.

1.	What I have heard from several professors (chairs, committee members, etc.) in STEM, they do not care if your verbal GRE score is low (unless it is horrendously low). All they care is your math GRE score is in the top percentage because the math GRE is below calculus I. There is the writing portion and most of the time when I asked about this part, professors kept saying along the lines of “Oh the writing portion…is it out of 4 pts or something?” (This was during the old GRE scoring system.) For most programs, writing does not matter because you have to submit your personal statement or sometimes an old essay. The old essay is usually one you did for your English or Writing class.

2.	Do a few practice GRE and subject test GRE to become familiar with how the test taken. The test is timed, so being familiar with the test will help with speed.

**GPA:** Most top programs will require a minimum of a 3.3 to 3.5 GPA. If your GPA is low, look at the personal statement portion on explaining why your GPA is low (if you have a good reason).

In **mathematics**, since research is not as important, your grades matter a lot. A minimum GPA of 3.8 to 3.9 would be most advised.

1. 	Graduate programs do look at individual GPA's (general courses vs subject courses). If you didn't do well in your ethics class but excelled in organic chemistry, the program will only care about the courses that were relevant to your field.

* More of a side note. I have been told I had a great transcript because it showed I did all the required coursework (did well in them) and took other classes like advanced snowboarding and judo. The DGS told me personally how I stood out and said he wanted me to teach him and others to snowboard (odd request). Not sure how much this matters. Just a story.

**Letters of Recommendation:** Most places require three letters. I have only applied to one that required four. If you have done research, did well in classes, and some other extra circular activities, you should have at least three people in mind. 

1.	Ask the three or four people you are considering well in advance. Summer is a good time. State how you are considering applying to graduate school and would like them to write a letter. Remind them one month before the due date, then one week, and finally the day before. If you do not have enough letters, it is an easy way for the graduate committee to cut your applications out.

2.	Whom should you ask? One should be your advisor. I hope that you have developed a good relationship with them, and they can speak to your character. The second one should be someone who can talk about your research. If this happens to by your academic advisor, that is great. The third one can be anyone that knows you well. I say this because you need to make sure you have a professor that KNOWS you. It is obvious to the committee how well a professor views and knows you from the letter. In addition, it does not hurt to play the system. I had a list of professors I had that could write great letters of recommendation. I had two professors that taught at the university I ended up attending. They could speak about how I could meet the expectations based on how well I did in their class compared to other students they taught at the university I was applying for. Networking is key.

3.	Be wary on who you ask. Most “good” professors will make up an excuse if they know they could not write a nice letter about you. Others might agree and write a slanderous one. This has happened a few times in my experience (not about me, but others). Do not let this happen. If you are uncertain about professors, the best advice I have heard on the matter is you not only ask the professor to write a letter, but a good letter. Be tactful on the issue.

2banmm,53,2014-07-21,What to Know About Applying for Graduate School (STEM),littlemoondragon,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2banmm/what_to_know_about_applying_for_graduate_school/,"I have given advice on applying for graduate school several times. I should have made this before, but did not realize how often this comes up. Here is my advice on applying for graduate school. This is based on my research when I applied (talking with professors from various universities, other graduate students, etc.)

**NOTE:** I graduated with a double major in mathematics and physics and I focused on physics applications at the time, but ended up going to an applied statistics program.

**Please let me know if I have said something erroneous or should add some other information.** 

Early on in applying, you need to figure out where you will apply for. Applying is expensive. On average, it will be $100 - $150 per application. This includes the application fee, GRE submission, and transcript submission. Apply for five to seven places. Why? Pick one or two that are your dream school that you think you will not be able get in. There might be a chance you can. Pick one or two you think you might get into, but are unsure. Again, one or two you are sure you will get into. You need safety net in case you do not get accepted to any of the higher schools. However, keep in mind that you don't want to go to a university or program just because you couldn't get into anything else. If you are not accepted into the programs of your choice, follow up with the program and say thank you for them considering your application and ask what areas you can improve on.

**NETWORKING IS KEY!** In some instances if your advisor or some other professor in your current department knows someone in the program you are applying for, the chances of you getting in increase substantially. Just like a job, if the boss knows you, you are more likely to get hired (based on if he or she thinks well of you). Sometimes professors will select an applicant out of the stack if they know them and have the funding. If the department doesn't have to pay for the student, they are more likely say yes. This happens often.

**Fellowships:** Apply for fellowships early on. This not only helps you with how most applications processes proceed and give you writing experience, but if you do win one you have a leg up on other applicants for graduate school. For instance, if you win the NSF GRPF, you come with your own stipend and money for the university. This becomes very appealing for graduate programs considering incoming graduate students.

Usually, graduate programs look at five parts in applications. The list is no particular order.

1.	Personal Statement and/or Resume/CV
2.	Research Experience
3.	GRE and/or writing sample
4.	GPA
5.	Letters of Recommendation

A great application will excel in all five areas. However, most people will fail in one or two. You want to make sure you do well in at least four out of the five to be accepted in the more competitive/prestigious programs. My suggestions will be geared toward going to top programs. Keep in mind there is a difference on being an acceptable applicant vs being a competitive applicant. Not only should you meet the following requirements, but you need to stand out. The top programs will have hundreds of applicants. You need to be remember-able in some way. Additionally, most STEM programs will waive your tuition, provide a living stipend (around 20k to 28k), and sometimes health insurance (or at least a subsidy). This means they are investing in you and taking a risk for both reputation and financially wise. 

**Personal Statement and/or Resume/CV:** The personal statement is one part of the applications you must customize to the particular program you are doing. Each program varies on what they want you write. Most of the time it is a 1.5 page essay about your research goals and why you want to be in the program. I have seen a few that require 3,000 words or more. These are my suggestions on writing one:

1.	Write a generic essay NOW! As in before school starts. This essay will be the most time consuming part of your application. If you have a program in mind you want be in (i.e. your favorite program) find their statement and write an essay based on their requirements. Since most personal statements are the same or at least similar, you can modify the one you wrote to fit to others.

2.	Make sure you find a professor you want to work with and mention them in your statement. This says you looked into the program other than just their reputation or other reasons (I know some people went into my current program because the university has a great football team). Of course don’t just name drop. Explain how working with this professor meets your goals and how you two will be a good fit.

* If possible, contact the professor you are interested. Get your name out there.

3.	Do not mention classes you have taken in your statement. That is a waste of space. You are only given 1.5 pages on average to tell them your goals and why they should accept you. Transcripts are required. Why should you remind them again what classes you have taken?

4.	If there are poor marks on your applications such as bad grades, GRE, etc. your personal statement is the place to mention why you did poorly one semester or why your GRE score is low.

* Why should you do this? When you apply, the committee will have no idea who you are other than the stack of paper in some folder with your name on it. If you do not explain yourself, they will automatically make a poor assumption on you. 

* What are some examples of this? One of the top ten physics programs accepted a woman who had a bad GRE score and in the same semester, her grades plummeted. Everything else looked great. She wrote in her personal statement that her boyfriend died in a car crash before taking the GRE and had a difficult time focusing on her schoolwork that semester. Another example is a few friends of mine went through a divorce and another friend that had been diagnosed with severe test anxiety. However, do not make your situation sound as if the committee should pity you. Write about how while this happened, you became stronger or your rose above the situation or something.

Sometimes programs ask for a resume or a CV. If it is a resume, make sure it is only 1.5 pages. Jobs usually want one page resumes, but when applying for academia resumes can be longer. However, do not go crazy. If they wanted more than 1.5 pages, the program will say CV instead of resume. (My source is chairs and heads of admission committees from at least four different universities.)

**Research Experience:** You are applying for an advance degree in STEM, so you must have SOME research experience. If you are a rising senior, get on it NOW! Many fail this one area. If you are applying for anything in STEM and have a publication or gone to another university for research such as a REU you will have a huge advantage over the other applicants.

However, this section is not as relevant with those in **mathematics**. I was the only one in my incoming class of applied mathematics and statistics students with any research experience. Professors at my current department told me research experience is not as important. The most recent year did prove otherwise. The committee admitting students for this year (2014) all had research experience and the professors on the committee were impressed with all of them. While research experience for mathematics is not as relevant as the other sciences and engineering, it couldn't hurt.

1.	If you are early in your undergraduate career, start asking professors about their research! This shows initiative on your part. Some departments do seminars on what research is being done and if a professor is seeking students, but not all. If you are in one of the departments that does not, you need to talk and find research on your own.

2.	What if research at your department isn’t in you interests? Look for internships or REU’s. I have done couple REU’s, and they are great exposure to research.

* If you do research at another university (e.g. REU), you have someone lined up to write a letter of recommendation. This becomes a powerful tool in your application, because this research advisor can vouch for you abilities at a different university other than you own.

**GRE:** This part varies from university to university. Some programs want you to take only the general exam others want both the generals and the subject test. This also depends on field. For instance, all top physics programs will require both the general and subject test exam. This is because the subject test is a soul-crushing monster and helps programs compare students across the nation. On the other hand, some top applied math/stat places do not require the math subject test.

1.	What I have heard from several professors (chairs, committee members, etc.) in STEM, they do not care if your verbal GRE score is low (unless it is horrendously low). All they care is your math GRE score is in the top percentage because the math GRE is below calculus I. There is the writing portion and most of the time when I asked about this part, professors kept saying along the lines of “Oh the writing portion…is it out of 4 pts or something?” (This was during the old GRE scoring system.) For most programs, writing does not matter because you have to submit your personal statement or sometimes an old essay. The old essay is usually one you did for your English or Writing class.

2bavt1,2,2014-07-21,(Advice needed!) (DE) First year Big Four associate and I am completely miserable.,Ben_Hamm,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2bavt1/advice_needed_de_first_year_big_four_associate/,"Hey everyone. I've lurked on this subreddit for a while, and haven't posted much before, and one thing I recognize is that the people that frequent this subreddit generally have a lot of experience to share and can give good advice on issues.

Last year I interned with a Big Four firm in Germany in the US Tax department through the busy season. At the end of the six month internship, I was offered full time placement for this year after I finished my degree this past December.

I admit a lot of my issues now stem from mistaken assumptions about what life would be like as an associate, but what I am realizing now is that I hate this job. Being a foreigner adds to the stress because lately there has been a growing animosity towards foreign staff (which is incredibly ironic given that this is a US tax department), Additionally, my pay really isn't all that great, especially factoring in the higher tax rate. At the end of the year, after taxes, my salary comes out to the low 20,000s in euro.

When I first started there was a mistaken (albeit flattering) assumption that I can easily do work on projects I have never touched before. So I was given returns that had been in the office for months, involving incredibly complicated situations, with dual status, first year returns, and details and items that I had never seen. Add on to this the fact that most of these documents were in German, so I spent a fair amount of time hassling staff to explain the meaning or using google translate.

A lot of these clients are already pissed at the amount of time their files have sat dormant before being thrown to me, so I also have to deal with their tempers as I ask for information.

I'm taking a course now in the local language, but I only expect to be around B1 by September, and I won't be able to take the next level until the middle of next year.

I had a lot of ambitious goals for life after college, like getting my CPA, my Masters, and actually settling down somewhere. But the way my work-life balance is now, and the way it looks like it will be for the foreseeable future, none of that is really possible. Not like I can afford actual classes or the exam anyway.

The idea that I could be wasting away at this job, coming in every morning and seeing a new pile of work when the past work still isn't done is incredibly discouraging. I was apologized to several times for the way the complex work was wrongfully allocated to me, but the work wasn't lifted, and the clients are still ringing.

I'm not a lazy worker, and I'm not someone who likes to procrastinate. I excelled during my internship, enough that they were confident in bringing me back.

The real question I guess I am asking is this: I am currently signed to a two-year lease on my flat that I'd like to see out, and it ends next Fall. Would one busy season as an intern, and two as a full-time staff be enough experience to let me jump out without looking like a failure or like I couldn't handle the Big Four? It all boils down not to the work necessarily, but to the department itself. And switching to another department is next to impossible because of the language barrier.

If you have any questions to help in working this out, feel free to ask, and I will answer them to the best of my abilities. I feel incredibly trapped, and the stress has led me to start smoking, and I am currently seeing a therapist as well. My job is sucking the life out of me, and I feel like the sooner I can afford to get out, the better. I worry that I have just made a terrible mistake with my career.

Thanks in advance!"

I’m sitting here on my break, going over things in my head, and I need insight because  I really don’t know what to think. I’m trying to crank this out as fast as I can on break, so please forgive any typos or grammatical errors.


Let me give you some background.  I’m a 26 year old woman.  I have a degree in Criminology, and am finishing up a degree in Forensic Chemistry in December.  I’m currently undertaking an internship in the analytical lab.  I consider myself a scientist, and therefore believe in things I can observe, record, and measure.  I live my life based on data and fact.  As such, I am not easily spooked and I do not believe in the paranormal.  I do have a penchant for the show Supernatural and the Hellblazer comics, but that’s only for fun.  It’s not real, and I know that. 


Due to my chosen career path, you can also bet that I am unbelievably curious and nosy; I have to investigate anything and everything.  I am an expert facebook creep, I can find just about anything on anyone (my friends always call me their personal private investigator), but I have had legitimate work with the coroner’s office. 


As I said, I intern at a analytical lab.  It’s not in the most savory part of the city; when I say the section of town I work in, most people ask me if I carry mace/have a concealed weapon permit.  Our parking lot has a security booth and is fenced in with barbed wire.  Across the street last year, a girl was stabbed to death.  Yeah.  It’s not the greatest place to work, but the pay is good for an internship and let’s face it, I was desperate – I need to take an internship in order to graduate. 


Anyway, the plant itself is really old, but the main building in which the lab in located is even older.  It was built in the 1920’s, and like any old building, it has its issues.  There are odd noises all the time, scrapping in the walls and odd thumps, but that can be attributed to the sounds of the factory carrying through to our part.  Plus, it is easy to block them out with the sounds of the fume hoods and our heavy duty analytical instruments (we have an AA and ICP, and our ICP is ancient and loud).  There are also odd smells, but I think that’s mostly due to the fact that in order to prep samples, I have to dissolve metals in acid, and trust me, that is not a good smell.  If you don’t turn on the hoods almost immediately, the odor gets trapped in your nose and you can’t get rid of it for days.  The lights flicker constantly, but this is due to the fact that the lab shared electricity with the entire plant, and the lines are unbearably old.  Add in the fact that the old-ass ICP sucks a ton of electricity, and of course the lightning will suffer.  I’ve been here for almost two months now and I barely notice any of these things.  Only when I first started did I really notice them.


Anyway, about a month into my internship, they began renovations on our lab.  To describe our lab:  It’s a large room, separated by a big island. Each side has a fume hood.  The right side of the lab is getting all new cabinets and countertop, as well as a brand new fume hood.  Everyone was super excited, because the old one looked like it was straight up out of the 1950’s.  Right before they began to tear everything up, they were looking up in the drop ceiling to see where electrical wiring, gas lines, and water lines were.  I came in one morning to a removed ceiling tile and a weird… I dunno, hand print on the wall I guess.  It was really smeared, and looked rusty (the room smelled weird, too, but whatever, the contractors weren’t exactly the cleanest of people).  There was no ladder, but eh, they probably took it with them.  I sent a snap of it to my best friend, knowing she would get all riled up over it.  Sure enough, she sent back a horrified look, asking what on earth climbed up into our ceiling.  I just shook my head and went about my day.


When they finally stripped out the ceiling about a week later to extend piping, it was a disaster.  Apparently, the ceiling and walls was just all asbestos, and instead of removing it properly and sealing off the room, the dust went everywhere, including through the vents and into our one furnace room.  The furnaces went nuts and completely overheated as a result of the dust (which we think was a mix of asbestos and iron, which is highly combustible). Our instruments went haywire, too.  The ICP, which barely works on a good day, refused to cooperate, and the AA (the only instrument that is consistent) was giving bizarre calibrations and results.  Add to that the fact we had to wear ventilation masks that day and you’ll understand why everyone was angry. 


After that fiasco, the noises got more and more noticeable, particularly when the contractors weren’t there. You could knocks and scrapping sounds over the fume hoods and ICP.  Without the ceiling there as a buffer, every sound was audible. The only time I didn’t notice them was when the contractors were drilling or sawing.  Then there were the lights.  It’s understandable for contractors to cut power when messing with electrical shit, but the lights went on and off all the time without warning; sometimes it was the contractor, sometimes they just went out.  I think the contractors messed something up and made faulty wiring. I didn’t even care about the lighting so much as the impact on the instruments.  Everytime the power went out, the balance would shut off (sometimes in the middle of me weighing samples).  The moisture analyzer would turn off and then have to be recalibrated.  Thankfully the AA and ICP were on a different breaker and weren’t impacted because I would not have had the patience to deal with that mess.


It was also around this time we noticed things missing from around the lab.  Not huge things, mind you, like instruments, but things easily removed, such as power tools, lab ware, small bottle of chemicals…. Things you could put in a box and get out of the building.  Except lots of people come and go with boxes, so we had no idea who it was, nor did we have cameras in the areas where the missing objects were lifted from (we only have them in main entrances/exits of each building). 


All of these things are easily explained.  But then things got….weird.


My boss, unhappy with both the quality of work and the amount of time it was taking, chewed the contractor and his assistant out.  The day after, all the odd noises stopped.  But the work got even sloppier.  I was used to the assistant’s bizarre behavior, but then he started laughing at completely random things, like the trains that go past our windows, birds that flew past, or simply nothing at all.  If it wasn’t that, it was angry muttering.  And then one day last week, I walked past the door and he was just staring at the torn up ceiling at… well, at nothing really.  There is nothing there to look at besides pipes and wiring. 


Once again, I could chalk this all up to him just being strange, but on Friday I was walking in the hallway while he was up on a ladder by the door to the lab and a drill flew at me.  I dodge it and look at him.  The look of sheer rage on his face….


Now I’ve seen rage before.  I’ve looked in the faces of murderers and in the faces of people affected by brutal deaths.  The look on the assistants face was beyond anything I’ve seen at my time in the coroner’s office.  I can’t describe the twisted, enraged look on his face and the seething hatred I saw in his eyes. 


He told me he “dropped” the drill.  If you drop something, it falls straight down, not out into a hallway. 


I’m sure I’m just imagining things, right?  I mean, the contractors are tired, angry at being bitched at, sick of this job… And I’m overly stressed from wedding planning and thoughts of my upcoming semester… There has to be a logical explanation for his behavior.


Anyway.  The assistant contractor isn’t here today, so he must have taken a three day weekend to relax.  It’s just odd, because if the assistant is out, the contractor usually brings another guy with him to help, but he’s solo today.


Anyone have any ideas as to what this guy’s deal is and how I should proceed?

However, I was wondering if you guys recommended any type of internships/jobs that I could be doing right now to make my future job search easier.

I'm reading some older threads about how to get some knowledge and I'm following those, but I still am nowhere near confident to look for some type of SAP internship. However, I was thinking of some type of Business Analyst or Systems Analyst internship of sorts, would those be solid internships to get into? Or are there better jobs that are attainable and would be a better fit for someone going into SAP?

Right now I'm doing an IT internship, but in the long run, I think I want to get into SAP! Any ideas? Thanks!"

2bbj0v,2,2014-07-21,How beneficial would an associates degree in CS from a community college be and look on a resume if I have already gotten a BA in something else?,Turin_Giants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbj0v/how_beneficial_would_an_associates_degree_in_cs/,"So, you might recognize my posts from before but I really want to get this right so I hope you guys can appreciate that. Anyways, I went to a 4 year college, got a BA in psych. Stupid decision on my part but I can't undo the past. 

Moving forward: I want to get into the IT line of work, notably Cyber security. That is my goal, at least. Anyways, I was thinking, as a backup/foundation, I could attend a good community college near me and get an associates degree in BS. I would have no intention of continuing that degree at another university unless it absolutely warrants it. If I was to go to community college for CS, I would be simultaneously studying and, hopefully, receiving my certifications in A+ and security +, as well as Microsoft's certification, in hopes that it would raise my chances of landing a good job in the cyber security field. Ultimately, I would hope to get a security clearance, which would help me even more with finding and landing a good job. 

At the moment, I already have a full-time job, that pays salary, but it has nothing to do with what I want to do in CS, but this is relevant because this would stop me from getting any internships.... The only ""hands-on"" experience I would have (hypothetically speaking) would be what I do at home and the certifications that I (hypothetically speaking) possessed. 

What I am trying to get at is that I have a week to make up my mind regarding attending community college to get an associates degree in CS. I don't want to waste my money if its not worth it if I were to get all of those certifications, which I know many employers see as most important. 

I mean I see community college as something that CAN'T hurt in terms of experience and learning and good serve as a good background but I also don't want to waste my time and energy. 

Thank you for your help"
2bbl3t,0,2014-07-21,Programming practice / job prep,thebigbadjay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbl3t/programming_practice_job_prep/,"Hello All,

I graduated college in 2012 with a degree in Comp. Engineering, moderate GPA (3.0). I like to think I was a great programmer too, although I'm more than likely over exaggerating this. After graduation I went to work for the family business, which I now regret. Great pay, shitty hours, really no where to move up. 

So I'm looking to get a job as a developer in a few months. I've always wanted to be one, but I kinda fizzled out of programming practice. So I have a few questions to pose to you guys. Any help is very much appreciated:

1: Anyone have any good projects I can do in Java / C++ / Python that I can use to brush up my skills? I've been working on a self-made scientific calculator in Java / Android as a first practice. It's coming along well, but I can always use the practice with a new idea &amp; new language.

2: How important is experience for entry - level employees? It says 1-2 years experience on all the job listings I saw. Really regretting not going for an internship at least right now (among other things).

3: Should I put together a portfolio of my past work? None of it was professional really, mostly school work / projects. I made an app for the company last year, which wasn't that impressive really. Just something quick and basic that filled a need for my company in particular.

I know these questions are probably addressed elsewhere in the sub. Just hoping to hear something encouraging I guess. Pretty terrified of moving onto this next step. Any help you guys can provide is appreciated.

I worked there for close to a year to move on to another company that happens to be very close to where I was. One of the managers personally asked me to interview. I interview there a few times get turned down the first time. Though on the second go round they hire. 

Sadly doing what they hired me to do was degrading to me and not taking advantage of any of my skills that I had acquired. I learned alot at my internship and I work in my homelab quite a bit. Needless to say I wanted another job preferably one on first shift so I can live a normal life again. A friend is in the process of helping me to gt hired on as a Desktop Support/ Sysadmin Combo. In this process I went out asking for references again and included my internship manager. Now here is the best part, my internship called me back today and offered me a full salaried job with PTO at a pretty awesome salary (no where near where experience sysadmins make though).

Just a lesson to be taught when you do your internship work you Ass off and stay in touch. Never go in a bad mood and it might just pay off.

TLDR; Internship, Crappy 2nd Shift Job, Due to keeping in touch with the Internship and they knew I didn't like my current job they offered me a Full Time Sysadmin Job.

All I have to do is say yes and withdraw my current job application and in 2 weeks il be a SYSADMIN!

I should also mention I'm not old enough to drink yet if that tells you anything."
2bboo2,378,2014-07-21,I recieved a call from my best friend from high school...,irarelysleepatnight,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bboo2/i_recieved_a_call_from_my_best_friend_from_high/,"Last night, I recieved a call from my best friend from high school.
We had been out of touch recently, and hadn't spoken in a few years. She hadn't had a Facebook page, and whenever I called her it went to voicemail. 

In high school, we always had a lot of fun. We got into trouble, stole our parent's alcohol and got black-out drunk, smoked a shitton of weed, but still managed to earn straight-A's. We'd met on the first day of freshman year in homeroom, and instantly became good friends. From then on, we were at each other's houses every night after school, sneaking out to go to parties, telling each other everything, and having typical high school adventures.

When the time came for us to graduate, we'd cried in the bathroom, hiding in her house, drinking vodka and trying to forget. It wasn't the high school we'd miss; it was seeing each other every day, having fun and being carefree, laughing about people and events that had happened. It was all the memories, four years worth of them, and now we were hardly going to see each other any longer.

She promised me we'd have a reunion during Christmas break; she was going off to a college in Philadelphia and I was staying in New York to study jouralism. 

The first December break, she didn't call. I phoned her, and all I got was an automated voice telling me that the phone line was no longer in use. I tried to contact her parents, but there was no success. I tried to find her on Facebook, only to find she'd deleted her account.
I was confused, scared, and missed her a lot. I never heard from her again.

 Until last night.

I got a call from an unidentified number at around 2:00 a.m. When I answered, still awake from studying for a huge test I had the next day, I recognized her voice almost immediately. I'll try to recollect the dialogue as much as possible.

""Hey, April.""

""Um, who is this? Who the hell is calling so late?""

""It's Beth.""

""Holy fucking shit. Beth? As in my high school best friend who dropped off the fucking earth when we started college?""

""I thought you'd forgotten about me. [laugh].""

""Of course not. Holy shit, where have you been?""

After a long sigh, she began recollecting the last few years of her life. When she started college, she'd also been introduced to heroin, and became addicted very quickly. She grew very ill, and almost died a few times. Her addiction lasted for a year, and she constantly was stealing things to get drugs. This behavior ruined her life and future; she did not have enough money to continue for a second year of college, due to all the spending on heroin, and her parents grew suspicious. She'd always had more than enough money for school, as they were a bit rich, and so they forced her to come visit immediately, which she hadn't, since she'd mysteriously stayed home all her vacations to do ""extra work"". In reality, she had been injecting a dirty needle into her arm in the dark.

When they found out she had been on drugs, they were devastated, and checked her into a rehab center. There, she recovered surprisingly well, but when she left, after a few months, she could no longer attent the college in Philadelphia she had been previously attending. She was much too broke, and had wasted all of the money her parents had saved for her.

Being forced to attend a low-grade community college, her future seeming to go nowhere, she sunk into a deep depression. She took up self-injury, always burning and slicing herself, and eventually contemplated suicide. The first year into education at the community college, she attempted suicide. She failed, and wound up in a mental hospital this time.

So now, with two useless years of education, and a past of severe drug addiction and depression, she had barely any education to put to her name, and no money. It was very unlikely she'd get a job any time soon, but her parents, reluctantly, gave her some money to get an apartment in Philly, and get back on her feet. She thanked them profusely, and upon moving into her new apartment, she searched for a while for a job, where she could subsequently attend night school. She ran out of luck. Soon enough, she was doing nothing but sitting in her apartment all day, shooting up heroin yet again. That time in rehab had been in vain.

 I felt terrible. While her life had been turning to shit, I was successful and happy. I was making good marks in college, staying consistant, and avoiding any serious drugs (while smoking the occasional joint). I had a good future set for me. I even planned on being an intern in New York after I finished my final year of college at a magazine company.
Our dialogue then turned to this:

""I'm so, so sorry, Beth. Why didn't you call me?""

""Most of the time, I was too busy shooting shit into my bloodstream to care about anyone besides myself. I was selfish. And then the other times I was in rehab or the loony bin. I couldn't.""

""But are you all right now?""

""Yeah, I was in a really rough time, but I've found a way out. I'm okay now.""

""That's amazing. We need to meet up sometime. I missed you a lot.""

""[Pause] Yeah, maybe. That'd be nice. Remember the shit we did in high school?""

We laughed about our experiences for a while, recollecting on everything we did and how stupid we were. I was in the middle of laughing about one time when we threw a cliche keg party while Beth's parents were out of town, when she sighed.

""What's the matter?""

""Nothing. I'm just- I don't know. I'm sorry, okay? For never talking to you, for being a shitty friend. After all we went through together, and I didn't even keep my Facebook page up. I'm sorry. I love you. We'll see each other again really soon, right?""

She sounded panicked, in a hurry. We were just in a leisurely conversation, having fun and reminiscing, submersing ourselves in nostalgia, and now she was trying to hang up. I checked my phone. We'd been talking for two hours.

""Yeah, definitely. Thank you for calling. Stay safe.""

She chuckled. ""I already am safe.""

""What?""

""I have to go.""

""Good night, Beth. I love you.""

""Goodbye.""

The phone call ended. I felt uneasy, but satisfied. It was 4 a.m, and my roommate was waking up, pissed, asking me why I had been talking for so long. I apologized, drowsy, and headed to bed, although I could not fall alseep. I was too busy thinking about her.

When I was roused from the sleep I'd drifted into, it was my phone ringing at 7 a.m. I answered groggily, annoyed at whoever was calling this early. It was Beth's mom. I was shocked.

She sounded drained, exhausted. I asked her shakily what had happened. She explained to me that she'd gotten an odd voice mail from Beth last night at around ten, saying goodbye. When she didn't answer the phone, she grew very worried, and drove the two-hour drive to Philly to check up on her. She had a spare key to her apartment, and when she entered, she'd found Beth hanging lifelessly from a rope.

I was in shock. I didn't know what to say, but I could feel silent tears making their way down my face. She was dead. My best friend was dead. She'd lied when she'd said she was okay. She only had called to say goodbye.

""The police say she'd been dead for an hour by the time we found her.""

""When did you find her?""

""Around twelve. We knew this would happen, we should have done something to stop it."" I knew she wasn't talking about me; I had had no idea.

And then I paused. ""No, that can't be right. Beth called me at two a.m. last night for the first time in a few years. We talked for hours.""
""We found her before then. That's impossible.""

I hung upwithout responding, terrified. I checked my phone logs. There it said the exact time we'd spoken. It had definitely been Beth. There were things she said that nobody else could have known.

I'm scared. How the hell did I talk to Beth if three hours before she'd committed suicide? I'm exhausted and devastated, and confused. What do I do? Has this happened to anyone else?"
2bbtce,0,2014-07-21,I'm a student thinking I might have screwed myself over.,csjobthrowacct,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbtce/im_a_student_thinking_i_might_have_screwed_myself/,"A throwaway account because this situation seems pretty abysmal to me.
Okay, so here is the situation. For four years I studied to get my Psychology degree, near the end of which, I discovered I hated. I said okay, I'll just double major in Computer Science as well.

It didn't go as expected. Coincidentally, about the second semester into my Computer Science studies, I was both overworked, since I also had a side job and a lot of coursework, and struggling with crippling depression. Suffice it to say, I failed all five of my classes, which were all required.

I have since discovered that I've run out of funding for college. Since I've failed those classes, my gpa isn't so great for scholarships, and all my financial aid has been used up on my other classes. I may just have to graduate with a Psychology degree and call it a day, without any computer science experience and a ruined gpa. I think I might be sitting at like a 2.3-2.5 or so.

Additionally, I've only taken so many math courses. I've taken a lot of statistics, some discrete math, algebra and some trig. No calculus, however.

Is it salvagable? I know that people without traditional CS degrees can get jobs but they're usually not studies like Psychology, it's usually engineering or something more technically minded, even though it is BS in Psychology, more research focused. 

I might be able to do things like get certifications, self study, get a portfolio together, et cetera, and try and see if I can get an internship, but will that even be enough? Will the failure be too big a mark on me?"

My end goal is to work at one of the main pioneering companies right now like SpaceX or DSI. I realize that landing an internship and/or a full time job at one of those right now is going to be difficult. However, I am fine with starting at a smaller aero company and then working my way up to one of the more prominent players later on in my career.

I live about an hour away from Huntsville, AL, and there are smaller aerospace contractors scattered all over the place there. This coming winter, I'm going to start applying for internships at these companies for the following summer. I want it to be obvious through my resume that I'm set on working in this industry, so I want to be able to complement my school experience with side projects related to the field.

There seems to be a plethora of options out there for related projects, but one that has recently peaked my attention lately is to learn how to simulate aerospace related things. I've found a few books online like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Aerospace-Simulations-Library-Flight/dp/1563479362) one. While not exactly portfolio projects, I feel like going through exercises in books like these would help develop my physics/aerospace knowledge greatly, and also show initiative to an employer. 

I'm not exactly sure how I would list this in a resume though. Also, I do believe knowing how to do simulations like these is relevant to the industry, but would I be better off trying to learn more about embedded electronics? I have a decent enough workstation at home, and I figured I could pick up an Arduino and attempt some projects. However, I feel like the embedded electronics type work is going to be more suited towards EE's and compEngineers. The only embedded related projects I can think of that interest me are stuff like quadcopters, RC planes, and just a bunch of other projects that will cost me a lot of money and be less interesting to me than purely computational projects such as simulations. 

I'm mainly seeking advice on what I can be doing in the next 6mos - 1.5yrs to increase my chances of getting an internship and later a job in the aerospace industry. Thanks a lot for any feedback here!"

I studied in this field in university, graduated two years ago and have been working in the field ever since. To break in, you usually have to do internships and/or paid contracts. I've done this at some of the best companies in the country, but have yet to land a full time gig. This is not unheard of (pretty much everyone I know in this field under 30 is either unemployed or on a short-term contract/internship). I've worked my butt off and am proud of my success, but of course I still want to land a full time job in my field.

Enter my friend. She studied in the same field as me, spent a year at a small company working on contract after college, decided it wasn't worth the headache and switched to a more welcoming industry. She's worked two years at a full-time job with benefits, 9-5 hours and good pay in this other field, but hates it. Over the past few months she has become increasingly dissatisfied with her work and decided she wants to move back into my industry. All fine and good.

So a month or so ago she starts applying for internships/contracts and due to her lack of experience the fact that she hasn't been in the game for the last two years, I expect her to struggle a bit (as we all have). Instead, she lands an interview for a full time gig after a few weeks (didn't get it) and an internship at one of the most sought-after companies in the country a week later. We're waiting to hear if she got that gig or not, but in the mean time it's driving me crazy!

I want to just be happy for my friend and I know that any success she finds does not take away my own achievements...but I can't help feeling weirdly envious. I worked very hard to get where I am while she wiled away in her cushy full time job and now she just floats back in and, if she gets this job, will basically be at the same level as me within a month. 

My question is: how do I get over it? I have no control over how she does and, in my heart of hearts, I want her to do well because she's my friend. It's driving me crazy that I feel this way and I find myself hoping she doesn't get the job. How can I stop my envious thoughts and just get over it already?

2bcffc,8,2014-07-21,Where to move to,TaylorHu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bcffc/where_to_move_to/,"Long story short, graduated from college with a B.A. in Game Design, which contained 0 programming.  Wanted to get a job at a game studio, but had all the student loan debt so I took the first job that came along.  Tech support for a web design/cms company.  Got a girlfriend, an active social life.  Worked my way up to more of a front end dev position.  Got basically comfortable in life, and next thing you know it's almost 4 years later.  Now I am approaching 30, and have realized it's time to get serious with my career.

I'm no stranger to programming, been doing it on a hobbyist level since AP CS in High School.  Decided to really focus on that and I would like to get a development job.  Maybe at a game company, maybe at some web based startup.  I'm not that picky.  While working at a game studio does sound like it would be fun, I'm not as set on that as a career as I was when I was 20.  So self studying, doing the Coursera/Udacity thing.  I can also audit classes through where I got my B.A. from (online), so been auditing my way through their CS program.  Now my question is, where should I move?

The best thing about my job is that it's telecommute.  I am in Phoenix right now, but I am thinking I should move to someplace more startup/tech orientated.  Due to my lack of actual CS degree or internships, I don't think I have a strong enough resume that companies would be willing to fly me out for interviews or anything.  I think my chances of landing a job are much stronger if I am physically there able to go to interviews at attend meetups and all that jazz at a moment's notice.

Now my job only pays around $42k/year.  Not exactly rollin in the dough, but enough that I can rent a studio apartment and buy top ramen until I find something better.  Right now I am thinking either Seattle or Silicon Valley.  

Advantages of Seattle are that my current income would definitely go farther there.  I also like the idea of living somewhere that buying a house one day is, you know, remotely feasible.  I also grew up in Alaska and spent some time in Portland, so I like the outdoors, I like trees and nature and hiking.  In general the Pacific Northwest has a lot of appeal to me.  Being a short, non-stop flight to Alaska whenever I want to visit would also be an advantage, though not one that would come up THAT often.

Advantages of SV are, well, it's SV.  Where all the big money is, the highest concentrations of startups, the highest concentrations of game companies, etc.  But it's also very expensive, I am assuming I'd have to get a place in the dark corners of Oakland at first. But my biggest concern with SV is that I'd be facing competition for jobs from people with degrees from fancy places like Stanford and UC Berkley who had internships at Google.  

I've never really been to either city so I don't have any first hand knowledge of them, looking for advice from people that do.  Is there someplace else I should consider (I've heard good things about Austin lately, but it's never been a place that was on my radar or anything)?

2bckss,14,2014-07-21,[CS Student] Applying for aerospace internships in six months and will be applying for full-time aerospace jobs in 1.5 years. Looking for portfolio / side projects advice.,vic986s,aerospace,https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/2bckss/cs_student_applying_for_aerospace_internships_in/,"-Cross-posted to cscareerquestions as well

Ever since I started back school, I've been dead set on getting into this industry. My end goal is to work at one of the main pioneering companies right now like SpaceX or DSI. I realize that landing an internship and/or a full time job at one of those right now is going to be difficult. However, I am fine with starting at a smaller aero company and then working my way up to one of the more prominent players later on in my career.

I live about an hour away from Huntsville, AL, and there are smaller aerospace contractors scattered all over the place there. This coming winter, I'm going to start applying for internships at these companies for the following summer. I want it to be obvious through my resume that I'm set on working in this industry, so I want to be able to complement my school experience with side projects related to the field.

There seems to be a plethora of options out there for related projects, but one that has recently peaked my attention lately is to learn how to simulate aerospace related things. I've found a few books online like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Aerospace-Simulations-Library-Flight/dp/1563479362) one. While not exactly portfolio projects, I feel like going through exercises in books like these would help develop my physics/aerospace knowledge greatly, and also show initiative to an employer.

I'm not exactly sure how I would list this in a resume though. Also, I do believe knowing how to do simulations like these is relevant to the industry, but would I be better off trying to learn more about embedded electronics? I have a decent enough workstation at home, and I figured I could pick up an Arduino and attempt some projects. However, I feel like the embedded electronics type work is going to be more suited towards EE's and compEngineers. The only embedded related projects I can think of that interest me are stuff like quadcopters, RC planes, and just a bunch of other projects that will cost me a lot of money and be less interesting to me than purely computational projects such as simulations.

I'm mainly seeking advice on what I can be doing in the next 6mos - 1.5yrs to increase my chances of getting an internship and later a job in the aerospace industry. Thanks a lot for any feedback here!"
2bcq8v,4,2014-07-21,"My [19F] relationship with my parents [50F, 46M] declining due to being in college",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bcq8v/my_19f_relationship_with_my_parents_50f_46m/,"I'm 19 and going into my sophomore year of college. While my parents are proud of me for being in college and having a 4.0 so far, they didn't go to college themselves and don't understand anything about how it works. They're just simple people with simple lives and not much education. That itself isn't the issue. **The issue is that, if something falls outside of their limited range of experience, they believe it isn't real and it doesn't matter.**

Some background info to begin: I live with my parents and commute 35mins to school to save money. I have scholarships that cover about half of my tuition. My parents paid the remainder of my first year out of pocket, but then realized that it was too difficult to sustain over the following years. This year I'm paying with scholarships and loans, but hope to make some payments out of pocket in subsequent years. Although they are no longer paying for college, my parents will let me live in their house and use their car for as long as I need, so it's in my best interest to get along with them.

Now, my concerns:

* They'll fight with me about wanting to have a part-time job. In high school, they wouldn't let me work, saying ""your job is to be a student"" (which was ridiculous, because high school was very easy and homework required little time). This year, I started looking for my first job and was stressed out about how much difficulty I was having. They acted like I was stupid for worrying about not having a job. Now that I've finally been offered a job (orientation is this Friday), they still tell me that I don't need to work and imply that I won't be able to handle it. They do not see the merit of having work experience. They think that as long as I have a degree with a good GPA, companies will be fighting each other to snatch me up and I'll basically be handed a job - even if there's nothing else on my resume. They think part-time jobs in college are worth nothing, internships and research experience barely matter, and extracurriculars are a waste of time.
* Getting them to file their taxes for the FAFSA was far more difficult than it should have been. This year, they still hadn't filed their taxes 5 days before my school's deadline for the FAFSA. I kept asking them to do so. My dad basically threw a tantrum and said, ""Why do I need to live my life according to your schedule?"" I said it wasn't my schedule, it was the university's schedule. They finally filed their taxes, but wouldn't assist me with entering their information in the FAFSA although I had questions.
* They refuse to recognize the challenges that come along with being a first-generation student. It's an upward battle for me to learn how to navigate the system. I was very out of my element during my first semester and didn't always adjust as quickly as others (to the point where one professor actually commented that I seemed ""very uncomfortable""). I'm doing a little better now, but I still feel overwhelmed a lot of the time by everything ahead of me. I've also switched to a major that is more academically demanding and leads to a less-straightforward career path than my old one. While I'm confident that it is my passion, it does intimidate me at times. My parents can't understand that these feelings are exacerbated by being a first-generation student (in particular, a female first-gen student in a field that women haven't always been encouraged to go into). I have a strong fear of failure and inadequacy, and they think it's ridiculous and stupid to worry about whether I'll succeed.

At this point in my life, my childhood is over and I'm branching out and becoming my own person. I wouldn't want to rely on my parents for constant emotional support or expect them to perfectly understand everything I'm going through. But I wish they could at least be there for me when I need to talk things out or ask for advice. I was always very close to both my parents, but now they can't relate to any of my experiences.

I am hoping by providing specifics about my dilemma, I can find my definitive answer. Here are pro and cons lists for attending UMass Amherst and University of Wisconsin Madison. The bullet points that are more important to me appear closer to the top of the pros and cons. 


**UMass Amherst**:

Pro:

* I have heard several accounts of people landing jobs with upwards of a 100k salary

* Cheaper cost ( ~20k  every year)

* Closer to Home ( 1.5 hours I am instate)

Con:

* The CS program at UMass is distinguished, but it is not the top of the top so I will be at a disadvantage compared to students from a higher ranked school when companies are deciding whom to interview for internships
* On AVERAGE (not everyone) the students in the CS program will be less competitive and less skilled (sorry if it sounds harsh) 
* Tier 3 School (US News ranking of #25)
* I have not heard anything about the alumni network at UMass


**UW Madison**

Pro:

* More talented student body
Because Wisconsin has an elite program, I will be more likely to an interview for internships
* More of an alumni network
* Tier 2 School (US News ranking of #11)
* NICE Campus
* More Asians (IDK how to explain this one, I am Asian so I like to surround myself with people that share common characteristics)

Con:

* 17 hour drive; 5 hour flight (1,131 mile) – Although I do not plan to come home often. My family is Asian and we are not that traditional so we do not make a big deal about celebrating holidays
* Double the Price (~40k)









**Facts to Consider:**

* As both are in the top 50 CS programs the material being taught is the same

* I can afford both of these schools, but that doesn’t mean I want to piss away any money
* I do plan to work outside of Massachusetts, namely Seattle or California 
* I am more than willing to hear suggestions for different schools with good CS programs

Analyst Mark Jones of the Signals Intelligence unit at NSA was covertly referred to as “Spills” by his coworkers, and at this moment, he was living up to that handle as he valiantly attempted to mop up the coffee that had jostled out of his cup and onto a the cover of one of the many folders laying on the conference table. His boss, Director John Samford, glared at him. “Do you need a sippy cup, Mr. Jones?” he icily ground out. “Or perhaps a bib?” The others at the table squirmed, both feeling sorry for Mark and at the same time, glad they were not the ones receiving the ire of Samford.

“No sir, sorry sir” stammered Mark, as he got the last of the coffee off the covers. Fortunately none of the papers inside them were ruined, which would have probably found Mark outside the front door with no security clearance, no job, and no pension.

Mrs. Rosemary, Samford’s secretary, took pity on Mark and brought him a waste can for him to drop the sodden napkins in. “Thanks” Mark whispered to her, and Samford glared at Mrs Rosemary, who ignored him as she returned the basket. She was quite capable of putting up with him, and he needed her more than the other way around, and they both knew it.

“Now, if we’re done with the water sports, can we get on with your report?” Director Samford asked.

“Yes, sir, as I was about to say, we’ve been seeing an increase of traffic between several research centers, both here and abroad. Most of it seems to be between observatories of various types, but recently we’ve seen a bunch of the same kind of traffic going in and out of JPL.”

“Well, what are they saying? That they’ve spotted a new rock or something?”

“At this time, we don’t know for sure; the email text is mostly encrypted. We’ve been sifting the phone records for whatever we have, but people are using more and more encrypted calls, so not much there.” Samford made a sour face. Ever since that goddamn trator Snowden let leak that the NSA was listening to everyone, people were more and more using free off-the-shelf encryption on their phones. His boss was pushing for a presidential directive outlawing that, but it wasn’t looking good so far, since it would only affect phone usages within the United States, and anyone they were “supposed” to be looking at would use it anyways, law or no law.

Mark continued, “From what we have pieced together, we do know it’s involving the new James Webb satellite and the Far Side moon observatory, and that it’s probably in the southern sky, but beyond that, nothing directly from any scientist involved.”

“That’s it? That’s all you got? I can’t go up the hill with just a ‘we don’t know’ report!” Samford turned the glare up a few notches, which, combined with his sour visage made other parts of Mark’s body pucker up.

Nancy McCalice came to Marks rescue. “Actually, we do have a fair bit more. Apparently, JPL’s Jim Broachfield just came back from Germany where he was meeting with Torsten Fiedler - he’s the director of the Berlin Radio Observatory - and SIGINT’s transcript of the phone call afterwards said that he was ‘on board’ with the operation they have. He was talking with Dr. Bill Robenson, a professor also working at JPL, and said to tell CNN it was a comet.”

“So they did find a new rock, big deal! You’re not blowing my skirt up here.”

Nancy ploughed on with “right after Broachfield boarded his plane, we have a phone call in the clear between a Russian reporter” - this got Samford’s attention, nothing like a Russian to make a briefing interesting - “and his editor where he mentions Fiedler, which triggered the SIGINT system to flag it for review. In in it he was asking her for a plane ticket. His reasoning is interesting and puts a new spin on what we have.” She tapped a spot on her tablet, and the audio of Yevgeny phone call played, with an English translation overlayed:

Yevgeny Kornelyuk: “Viktoriya? Yevgeny.”

Viktoriya Rubipon: “Your last article was crap. Just like the previous article, and the one before, and the one before that. Who cares about fancy dog shows? Maybe I should fire your stupid ass before you file any more crap like this!”

YK: “Yes, I know. Listen, I need a plane ticket and a visa to Texas, quick, today.”

VR: “Are you fucking drunk again? Are you going to start singing to me? I’m not handing out anything to you, I don’t care if you are my favorite nephew twice removed. I swear, if you-”

YK, interrupting: “No, I’m not drunk -  I think I’ve got something.”

VR: “Something or someone? What do you have, some nasty disease that you got from some American cowgirl?”

YK: “Goddammit, shut up and listen! I’ve just been given some stunning information by Jim Broachfield, one of the heads at JPL. Apparently there is some amazing things happening in the solar system, right in our backyard it looks like, and he’s got a whole bunch of people working on figuring out exactly what. It doesn’t look like anyone in the press has noticed it yet, and I discovered it by accident myself - they are keeping it very quiet. I think we have a real chance to report something earth shattering, and get in front of this.”

VR: “What kind of amazing things? A new comet or an metor about to hit us again?”

YK: “No! He gave me some pictures and reports, and I think it’s a goddamn *alien spaceship*”.

Nancy stopped the playback, and Samford stared at her for a very long minute and responded with “I’m waiting for the punchline”.

“Sir, there is no punch line; Kornelyuk managed to get Rubipon to fund a ticket and was able to get his visa approved amazingly fast. He’s already here. Whatever is going on, space ship or not, a lot of people who are a whole lot smarter than us are treating it very seriously. And I think we should too.”

---

*Christ, it was humid* was the first thing that Yevgeny Kornelyuk thought of when he stepped out of the LAX airport. His connecting flight from Texas had been delayed and his luggage made it before he did. Like many foreigners, he assumed that anything to do with space flight in America was in Houston, Texas, but being laughed at by his editor cleared that up.

*Just as well, I would have been looking for a story in the wrong place - again.* He muttered, under his breath, without thinking, “but at least a good place for a farm.”

Dragging his suitcase over the curb, he waved down a taxi. “JPL. Fastest way, please”.

Watching from a few cars down, Agent Boyard Nicles of the FBI pulled out smoothly behind the taxi. “Tracker is working nicely, and what did he mean by a farm?” he commented to his partner. “Hmph” was the only reply.

---


Jim Broachfield was talking quietly with one of the techs working on of the many control panels. The main screens were showing live images the Webb, Hubble, Far Side, and a few other ground-based stations, all of which were showing various star fields. A graph flowed across one display, giving a live composite readout from the SNEWS systems, and a few smaller monitors were showing telemetry data from the Mars Observatory still orbiting the red planet. The sounds of people doing their various tasks and speaking quietly into headsets provided a constant, subtle background noise that only made the buzz of the cell in Jim’s pocket seem that much louder.

“Jimbo. What? You are fucking kidding me! No, goddammit, shit, send him down to main ops. Jesus christ on a pogo stick”. It was hard to hang up a cell phone with the same kind of emotional force as slamming a receiver down, but Jim gave it his best effort. The tech he was standing next to looked up with one eyebrow raised, as if to ask what had his boss so upset.

“Reporters!” growled Jim Broachfield as an answer.

Yevgeny looked apprehensively at the receptionist, who had jerked as if she had been stuck with a cattle prod. “Well then!” she exclaimed “He seemed rather… agitated that you were here, but said to send you over”. Yevgeny nodded, still mostly awed at the displays suspended from the ceiling. “You’re going to need a visitor badge” - the one handed to him said “PRESS” on it in big white letters with a blue background - “and we’ll need to know your contact info.”

“My.. what? My contacts?” Yevgeny was confused. Why would they need them? Was he supposed to wear eyeglasses?

“No, I mean your contact information, like where you are staying and your phone number and stuff,” the receptionist - whose name was Marcy he now noticed - was trying to be helpful with the slightly distracted reporter.

“Oh, da, yes, sorry. I just arrived direct from airport, I don’t have a hotel yet, and my cell is Russian, so I don’t think it will work here, but I can give you my paper’s phone number if that helps.” Yevgeny was apologetic and managed to get his focus away from the replicas - was that *actually* the Mars Rover?

Marcy smiled and said “oh no problem, we can set you up at the Hilton nearby, we do that all the time. As for a phone, that depends on how long you are here for?”

“My visa is only good for two weeks, so just in and out I’m afraid. I might be able to extended it, but not by much”. Viktoriya had pulled a *lot* of strings and called in more than a few favors to get a visa in his name approved, and he was sure some of them involved a bribe. Or worse. At lot was riding on this story, for both of them. If this didn’t pan out, Yevgeny wasn’t sure a farm in Texas - or anywhere - would keep Viktoriya from coming after him, favorite nephew twice removed or not. He had a feeling it would be changed to just *removed*, full stop.

“Well probably not then, but if you need one, let me know and we’ll set you up with a temp one. Oh, here’s Josh, he’ll show to Jim. You can leave your bag with me, I’ll send it over to your room. Nice meeting you!”

Yevgeny smiled back and replied with a “nice meet you too”, before Josh led him deeper into the facility.


---

Boyard listened carefully to the bug that had been dropped in Yevgeny’s suit pocket by an agent in the airport in Texas. “That’s our cue. Get in there and grab the bag, and we’ll hotfoot it to the Hilton”.

“Hmph” was the only reply his partner gave as he exited the car.

“Hi, I’m from the Hilton for Mr. Kornelyuk’s luggage?” the well-groomed man smiled down at Marcy from his impressive height. She stared back up at him, startled by how quietly he had approached.

“Oh!” she squeaked. *Real professional there girl,* she chastised herself. Clearing her throat she tried again, “um yes, my, you are quick, I mean, you got here fast”. *Get a grip Marcy!*

“I was nearby and got a call, so it was simpler to grab it now and drop it off later. That won’t be a problem, will it?”

*You can grab me now and drop me off later,* Marcy thought, mesmerized by his hazel eyes. “N-no, it’s right, um, right here. Room 4023”. She rolled the luggage out and attempted to pick it up, but was stopped by Mr. Tall-and-Hazel before she had a chance.

“Thanks, but I’ve got it,” and with that, he turned and left with Yevgeny’s bag in one hand, as if it was nothing, leaving a very flustered Marcy behind.

---

Boyard was writing up case notes when his partner thumped the luggage into the trunk, and started up the car as he got in. “What room?”

“4023. And you get the bags next time, ok?”

“What, too much for you? Can’t handle one little girl?” Boyard laughed.

“Creeped me out, having to smile like that. Probably creeped her too, acted like she was scared of me.”

---

Josh was recounting what he had found from the Voyager 1 data, much to Yevgeny’s entertainment. He was just so wound up with excitement from what was going on, and being a part of it - he never thought that a summer intern job at JPL would turn out like this!

*Nobody did*, thought Yevgeny. “So, it’s been what, about two weeks since this started?” That didn’t match with the information he had been given.

“Naw man, we’ve only figured it out, like, two weeks ago. Voyager, like, it was sitting on the data for a week or so before it squirted it back to us, and then the new-treeno dudes got their shit together, and then, wham!” he smacked his hands together, causing Yevgeny to jump a bit “magic, man! And then the dude from Australia posted his picture of the thing, and was asking if someone was testing new stealth planes, and we just knew man, just knew!”

Yevgeny hadn’t realized that the blurry picture was from Australia, and he mentally kicked himself for not using an image search to match the source. Of course it would have been posted. “You just knew what? Man.”

Josh stopped and looked around, and cupped his hands in front of him.

2bcza4,2,2014-07-21,Having trouble with interview question: Why are you leaving your current job?,jbo-throwaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bcza4/having_trouble_with_interview_question_why_are/,"The reason I'm looking for another job is pay.

This is the truth, but maybe not the right answer (or is it?). I'm just not sure what else to say.


**Context:**

I'm still getting paid $10/hour for my position as an intern. This is my first job out of College, and I've been at it for about 26 months. I was initially happy with my position, as at that time, I valued experience over pay. But now, for what I do, I could easily be getting twice as much at any other place. My boss even acknowledged this when I confronted him about it last month. He says that he can give me a raise, but not immediately. Apparently he found out about my pay just a couple weeks before. He even offered to set up a meeting with his headhunters. Can't tell if he's being sincere or if it's his way of showing me the door.

In speaking to my manager, he indicated that he expects me to take on more projects. This was the first time I've heard this ... up to this point I had always thought my role was to 'keep the wheels greased', by focusing on bug fixes and feature additions. So there was a bit of miscommunication, as I expected projects to be delegated. I'm very confident in my ability to debug/reverse engineer code, add features, and automating manual processes. But I would agree with my supervisor, I need to do more large projects.

At any rate, I feel rather pigeonholed. If I answer ""pay"", the question becomes: ""How much do you make"". If I say $10/hour, this seems to heavily indicate performance issues. It's entirely possible that I'm making a big deal out of nothing :| But I hope to tap into some wisdom here.

2bczur,2,2014-07-21,Should I graduate early or stay the last year for more internship experience?,xjtian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bczur/should_i_graduate_early_or_stay_the_last_year_for/,"I'm in a position right now where I could graduate with a BS in CS next year (spring 2015) after 3 years of undergrad, or stay an extra year, maybe do some research, and add an extra year of internship experience to my resume. I'm considering staying the extra year because I'm not sure if my resume is strong enough to attract many full-time offers.

My page at http://xjtian.com basically has everything that's on my resume. I'll list the highlights here as well.

1. BS in CS at University of Maryland on a full academic scholarship, 3.8GPA currently. Could graduate 2015, technically in the class of 2016.
2. Github: https://github.com/xjtian
3. Summer 2012 &amp; 2013 I interned at the [JHU Applied Physics Lab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Physics_Laboratory). Worked on a wide variety of things my first summer, writing drivers for wired gloves &amp; inertial sensors and a game in Unity3D among them. My second summer I just did front-end web dev &amp; design.
4. Currently, I'm interning at Bloomberg in NYC.

Should I stay for my last year and go for an internship at a big name company in summer 2015 to beef up my resume, or am I a qualified enough candidate for full-time positions starting 2015? Also, if I do stay one more year, should I continue as a full-time student, or do part-time classes (6 credits a semester) and intern part-time?

Thanks in advance for any advice!"
2bd1c6,6,2014-07-21,Looking for a new razor,elykl33t,wicked_edge,https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/2bd1c6/looking_for_a_new_razor/,"Hey wicked_edge! I started using a DE razor a bit over a year ago and right around that time is when I stumbled upon this subreddit. Now I'm coming here for advice!

I currently own a rather plain, but solid [""Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor""](http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Long-Handled-Safety-Razor/dp/B000NL0T1G) that I ordered just because from what I could find, it was a solid and inexpensive start point.

Now with my summer internship, I have a little money to spend and am looking to upgrade to something a bit more aesthetically pleasing, and maybe not so ""beginner"" since I have been shaving with a DE razor for some time now.

I have looked fairly extensively at a lot of stuff linked to from the wiki, and am finding myself gravitating more towards razors with (mostly) black handles.

The two that are catching my eye right now are:

* The [Edwin Jagger DE86811](http://www.westcoastshaving.com/Edwin-Jagger-DE86811-Double-Edge-Safety-Razor-Octagonal-Imitation-Ebony-Chrome_p_1026.html) since it looks nice, and Edwin Jagger seems to have a good reputation.
* The [Timor Gunmetal Safety Razor](http://connaughtshaving.com/1321lh.html) which I'm reading is a rebranded Weishi and is a relatively ""mild"" razor, and thus can be seen as more ""beginner"" and doesn't give as close of a shave.

Can anyone offer some insight on the razors I have mentioned so far, or point me towards some other options I might like based on what I have said? I am still fairly new to all of this, and any advice would be appreciated!"

2bd2z3,4,2014-07-21,Everyone has their story to tell. Here’s mine.,mawkish_me,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2bd2z3/everyone_has_their_story_to_tell_heres_mine/,"It's a long read, but if it helps relate with at least one person out there, I know I didn't waste my time writing this.

I first inhaled back in high school, at the end of graduation party. It did nothing for me, while my other two friends were giggling like mad men beside me.

I thought to myself, who would waste their money on something so stupid like this?

I thought that my mind was too strong for this plant. 

I thought I was done after this one time hit.

How wrong I was. I knew nothing.

Fast forward two years; I’m in college and doing decent for myself. Not necessarily the top of the class, but I found a good internship back in my home city. During this internship is when I started hanging out with a couple of old buddies from high school who had went to other colleges.

One night after partying with their friends, one of them pulls out a joint. When I saw that white paper filled with green unknowns ignite with red fire, I was determined not to back out. I didn’t want to look afraid in front of my peers. I didn’t think it would penetrate my invincible brain. And of course, there was a girl. Girls are another type of drug, making you do stupid things. In fact, she was the one who pulled out the joint in the first place, so (*in my mind*) I definitely couldn't back out.

I inhaled once more, and made sure it stayed. I coughed and coughed, and you all know what that meant.

That first hazy night of being high was all a blur to me, all I remembered was having a *great* time. Laughing like a maniac, talking with a pretty girl, listening to flowing music, and the *food!* Never had I experienced such sensations to my five senses. 

I thought to myself, who *wouldn't* want to smoke this phenomenal plant?

I started to accept each invitation to fly high with great joy each time with no hesitation and no regrets. 

After a few months, I moved back to my college town to continue my studies and left my friends back home. Over the next few months, I lost contact with my friends and I lost contact with the girl, but I didn't lose my love for weed. Now that I think about it, weed was the only thing that really connected us. Without it, we were strangers to each other. I indulged in it, greedily inhaling every smoke like it was air. I started smoking up alone, at first quietly during nights, and then secretly during day. Then openly before dinner time, and then proudly before class. I wanted to do every mundane thing while high. I wanted to re-experience everything I've ever done.

I read into too much of the Internets sage advice of ""not giving a fuck"", ""do what makes you happy"", ""you won't be able to do this when you're out of college, so do it now"", etc. I realize now that, like drugs, everything should be done with moderation. Even not giving a fuck. Sometimes, you should really give a fuck or two. 

So what happened to invincible mawkish_me? You can guess the obvious: failed 2/3 courses (it wasn't even a full course load), barely kept in contact with any friends except my pothead roommates, almost decided to quit my next internship because I was too embarrassed and had too much trouble remembering what the fuck I was supposed to do. I could tell my manager was severely disappointed in me, and perhaps himself for hiring me. 

All this led up to my depression.

I had never believed in people with depression. I was one of those people who thought ""why don't they just cheer up? Stop being so sad. It's all in their head."" Then I realized depression wasn't an emotion; it was a state. Depression isn't being sad for a week after hearing that your dog died, it's crying for no reason while you're taking a shower on the floor because you're too helpless to even stand up. It's bailing on your friends birthday party with a weak excuse, because you don't want to socialize with other people. It's taking two sick days in a row (when you've taken a few before already) because you don't even have the energy to rise up. 

I took anti-depressants, but it didn't help me much. I just started a habit of grinding my teeth and a loss of appetite. Food that which I once loved was now tasteless to my mouth. The pills did not help me because I was still smoking weed at the same time. I knew this at the back of my mind, but I couldn't say it out loud. I was dependant on her haze, now more than ever, in my lowest of lows. It was the cause of my darkness, but it gave me a candles light each time I lit up. Let me tell you right now friends; if you are in that darkness yourself, a candle will not help you guide the way out. It will extinguish in an hour and leave you with a mess made of wax. You need to go fearlessly towards the exit. You may not know where the exit is, but reach out with your hands, for your friends and family will lead you to the right direction. 

Now, I know some type of people can handle weed perfectly fine. Some say they only smoke during the weekends. Some say they can smoke up before class and do even better than while sober. I applaud those type of people, but I know you and I aren't those type of people. We are the type of people who will ration out their half ounce for the week, and then smoke it all in two days. We are the type of people who don't remember the last time they were sober. We are the type of people who will scrape off our grinders and ziploc bags for that *one. more. hit.* to get us going for the day, or until our dealer comes to drop off another bag. The whole ""weed isn't addictive"" was very counter productive to me, as it made me feel less guilty for smoking up every hour like a fiend. I am that type of person, and I needed to realize that.

My internship had finally come to an end. I got a horrible evaluation, and my manager left on my last day without a word. This isn't me. This isn't who I wanted to be. I desperately needed change. I couldn't go back to my college to study, or rather, fail again. I couldn't go back to living with my roommates who would sink me further into a life of laziness. I didn't see a bright future anymore. This is when I decided to take a break from school to go travelling during the summer. I had one friend on the other side of the country who was willing to live with me for a month. I was quite hesitant at first; it was supposed to be me and another friend going there; he had to cancel on the last minute. But I was done bailing out on agreements; I went alone.

My decision to go travel was the *best* thing I have ever done in my life. Being in a new area had made it hard for me to find a dealer. Don't get me wrong, I could've gotten it if I had actively looked for it, but I never did. My friend showed me so much support when I confessed my addiction and depression for the past year. She listened and guided me out of the dark, and taught me how to smile again. I never dared to flake out on a friend. I went out and socialized. I met a beautiful girl, one that I would never have talked to if I was still lighting up. I made new friends, friends that I could actually call them friends. All without the help of a plant.

Coming back to my old life was probably my greatest test of will yet. I arrived back to my apartment and the first thing my roommates ask is if I wanted to smoke up. I said ""no"", and I said it again and again for the next hundred times they asked. I know that sometimes, it'll be hard for me to say no. I know that my brain is not invincible. But I also know that smoking will bring me nothing new, it'll only bring back the old bad. I know that if I pick up that bong again, then I will never be the man I strive to be. I know that if I roll up a joint, then I'll only imagine the disappointed face of my friend. As of right now, the number is 64. I know that if I put my lips on her smokey lips, that number goes back to 0. Fuck the 0, I'm going for 100000."

How do I use what little experience I am gaining to get a more development center job?,bain_n_switch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bd3ka/level_1_soft_eng_doing_little_to_no_coding_how_do/,"if you want a little background, you can see my previous post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qbdnl/i_feel_like_i_got_the_bait_and_switchnow_what/

some more background (skip ahead a couple of paragraphs if you just want the question):
basically, I am an older lvl 1 (30) working on a program in which I was told was web development but in actuality ensures high availability of network traffic.   I do little to no coding.  This fact alone grinds on me everyday.  Our baseline is comprised mostly of configuration files and configuration scripts.  We work almost exclusively with oracle products, and I grow more and more frustrated every day I come in to work.  This isn't what I want to do, this isn't what I went back to school to do, this isn't what I put myself in debt to achieve.
I had a better attitude in the beginning but I grow more frustrated every day.  The only thing keeping my spirits up are the good group of people I work with.  Being older than the average level 1 I feel like I don't have any time to waste gaining experience in an area of the field I do not wish to be a part of.  It is unlikely I would be able to transition to another team in the company because of the time investment that has already been made in me, and the team is still in need of a couple more people, so wouldn't let me go easy.  The lead on the team is also really a great guy, and has done everything he could to help me.  While I understand this is reputable and necessary work, and the pay is decent for out of school, no amount of money can keep me happy if I don't find the work at least somewhat rewarding. (end of venting rant)

The actual question:The buzz words I hear tossed around at work are SOA, cloud computing, web services (though I haven't written any), ORACLE products, j2ee (though I barely code in java), JMS, python/jython.  I would like more to work in application/web app development.  Something .NET or RoR/Django related.  Game dev would be fun but probably out of reach for me.  Soon, I will have 1 year exp when I begin my job search, plus 6 month .NET (wpf) internship experience.  How do I use my experience to get a job where I can actually create something tangible?  Or is the forcast of the area of work I am currently in so good that I should make this my home forever?

Please help, thank you."

* Should I apply to internships even though I am incredibly underqualified? (I have no previous work experience)

* When should I start applying for Internships?


* Do you have any tips for someone like me trying to get an internship? I want to be prepared so that I have a good shot at landing an internship for the Summer of 2015. (I can't take another summer of nothing!!!)

Social anxiety is getting a bit better
I'm doing better at my internship
More interest in books and music
More active desire to socialize
Less brain fog

My longest streak is 7-8 days on and off for about 3 months. Every time I get around a week I relapse because the urges just become too strong to resist like it gets to the point where I don't care about the progress and just binge and restart because its hard to focus and sleep. Like I know that quitting porn has all these benefits and to everyone else I just say stay strong and keep at it because this absolutely is the right thing to do but for some reason I just can't make it work.

It is also hard because I will get drunk and then not care and then re binge. Do you guys have tips?"
2bd8jt,1,2014-07-22,Me [20 M] with my GF [21 F] of about 1 year 8 months. Currently semi-long distance because we're both home from school for the summer and I feel as though she doesn't try hard enough to see me,throwawayaccount0222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bd8jt/me_20_m_with_my_gf_21_f_of_about_1_year_8_months/,"Hey /r/relationships, made a throwaway for this post. So my girlfriend (who we'll call Jess) and I have been together for over a year and a half and we met at college. We live about 3.5 hours apart so while its not super far, it's far enough to make it a little difficult to see each other often.

This is our second summer we've had apart, and we've been trying to see each other whenever we can. It can be a little difficult with work and plans with family and friends but we try to see each other on the weekends at least every couple weeks.

Personally I like being able to spend a lot of time with Jess when I can. When we're at school together we basically see each other every day, and we're both fine with that since she's my best friend. We don't really ever argue about anything and overall we just have a very strong relationship.

Last summer we had been going out for about 6 months when we went back home and started working our summer jobs. At her job she basically worked every day of the week for 13 hours a day so she didn't really have time to visit me often. So I did the best I could to take off work and visit every other weekend or so.  This summer, she cut down on her hours much more at the job she had last summer and she has more control over her scheduling. Jess also is working as an intern this summer for someone in the field she is possibly interested in going to grad school for but overall she really doesnt work that many hours there.  She has less control over her schedule here, but she could still ask for time off if she told them ahead of time.

Jess has also been pretty busy with family events and such (some of which I have driven up to go to) on the weekends but we have managed to see each other a few times now and it is a little closer to a 50/50 split of her visiting and me visiting which I'd prefer since last summer I was basically the only one doing the visiting.

Now, my problem lies here: we did get to see each other more earlier in the summer but we don't get to see each other as often now. We both express how we much each other and how we could see each other but I feel as though she won't put in the effort to visit me like I would (and did) for her. She will tell me that she really wishes she could see me and when I try to create some sort of a plan where we could take off maybe a day or two of work to see each other she seems to like the idea but won't take the action of actually trying to take off work even though it would be possible if she did it ahead of time. I just wish she would put in a little more effort in trying to see me like I do for her and it's making me feel a little unappreciated but I'm not sure how to bring it up without feeling like a jerk.

We're usually very good at discussing anything we have to talk about but any help you guys have for me would be awesome. Thanks

EC's: -Internship at intel as a validation engineer/technicial (summer after freshman year)
-Currently interning at hewlett packard as a software engineer (for the summer)
-4 years of being on a first tech challenge robotics team in high school, went to national championships twice
-Spent a year on my current schools mars rover robotics team (competing in the university rover challenge)
-various other coding / programming side projects (don't know how much this matters)

The only thing that is worrying me is that I got a B- in one of my compsci classes, its only 1 tho, but for a competitive program like UIUC I am worrying this might severely damage my chances, I'm not entirely sure though.

2bdszh,1,2014-07-22,"About (sexual) texting, need advice",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2bdszh/about_sexual_texting_need_advice/,"There is this girl I never met in real life. She started pursuing me 3 months ago. We matched on Tinder. She added me on FaceBook and I accepted her. Then I added her on WhatsApp.
Now she seems to be very desperate but also sweet. I don't have a lot of experience with women so I thought this would be a good chance. The thing is she started texting me with a sexual undertone. Note: she didn't sent any nudes.

Since then I felt like crap. I felt the dopamine rushing through me. And I notice I fantasize about her when I lay in my bed. Or when I just wake up I also fantasize about her and I feel the dopamine rushing through me. I find it hard to stop it.

Now since 3 days I have been feeling groggy, brainfoggy and overall not good. Not as bad as when PMO-ing but I notice my energy is totally gone and I feel like I am addicted to texting her. We want to meet up Thursday but I don't feel like it. I don't even like her that much, she is too needy and desperate. But on the other hand my brain is: ""easy sex bro, go do it!!!""

Before this I loved going out with my friends, hit up on (REAL) girls and flirt with them and see their beauty. I loved socialising. Now I feel like sitting inside all day, sleeping. I even lost motivation to go to the gym (I still go but my lifting have sucked the last few days). This sounds like PMO doesn't it?

But I still have a bit of my confidence and eye contact is not hard. I just feel totally uninterested in real girls that I see around me. That's when my alarm bell started ringing. I know that I am doing something that I shouldn't be doing. Before this I loved watching real girls and flirt with them. And I loved life in general even though I had no relationship or a girl to be with!

I think the problem is that before this all I was doing a very intense internship so I was busy all day. Now I don't have a job at the moment and I am working on graduating. This leaves a huge gap. So slowly I started getting back at my old (bad) habits. While it's not PMO, it's still triggering.

Now as you can see even after 115 days there is still danger.

Can someone give me advice? Should I block her and move on? Can someone give them their experience with this?
Thank you!"

The year was amazing, first real girlfriend she is amazing


I started my first real job a month after graduation and things went bad.  She was busy at her internship and I wasnt that busy because I was doing training.I started to get clingy. She went from living in an apartment where she hated her roommates to moving into a soroity with her best friends. And i did a bad job of giving her space and letting her do her thing. I got out of work and just wanted to hang out with her. I stopped hanging with my friends, She dated me because I did my thing and let her do hers but once she we started working the dynamic got so much different.

I let us not texting as much affect me so much. I know she would be out with her friends and she would always get back to me but I wasn't feeling better. We were drunk and got into an arguement and we talked it all out and she told me everything to do and she was right. But i didnt feel any better. We were fine when we were together but once we were apart id freak out. I screwed up next by talking to all her friends and my friends about our problems when I should have just talked to her. Last friday i knew she was going away for the weekend and when we said good bye in the morning and we loved each other and to text each other this weekend. We talked a little around lunch time and that was that. She went out and didnt respond I saw that she posted instagrams when she got there and got so hurt that she didnt text me she was there or whatever. I know i was wrong but i texted her at like 4 am ""so are we done?"" so stupid and wrong i ruined a weekend that she had planned for months. 
 I asked her to talk last night and she wasnt ready but i said i needed to she called me out on a lot of things i needed to work on. Maturity, having space, letting her do her thing, the fact that we dont live together and we need to get back to dating not just sitting in my room. I knew i was in the wrong and had to grow up things were fine i was freaking out for zero reason. 

then she asked if i had taken drugs while we were dating. It was her one rule. not weed hard stuff. I said yes but i promise not when with you and she said ""now is not the time to lie"" and i said im so sorry i have done it when we hung out. She was so upset i broke her heart and her trust. Her one rule was no hard drugs and she knows i lied our whole relationship. Said no wonder you dont trust me youve lied right in front of my face. She just cried and cried. said lets get food. wouldnt let me pay for her. but i said like please dont leave me and she just started crying again. we went and sat and she just keep crying. 

I said listen i know i fucked up and broke your heart and trust and i dont deserve you, if you want to break up with me just do it, if you want a break just tell me and she just said i dont know. and said i dont know if we can fix this. I really broke her heart and trust. we sat and she just didnt say anything after a while just said she wanted to go to sleep...i just said whatever you decide please do it in person and that was that..i know i need to give her space and let her come to me just bummin out at work today i love this girl

I've googled around and most of the solutions I've found only apply if you can't access your dashboard at all. I can, but it just looks wonky and has limited functionality. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

The email was pretty self-explanatory. ""Due to recent reports of alleged security problems by an intern, I have had to temporarily block access to spotify. I apologize for the inconvenience.""

It got around relatively quickly that Jack was the one responsible. Two of the interns quit. They stopped playing music out loud. None of them talked to Jack.

He wasn't in the intern room for very long anyway. About a week after his hire, Boss's Wife decided to let Jack just use her office while she wasn't there, presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him.

*

Day 8. I got an email from Jack. ""I'm having issues accessing Buzzfeed.""

I didn't even move from my chair, emailing back a simple reply: ""Due to management concerns, Buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings.""

His email was immediate. ""Please? I just want to check some things while I'm on lunch.""

I replied back a simple ""No"" and went about my day. and that was the last I ever heard from Jack.

I'm kidding. *Of course it wasn't.*

*

Day 9. Someone had opened my desk. See, I have a laptop in my desk. The laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it, like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a usually-blocked news site. It's common knowledge I have it.

Someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop.

I stormed down to the officer manager's desk. She and I have the only two keys to my desk. I told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing.

""Oh?"" she said, confused. ""Boss came down here and needed the key to your desk.""

""Boss!?"" I was taken aback. ""I...alright."" Maybe Boss needed the laptop for something, I told myself. But that didn't stop me from going straight to Boss' Wife's office.

There, sitting at the polished hardwood desk, sat Jack, with my laptop. And my desk key next to it.

I approached. ""Jack, I need you to give me that back.""

Jack shook his head. ""I got approval from Boss. The computer in here was acting funny, so I asked if I could use your spare laptop and he said yes.""

I was completely stunned. ""So you asked Boss to get you the key to my desk--"" I picked the desk key up and put it in my pocket--""then take my laptop, and use it for..."" I looked over the screen. Two windows docked side by side: Facebook and Cheezburger. ""...this?""

He shifted the laptop so I couldn't see the screen and cleared his throat like I was intruding on his private data. ""Thanks. You can go now.""

*You can go now.*

*You. Can. Go. Now.*

Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Shit doesn't work like this, man. I felt like I wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me, but I steadied my hand and took a breath. The only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a spoiled intern.

The only laptop with unrestricted access.

I smiled at Jack. ""Alright, no problem. Have a good day."" I walked out of the office.

I had a plan. Jack was fucking going **down**.

**Edit**: WOW! Thanks to whoever gave me gold!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How often are there mice casualties, and when they do happen do you feel a guilt about it, or is it just part of the job that you've become accustomed to? Basically, how much emotional baggage comes with the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3wg19?context=5)|It depends on when in the procedure, but eventually all the mice are casualties. The most common place it happens are when we put them through pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. In layman's terms, when we give them epilepsy. This can often have a casualty rate of over 50% and involves watching mice seize, sometimes to death, for three hours.
 |I can tell you with a hundred percent certainty that I haven't met a single researcher who enjoys this process and isn't bothered by it. A lot of people break into tears. At the end of the day we all have to rationalize it by knowing that it will bring good to and improve the quality of life, maybe even save it, for a lot of people.
 |There are other procedures that are difficult as well, such as live profusions to preserve and remove the brain of an animal that is still alive for the preservation stage of the procedure. This really bothered me the first time I did it, but that ""numbness"" that happens after awhile is more you cementing in your mind that this will help a lot of people.
 |Also on related note, there are tons of provisions in place that make sure the animals feel little to no pain at any time and are treated humanely at all times. I know a lot of people say this as a sort of hurried defense but I can attest that we can get in huge trouble for breaking any of these rules and nothing kills a research lab faster than losing grant money because of animal cruelty sanctions. 
[Hello, thanks for doing this AmA. What advice would you have for a high school student interested in a career in science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3rogq?context=5)|It really depends what you want to do in regards to 'science'.
 |If you're talking R&amp;D a lot of it comes down to the university you choose. The specific one I go to has reputation as a large research university that has connections to a lot of local businesses and, in my case, a huge research hospital. So in short I guess just make sure the college you're going to has connections to research opportunities.
 |Also don't be afraid to be wrong in what you first declare as your major. I made a 90 degree change in my path after a year. No one expects you to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at 18 and there's no shame in realizing that what you thought you wanted wasn't what you expected.
 |Finally utilize your advisors. This was my biggest problem coming into college. Unlike your high school (probably) abvisors can help you out with everything from getting you into closed classes to waiving requirements to courses to getting you an internship or job just by asking. *Do not be afraid to ask for help.* It's much better than failing alone.
 |I hope that answers your question at least a little.
[Thanks for the reply, you did answer my question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3tw2r?context=5)|You're welcome. Best of luck in whatever your choose to pursue!
[How do you dispose of the deceased mice? Are they cremated at the lab if they are cremated at all? And if they aren't disposed of properly would there be a big risk of their disease endangering anyone or other mice in the lab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj52obm?context=5)|I'm not sure what the final method of disposal is, I assume it's cremation, though. The last time is see them is bagging them and putting them into a cold room next to necropsy (the room where most post death procedures are performed). The cold largely removes the threat of germ transfer.
 |I will say that none of the mice that I know of are undergoing infectious disease research. There are, however, a lot of mice I don't know of.
 |Transferring disease to the mice I handle is almost nil though. I have to swipe into a room, take my clothes off, change to scrubs, a mask, gown, shoe covers, gloves and a cap, then go through a 30 second air shower. Any outside material we bring in goes under a uv hood. It's very tightly controlled (and pretty cool) . Additionally if you go through any of the ""dirty"" areas that animals are kept in you have to either shower or wait 24 hours before going behind the clean barrier again.
 |Tl;Dr of that last paragraph: there are a ridiculous amount of sanitary procedures in place to minimize risk to us and the animals. 
[everything possible is done to minimize pain and discomfort. When experiments are not occurring the mice are treated very well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj42ld8?context=5)|Minimize is a key word there. We do everything we can to make it as humane as possible but there is always some risk. However without animal testing what option is there? People don't respond well to injecting their children and loved ones with untested drugs.
[Also, experiments will not be approved if the experiments could possibly be completed in a different model organism (i.e. cell culture, yeast, fruit flies, or nematodes\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj42ld8?context=5)|This as well. Animals are expensive and require a lot of people and a lot of time to take care of. There's often this thought of ""unnecessary"" testing for drugs and products going on. People don't understand the culture of lab work and how important budgeting your, often sparse, resources is.
[How friendly are the mice that you work on?.  If you wanted to could you like pet and hold them?!.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3sp2f?context=5)|Well the mice i work with specifically are actually pretty nasty. We induce epilepsy in them for the work we're doing and for some reason this makes them particularly aggressive when you're trying to handle them. They like to bite and don't really want to be touched, luckily almost all the hands-on work we do with them involves them being sedated in one way or another.
 |In general though the mice that are in the clean barrier (where a majority of the mice in the research wing are kept) are nice and playful like any normal mouse you'd buy in a pet shop. Part of the animal training involves picking up the mice and putting them on your hand and those mice were perfectly content to just chill on your hand and sniff around.
[Not to be an ass, but could the aggression not stem from fear over the experimentation? (I've heard research dogs are basically unadoptable for similar reasons.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj40l2i?context=5)|No offense taken. It's possible, though there are many possibilities and I'm sure someone could do months of research on just that issue. Personally i think it's more to do with the region of the brain that the pilocarpine targets: the hippocampus.
 |Since the hippocampus plays a huge role in memory storage my hypothesis is that it messes with or deletes their memories of humans, possibly even causing a type of mild anterograde amnesia. This would mean that despite being raised by humans the mice would have no perception of what we were and would be scared by even our appearance (they do get a bit skittish as well and are easily scared if you peer too close to their box).
 |Who knows, maybe it's just a reaction to severe pain. They don't care for other mice much after the status either. Your guess is as good as mine.
 |This is just another reason science is so interesting, always raising more questions.
[How hesitant are you to talk to your PhD bosses/supervisors about science when they know so much more than you do, and almost any question highlights the fact that you know so little as a college student? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3xrfs?context=5)|The PhD candidate I work under is awesome. She's my main liaison at the lab and my contact with her is essential to my everyday work. We have a very open work relationship and I'm not hesitant to ask her anything I'm unsure of. She was in her undergrad not too ago so she understands where I'm coming from.
 |The doctor who runs the lab on the other hand is a little more imposing. I've only spoken to him a half dozen times in so many months. Though he is a font of knowledge from what I've gleaned. He's also an expert in laser microscopy which is pretty interesting and which I do a lot of in the lab. I normally wouldn't approach him since I honestly feel like I don't know what I'm doing when I talk to him. 
[Real question! what is the difference between your control and experiment group? (i.e.\) what are they receiving and are they from the same litter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4919w?context=5)|The control receives a dose of our treatment before we record them (sorry, unpublished results tight now and we're working against another researcher) and the control group receives a saline injection.
 |I believe a that we are using the same litter for mice being recorded at the same time. However with an n near 100 that's not entirely possible. We do use the same breeders multiple times and all mice are genotyped after we record them to ensure consistency. 
[Do you work for a research company named Jackson? Or Jackson Labs or Jackson Research or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3tzci?context=5)|No, I work in the research wing of a nationally ranked hospital.
 |Anyone familiar with the area I live in could probably guess where based on the design of my badge in my proof.
 |I looked it up and Jackson Labs is actually who we get a lot of our mice from since our research requires mice with specific genes activated and deactivated. It's just usually abbreviated JAX whenever I see it.
[I'm close friends with Dr. Sanchez, if my conjectures are correct, he is a vet that takes care of the animals.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3xsd1?context=5)|I'm not familiar with that name. 
[Neuroscience seems like an interesting field which I unfortunately never got the chance to explore all that much while I was in undergrad (just graduated in May with a BS in molecular biology and a chemistry minor\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4aweb?context=5)|I do quite a bit, actually. I section brains, stain slides, do confocal imaging, analyze those images, analyze our EEG data, and I've even helped or performed numerous surgeries or operations.
[How much do you currently do around the lab and are you planning to increase your responsibilities in the future? Any plans for after you graduate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4aweb?context=5)|I don't write any of the papers or design any of the experiments, though, and I don't get paid (unfortunately). I alluded to it in another post but I'm not sure what I'm going to pursue yet. I'll be taking the MCAT but this work has actually sparked a strong interest in the research side of medicine. 
[Very cool, especially the surgery bit. I'm in a similar situation at the moment and I've learned that there is never a downside to keeping an open mind about your interests and goals. You'll never know where you might end up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4zwmi?context=5)|Definitely, an open mind is really the best thing you can have as a college student/young professional. There are so many things that you've never had exposure to and writing them off only hurts you.
[PS: don't let the trolls get to you. I had a similar reaction from people when I told them about my experience in biotechnology/bioengineering research. Anti-GMO people are...interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4zwmi?context=5)|Eh, I'm over it, but thanks. I can only tolerate people who are purposely ignorant for so long. as for GMOs, talk about a topic that people detract for similar reasons. I'd ask the more or less the same question I asked the troll, ""What are your alternatives? Where's your data that it's a bad thing?""
[Yeah, thats pretty much how I handled the whole GMO thing as well (although it gets annoying thanks to all of those ""truth about Monsanto"" websites which never get peer reviewed anyway\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj5akoq?context=5)|It's amazing how much misinformation is spread and how much people take it to heart. It actually makes me sad sometimes because it stifles scientific progress.
[Good luck on your MCAT! I'm working on mine now :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj5akoq?context=5)|Thanks and good luck to you as well. I'm not taking mine for a semester or two but I'm already getting study materials together/looking at courses.
[What are your aspirations beyond undergrad? What type of mice do you use (just curious\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj46jlf?context=5)|Honestly I'm not 100% sure. Originally I was all about getting into med school, and I still plan on taking the MCAT and applying, but doing this has opened my eyes to the research side of medicine and how interesting it is.
 |I know the mice we use are all from JAX, which is a massive supplier but off the top of my head I don't know the strain. 
[Awesome! Best of luck on the mcat. I'm studying for the GRE right now and hope to go to grad school to get my ph.d. in neuroscience. We use Peromyscus californicus in the lab I work in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj57fph?context=5)|Thanks, and best of luck to you too! I have a few friends who just took the GRE and their life was hell in the weeks leading up to it but the studying paid off. Good luck with grad school as well, with any luck you'll end up doing some really cool and beneficial research.
[*Originally I was all about getting into med school, and I still plan on taking the MCAT and applying,*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj58p88?context=5)|You realize that more or less every licensed graduate of med school worked in a research lab during their undergrad at some point, right? It's part of the curriculum for most undergrads for a pre-medical/biology track.
[How often do experiments that worked on mice actually work on other animals, or even humans? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3uyze?context=5)|I can't accurately answer this question from a numbers standpoint buy I can say that nearly every procedure or drug you've ever used probably went through some level of animal testing on an animal that had a valid human analogue.
 |People unfortunately don't like untested treatments taking place on humans. 
[*People unfortunately don't like untested treatments taking place on humans.*  You could always volunteer.  You know, since the testing is so humane and all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj42xnj?context=5)|**What is your legitimate alternative to animal testing? How do you propose we test drugs and treatments to make them safe for humans?**
[Also, smallpox didn't involve animal testing.  It involved observing that people who'd been infected with cowpox didn't get smallpox.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj43aty?context=5)|&gt; Also, smallpox didn't involve animal testing. It involved observing that people who'd been infected with cowpox didn't get smallpox.
[Pretty sure they were already infected, from what I read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj43nbr?context=5)|No, you're incorrect. It was a huge business opportunity.
[So you'd volunteer to take the place of one of those mice you torture if only it were legal?  Tell the truth, now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj43tuk?context=5)|&gt; So you'd volunteer to take the place of one of those mice you torture if only it were legal?

[Hey OP, i graduated with a degree in Biology and currently am doing research in behavioral genetics with D.melanogaster.

Any hints or tips on how i can land the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4n3cb?context=5)|You're actually farther ahead than I am!
 |Honestly though, just ask around, contact the doctors who run the Labs and ask how they fill their openings and if they have any. Talk to your any contacts you have remaining from college, professors, advisors, whoever has the professional contacts. 
[What made you choose this profession? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3y6z8?context=5)|I'm just doing it as an internship during my undergrad but I more or less have full responsibility as a worker in the lab. I just don't write papers or do the final data analysis. 
[This may or may not be related to your line of work. But whenever they do studies on alcohol effects of addiction or withdrawal seizures or whatever, what kind of alcohol are they using? Im always picturing a bottle of Jameson zip tied to the cage with a feeder, but is it something lab grade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3wcq7?context=5)|Well my research doesn't involve alcohol tests but some of the procedure involves using ethanol (the alcohol you drink) of differing strengths. It's generally diluted in-house from 95% ethanol that we get from a lab supplier.

2bebsy,93,2014-07-22,Never nurture the colony | Day 1,liamgunboun,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2bebsy/never_nurture_the_colony_day_1/,"**FTP|LTL** 

This started earlier this summer when I got a, let's just say internship, at a fairly large tech company (corp#) that operates out of Canada. CORP# provide business solutions for very large businesses. They have many important server banks, most of which are not easily accessed from the office location, luckily for the poor sob(let's call him Rodney). How ever the in house dev servers, that housed the pride and joy of the devs, were quite easily accessed. Our story begins on my second day of the internship. I'm given the skill testing task of reimaging many of the company's old machines for an upcoming staff sale. Rodney just wanted that job off his plate. This ranged from lenovo t40's to dell precision 390's. On this day I was given the task of getting the image off one of the computers (that Rodney had already imaged) via clonezilla. Rodney however was not present, so I was on my own to learn the ins and outs of their process. Being the curious little shit that I am I decided to do a quick virus scan of the computer I was about to take the image from and found there to be what can only be described as a *colony* of viruses. I began to chuckle.

&gt;headIT: What is it Liam?

&gt;me: Rodney has been nurturing a colony on his computer


He got up form his desk and began his usual relaxed walk over to my desk however his slow meander turned into a brisk walk when he spotted the red number showing just how F*%# up this computer was. His eyes widen and nostrils flare as he basks in the horror of the thin scroll bar.

   
   I left my desk to allow him some space as he slowly assessed the damage. I didn't mind, there's a Foosball table. Its a good thing Rodney wasn't there either or he might have no longer been with us. 

   After what seemed like an eternity I was allowed back to my desk and instructed to do nothing and not touch that computer in the slightest. The finish window was to be kept open until Rodney returned the next day.

   The other techs told me it would be best if I just went home for the day and prepared for the sh!tst0rm that was to become Rodneys Reality.

2belu2,13,2014-07-22,So much change happening and I can't deal.,mmmmmpopplers,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2belu2/so_much_change_happening_and_i_cant_deal/,"So in addition to this huge change happening in my life and all the stress that has been brought on getting ready for baby, work is going so some crazy change right now too.  So we just made a strategic plan for expansion of our department that has been approved.  So we are looking to add 2 additional positions this coming fall.  Our office currently has 5 full time positions (including myself) so adding 2 new people is a huge change to the culture of the office.  In addition to those 2 new positions, we have also applied for a grant that we will probably get that adds another new position, bringing that total to 3 new full time staff.  We also have 4 graduate student interns that will be starting this fall while I'm out as well.  So 7 new people.  

If you thought that wasn't enough, we are currently conducting a search to fill an open position and having a hard time finding a good candidate.  That person will likely start while I'm out as well (grand total 8 new people).  And finally, this morning another colleague put in her resignation and will be gone before I start my leave with the search to fill her position happening while I'm out.  So if you lost count, that is 9 new people for our department that will either start or be hired while I'm on maternity leave.  

I'm the administrative assistant for our department, so this affects me greatly.  I am usually the one coordinating all of the logistics for the searches, booking travel, handling welcome gifts and making sure everyone has what they need.  There is also the added bonus of not having space to put all these new people, so our office will be undergoing construction to build new offices.  

So when I come back from maternity leave, our office will have a completely new staff (minus the 3 of us who are not leaving), it will look physically different and I will be a working mom for the first time.  This is all soooo overwhelming.  I was barely keeping it together as is at work, and now I feel like i'm suffocating.  My hormones are going crazy and I just keep crying.  I know everything will work out fine, but I really didn't want my last weeks before maternity leave to be so stressful and busy.  I've already started cutting back my hours (just 1 hour a day) because I am slowing down.  

To add to this overwhelmed feeling, the invites went out yesterday for my work baby shower and close to 200 people were invited!  I work in a large division at a university (over 300 people in the division) and I have a very visible position, so I interact with a lot of people who have all been excited about my baby.  I feel very blessed, but damn that is a lot of people!  That's more people than we invited to our wedding!  

Thanks for listening to this rant, I just had to get it all down.  Thank god I see my therapist today so I can process all of this.  "
2bem6r,8,2014-07-22,"Underemployed college student in Charlotte, NC. What kind of jobs might I be overlooking?",brickoftr00th,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bem6r/underemployed_college_student_in_charlotte_nc/,"Hey, everybody. I'm a university student majoring in Accounting and Finance and am currently at a sophomore level, starting my junior year coursework in Fall of 2015.

I understand that, typically, accounting students do their internships in the summer between their junior and senior years, but I'm looking for something better than retail grunt in the meantime.

My main experience is in retail sales and food service and I'm looking to get out of the ~minimum wage area.

My course schedule for the fall is set up for me to have classes Mondays and Wednesdays only, so I have a work friendly schedule.

Currently, I'm trying to break into a bank teller position, but I'm not having much luck on that score.

I'm in my mid-20's (Non-traditional student) and have a great deal of work experience. Here's a brief list of my most prominent skills:

- Most work experience is grocery stores, department stores, and fast food.

- Exceptionally strong and recognized communication skills including public speaking to large audiences.

- Supervisory experience (have been in charge of up to 48 employees at a time)

- College extracurricular activities involving managing an $80,000 fund, event planning for 1000 students, lots of neat leadership-type stuff

- Lots of cash handling, including book keeping for $50,000 cash on hand.

Those are my main selling points, I have lots of other given skills like food safety, customer service, familiarity with MS office, my own transportation, etc. I've also been told by a few sources that I interview very well.

I'm looking into staffing agencies, but there are so darned many of them here in Charlotte, that it's a bit overwhelming and the larger part of them look shady/unprofessional by their web-presence.

Thanks for any help/advice!

TL;DR: Mid-20s, student, lots of experience and uncommon skills, making less than $9/hr, want to start pulling +$10/hr, tried banks, not going so hot."

User complains she can't open Word. Normally the issue is there is no default program set for .docx files, so they click on a file, Windows complains about a lack of default, and ""see it's broken!"" Set Word as default and done. But not this time.

Boss sits down in User's chair as I hover over his left shoulder. He tries opening Word from the start menu shortcut, and it opens in the taskbar but does not display a new document. Tries opening winword.exe directly, same result. Tries Excel, same thing. Tries to alt-tab to it, no go. Tries several more things and concludes he will have to reinstall Office. Meanwhile I shift to hovering over his right shoulder, and immediately see the problem. ""I see the problem,"" I announce. I turn on User's second monitor that is *half hidden behind the first monitor* and am instantly greeted with all the blank documents Boss had opened in the past five minutes.

2ben2a,2,2014-07-22,I (F20) have developed quite the crush on my guy friend (M20) but I have the hardest time reading him. What do you think?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2ben2a/i_f20_have_developed_quite_the_crush_on_my_guy/,"I'll apologize ahead of time because this is going to be long. But I'll try to keep it as short as I can and I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

So I am friends with this guy, let's call him Matt, and I have developed quite the crush on him. We met in an honors college organization at my university during our freshman year, and spent a lot of time together in the organization (it's a small, tight knit group) and that evolved to spending time outside. Certain things that he does leads me to believe he has more-than-friendly feelings for me.

- In our two classes together he often sits next to me.

- He teases me a lot in a friendly way.

- During the semester he invited me out to dinner about every other week and never let me pay (he called it a date a few times but once said that he thinks if people of the opposite sex are getting dinner alone it is a date)

- I could tell he didn't really like the guy I was dating earlier in the year but he never told me. However, one night I was texting him and told him I was fighting with my boyfriend and he responded saying he was sorry about the fighting and invited me to drink with him and his friends. I went drinking with them and after about an hour he told me he wanted to take me to get sushi and he paid for my drinks and my sushi.

- My ex would start arguments every time I mentioned Matt and said he hated that I was friends with Matt because he obviously liked me. But, my ex didn't know him that well. They were the same major (a pretty small major) but in different years.

- He would show up randomly at places where I was studying. Sometimes it was because I would post something on Facebook about where I was studying, but sometimes I think it was just a coincidence.

- He invited me to come with him to see this speaker who was talking about sex, safety and consent. When we left he told me something he says he has never told anyone else.

- His fraternity was having a party at a bar one day and he invited me, and drunk texted me every 10 minutes asking when I was going get there. When I got there he introduced me to every brother he saw as ""This is LovelyDinerDate, she's smarter than you!"" He does something similar (texting me, introducing me in a flattering way) at every one of his fraternity's parties.

- He drunk texts me a lot. Usually asking me to come hang out with him at the party/ frat house.

- He is at an internship on Wall Street right now but he texts me every few days. A few weeks ago he said ""Text me when you randomly think of me ;)"" at the end of a conversation. The winky face caught my attention because he doesn't send a lot of emoticons.

- When he needed new glasses during the semester he invited me to look for new ones with him. He has told me a few times he really likes the ones I picked out.

- I'm starting an organization at our school and when I am around he sometimes makes jokes saying ""Oh, you're smart/ cool/ fun, you should be in [my organization]"" in a kind of teasing manner

- The apartment I lived in this passed year was two blocks from the frat house where he was living. One night my apartment's fire alarm went off at 1 a.m. so I texted Matt to see if he was awake and wanted to hang out for a bit until I could go back to my room. He didn't answer because apparently he was asleep and his phone was on silent, but he told me that I should have just come over to the house anyways. I said it would be kinda strange for me to just show up at his frat house really late at night, uninvited, and he said he wouldn't mind at all and told me that I didn't need an invite to come over.

However, there are a few reasons why I am not sure. He was dating another girl earlier this year, he started dating her a few months after I started dating my (now) ex. He didn't tell me that he had a girlfriend, avoided talking to me about her, and never posted a picture of her on Facebook. I never met her, I only knew he had a girlfriend because a mutual friend (who has no ideas I have feelings for Matt) told me. I don't know if they are still dating, but I don't think they are.

He also took a mutual (really good) friend to his fraternity's semi formal and apparently said something sexual to her that made her really angry. He apologized and they occasionally hang out. But even she told me that she thinks he may have feelings for me.

And, last night I texted him first (usually he texts me first), about an assigned summer reading. He responded once, albeit a three sentence reply, and then didn't respond to my next message.

He is a really introverted guy. We talk a lot about social, political and environmental issues a lot, and about things going on in our lives and with the people we know, but we don't really talk about how we feel about things. So I don't know if he is just really really friendly to certain people, or if he does have feelings for me.

What do you guys think? What are the chances Matt has feelings for me? And I would like to ask him to be more than friends but I don't think I want a full blown relationship, more so a FWB + some feelings situation. How would I go about bringing that up/ proposition him?

TL;DR I think my friend Matt may have feelings for me (see bullet points for reasons why) but I also have some reasons to not be sure about his feelings. I am wondering what you all think the chances are of him reciprocating those feelings and how would I go about bringing up my feelings for him/ being more than friends.

Edit: Screw autocorrect

**Edit 2: UPDATE! I just got back from coffee with a mutual friend of Matt and I's. I told her that I was attracted to Matt. Before I could say any more she cut in and said ""Oh you need to tell him as soon as he gets back!"" I asked her why she is so excited. Apparently Matt has had a thing for me pretty much since we met. I was completely wrong in thinking he acted a similar way around his other girl friends, I am the only one he takes out anywhere or pretty much tells anything to (she didn't know he made a huge major change. He talks to me about it all the time). She told me that he probably never made a move because I am hard to read and he didn't want to make a move and have it ruin the friendship. And she was amazed that I wasn't positive that he had feelings for me! I am so happy right now! It seems really childish but I am really excited my crush feels the same way. Now I just need to figure out how the hell to let him know about my feelings/ make the first move!**"
2bevhf,8,2014-07-22,To do a Master's Thesis or not? (Accepted MS Candidate for Systems Biology and Bioinformatics.),StrikeSaber47,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/2bevhf/to_do_a_masters_thesis_or_not_accepted_ms/,"Hey all! I just found this subreddit by accident and I have been reading about the myriad of threads on job prospects and MS/Ph.D expectations. 

So I recently was accepted to CWRU's MS Program for Systems Biology and Bioinformatics and I am planning on going with their specific track in Molecular &amp; Computational Biology and will start the program next Fall (due to current work commitments). I am going in with a BS in Genetics from UCD and I have supplemented the degree with CS courses (up to Machine Assembly and Data Structures) as well as self-teaching myself SQL.

Now based on people that I know who works in the industry, some have told me to go with the Master's Thesis route as it enhances your CV/Resume when you graduate in two years and it demonstrates your skills. However, I see myself really wanting to go intern during the summer next year in a biotech company back in California (where biotech companies are everywhere) instead. I am focused on wanting to work in the industry and not academia and applying myself in technical applications over wet-lab, classical research. 

If I do choose to go with the Master's Thesis, I find myself stuck for the next two years literally at the university to get it done, but I really want to also get experience from the industry so I kind of not want to waste my big summer break in the lab. So my question to this wonder subreddit community is if the Master's Thesis is significant for the industry or it is better to not go with the extra mile and just find internships instead?

Thanks!"

I did a STEM major ( Chemical Engineering ) and I did an internship ( ~10 months ) but still no dice. I am applying and applying but no one is biting my resume. People say move to Houston, but how can I move somewhere if I don't know anyone there. This job search has been hopeless so far. I am currently studying some programming at my local CC so I can get an associate's in CompSci so atleast I can get a minimum wage code-monkey job. THIS FUCKIN' SUCKS.

2bf5tb,2,2014-07-22,I [19/F] am concerned about my boyfriend [20 M] starting to talk to a sort-of-ex.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bf5tb/i_19f_am_concerned_about_my_boyfriend_20_m/,"Hi reddit. I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. We love each other a lot, and we care for each other but in the past few months we've had a lot of stress in both of out lives and we've been fighting frequently (maybe every two weeks). I'm currently home for the summer and he's still at school on the other side of the country taking summer classes and an internship. 

Before we started dating he was madly in love with a girl who went to college in the city I'm currently attending college in. She dropped out and moved to our home state, and then he met me. We became good friends, then fwb, then dating. I later found out after a few months of dating he wasn't actually over this girl and was still in love with her. I had a lot of insecurity issues when we first started having sex because he really built her up to me as the love of his life during our friendship. I started wishing things like I had freckles like her because he said he was into freckles, dumb things like that. When he told me this it honestly just crushed me. He assured me that he wasn't ever going to talk to her again, she was out of his life forever and I'd never have to worry. He later told me he was in love with me and I've never doubted it. 

It's been about two months since I last saw him in person after leaving for the summer. It's been really rough because we're not used to being so far apart for such a long time, and there have definitely been a few fights. He suddenly asks me to not be mad at him for what he's going to say next, and makes me promise I won't be upset. He tells me that he started talking to her again, and I kind of just bit my lip and went quiet. I later told him it did make me upset and he was confused and wondered why I wasn't ""over her yet"". I asked him where this was coming from because he always talked to me about what a huge bitch she was and how she broke his heart, and now he's doing a 180 and telling me she was a great friend and he didn't want to lose the friendship. We were extremely upset at each other and fought over this. It ended with me telling him to do whatever he wanted, and he was right that he could talk to whomever, but he should not expect me to feel comfortable with it or react emotionally how he'd like. He was upset because not only does he want permission he also wants me to jump on board and be all smiles about it. 

After taking a little time to calm down, I decided maybe it wouldn't be so bad and I warmed up to the idea. Then I found out that he didn't mention that I even existed to her and she doesn't know he's in a relationship. I also asked if I could meet her since we're both in the area and I'd like to get to know her if they were going to maintain a friendship, and he kept dodging and skirting this. At this point I started to feel really suspicious, but he continued to get upset that I wasn't giving him the benefit of the doubt and my trust. 

This morning I told him how this all felt really wrong to me, and we talked more about it. He then asked me for a break. That reaaallyyyyy didn't help his case at all and it felt like that was confirming my suspicions. I laid out all of what's been going on in front of him and he confirmed that it looked really bad but that he doesn't want anything more than friendship. I don't really care about whether it's just friendship or not, I just sort of feel betrayed. He said that if he stopped talking to her then he was letting me walk all over him and pick and choose his friends, and I was shocked and hurt that he thought of me as such a controlling girlfriend...I've told him I didn't like his friends before, often because they made sexist or racist comments, but I never told him he couldn't hang out with them. It's just this one girl that I have a bad feeling about, not on her part but his. I don't know whether I'm being crazy or not, all of this just feels wrong and it bothers me that he doesn't think I have reason to be upset.

**tl;dr**: boyfriend started talking to girl he's in love with, thinks I'm crazy and controlling when I tell him I don't like it, asks for a break. "

I recently obtained my license to carry a pistol in my State. These licenses are notoriously difficult to obtain because my State and most whom live in it are very anti-gun. This includes my parents.

My mother is a lawyer and my father is a banker. They were very upset when they found out my pistol permit had been approved (they assumed I would get rejected like most people) and they forbade me from purchasing a firearm. 

I bought one anyway without their knowledge and proceeded to carry it on my person. My sister, who I confided in, told my parents. For no reason other than she just loves drama and wanted to watch me get in trouble (she's 20 incase you're wondering).

My parents were extremely upset. Mostly my mother. She had some very anti-gun professors at her law school who made her petrified of firearms. When she found out I had it on my hip, she had a full blown panic attack. 

My father is a bit more reasonable, as he knows I'm in the process of becoming a police officer, he knows that I have extensive training with the weapon (80 hours of private instruction by a police lieutenant who's a friend of mine) and knows I have a way to safely store it (fireproof safe bolted to the floor of my closet). 

Never the less, my parents told me that if I continue to carry the firearm on my person, they will kick me out of my house. My mother does not lose in these types of arguments. She will employ whatever measures are necessary to get her way. It's quite literally either compliance with what she wants, or leaving my home. I can't afford to live elsewhere right now.

I have full confidence in my ability to own and operate this firearm. I have worked several security jobs, and public safety internships that have put me in contact with some very bad people. Bad people who know my face, and name, and what town I'm from. Bad people who have accosted me on the street before. That firearm is my only form of self protection. 

I don't want to tell my parents about the real threats to my life, because it will only make them worry. And my mother (who was recently sworn into the bar association at 55) feels invincible and says that a ""cease and desist"" letter from a lawyer will make these people ""back off."" Yeah mom, a violent felon who I detained and had arrested for outstanding warrants is really going to respect a letter. 

According to my parents: ""We live in a safe neighborhood and as long as I don't go into any  bad neighborhoods or 'black areas' (WTF?) I should be fine.""

They flat out refuse to listen to anything I say, they feel completely safe in their suburban bubble, and are treating me like a child.

So I lied. I made up a story about how I was mugged at the ATM and that luckily all they wanted was money. I said thankfully I was safe, but if they had wanted more than money, I would have been screwed because I didn't have my firearm. 

Well, my mother actually said ""see? now you know that they only want money and if you comply you'll be fine."" After accosting me for going to a ""bad area"" (downtown).

My father, god bless him, looked at her and said ""Are you insane? What if they had wanted something else? and he didn't have it? He was at the mercy of someone who obviously could have killed him if they wanted to.""

After a few hours of deliberation, they both told me that if I thought my firearm was the best way to protect myself, then I should carry it. 

So, I have my parent's blessing. However, I feel awful for being dishonest. I lied because my parents don't understand or respect the actual threats to my safety and so I had to materialize a threat they would respect: randomized criminal acts. 

It's not in my character to lie. I hate lying. I'm going to be a cop, and I try to hold myself to a very high standard of honesty and integrity. I feel exceptionally guilty for this.

However, I now have my parents blessing and support of my right to protect myself and I'm in no danger of losing my home.

Did I do the right thing? "

Holy shit.  Holy shit holy shit holy shit.

Contractor's assistant is dead.  He was stabbed to death. 

Freaking out a little, guys. 

Going to text the guys I used to work with at the coroner's office.  Maybe they can give me more info, because all anyone knows is that the kid was stabbed to death. 


Fuck. I'll let you know if I find out more.  All is quiet at work today, but I have been avoiding the lab and doing computer work because I'm freaked out.  The contractor didn't come in to work because of what went down. 


Edit: So I submitted this with 24 hours of my last post, but whatever, I have more to update.  I had managed to calm the fuck down until I got details from the coroner's office.  I shouldn't post them, but fuck it, I'm freaked the hell out and it's not my ass on the line if details get out.

The kid wasn't just stabbed to death.  His guts were basically shredded like ribbons.  ""Pete"" (my coroner contact) said that you couldn't even tell which organs were which, it was just a big sloppy pile of blood, skin, and tissue.  He doesn't know what they will find at autopsy, but he said he'd keep me posted.

But the part that freaks me out the fucking most are the facts surrounding how his body was found.  The contractor didn't know where the kid was and called the kid's girlfriend, who went over to check on him.  All the door were locked, the windows shut and locked, no AC running (which is weird because it was over 80 degree this weekend).  She went in, the house was completely normal until she got to the kitchen and saw him there.  The neighbors called the cops when they heard the girl screaming.  No one had heard from him this weekend, not his girl or parents, but the neighbors said they heard angry muttering Sunday night, but nothing else.  There were no signs of struggle or break in at the house or on his body based on cursory observation. The neighbors didn't hear a struggle or screaming.  And they found a bloody hunting knife beside the body, but no other signs of a person in the house.  No bloody foot prints (and there would have been according to Pete because of the amount of blood), no signs anyone cleaned up ....

EDIT 2:  Holy fuck, Pete just told me that they think all the wounds are self inflicted based on the wound patterns.  What the fuck was going on with this kid?? There is no way this is related to the weird shit at my internship right?  Like, I NEED some one to talk me down. "

He's mentally ill and suffers from severe depression. I've tried so hard to be there for him and try to help and support him, but nothing good has come of this relationship. 


He's been in long distance school for over a year and has yet to turn in a single assignment. He only began taking antidepressants after I threatened to leave him a year and a half ago. He refuses therapy or conversation with anyone at all about how he feels. His room is absolutely disgusting, I can't go over there to visit his family anymore because I swear there's bugs on his floor that bite my feet and legs. I took out 7 months worth of garbage from his room the last time I was there. He rarely bathes and I know it's a symptom of depression, but I feel like he uses his condition as an excuse for many behaviors he knows he needs to change. 


He refuses to do an internship and has never worked a day in his life. He won't do anything ""underneath him"", although he has 0 real life experience. Even after 4 years together I just don't see myself marrying him someday or him even moving in with me anytime soon. I don't want to have to pick up after him for the rest of my life like I do every time he's at my apartment. He's never washed a single dish. We've never gone on a date alone before. Never even to a restaurant. He's never given me anything to remind me of him. 


He promised me last night he would go grocery shopping with me, I wanted him to have something to eat because he spent all his money on weed and had none left for food. He never showed up and instead played Sim City at his friend's house until 11am when he showed up at my apartment rummaging through my fridge eating my food he didn't want to go with me to buy. Weed is more important than anything else. He tells his parents he needs money for food while he stays at my place, and spends over 15€ of 25 on weed and has 10€ for food, from which he ends up eating my own food just a day later...I'm not rich and have asked him to please stop eating everything I have. 


He was in a clinic being treated for his depression as a condition to continue his education he doesn't take seriously and was diagnosed as being dependent on marijuana by his doctor there. He was not allowed to smoke for 2 months and the entire time, he was a jerk and moody but it was nice having him be ""down to earth"" with me again. He insists he doesn't have a dependency, but it's obviously there. 


I just can't take it anymore. He's never done anything special for me. Everything is always about him. His parents beg me to stay with him when we fight. One Christmas I gave him a large 200€ DJ mixer I carried half across the world for him. He gave me an empty picture frame he bought at the local drug store at the last second. He's never written a single reply to any of my love letters. He's never wanted to Skype with me although we were long distance for 2 years. He has flirted with his female friends and said very sexual things to them (I have written proof of ""I want to lick your pussy""). 


He was never there for me when I applied to live in his country to be with him. He slept in during all of my appointments. I learned his language, he knows mine, but refuses to speak to me in my own even when I ask him to take 1 day out of the month to. He says he doesn't like my friends although he's never met them, yet he says I have to tolerate his own friends, his best friend threatening to egg my windows for being a ""gossiping bitch"" because I chatted with his sister about him.


I think he loves me, but it's immature, twisted and fucked up. I love him, but I'm leaving him for good. I've set up a lie and am leaving to go back to my country in a month. He thinks I am just going back for more school and doesn't know I'm staying. I am acting totally normal until then although I don't really want to have to sex with him anymore. The tickets are paid for, and I am selling my furniture and promising him I will be back in December. Actually, he never even asked when I'd be back. All I heard was ""can I stay in your apartment while you're gone?"" and ""You're free to go wherever you want, we can just do long distance like before"" instead of ""I'd miss you"".


I think someday I could meet someone who does give effort into communicating with me, who doesn't turn things around on me and make me feel crazy (or even call me that word), who doesn't make me feel like I am being used for my parent's money, who won't flirt with other women to a level where it upsets me greatly, and who respects me and likes to go out and do things with me. Someone tell me I am doing the right thing. I love him and this is so difficult, but it has to be done and I'm scared I will turn around and go back to him.


TL;DR Boyfriend is mentally ill, not getting help, treats me like crap, I want to leave and I am afraid I'll go running back to him because I'm codependent"

I am a recent university graduate from a top public engineering school with a degree in CS specializing in software engineering. My dream is to head out to San Francisco and work at a startup company, however as of yet all the companies in SF I have interviewed with have fallen through in either the second or third round interview.
I have a final round interview with a company in a city close to where I am living which I am fairly confident I will get an offer from. The only catch is that position is in software testing and not development, which is what I really would like to do.

My questions to you are:

1. Would it be better to take the job near to me and build my resume and then after a year or two look at at jobs in San Francisco, or keep up my job search till I find the job I want.

2. Does working in software testing kill your chances at getting a development job in the future?

If it makes any difference I have no previous internship or co-op experience. The job I had before now was working as a TA for my university.

Thanks for all of your help!

From what ive read people have said it is a promising degree however a lot of what you learn is simply fluff and easy courses and there are only some courses that give u some real world skills like programming/networking/database/managerial etc.. now my question is how are the prospects for jobs and IT careers out of this degree? is it promising? I specifically want to be a business analyst/ project manager. would this degree be a good choice? if so what specific courses out of the ITI program should I be focusing on and take? I also know that since the classes arent going to give much real world skills that I have to go out and acquire outside knowledge and also get internships etc.. So since I want to be a business analyst how would I specifically go about and do that? Thanks!

I need some advice on where to go next. 

A little about me: 

Like the title says, I'm a rising sophomore at a public liberal arts college in the midwest(4.0, CS major). I'm about to finish up a business/finance internship at a Fortune 500 aerospace company. My big project this summer was writing a VBA macro that pulled HTML information from the web, but I also had a few business-related tasks.

As far as projects are concerned, I'm a budding app developer who just released his first app (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWyKlbIh_CM) and want to continue making apps, perhaps for a living. It took a lot of time so it's the only project I have so far.

Here is my situation: there is a pretty good chance that I will get a CS internship at this company next summer; however, I'm not sure whether I want to go back (culture is boring as far as I can tell). I've also really been wanting to get into the startup scene, and have thought about applying to startups in California next summer. I also would LOVE an internship at one of ""the big 4"" and will definitely be applying to those as well. I plan on studying heavily this semester (reading Code Complete, etc) as well.

A couple questions: what would you do in my situation? Does the non-CS internship look good at all if I'm applying for a CS internship? Should I apply other places? Is the internship that I'm already likely to get at the company I'm with going to stand out on a resume? Are my chances of getting any internship related to app development reasonable?


It should be noted that should I get an offer from my current company, I'll have until late october to decide on it.

Thanks for any advice you might have."

We’ll try to update this post with their thoughts throughout the week, if possible.*

**Alex (aLeXmOrA):** Well, last week was release week and I have to say it was a little stressful one for me. I had everything set and ready in the KSP website to make a smooth and clear release, but you should always keep in mind that Murphy’s law will get you anyway. So, as expected, there were some issues with the downloads and then the KSP Forums. In the end, after a few hours, I managed to fix the issues and left everything up and running for the weekend, so all of you could get the First Contract update. I really hope you’re enjoying it!

**Daniel (danRosas):** Wrapping up the release, really cool to see the response from you guys, you’re an amazing community. We’ve made some wallpapers that are being released, for First Contract fans. There are some tasks floating around at hand, there are some models that have been done that need to be taken into the game, and I just had an interesting chat with HarvestR about them. Also, I’m working on a new animatic, but I’m still not happy with how the events inside the short are unfolding, so I’m going through that other stuff in order to have a clearer mind about the Kebal misfortunes :)

**Jim (Romfarer):** This is by far the biggest gui update I’ve worked on and it feels great that it’s finally released, even though we discovered a bit of a game stopping bug for the moddable features of the application launcher. But fear not, this bug only affects mods and it is possible to circumvent the bug. In any case the bug has been fixed and it’s already in the pipeline for the next version. I’m also likely to throw in some extra features that were suggested too late in the process to include with 0.24.

**Bob (Calisker):** It was a lot of fun to get the update out the door - thank you to all of our friends in the games media who covered the announcement. We spent a lot of time drafting the press release, making sure it was factual and really explained why First Contract is such a great update for KSP. One story I’m particularly interested in is those of you who are playing with your children. If you’d be willing to share your story about why you choose to play KSP with your kids (or if you’re playing with one of your parents, let me know too). Please email press@kerbalspaceprogram.com with the subject line: Generational Play in KSP. Thanks!  

**Anthony (Rowsdower):** Another update’s been put in the books. We’re glad to see First Contract was worth the wait for many of you. I can’t wait to see where the hype train goes for 0.25. Anyway, I’d just like to publicly thank the mods on the forum and reddit for keeping the train on rails, especially on the forum. The number 502 will forever haunt everyone. The media and KSP-TV crew also deserve major props for simply doing what they do best and entertaining you all. Ok, now that that’s all been said, it’s back to business.

**Rogelio (Roger):** Hey guys, hope you like the first contract video I’ve started to work on new models for the next animatic, but until the whole team feel happy with the  idea we’ll tell you more about it.

**Hugo (The Intern):** Had a lot of fun with the new release!! Still working on some pieces aesthetics. Mainly working on the MK line right now. Hopefully you guys will like the work. Had a very interesting and insightful conversation with Felipe and Dan to discuss some designs and what we would envision to add in the future."

I think I'll press submit this time. 

I find it extremely difficult to think positively about my life. When I'm alone my mind goes to really dark places...suicidal thoughts, death of loved ones, failure, debt, and stress. I have days where I feel OK. These are the days I'm not thinking about the bad stuff.

I'm a 20 year old, college student. I constantly worry about the future and how I am going to fail. My family is poor, and I have incurred lots of debt so far. I am scared. I don't want to disappoint anyone. 

I constantly compare myself to my peers. I go to a top university and everyone seems to be that go-getter (president of clubs, networker etc) kinda person I never will be. Or they somehow cheat their way through things. My GPA is pretty good, but I haven't set myself apart. My depression keeps me from being that go-getter. I feel like I will never get an internship or a job. I am a good, honest person and a hard worker. I just want recruiters to know that despite my lame resume. 

My roommate has made me realize I need to stand up for myself and stop agreeing with what others say just to avoid conflict. She is getting failing grades dropped because she is lying about depression. She talked about this to me like it was nothing, laughing that she'll just recite the some WebMD symptoms about some form of depression. It made me angry on the inside but I just said ""good luck with that"". WHAT DO I DO in this sorta situation. I wanna tell her fuck off and rat her out. But I'm not a snitch. I don't that kind of stress in my life. But it makes me so angry. I should just let it go. 

All I want (as of now) is the financial means to pay off my loans after I graduate, high self-esteem, and a positive mentality. 

Btw I've been trying to get a counselor from my school for the past 4 months. No luck.

I am a cs senior currently doing an internship that started with really low pay. When I brought up the pay to my owner/ and my boss they as I assumed didn't know how underpaid I was. Instantly I got a raise but they said we would further discuss it. Today I found out we are discussing it tomorrow.

I am the only programmer (web developer) at the company and so there's no real set salary. I looked up averages for my university and cs specifically, but as the job is web development I am not sure if those apply. I'm general im not even sure what my position really is.

For the internship I'm developing backends of crud systems and restful api's eventually going to build web apps. Though I have to do everything single handedly. Database design and layout, frameworks, how the Apis work, basically everything. Presumably I'll need to fully design the layout of apps and what is needed.

What salary should I ask for? Both coop and full time positions are going to be discussed I believe. I've looked at glassdoor and salary.com plus my school and I assume for coop 16-22/hr is fair, am I remotely correct(Midwest)? Full time I would say 57-65k/yr. 

Are my numbers valid? Is there somewhere that's respected for averages? How should I go about negotiations, any tips?

I am currently a high school senior, just thinking about the future in general as I enter my last year of high school. I know it is typically unusual for a freshman in college to get an internship, but I would like to try my hardest to get one so I can experience different sides of the programming career in each summer of college before I graduate. I think that getting an internship at a startup would a good place to begin this.

One of the things I am interested in is knowing what type of technology/language I should focus on. I know that technology is constantly changing, but I assume not much will change in the course of a year. Since I'll be busy focusing on college applications and other activities, I would like to spend most of my time building applications in one language/framework so I can have multiple projects to show to potential companies. I think this would be better than trying to juggle a lot of different languages at first.

From the research I've done, it seems that the most popular technologies for startups are Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Django (along with iOS/Android in general, but I'm more focused on webdev right now). I am getting better with front end dev (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) every day, but I want to spend more time making full stack websites and I can't really decide which would be better to focus on. I've made a couple of test sites with Rails and Node and I really don't have a preference as to which is more ""fun"" to develop in.

So, what is the best route to go for the sole purpose of getting an internship at a startup? What languages/frameworks to focus on? Thanks."

My internship is coming to a close within the next 2 or so weeks and I'm having terrible stress about what I've accomplished. 

Basically, I was given just 1 big project throughout the internship and I'm worried that the team I worked with will look down on me because I wasn't able to finish their project. The reason is because the project was very challenging (at least compared to the projects at my previous internship) and I had zero experience with some of the tools and languages used. 

Because of this, I had to ask a million questions, google, watch youtube videos, and research a ton just to progress throughout the project. Everyone was very kind and more than willing to assist me, which I guess is where the guilt is coming from. Also, I wasn't micromanaged at all for this project, I was kind of a free bird so I realized I spent way too much time on certain portions of the project than I should have. At the most I can give them a half assed application that is kind of a useless and needs more work (alpha build as they call it?).

Just the whole meme of ""you had one job"" keeps playing in my head, because it's true, I did have one job. They paid me a ton to finish this damn project and I couldn't accomplish it. It's kind of annoying because the other interns I know received significantly less challenging work and have been/are finishing up their projects. They can safely say they accomplished their team's goal and will probably receive job offers. 

I've already been in contact with my supervisor, as he recently gave me a performance evaluation and had nothing but positive things to say. However, when I directly told him that I probably won't be able to achieve the ideal outcome of the project before my internship, he seemed kind of taken back a little bit. He said he won't be disappointed and completely understands since I had minimal exposure with the tools used. Nevertheless, I feel like I could still sense a little bit of disappoint from him. 

I have two major upcoming presentations, one to a group of management personnel outside of my team (very formal, professional, etc) and another one directly to my team (more casual).  I'm having bad anxiety about the one to my team because only my supervisor knows my project won't be 100% complete. Now I gotta let 6-10 other people know that what I did this summer really isn't going to be of use to them until someone else takes the plate and finishes it.

So do you guys have any words of wisdom for me? Criticism? Opinions? 

Sorry for my poor paragraph organization and/or structure...the stress is really getting to me I think. "

* PCB layout, assembly, rework (soldering skills)
* Some mechanical prototyping (Solidworks, 3d printing, laser cutting)

I did a 6 month internship in the San Jose area, so I sort of know my way around, but South Bay is not for me. I'd even appreciate a few leads or company names if not straight up opportunities--thanks!

To explain the 18mos experience, we have a co-op program.  5 year degree program includes 3 6-month internships.

2bh3co,1,2014-07-23,She [20F] and I [22M] ended a short-lived relationship months ago because of distance. I'm moving back to her town in a month and I want to restart it.,bristlypear,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bh3co/she_20f_and_i_22m_ended_a_shortlived_relationship/,"For a month before my college graduation in May, before I moved home for the summer, I dated a girl who I found out had a five-month old crush on me. From the first date, we clicked and shared a very intimate month together. At the end, we agreed that long-distance relationship at that moment was too much for both of us. Over summer, we agreed to talk occasionally. She told me if I came back ""I would totally want to date you again.""

She went back to her home country abroad for the summer. She's a very family-oriented girl who used to talk to her mom and brother every day and wanted to spend as much time with her family because this summer ""might be (her) last summer with her family at home."" I went back home for an internship, but after the summer is over, I decided, I am going back up to my college town because I am not happy at home and will search for a job there. 

We communicate one to three times a week. At first, we talked very frequently because we just split apart, but we naturally slowed down the frequency. There would be times where we go a week or two without talking. When we do pick it up, there doesn't seem to be a big problem; she sounds very happy to hear from me and tells me she misses me. We have Skyped a couple of times, and there was no disinterest from her tone or body language as well. She said that I am the only person she has spoken English to on a regular basis this summer because she has been solely socializing with her native friends and family.

But I worry her interest is waning. It can be a pain to talk to her sometimes. She goes on Facebook a couple of times a day for a couple of minutes and takes days to respond sometimes. She uploads no photos, so I don't know what she's up to via photos. She has no Twitter, LinkedIn, or Instagram. (Maybe the onus is more on my personality: I am pretty active on social media and good about getting back ASAP.) As aforementioned, there can be long droughts in communication, and that does bother me a bit after several days. I know she's alive and on Facebook, but she won't come around to say hi. 

I keep myself busy, so I don't get wound up on this too much. I think I am overthinking this tbh. I want to avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy. I never brought me being bothered by the no communication droughts up to her because we aren't committed to a relationship. As such, who am I to tell her we need to talk X amount of times in a week? I don't want to be needy. After all, my other friends and I talk on an irregular, organic basis all the time. But I do crave listening and her voice because I miss her and I want her to be more than my friend.

I miss her more than I like to admit. I went on two dates this summer, but it went nowhere partly because she was on my mind. I want to give us another chance when I get back. But I know getting back, according to Reddit, is almost impossible and not recommended. I would like to ask her a second chance when I see her in person (if I see her in person). I don't want to ask her via Facebook.

I put this on /r/relationships to see 1) if I am being crazy here and just move on, 2) if I am missing any red flags here that shows she's not interested, and 3) what I should do about the communication issues. Lastly, I read all the time here on how getting back together almost never works, but I have yet to see a post about what happens when a couple breaks up on a logistical basis (distance) and on a very good note and gets back together. I really hope there's a story out there where someone was in a similar situation like I am and it ended out okay. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Girl and I ended it on mutual, cordial terms due to distance. I am coming back to her town. I want to restart our dates, but I am scared she's lost interest based on the fact she can be hard to talk to. "

I'll probably be moving to Toronto on late 2015 from Brazil, Rio de Janeiro.

So far I came accross [Expatistan](http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/rio-de-janeiro/toronto?currency=CAD), [Numbeo](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Brazil&amp;city1=Rio+De+Janeiro&amp;country2=Canada&amp;city2=Toronto&amp;displayCurrency=CAD) and [Toronto.ca](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=3e5eae0b7e612310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=4a27ba2ae8b1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD).

I was wondering if reddit thinks these numbers are accurate and how deep can I trust them.

Also, I wonder about the average salary for IT professionals. I lurked a bit on glassdoor.com, and even the Intern salaries I found were quite high, like 3k/month. Is this realistic? How good would a salary of about 40k/year be? Would it be reallistic to expect this kind of money?

I stupidly took the first job that was offered to me straight out of uni. I studied a law degree and because this job was advertised as relating to ''law"", I snapped it up. Immediately, I got a weird feeling about the job and the interview itself made me question the merits of the company. They told me and the other trainees that we would be working with legal claims and would be really helping people who had been in accidents however, when we started , we realised this was nothing more than a glorified tele sales job! We spend 10 hours a day calling and effectively harassing people and it is making me miserable. I constantly get abuse on the phone and am so bored and sad, I don't feel like doing anything when I leave work. I have only been working here for 3 weeks but I already dread work. I feel like I have been lied to about the job and the job role.  It is hardly related to law, everyone who works there hates it  and the managers treat us all like idiots. The problem is that it is a job and I don't know whether I should stick it out just because it is something to go on my cv? Part of me thinks I should quit next month and look else where and perhaps get some legal work experience but the other half thinks I should stay and just be miserable for a year. The company itself seems like a scam in that they do a lot of dodgy things but I was told in the interview there is a lot of room to move up in the company which is the only good aspect about this job. I don't think I will get another job if I quit due to being fresh out of uni so I would have to look at internships and so I don't know if I should just stick it out or not ? I am just so confused, please help !!! 

In terms of the money side of it , it is okay pay, nothing special at all. If I did quit , my dad has already said I can go home and live rent free whilst looking for more work however, that seems like a huge step backwards :(. 

Oh, and I have expressed my thoughts with the managers and the HR manager who hired me and they really don't care. They are constantly hiring, training and firing people so I doubt they care less about the fact this job was falsely advertised. 

Any advice would be great ! Should I get out now or stay ? "

I have a few questions and I would love for anyone to add more advice if you think I should hear it!


1. Which university will best set me up to get into med school/an accelerated nursing program?

2. How is the Biology program at GW on the pre-med track?  Also, how is the Global Public Health program?

3. If so, is the program at GW that much better than CU?

4. Internships seem to be plentiful at GW along with many other resume building opportunities, would it be significantly harder at CU?

5. I'm only slightly above average at certain sciences, but maintain a high GPA and excel in all other academic fields. Is it better to struggle a little at GW (where I've gotten the impression that academics are a little harder), but be part of a smaller pond and have great internship/research opportunities or perform slightly better at a big pond like CU with less resume building opportunities?


This is the first time in my life that I have had even remote anxiety due to decision making and I would really appreciate any advice.

As some of you may know from last months post, I'm an intern at a MMA management firm in Florida. I convinced the higher-ups that there are a lot of small businesses and MMA fans on Reddit who may be interested in sponsoring fighters but have never been given the opportunity to do so.

So this month we are going to try something different. As long as you are a reddit member, we have flat rate pricing on sponsoring fighters. WSOF fighters are $500 for a company logo on shorts and banner. UFC is $1,000 for a company logo on shorts and banner. 

Here are the fighters you can advertise with this month:

Thiago Tavares ($1,000)

The event is headlined by a light heavyweight showdown between Ryan Bader and Ovince St. Preux. UFN 47 takes place at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor, Maine and will be televised live on Fox Sports 1. Thiago Tavares vs Robbie Peralta is expected to be on the main card.

Mirsad Bektic ($1,000)
Also in the 145 division, undefeated UFC prospect Mirsad Bektic (8-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC) will take on late replacement Max Holloway (9-3 MMA, 5-3 UFC) at UFC Fight Night 49. UFC Fight Night 49 is set for Aug. 23 at BOK Center in Tulsa, Okla and will be televised live on Fox Sports 1. The event is headlined by a lightweights Rafael dos Anjos vs. Benson Henderson. Mirsad Bektic vs Max Holloway is confirmed to be on the main card.


We have two MMA fighters competing on an upcoming Las Vegas event. World Series of Fighting 12 will take place Aug. 9 at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. It will be televised nationwide live on NBCsports.

Luis Palomino ($500)
For the main event, our fighter Luis Palomino (22-9), will meet Lewis Gonzalez (9-0) in a lightweight bout. 

Alexis Villa ($500)
On the main card, our fighter Alexis Villa (14-4), will face Brandon Hempleman (9-2) in a flyweight bout.

2bi7d7,209,2014-07-23,Is it normal to feel lonely despite being surrounded by people?,sbpbsl,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2bi7d7/is_it_normal_to_feel_lonely_despite_being/,"Does anyone feel like their life is on track, they are surrounded constantly by people, but somehow still feel alone? Like late at night they could cry by themselves in a room and no one would care? I do. But I guess I should give a little bit of background information.

Since young, I have always been an introvert. My parents warned me against all the usual things: ""focus on your studies first"", ""don't mix with the wrong people"", ""excel excel excel"". In the end, I did many things except talking to people. As a result, I ended up being good in a great number of hobbies, ranging from music to sports. And when I mean good, I mean represent-your-school good. The point of saying this is to emphasize how much time I spent on always training and training. You have only 24 hours in a day, and something had to go. And so I grew up socially impaired, despite my achievements. I was always the loner, the introvert, the quiet prodigy, yadda yadda.

Then I went to college. Change of environment, change of culture, new people, new places. People paid me no attention. I decided that something has to change. So I went online, I read self-help books, I went to forums. One thing in particular stood out to me: ""Fake it til you make it"".

So, I emulated Gordon Gekko, Jordan Belfort, Jay Gatsby. Charismatic, confident and masculine sonuvabitches. But I was not like that.

This is who I truly am: I have an abandonment complex, I have an inferiority complex, I self-doubt to a huge degree, and I am very, very, very insecure. I know all this and I'm trying to fix it but I can't. I just can't. And maybe I thought by emulating the Real Deal I could be just like them.

Fake it til you make it.

And so with my new arsenal I did the only thing I could: excel. I studied hard, got good grades, joined and won academic awards (case competitions, etc.). I worked out and lifted heavy, read up on men's fashion and got a new wardrobe. I joined a club, trained hard enough and went to nationals. I had ""friends"", oh yes, I had many ""fans"" too (among the freshmen generally). I networked my ass off, laid the groundwork in relationships in all the events and competitions I went to.

I climbed my way up the prestigious ladder in terms of internships, and am on track to a prestigious company. Prestigious enough that my name became bandied around the school among other kids who are aiming for the same thing (or similar). More people talked to me, my number gets thrown around more. I get invited to parties, I get more ""friends"". People who would usually not talk to me began to take the initiative to approach me. But only as long as I continued building a high profile, only if I continued achieving, winning and networking.

From the outside it looks like I'm doing great. And I'm not complaining, because the fact is my life IS going great. I'm on track to get the dream job I want, I enjoyed my time in my school's club and managed to achieve some level of respect, ""street cred"" and skill. My grades are going well. I am always surrounded by people, going to parties and what not.

But that's not really me. That's the ""fake me"". That's ""banker me"". The real me is and still is the insecure little boy doing his own thing in a corner while the world passes by. I am surrounded by friends but somehow, I still feel lonely.

There was a stretch of time a year ago when I just withdrew from everything socially. Deactivated my social media, went into a hermit like state. No one noticed, no one cared. Other than the ones that wanted to ask me for advice/help, etc.

Then I swapped back to the ""fake me"", and then the result was completely the opposite. I don't even know anymore. I see interactions with people now as purely mercantile. Have they done enough for a trade before I help? Yes/No? It's screwed up, and I hate myself. But I can't help it.

Everything on track, and life is going great. But no one will believe me if I said that I am so lonely that it's so painful. Sometimes I look at the moon in the sky, and my heart swells with pain, like if I dropped dead there no one would care. I could cry, and no one would be there to relieve the burden, because everything thinks I'm invincible. I act like I am, but that's just ""fake me"". I'm human just like everyone else, and truthfully I'm even weaker than most people. The enormity of emptiness just keeps growing, and it's hurting me.

But fake it til you make it. And ""fake me"" has to go on Balling. And ""real me"" goes on hurting.

Now I'm going into my final years in college, and I don't think that the ""University experience"" is meant to be like that. I don't think that crippling loneliness is supposed to be included in the package. I made some changes; I tried to be even more outgoing, and I moved places to the dormitory on-campus. Maybe I just needed a change of environment again.

What can I do? What do I do?

Help me."

I'm an intern for IT (repairs and stuff, position right above help desk where i handle tickets) and while i don't make market wages as i am an intern, the position i had before doesn't pay me that bad (but not enough to pay the bills), and its within the company so wage didn't change.

just checked my bank. $ -197. yup. i have overdraft protection, couldn't deposit any god damn money into my account because WOAH I DON'T HAVE ANY. 

I don't know how anyone worse off than me can survive. I got slammed with OD fees because i HAD to pay my car insurance. i leased a car last year (when i had a decent job which of course my stupid ass lost it) so i can't miss insurance or i would probably lose my car. 

so of course 4 payments were pending and WHOOPDEEDOOP 4 fees. well i guess thats cool, im negative with no money so only way to get the x money i was off by is to ADD MORE FEES. I can't borrow money from anyone - i've already borrowed too fucking much to pay my rent last year and to get out of the apartment at the time. i can't keep asking people around me for help. My parents can't help, my friends can't help and its because I'M MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY yet can't even do that. i fucking hate my life right now. My car payment is due next tuesday, i don't get paid until thursdays every week. I have no insurance for dental, health, whatever because NO i can't be on my parents plan for reasons they have (and no ""they should blah blah"" shits going to help).

i'm really at the end of what the hell i can handle. I'm trying to balance pleasing all my needy friends and give them the time of day (as in i don't even drive anywhere, they give me the ride and buy me drinks whilst out, but i don't like mooching even if they do offer) while trying to pay all my bills. i mean for christs sake i can't even buy my own food anymore. I live at home with my stepdad and brother (mom lives in florida with rest of the kids) so i pretty much eat whatever my brother offers me. 

my birthday is the 30th and guess what i'm doing. Nothing. No ones going to go out of their way to throw me a party or anything (not that i'd ever expect anyone to and don't feel entitled to anything). i'm 22 and i've fucked my life over so hard because i'm an idiot. i could hang out in /r/personalfinance all day which wouldn't help me any how - I know what i have to do (and im working my ass off to try to keep working here after the internship next month and actually get a raise and a job i like doing, not to mention actually good at). It is kind of hilarious though, im freaking out and my bills aren't even that ridiculous compared to people who are ACTUALLY struggling. But I can't let it get there. I don't want to be on food stamps or welfare (because I believe unless you have a true disability or problem where you can't physically ever work a job you shouldn't be near welfare)

I just need to walk into $1000 lying on the ground or win the lottery. I just want to be able to save money, and get back on my damn feet.  My whole paycheck is going to go to OD fees to a stupid corporate bank (which isn't even their fault - im the idiot here). I will probably have to get a second job. Which i have no idea how that will go considering I have to be in bed by 10pm to wake up not dead 6am the next day, and don't get home until around 6:15 so what do I do, get a job at McDonalds and work 7 to 11 every night?

I have no where else to turn, I can't have everyone take care of me or help any further because i already owe them money which i feel like shit because i can't even start to pay them back yet - in turn making me seem like the biggest asshole. Can I start a kickstarter for something stupid then just pay my bills and donate the rest? I don't have the conscience for that so no.

I'm sorry for shitty formatting, errors, whatever. I'm actually one of those people who can't stand proper grammar and such its just i'm just so angry with myself because there isn't anything or anyone else to blame but myself. I have a dental bill (from no insurance so YAY) that i will have to skip and lose more of my credit (that was built up so well before) and probably skip on my phone bill. again. If you got this far without puking at how atrocious this looks on your screen, well thank you for listening. Hopefully I figure something out before I snowball thoughts and beat my head into a brick wall until I die. I'm going to go back to working and put on my fake happy mask for everyone at the office. Someone made something really good and it smells good and I'm starving. So if you need me i'll be in the cafeteria eating a Styrofoam cup. At least those don't cost money

I have been bombing couple of interviews these days. They were all behavioral questions, but I have trouble articulating thoughts (I'm weak at communicating in English).

However, the interviewer said I should be expecting technical questions for this interview (OOP, Data Structures etc). I have heard that Fed job interviews are different from the tech company interview, so what should I be expecting?

I only have work experience in Front End Development although I'm a Compsci major (other than class projects), so I feel I'm clueless on what kind of work I will be doing.

When they ask me to talk about the projects, I'm not sure what they are expecting.

For instance, I have written a filesystem in C, but what exactly should I be talking about?
I have written a finite Automata interpreter, but how does this relate to a real world application?

So with all these problems, how do I prepare (not just for this interview, but for future)?"
2bicsh,23,2014-07-23,"I've hired a few interns and mentored them (in game programming) and I see a common theme that really irks me and has kept from recommending any of them for a position. Interns, please stop doing this!",prodikl,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bicsh/ive_hired_a_few_interns_and_mentored_them_in_game/,"Hey all,

As the lead programmer at my company I've interviewed a few interns and have worked with them one on one. I was an intern 8 years ago and worked my way up to a full-time web position (and have since moved on) so I know what it's like from both sides, here's a few things I've learned, and a few don'ts:

What I've learned:

- **Interns sit in a gray area** between profit, investment, and loss. I've taken someone from barely competent to very competent. I really feel like my (and my peers') tutoring was more valuable than a few college courses.

- That said, as an intern, **don't assume you're giving the company more than you're getting** (even a free internship). Mentoring requires weeks of taking someone very competent off-task, just to get you to the point of a net gain for the company. If you receive an internship, it's honestly not often a good investment for the company; it could be, but most interns leave after their term.

Anyway. As a mentor, the most annoying thing is interns with an **ego**.

- **If you try to complete my sentences because you think ""you got it; you got it"" then you're annoying your mentor**. I can't count how many times I had my sentence completed or talked over just to tell them that no, that's not what I was going to say. By talking slowly and in detail I'm actually trying to **keep you** from looking like a n00b. When I have to say ""no, that's wrong; like I said: it's like this"" in a slow and louder voice so everyone can hear, I promise right after you leave my peers and I will bitch about you.

- I understand maybe you feel a need to **prove yourself** as good enough or something, but please, please don't. We hired your for your potential and because you seem like a good learner. It's disappointing and dishonest if suddenly you are hard to teach, regardless of your skill.

- I'm (and most professionals are) a pretty good gauge of your current level of ability. If I stop to explain something slowly to you, its because **I'm pretty sure you don't know what I'm about tell you**. (And that's totally fine! A good learner is way more valuable than someone pretty competent, but with an ego)

- If you have an ego *and* get visibly frustrated about something I told you and you can't quite ""get,"" or argue with me that I ""didn't say that,"" you're causing more trouble than you're worth, literally.

But on a positive note:

- I really enjoy mentoring. I got my start as an intern, and I'll never forget the guys who taught me what I know; I learned more from them than my college courses. I really want our interns to succeed, and it hurts both the intern and the mentors if that relationship isn't respected.

And the best part for those of you who are looking for an internship: **the skills you have coming into the internship aren't really our only concern**. What we look for is:

- **Humility and appreciation** for the education we're giving you. **Ask questions** if you don't know something. Don't try to save face: just say ""Hey _____ ? I'm sorry, I forgot what you said about _____, could you show me that one more time?"" Do NOT try to blame your mentor for your trip up. You'll gain a lot of respect and trust for manning up

- **A friendly attitude.** If I'm sitting next to you for 100 hours in the next month, you better be pleasant. If it's a chore to explain things to you or if you're overly sensitive, you won't be recommended for a position; it's totally not worth it.

Anyway, this turned out way longer than I meant it to be. Any current / future-interns, I hope this helps you get on the right side at your company and lock in a position if that's what you're going for! You'll learn a ton and will create a very special bond with both your mentor and your company!"
2bidnu,2,2014-07-23,Hi guy wanted some advice and legal help,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2bidnu/hi_guy_wanted_some_advice_and_legal_help/,"Hi, I am new to reddit and its my first post, please bear with me. So a little background first: I'm 17 now and my dad is 51. I live with my mom(48) and my brother(14) and my cousin sister(25). She was living in our house for past 2 years as she was studying and doing an internship under my dad.


So this happened yesterday, and I just don't know what to do. So moving to main story.... Yesterday afternoon at around 1 pm I was using my laptop and the power went out. As it was not charged (because of cs 1.6), I asked my dad for his laptop for the time being as I knew he always had his laptop charged up. So I went to ask him and he said yes, so i took the laptop to my upstairs and started lurking on reddit and stuff.


It was around 1:40 the horrible thing happened as I was trying to play my songs in the background through pd. I opened the played before choosing the song. As i opened it I saw some thumbnails of videos with me, so I opened one of them and saw they were my baby videos. I was happy, very happy, as I have not seen them for quite a long time. As i was playing them another a video opened, purely by chance... Then came the horror.


It was a video of my dad having sex with my cousin. I was shocked, petrified, as I watched that video with tear in my eyes .... because the cousin was the one living in our own house. She was my best cousin (among 7 more cousins). I used to share every detail with her she was always polite and helped me whenever I asked. So as I watched the full video I cried and just fell numb for about 10 minutes.


After that I became angry but the horror did not stop there. So I started searching his laptop for more evidence. I searched everything in his laptop; videos, photos, everything. Then I started opening doc files and reading every one of them. (This went til around 3pm.) Then as i was opening one of them I read this (exactly as it was in the doc): Q: How did like the last time? Q So when will be the next time we do that? Q Did you liked the taste ;)


...And many more questions like this. And at the end your love, x (cousin's name). I felt like killing them both and this did not stop. There were docs like this as old as 19 months. And what more did I fucking find? Pics of my cousin. I felt horrible for even opening them...


So fast forward 2 hours. I have him his laptop back (he leaves for work around 5:30). At around 8 pm he comes back home with my cousin as she is an intern under him. I open the door and just stare, feeling how could this have ever happened. But it did. I felt like puking and my stomach have been churning since then.


And the anger, oh the anger. I didn't sleep last night and not even going to tonight. My mind is hurt. I just do not know what to do. Should I tell my mom all of this? Or ask my cousin to confess all of this? Help me guys. I don't know how to handle this situation... please help me if you can. Q I do not know how to confront my sister or my dad? Q Should i tell my mom first about this or first confront them ?

tl;dr: used my dad's laptop and found his and my cousin sextape

Edit My dad came home but without my cousin I asked him where she is and he said ""She has gone to the company's other office in a near by town and tomorrow he will also be going there "" I asked him for his laptop but said he left it in the office .Now I am thinking that tomorrow they will do it .But I do not have any evidence .
Q Is there a way i can remotely take the video or chats out ?
And thank yo all for the support now my main plan is to gather evidence first then talking to my mom.."

As a project while I'm there, they wanted me to look at reasons for leakage from a screw plug and then some possible solutions to it. So the screw plug sits on a copper washer which deforms to produce a good seal. The screw plug is a M26x 1.5 hexagonal bolt and the copper washer OD is 29mm and ID is 26 mm with average thickness of 0.95mm 

I feel the copper washer isn't deforming enough and I wanted to see how it deforms using FEA and force calculations. When measured, the copper washers usually deforms to 0.87-0.91mm thickness. The tightening torque for the bolt is 80 +-20 Nm.This large a deformation is something I cannot explain by theory(hookes law or roarks stress equations) or by simply FEA as the required force I calculate is around 800,000 N (which obviously seems too high). Does anybody have any idea where I could be going wrong and what I should be looking at. 

If it matters the screw is a chromium plated steel screw and the housing is cast iron. I'm using

2bijq3,3,2014-07-23,In-studio tech support?,misterdoctor,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/2bijq3/instudio_tech_support/,"I have a question (sort of) for any of you engineers and studio owners.

I have been working as a Systems Administrator for over 5 years now. Recording arts was my original field of study before I got into the IT world out of need for more stable work. A series of events has lead me to realize I should be following my passions and return to pursuing my original career path. I’d like to leave my current job so I have more time to build a portfolio of work, but I'm looking for other possible avenues. I’m willing to take an intern studio assistant position to get my foot in the door, but I am wondering if having an IT background would be considered valuable to a studio owner? I can confidently say I know my way around most PC and Mac platforms, network and storage technologies, a variety of DAWs and hardware interfaces, and so on. I’m sure studio engineers would appreciate not having to troubleshoot an issue so they can stay focused on their work.

Do I actually have a shot at a potential foot in the door? OR is this the sort of thing that a studio would outsource for the times they need tech support or larger scale hardware upgrades?

Thanks for reading!

edit: changed ""low-paying"" to ""intern"", and relevant clarification. I set my expectations a bit too high."

I took a job in Wyoming but after finding out that my ""internship"" was going to be me spraying weeds with violently homophobic people in the hot sun for three dollars an hour I packed up my bags and went home after about 3 weeks. My grandmother sent me the money through my mom but my mom spent almost all of it, so I had to get the cheapest flight with about 3 layovers and then take a train home.

I've been living with my parents since then and my mother never fails to make me feel like a lazy freeloader about it. I've been looking quite hard for a job, but I have so much to fix with my life and I don't even know where to start. 

My license is suspended and I can't get it back until I pay 675 dollars, and my mother will not give me a ride anywhere and we live in the boonies so it's like I've been living on house arrest the entire summer. I feel trapped. It's like solitary confinement. My father, the only person in the family who actually likes me is almost always away on business.

I was always just something to be used --- either as a ""trophy child"" to my parents when my grades were good, or as a ""cool friend' who had a car and access to drugs, or as the person who was always willing to lend an ear. No one has ever granted me the same liberty. I'm just like toilet paper, to be used for my purpose and thrown away accordingly. It makes me wonder what is so horribly wrong with me that everyone feels the need to treat me this way, even my own mother. 

I just feel like crying all the time and ending it. I had antidepressant but my mom threw them away, saying she didn't want a ""crazy person on crazy pills"" in the house. But I really need them. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just extremely mentally retarded and no one has bothered to tell me.

I bought some granola at the store the other day, my mother accused me of stealing it and threw it all away, then threw the empty bottle at my face. She then told my younger sisters that I am a disgusting thief and they should never be seen with me. I just want some sunshine in my life, but it's like I'm just drenched in constant rain."

My due date was July 22. July 13  all night I was having very uncomfortable contractions. I felt like I needed to take a big poo and the pressure was so intense! I tried timing the contractions but they were everywhere. I made it through the night and in the morning I went to see my doctor. Contractions still all over the place but pretty strong. I couldn't sit in the  waiting room, I had to walk around. Doctor checked me and told me to head to the hospital right away, I was 6cm. 

I got to the hospital about 3pm July 14. After about 3 hours I asked for an epidural (still at 6cm) They wouldn't let my SO stay in room with me :( ... The epidural was glorious though! I was the most relaxed I have ever been. I stopped feeling contractions. At about 11ish the nurse came to check me and I was 8cm. I was barley feeling anything. 11:45pm and 10cm,  doctor started me on pitocin. F%$# that stuff!!! Only 5 minutes later I started feeling sick and shaking uncontrollably. They gave me oxygen..my SO stood beside me holding my hand and looking white as a ghost. I had so much pressure and started pushing through the little contractions that I could feel. At 12:40 they said they could see his head and asked if I wanted to touch it! (Lol no. Just get him out of me) OMG ring of fire...no matter how much I read about it...nothing could prepare me for that!! That was the worst!! 12:57am July 15th my baby Ronen was born. 8.06 lbs &amp; healthy.  They plopped him on my chest and I started crying. 

I instantly felt better after pushing him out. It was very relieving. I had to get the episiotomy...and the stitches hurt. I have been in mommy heaven ever since!! Nothing prepared me for the feelings I have felt since he was born. I never knew I could love something this much! I feel like the luckiest person in the world. 




I few things:

* Breast feeding is hard!!! But we are getting better everyday :)

* Take everything you can home from the hospital, if they provide you with pads, ice packs, nipple cream, panties..etc..ask for extra!! I was glad I asked for extra stuff while my 3 day stay. It's been a week and I am still using the stuff they gave me at home. 

* Pack for extra days there. I did not expect to be there for 3 whole days. I thought 36 hours at the most. My baby has a little jaundice and they made us stay to monitor his levels. He also has a little heart murmur that they needed to run tests on. 

* I had so many people coming in and out of my room after baby was born that it was impossible to get any rest. Nurses, lactation nurse, doctor, dietary, house keeping, interns, visitors, and even hospital volunteers.  My SO had to put a do not disturb sign outside my door so I could get a full 2 hours sleep. I was exhausted!

Ten years ago, I was a good kid. 3.9 GPA in high school, several extra curriculars, worked full-time in food service my senior year. Went to college (top 100) with a substantial scholarship. Graduated with a political science degree, cum laude and other honors, even more extra curriculars, with internship experiences. Went to law school (top 40) on a substantial scholarship (first year was free). Did OK in law school (average GPA), did Pro Bono Society work, clinic, internships with national organizations in DC. Graduated from law school. Passed the bar exam in my home state with flying colors. 

I couldn't find a job (it's *very* tough for new lawyers out there) right away, so I moved in my with mom for a couple months. Then I moved in with a friend, paying very low rent for a spare bedroom, because the job opportunities were better in this metro area. It was supposed to be temporary, but she's very, *very* patiently allowed me to continue staying until I can pay for my own place (for now, at least). My mom lost her job a couple months ago, so I can't even move back like I know some Millennials are doing.

I've been looking for and applying to jobs in nonprofits, policy, state and local government, legislative, executive branch, judicial clerkships, etc. Literally anything that is relevant to any work I've done before. I check listings every day. I keep track of all my applications via Excel; I've submitted over 200 in the past 9 months. I've gotten my old Career Services Office to look at my resumes and cover letters, as well as other people to try to get advice. I've been applying for the occasional food service and administrative assistant position too, trying to find stop-gap work.

I've been living off (what used to be, but have diminished to nothing) savings from a paid internship I had, and a credit card, because I don't qualify for unemployment welfare. Been volunteering with a local nonprofit policy group part time to pass the time, but soon I won't be able to afford the gas to travel. Staffing agencies never have anything for me, and document review work never seem to pan out. As previous supervisors have agreed, I assume I'm overqualified (because law degree) or under-experienced (because less than 3 years of experience in any given field). And I have over $175,000 in student debt that I can't even *begin* to pay.

Today I got rejected from an administrative assistant position that an old supervisor recommended me for. I didn't even get past the phone interview phase. Then my car broke down. And then I cried. A grown-ass 26 year old man cried, while thinking ""I just can't do this anymore.""

***TL;DR*** I have been unemployed for over a year now, even though I have several years of high-quality experience and advanced high-quality education. I tried doing the right thing, the professional thing, the ""follow your passion"" thing. I have no money, no job, no working car, no real home, and no back up plan. And a year of hardcore job searching has left me with rejections. I don't know what to do anymore.

I've been spiraling downward into really negative thinking habits and I just feel like my entire life --- literally nobody has ever treated me like I was worth something to them.


I was always just something to be used --- either as a ""trophy child"" to my parents when my grades were good, or as a ""cool friend' who had a car and access to drugs, or as the person who was always willing to lend an ear. No one has ever granted me the same liberty. I'm just like toilet paper, to be used for my purpose and thrown away accordingly. It makes me wonder what is so horribly wrong with me that everyone feels the need to treat me this way, even my own mother.


I just feel like crying all the time and ending it. I had antidepressant but my mom threw them away, saying she didn't want a ""crazy person on crazy pills"" in the house. But I really need them. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just extremely mentally retarded and no one has bothered to tell me.


I bought some granola at the store the other day, my mother accused me of stealing it and threw it all away, then threw the empty bottle at my face. She then told my younger sisters that I am a disgusting thief and they should never be seen with me. I just want some sunshine in my life, but it's like I'm just drenched in constant rain. I want to die. I just can't see it ever getting better for me."

Got my chip today at my noon meeting and completed the 5th step on the same day! Afterwards, a 64 year old man in a wheel chair came up to me and told me about his 13 days sober and how he was so happy with our way of life, and that he wanted to have what I have one day...

I'm 25 years old. 

Over these 4 months, events like that, have blown my mind far more than any chemical substance I could take. A couple weeks ago I decided to get brave and ask the chair at our Saturday night meeting on the beach to be my sponsor. He agreed and my recovery has gone into a whole new gear. 

In my old addict thought pattern, ""goals"" was just a fancy word for ""big plans that I talk about and never do"". I'm pretty excited about the future, making much better grades in school, looking at MBA programs, etc etc. I arrive bright-eyed at the office of my internship about 30 mins before everyone else to pray and get ready for the day.

I love recovery and the new quality of life I have. I try to make 5-6 meetings a week, both AA and NA (Narcotics Anonymous). I would whole-heartedly recommend it to those brand new to recovery. I have tried to white-knuckle my way through recovery, with no support, by myself, to the tune of disastrous results, every single time. 

Thank you guys and gals for helping build such an amazing community here. One day at a time!

I've had interviews. I've made it to final interview at one company and had my references from my internship checked. I still don't have a job. This job was paying under 50k so it wasn't a really high end job. 

I've sent out countless resumes. and only heard back from a few companies. I have an interview tomorrow, so I'll see how that goes. 

I really have a passion for programming. I've had a year of experience working with java and SQL. I have a good feel for programming and learning new technologies comes fairly easy to me, but inexperienced compared to the 7 years commonly wanted in job postings, and I have little to no experience with the myriad of bullet point technologies they want me to have worked with. 

How was your experience getting your foot in the door? Was it anything like mine or not? Do you have any advice?"

* US citizen
* 23 years old
* Have been at my current job as a software engineer for 1 year
* B.A. in Astronomy, 2013 (not as super lame as it sounds, I swear)
* Hoping to be able to live in NZ for at least 12 months, preferably in Christchurch

Questions about looking for jobs in NZ as a foreigner:

* Is it even possible for someone with only 1 year of experience to get a job offer as a foreigner? Software engineer is on the ANZSCO list of long term skill shortage occupations, but I don't have the type of degree or years of experience that are listed under ""requirements""--does that mean that any company offering me a position would have to prove that no one in NZ can fill it?
* My boyfriend tells me that many NZ companies will only hire through recruitment agencies. But if a job posting just says ""send your CV to blah blah to apply,"" does that mean they aren't using an agency, so I can apply as long as it doesn't say ""we're only interested in NZ-based applicants""?

Questions about Working Holiday visa:

* My primary purpose in going to NZ will be to work (assuming I can get a job first!). Therefore I don't think I qualify for a Working Holiday Visa. Am I wrong?
* Would it be easier for me to find employment or an internship in the software industry under this visa (if I did qualify for it)? I just don't get how any company could get past the ""no New Zealander wants/qualifies for this job"" requirement in order to hire a temporary foreign worker like me.

Should I give up on the idea of finding a job as a foreigner and go to school in NZ for a year instead? I could afford the tuition, but I'd really rather be able to work. (On the other hand, getting some kind of Graduate Certificate in Computer-whatever-ing might make me more attractive to tech companies.)

Does anyone have advice? I'm just a confused noob here."
2bjwve,6,2014-07-23,Advice on embedded programming,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bjwve/advice_on_embedded_programming/,"I started my first internship and I will be graduating in December. When I applied for the internship I knew it would be for embedded technology but I needed experience in the field and working with a team so I took it despite most of classes and projects have been oop programming and mobile application development. I am about two weeks in and so far I have spent a lot of time developing C# for some tools they need and I am really enjoying it. Time is flying by and I am learning so much more than I have in full semesters at school. However my managers are hoping after I finish a few projects and get a feel for how the projects come together to start developing or at least debugging some C programs for some embedded devices. I have spent some time with coworkers watching them program and learn how they do their jobs. We have even tested our problems using an oscillator. My question comes with my fear of moving to embedded work. While I have not done any before it seems boring to me. I won't get to create any GUIs and enjoying putting a project together and be able to see the results. What are some of the ""fun"" sides of embedded work? I am afraid as I get into it I will begin to hate it while I enjoy what I have been doing so far. Am I being foolish and just letting new material make me nervous?

I guess I am just looking for some advice on how to make the most of it and what to try in order to find out if I do enjoy it. I am looking for some advice on if I should talk to my manager about my concerns even though I have only been there two weeks. I feel like I should tell them I like what I am doing and I am sure they can find plenty more for me to do that is not embedded. What are your experiences with embedded work? Should I go give it a try before I decide how I feel about it?"

Overall I have a lot of on campus involvement. 

Things have been rough for me in the past. I was orphaned almost my whole life, and have no relationship with my actual parents. I was over weight, poor, and unpopular in high school. This lead to a ton of bullying up until my senior year when I was actually able to prove people wrong. During my high school days I contemplated suicide a lot, and even had a botched attempt when my roommate walked in on me as I was about to commit the act. 

College on the other hand has been pretty great. I have a pretty good GPA, I'm heavily involved on campus, and I've done a couple of internships. This summer however has been absolutely awful. I received  a paid internship at a CPA office in my town and that job was supposed to get me through the summer. However, I lost that job when the CPA office had a mass exodus during my second week. A lot of people leaving, and the office eventually going out of business left me without a job. 

This was really difficult on me. They told me not to get another job just yet, and that everything would be panned out. It obviously wasn't. My rent and car payment were approaching their due date so I had to pawn a lot of my items and I do mean a lot just to make the payments so that I could function. 

I was able to find a job a little later in construction. I did rather menial tasks for a couple of weeks and everything seemed to be on the right track. I was also able to get my T.V. back from the pawn shop so I wasn't bored to death when I got home. After a couple of weeks on the job, I lost work yet again due to the contractor running out of it. I'm still seeking payment for one week of work in addition to everything, but he's actually a really good guy. It's just obvious that he has absolutely not work on his plate right now and is behind on bills. 

After I lost my second job I was screwed. I had to wipe out my savings yet again, and pawn things to make my rent and car payment yet again. 

This is what led to the problem I have now. I was absolutely broke. I was scrounging up what I could just to fill the gas tank to look for jobs and eat, but I eventually ran out. In a horrible frame of mind I went to Wal-Mart stole an item worth $14 dollars and tried to return it for cash so that I could buy food. I don't even know what I was thinking, I didn't even try to pocket the item, I just walked up to the service desk. 

Needless to say I was caught, and Wal-Mart is pressing charges that allot to a Class A misdemeanor. Not only that, I'm banned from going to Wal-mart again which is unfortunate for a couple of my organizations. Now I'm sitting here typing this out feeling like utter crap. I live in a small town, and when I go to court everyone is going to realize what I did. I still haven't eaten in a few days, and the town is so small that food banks don't even exist. I hate everything and I just want to get out of it all. All the problems coming down on me seem like too much, and on top of everything I have an electric bill 5 days past due and no idea how I'm going to pay for it. 

I hate waking up every day where my job is to find a job. It's just all too much."

2bk9v0,2,2014-07-23,PhD VS industry+masters... my unique situation,ricksteer_p333,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2bk9v0/phd_vs_industrymasters_my_unique_situation/,"Hello all, hope you're doing well...

So a huge dilemma I am facing is deciding between a PhD and Industry+masters (Electrical Engineering field). One of the largest factors that will be deciding which route I take is **my ability to finance myself and my soon-to-be wife.**

I'm currently on a 6-month internship with Intel, and in May 2015 I receive my bachelor's degree in EE. For several years now, I have been wanting to pursue a PhD, and I believe I have a fair chance to a university like Stanford, Caltech, or Berkeley. I would be starting my PhD next Fall, 2015.  As you know, the salaries for PhDs are well below $40K, even in the most expensive cities.

The other option I have is working full time at a place like Intel (or any major corporation) while doing my masters simultaneously. At this point I'll be looking at at least $60K salary, depending on the location.

The problem comes in with my student loans and soon-to-be wife. She's a foreigner who will move to the US, and she'll need my financial support for a few months as she situates herself in a new country. (Her career is English/Spanish translation, so I'm sure eventually she'll find a job).

My question is, how affordable will it be if I'm doing a PhD, to pay rent and have a dependent for several months? Especially if I am in San Francisco, where rent is **very** high. 

On the other hand, if I choose the industry route, none of this will be a problem, and things will be relatively easy, financially speaking.

FYI: Both routes, phd and industry/masters, entail doing what I like. I won't be sacrificing what I love to do for money. The advantage of a PhD is having the opportunity to be a specialist in a field, which is *very* attractive to me. Just sucks ass to be in this financial situation. 

**TL;DR** Girlfriend is moving from her country, to the US, late Fall 2015. I need to support her for some time, and I have $30K in loans. Do I pursue a PhD ($25-$35K salary) or industry/masters ($60K-$80K salary) ? I'll do what I love in both instances."
2bkc8x,0,2014-07-24,Me [21 F] with my SO [21 M] of 3 years don't see eye to eye on work life balance... I don't know what to do,Perceptivestudent,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bkc8x/me_21_f_with_my_so_21_m_of_3_years_dont_see_eye/,"Background: My boyfriend and I met freshman year of college, in the first week. We had a lot in common - both Honors students, both driven, etc. We have basically been dating ever since, but our different work/life viewpoints has always been an issue. He's always done as much as he can to get ahead, I've always been the type to procrastinate or put my friends/Reddit ahead of homework -- though I always managed Honor Roll. 


Current Issue: He's in the tech industry, and has always worked long hours. At school obviously we'd work together but we both had our separate dorm rooms to go to sometimes. This summer, he got an internship in Silicon Valley and moved across the country. I decided to go as well and found a summer job out here so we have been living together for the past 3 or so months. 

Things were ok for a while, but now work/life issues are bursting at the seams. I haven't been handling his working hours well - 8 to 7pm most nights, followed by freelance projects until 10/11 then bed on some nights, freelance til 9 followed by some TV on the others. He hasn't been handling my lack of understanding very well, and we've been fighting a lot. He thinks that I'm expecting too much from him, I think that - when living together - it's reasonable to expect at least an hour or two of un-distracted quality time together a day: ***either***  1 hr per day, or like a 5 hour date on friday night if it was a busy week. 

It's worth mentioning that I have an issue with this because 1) I couldn't handle a life like we are currently living right now forever. If he's going to work in a tech job and we end up married, I can't keep doing this and I fear that I will. 2) Because one of the ways I feel loved is if he puts effort into hanging out with me, and I don't feel like that is happening.

Question: For this reason (mainly) I have been questioning who's right, who's wrong, if I really should be changing my position, if he has a good point... and whether or not this is an issue we can overcome. I need help understanding what we're going through. 


If I missed any useful information, please ask me for it!

---   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend and I of 3 years differ on work life balance. Should I be more understanding of his situation, or do I have a legitimate concern? "

So i may have found my way out . My best friend and i always talked about renting an apartment together the second we both turned 18 , but when i got into that university , it ruined that plan. we were going to go to the same junior college and everything. but now, im realizing more and more that  theres absolutely no way id be able to make it financially with that route. Id rather go there with a little money in the bank and maybe a car later on in life and lets face it, got the money to START going there in the first place, and even then theres a billion obstacles , not small ones either, that id have to face. its just not a smart move for me right now. and i need love and care around me. and if i move to the neighboring city that we'd be moving to , id have that , from my best friend, from a pet,&amp;an amazing church community that is there that ive never gotten to be fully into because of how far away it is, i could intern there if i moved there and thats literally been a dream of mine for years, and one that God supports so its really important to me. i could never do that if i went to the university. And i could get a job, be in the navy reserves, be an intern, and be in school. I could finally have a pet. I could finally have a life where i can be continually happy. The more we talked about moving in together, the freer &amp; better i felt. like my family and their hate for me just melted away. thats the sign i needed to tell me God agreed. &amp; yes , my best friend can change her mind, very easily, but i doubt it. she needs to be close to school (we are going to the same school, she's already enrolled) , &amp; her boyfriend of almost a year is moving w his family to the same city we would be in . and her and i know each other so well we're basically sisters, i would not even consider living with her if i didnt know it would work. we know each others triggers, weaknesses, and limits very well. We are in very similar places in life also, so i have no doubt we'd be very good rommates. Also, she is incredibly supportive of my choice to get a restraining order against my mother. most people dont. most people see that a being ""cold heartd"", but my best friend comes from an abusive home as well, her mother very similar to mine in some ways, so she understands, and even is encouraging me to get the restraining order asap. &amp; honestly, i dont think me moving in with three people i dont know would be good for me right now. i know my limits. thats just too much to expect from me. one day, when im further from this pain an &amp; tumultuious home life i think that could work very well, but as of this year, not so much. And on top of this, i can get involved in the church again, and in sports again. But here's the best part of this week; the guy ive been talking about? the one who said hes liked me for tweo years, as i have him also,? asked me today  to be his girlfriend. He actually chose me over another girl. a girl who is prettier, more experienced w relationships , isnt into the whole abstinence thing like me, but he chose ME. knowing ALL of this. This has literally never happened to me. I cant beleive it. Im on cloud 9. I am scared. to be vulnerable. to let him in. to have to explain my hoem life and my past to a whole new person , one who could easily break my heart if he chose to . but i wont let fear hold me back anymore. im done with fear. i might not believe it yeet, but i am worthy of love.

She has this program called ""coconutBattery"" popping at startup. Two days ago it was 18 cycles and 100% health, then yesterday 19 and 95 % health, now it's at 19 and 97 %.

Did i fuck up her battery ? She told me to drain the battery at least once a month to 40 % then recharge, and to store it at ~50 %, which i did half the time. I don't wanna give it back damaged, so please tell me if it's a common thing or not :/

I come from a quantitative background and have limited hands-on work experience within finance (with the exception of a highly specialized internship which didn't give me as much of a ""broad strokes"" introduction to the industry as I would have liked). The role that I will be working in focuses primarily in quantitative investment research and risk management. 

So far, I've been reviewing and (re-)reading ""Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives"" by Hull and have been trying to keep up with current financial news. I've been thinking about studying/brushing up on statistical programming languages and Python/C++ as well (should Excel/VBA be something to focus on?). 

My issue is that there is SO much material and there are SO many different things to learn between mathematical techniques (regressions, optimization methods, MC simulations, etc.), financial knowledge itself (asset classes, types of securities and their nuances, how they all work/are correlated, VaR, portfolio theory), and  current news to keep up with that frankly I'm overwhelmed and don't know how to prioritize. 

I'm hoping to hit the ground running so any tips as to what I should review and prioritize before starting the job would be GREATLY appreciated (especially from people who have worked in similar positions)! Thanks in advance!

I'm tired of hearing people say its not that important. That is flat out just an excuse to not give it your all. A competitive GPA will get you more interviews, and help you stand out in the final decision making process too.

2) Read Cracking the Coding Interview. ---- Be able to hand write all fundamental data structures many times, think them over in your head. Implement all fundamental sorting algorithms, many times. Practice writing down your code. If you spend the time to think them over in your mind, you won't have to worry about memorizing them.

3) Side projects / certifications / new languages should be 3rd priority. I'm not saying don't do these. But from experience, it is very easy to dive into learning new/complicated things, and the opportunity cost is HUGE when #1 and #2 are hindered.

Extra Note: For those of you who say GPA isn't a factor in CMPSC.. Look around. Look at the resumes &amp; GPA's of students who get internships vs those who don't. 

I am just a student who has realized the opportunity cost of studying new languages / frameworks / databases instead of excelling in these fundamental areas."

I was able to find a job a little later in construction. I did rather menial tasks for a couple of weeks and everything seemed to be on the right track. I was also able to get my T.V. back from the pawn shop so I wasn't bored to death when I got home. After a couple of weeks on the job, I lost work yet again due to the contractor running out of it. I'm still seeking payment for one week of work in addition to everything, but he's actually a really good guy. It's just obvious that he has absolutely not work on his plate right now and is behind on bills.
After I lost my second job I was screwed. I had to wipe out my savings yet again, and pawn things to make my rent and car payment yet again.

This is what led to the problem I have now. I was absolutely broke. I was scrounging up what I could just to fill the gas tank to look for jobs and eat, but I eventually ran out. In a horrible frame of mind I went to Wal-Mart stole an item worth $14 dollars and tried to return it for cash so that I could buy food. I don't even know what I was thinking, I didn't even try to pocket the item, I just walked up to the service desk.

Needless to say I was caught, and Wal-Mart is pressing charges that allot to a Class A misdemeanor. Not only that, I'm banned from going to Wal-mart again which is unfortunate for a couple of my organizations. Now I'm sitting here typing this out feeling like utter crap. I live in a small town, and when I go to court everyone is going to realize what I did. I still haven't eaten in a few days, and the town is so small that food banks don't even exist. I hate everything and I just want to get out of it all. All the problems coming down on me seem like too much, and on top of everything I have an electric bill 5 days past due and no idea how I'm going to pay for it.
I hate waking up every day where my job is to find a job. It's just all too much."

Due to some problems with a recent project, my boss is considering breaking ties with this development company and finding someone new. I know it is typically a bad idea to have the company doing web development to also control hosting. Something of possible significance: They have refused to grant me FTP access so far, even when they could not find the file for a page we needed updates on. 

How much of an issue would be moving all of our products to a new hosting company? Our main site was coded many years ago by a contractor in India and so is considered unstable.

In April, I started as an intern and earned myself a spot as an apprentice for carpentry (for contruction, not furniture).

I did and do what I can to help as much with the carrying and all that as I can and I have had the chance to do bits and pieces myself. Those are my favorite times because I can just work and don't have 3 or 4 guys yelling around telling me to get this, clean that, and so forth, which can be very frustrating since I am not familiar with all the tools yet and happen to forget one I knew about before when I havn't used it in a while. I stay curious, ask, but the boss of the company keeps getting jobs that the workers can't finish in time and the atmosphere on the working site is very often, extremely tense, which doesn't really allow anyone to take time to explain shit to me. 

I understand I have to earn the respect first. I guess every beginner must go through a plethora of remarks and all sorts of comments. My age probably doesn't help (I am 30). I keep being told I am too old to become a good carpenter, why the hell would I pick this job and so on.

It becomes particularly annoying, when mistakes made by team members that cause significant delay go completely without any sort of remark, while I'll get yelled at if I just allow myself to change the plugs for the next power tool in order to have that done. It's simply incredibly frustrating and I need to know if this is normal.

My frustration is mostly directed at myself. When I am asked to bring screws and forget to bring a screwdriver, in my mind I go: how the fuck can I miss that, I got into med school for fuck's sake!!!

The sadest part though is that nobody seems to like their job there. All they think about is the little money they make and complaining and making fun of the boss having lost touch for the practical work. Yet of course, none of them would dare trying to work independently.

Fortunately, none of this has impaired my desire to want to become the best carpenter I can be. But I realize that I will have to do a lot on my own..."

tl;dr: i am going to do my masters in melbourne, it's a 1+1+2 [1 yr study, 1 year intern and 2 year working maybe?)

My questions are as follows:    
1. Apartment or a house

Apartment
I found that (over some time looking at property sites) that the rent for an apartment (2bdroom/parking) = to rent a house. my main concern for an apartment is 

a. having guest over    
according to a friend having guest over should be ok. but the thing i was thinking of signing on with SHA (Student Housing Australia) so i am worried i would not be able to have relatives/friends over (for visits)

b. renting then finding housemates    
basically if the above was allowed i was planning to get a 2 room and rent the other room out short term when i do not have people visiting? or get a 3 room and split 2 way. not sure if that is allowed.

House
house would have no problem with guest over and stuff plus there is a garden and parking space (that i do not have to pay extra. the main issue i may have is.

a. renting then finding housemates    
basically if the above was allowed i was planning to get a 3 room and rent the one room out long term term. would that be possible?

b. home security, i was wondering other than the normal locks and keys would i require additional home security systems?

2. Rental Periods    
what are the normal rental periods in australia like? like what is short term and long term like and for me which would be better?? (if i stayed 2 years before moving to a place near to the new workplace.) 

3. Any rental advice for first timers??

2bm938,14,2014-07-24,[Slightly NSFW] Masturbated for the first time ever. Story below.,throwthrowthrow125,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2bm938/slightly_nsfw_masturbated_for_the_first_time_ever/,"Throwaway because, yeah...

As weird as it is, and as much as many of you may not believe me, I don't really care. I am a 21yo M, and as of two nights ago, I actually masturbated for the first time in my life. It was awesome, and weird. It was a little different than I expected, but at the same time, just what I expected.

For a little background, I grew up in the midwest, with a family of six, and a Christian religious belief. While self-pleasure wasn't necessarily frowned upon in my family, it wasn't really a topic of discussion (except to not look at porn ever, because its ""bad"").

Even still, I went to public school, and when I moved to a new neighborhood in 4th grade, I made a good friend, and basically gained a second family because of it. We would talk about porn, and I'm sure i probably watched some stuff with him or his brothers, but it was never really weird. Even all throughout middle and high school I looked at porn, I just never really got off to it. I can't even remember how many times I would start attempting to get off, and then give up because I got bored. Instead, I'd just swing my member around, or play the guitar, or whatever. 

It's really quite laughable now. In these last few years, I came clean to a number of really good guy friends about my lack of masturbation, and they were all pretty unsurprised. But, they all gave me differing advice on what I should do. Some said I should stay on whatever path I'm on, because it's easy to get hooked and never stop. Some said they felt sorry for me because it's an awesome experience. What I got out of it: Only do it if you want to. It isn't weird, in fact it's pretty normal.

With all of this in mind, and due to a few circumstances I won't go into detail about, I had just kind of shrugged the whole idea off, and stopped thinking about it altogether. I still ended up watching a lot of porn, but still never actually got off to any of it.

After splitting up with my now ex-girlfriend January 2013, I was kind of at a loss about a lot of personal stuff. We were a very christian couple, as we had met at church. She was the church intern, and I was essentially an assistant Kid's and Youth pastor. So, we hit things off pretty well, but even after a while we had made decisions to save ourselves (which tends to build up a lot of angst). Luckily, I'm a relatively calm guy, and I tend to hold in anger pretty well, so it wasn't as huge of a concern as some might think. 

Because of all that, when we split I was torn apart. I had lost my passion in teaching kids about God, lost my faith in the church, had no real thoughts on romantic social interactions anymore, and was left at a very weird stand-still. I ended up partying more, and almost hooked up with a number of girls (didn't for a number of reasons), ate out a lot more often instead of cooking for myself, and ended up living by myself for 3 months over the summer. Ugh. I hated being alone.

Anyway, I ended up better because of it, and now I know where I stand in everything I was unsure about. I lost my passion for teaching because of the material, I lost my faith because it stopped making sense, I regained my social skills, and found out how to be myself apart from another person. In fact, living with five roommates right now makes me wish I had more time to myself.

Anyhow, being put into a better place I ended up joining a professional fraternity, enjoying the time I had with my college friends, and doing whatever I wanted that made me happy. So, a week or two ago one of my guy buddies made a comment to me about my lack of masturbation, and it finally clicked. Even in spite of my personal changes, I was still a virgin and hadn't had the opportunity to not be one yet. Thus, I was still pretty angsty about sexual stuff, even though I could talk about it all with ease. So, I just decided one day to give it another go, and voila! It happened, and I wasn't just playing the guitar this time! I was actually pretty excited but haven't really had an opportunity to talk to anyone about it yet, so Reddit, here we are!

**TL;DR - 21yo M, jerked it for the first time with a lot of pent up sexual angst. It was awesome.**

Thanks for reading everyone, and if you have any comments, I'd be happy to have them."
2bm9xu,46,2014-07-24,Intern Colleague who harassed me and paid!,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2bm9xu/intern_colleague_who_harassed_me_and_paid/,"This is one of the worst experiences I have had. Will try keeping this short. I took up an internship at a firm. I was happy, I was being paid to meet my expenses, though they made us interns work hard and till late. But it was OK. I don't mind working. Rather it was a new experience and I was damn excited about it.


Obviously, the new interns got to know each other, friends were made. I became friends with this girl. Let's call her Suze. We were a group of 6 people, who used to hang out together during the lunch time. One of them was Chris. He seemed to be a fairly OK guy in the beginning. That was the reason I was OK to have him as a part of my circle.


Then one Sunday, when Suze had come over to my place, she pointed out that she had caught Chris looking at me a lot. Now i am attractive, and I get a lot of attention, I know guys look, but it's never been anything creepy or gross. So I didn't take it very seriously but decided that I will definitely maintain some more distance from him, to make sure that if he was into me, he would know I am not interested.


I should mention that we all had a cubicle each. One of the partitions of my cubicle touched his while the cubicle on the other side of mine was of Suze's. My cubicle was at the end of the row. I think that's why me and Suze had become good friends quickly.


Anyways days passed by,and even I noticed Chris looking my side for long seconds when he was standing in or around his cubicle and he looked away when I looked at him. 


This is when I realized something. His stare at me made me extremely uncomfortable. Because the way he looked, it seemed there was something going on inside his eye that was too sinister. I can't explain. i don't know how to explain the kind of look. But it made me want to leave from there and get as far as possible.


I want to say that I have had anxiety issues since my school days, i.e. I get anxious and restless when I have to handle situations involving personal problems on my own, have difficulties in saying no to people and regretting later, and other such stuff.


However I did bluntly tell him one day that it would be better if he focus his eyes his work rather than at me. You know what he did? He laughed, as if I was a kid and he didn't think it mattered much what I said. I was offended and started completely ignoring him.


Some of the others in the circle noticed my behavior, but you know how people are, they kept their mouths shut and went about their own business. Only Suze would give him glaring looks when she she caught him looking at me. But it was a professional space and nothing more was said or done.


One day we decided to have a party at a co-worker's house who was also a good friend. I was with Suze most of the time, but she had brought her boyfriend too, and soon they wandered off somewhere. I was sitting on my couch talking to two of my male colleagues. I noticed the creep Chris staring at me from near the door of one of the bedrooms. I ignored it, there was nothing to worry about since so many people were around me.


Around 12:30 I left from the party alone (in case you are guessing I have no bf, had broken up 6 months back and wanted to be that way for some time). As i neared my house, I noticed someone at my porch. Nearer, it was Chris. i could make him out in the street light. How did he get there? He was at the party. But I had not noticed him during my last one hour or so at the party, maybe he had left early. WHAT on the earth was he doing at MY house? I was totally freaked out. This guy was crazy or even dangerous.


Friends, i didn't stop my car, i drove straight past my house, I was so scared. I turned a some random lanes to make sure he wouldn't know where I went and stopped the car because I was shaking badly. How did he know where my house was? No one except Suze did, and I am sure she would NEVER have told that Creep my address. I called Suze, she said she is coming with her bf straight away. I told her to ring me when she reaches my home, i was not going back ALONE.


I don't know why I didn't call police. Calling Suze was my instinct. Anyways when she got there, she called me and I went back. They told me no one was there when they arrived. Ok, so he must have left, However I begged Suze and her boyfriend to stay back with me that night. I never slept.


Next day I decided to confront the man. He was in his cubicle and I went to him and burtled-what the hell were you doing at my home yesterday? If I see you near my house ever again, i am going to police. He just stared at me and didn't say anything. Didn't see him around my house after that.


More time passed, work load was getting bad. One day I got some extra work because of calling in sick for 3 days. We interns usually left by 8 while some others kept working till 10. Anyways, most of the interns had left, so had Suze and the creep. Until I saw him enter our dept again. Maybe he had left and come back to get something he had forgotten.


But he comes to me and says something like- if I see you hitting on other colleagues ever again, I will come to your home and you won't be able to get help this time (how did he know I got help last time) friends, I never hit at my colleagues, NEVER. God knows what this man was saying. I just froze, i blankly stared at him as if my tongue was tied. I felt fear from this man. I should have shouted back at him, slapped him, screamed to gather other people. I didn't, my mind was blank. He left and my mind started working again. i went to my manager and told him all about the creep, his coming at my home and what he just said to me. I was not feeling confident about driving to my house alone so I took a cab and left my car in the parking.
Next day Suze told me that another co-worker had told her that the manager has let Chris off with a warning. That's all? I asked my manager to let me change my cubicle with another colleague and he let me.


Fast forward again, I was nearing the end of my internship. I was home and watching TV, when my phone rang and it was an unknown number. I took it. Friends, all I could hear on the other side was sound of drunk kisses being blown in the speaker on the other end. It's was disgusting and I knew it was him. Who else could it be, i disconnected the call and cried my self to sleep. I must have been in deep sleep when my phone rang again, I was totally out of senses so I just answered it.


It was Chris, he told me that he was at (____) address, 12th floor I have to come there alone right away, without telling anyone. if I don't come in another 15 minutes, or bring someone along, I will regret badly. The first think that came to my mind- what do I do? I was panicking and had already jumped out of my bed. There was no way I was going there, no one knew what this man could do. And then by God's grace, I knew what I had to do. i called up the police and gave them the address he had given me. That night Chris was arrested and I never saw him again.


Although after that, I rejected the offer of job in the same company I was doing internship at. I moved to a different state, where I got a pretty decent job. He is still in prison, Suze says he will be released soon, but I am getting restraining orders against him. I hope we never meet Mr. creep.

I'll be honest here, the reason why I'm majoring in engineering was partially decided by my parents due to its job prospect and salary. I told them that I wanted to go for undecided major to see what I could get but wouldn't let me, so I just ended up in ME department. The whole 3 years I've been depressed about my life due to family relation, course work, and having no clear goal in my mind. I kind of cleared this out with my family and we had a little bit of a discussion to allow me to take it easy without being pressured too much. Now I feel like I am able to concentrate on my studies properly and start thinking about my upcoming career. 

The problem starts here:
Due to my depression, my gpa ended up below 3.0, with no project or internship experience other than retail part time job and volunteering at hospital. It's summer right now so I'm spending sometime learning programming online Java,C...etc. (I guess that's a plus). But the thing is that I'm actually just learning the programming to get something in my resume to stand out a little. But that's just it. I really don't have clear goal in mind of what type of job I want to get so I really can't tell specifically what I should learn on my own other than taking classes. I honestly don't know a thing about engineering that I probably won't be able to talk about anything.

2bmi5f,37,2014-07-24,Removing drug abuse from my life - and why,ElectricSilence,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/2bmi5f/removing_drug_abuse_from_my_life_and_why/,"My foray into the world of drugs began in Freshman year of college. I was smoking pot with some pals from my residence hall every weekend I could get my hands on it, and I had my first few acid trips which I found underwhelming but fun nonetheless. I retained my sober personality (""spark"" so to speak), and every day was a new adventure. I remember drinking a ton and having pretty bad acne (probably from the drinking). Despite that, I had a beautiful caring girlfriend and as many friends as I could ask for. I went to parties and stayed up late with everyone, I was a bit of a livewire. My grades and social life didnt suffer at all, and I was very content with what I was doing.

When Sophomore year came around I had more freedom as far as places to do shit. I found myself smoking almost daily and tripping atleast once a month. My girlfriend from freshman year and I broke up, and I started abusing benzos to kill the pain. I would pop a few etizolam several times a day. Led to me scoring pretty well with women, but I usually couldnt remember the details. Freshmen thought I was a hotshot, but my friends knew I was rotting on the inside. I eventually tried Molly at a party (loved it, still do) and began dabbling in rc amphetamine because I was bored. I found myself around increasingly large amounts of substances and people willing to do them. I was crashing on peoples couches all the time cause they didnt mind and I was too high to leave by the end of the night. I usually ended up mopping myself up in the morning (often doing speed to be ""ready for the day"") to make it to class or the Internship I had scored. My grades started at the highest they ever had been, but by second semester I was nearly failing two classes. A lot of my old friends were becoming ""uninteresting"" to me as my desire to get fucked up didnt factor them in. I was also using a lot of K during this time and was illusioned to thinking it was perfectly fine to blow through a gram in a week or two. I saw the warning signs of my benzo abuse and managed to kick that right around finals week, luckily. That was the beginning of me reigning myself in.

I scraped by and managed to survive with not so great grades and alright terms socially aside from the failed relationship which left me crushed (was entirely my fault). This summer I stayed at the school and have been continuing my internship. My abuse of pot skyrocketed though and I was burning through &gt; an eighth a week. I also took up selling in order to fuel my addiction. My speed use became quite frequent and I could start to feel its effects on my heart. 


I found that the pot was numbing me to life, and making me a sloth at work. My boss was no longer being wow'ed by my quick work, and I was coming to the job still baked from the night prior. Speed was burning through my gains at the gym and making me an emotionless zombie. I became a burnt out twig of my former self. 

My abuse of all things mind-altering hit me when I found myself laying in bed with an empty box of nitrous cartridges. ""Fucking nitrous?"", I remember thinking. I blew 75 dollars I didnt really have on that shit, and was lying around inside on a nice day. Im done, I decided.


 Im turning it around. It started with me putting down the bong. Those glass tubes of fun are surrogates for pot dependence. Im gaining clarity to see that most of my ""problems"" were cause by being baked whenever I had free time.  Now im shelfing speed, and selling the Ketamine I have left. This shit, all of it, doesnt even appeal to me right now. Im done being fried on last nights chemical debauchery. Ive had a brief but intense 2 year ""taste"" of this lifestyle, and I want out of it. 


This post was basically a self-serving rant so I could get it all off my chest. So this is not a complete waste of your time ive provided my subjective analysis of each drug ive tried below. Thanks for reading.


**Marijuana**: Makes otherwise boring situations fun. Usually provides a case of the giggles if your tolerance is low enough. Smoking it long enough exposes users to the anxiety aspect of it that many find uncomfortable. It can blind you into being lazy while thinking you're ""normal"".


**LSD**: An overrated but still certianly interesting psychedelic journey. You see things you never quite noticed before. Everyone looks like actors on a stage and music sounds really good. The ""visuals"" are a fun aspect of it. Use of LSD frequently is likely to turn the user inward and make them more quiet and introspective. While this can be a good thing, its also a minor disconnect from reality and can throw people off their horse.


**Shrooms**: Lsd with a better body high if you can make it past the nausea. Half the duration of acid, which makes it less psychologically taxing.


**Nbome/nboh**: dangerous and should be avoided. If you do try them youl find it similar to a shorter, less mindfucking, lsd trip.


**Salvia**: Prickly and painful. There's a strange phenomenon where the user usually gets slack jaw for the duration of the trip. It can be enjoyable but there's no reason for you to expect that it WILL be fun. Youl likely feel like a part of an object, and with a high enough dose gravity will change direction on you. Lasts about 5-8 minutes.   While im done with most shit ive tried, I may revist this plant one day.


**DPT**: VERY introspective and not to be underestimated. Right around 3 hours of duration. The visuals may make it seem like youre underwater. There's a certain physical ""vibration"" effect that my friends and I found uncomfortable and foreboding. Snorting this hurts!

**Ketamine**: Youl feel numb and floaty, and may get dizzy. Moving your limbs feels really good and everything either looks a bit more distant or zoomed in. You can go deep on this so be careful. I got an hour (and a half?) out of it.


**DXM**: Like Ketamine but possibly more euphoric. It has very unique and super intense CEVs if you can hit the sweet spot. Ive heard of this lasting very long for my friends but I got about 4 hours out of it.

**MXE**: Less visual than DXM and Ketamine but more fun in a traditional sense. It also lasts A LOT longer. Inhibitions are lowered, and redosing is quite common. Its easy to get hooked on and can be very disconnecting from society. Makes life feel like a simulation (maybe it is). The duration is anybody's guess, ive gotten as little as 2 hours and as much as 8 out of it. If you do this drug, be sure to eat it!


**Dramamine**: Youl legitimately hallucinate. Its not fun, but it can be very interesting. White flashes of light are the only consistent visuals that ive been able to seperate from reality. Dangerous physically and in any social settings. I dont know how long it lasts, my guess is 6-8 hours.


**Nitrous**: a quick (1 minute quick) very fun high that feels kind of like weak MXE. Its overpriced and easy to abuse though so I see it as a regret waiting to happen.


**MDMA**: This is ""the best it gets"" as far as euphoria. Many people report empathy and happiness but Ive simply gotten super confident and amped up on it. Its not inherently sexual but It can be. Popular drug of abuse by the younger crowds, and has one of the worst safety profiles out of common recreational drugs. Lasts 4-5 hours. The crash sucks.


**Amphetamine** (2-fma &amp; Adderall): Racey, mildly euphoric, sweaty, and can be very productive. Youl probably get very social on it. Itl speed up your metabolism but kill your hunger. It interfaces with the reward system in your brain, which can make it hard to derive pleasure from anything but more amphetamine. Amphetamine is usually good for 6-10 hours of stimulation. Dangerous amounts of sleep deprivation are common due to poor dosage timing and redosing.


**Benzos** (Etizolam): as far as noticeable effects go, its alcohol in powder form. The only difference is its much more addictive, and the withdrawals are very dangerous because it acts on your brains GABA system (which you dont want to fuck with). Itl generally make you hungry and slow your metabolism down which is why frequent users report weight gain. Its very easy to get hooked on and very easy to black out typically. Neutralizes the effect of many other drugs. Etizolam lasts roughly 8 hours.


**Nicotine**: A mildly euphoric, hyper addictive stimulant that has a tendency to induce nausea at high doses. Its stimulant effects are very mild and short acting. If you can hit the sweet spot it can feel very comfortably floaty and euphoric. 

**Kratom**: The working mans ""opiate"". It feels good and its good for socialization, but eating it is terrible. Make it into a smoothy. Lasts like 4 hours, can be addicting, and is as safe a drug as they come. If I had more money id still keep some of this around for the odd night out.


**Alcohol**: A brain numbing substance that is often habbit-forming. Inhibitions and fine motor function will be diminished, speech will be slurred, and post-binge nausea and hangovers are common.  Good for socialization, but bad for your body over time. Many frequent users develop an excess of fat due to the high level of carbohydrates present in alcoholic beverages. Alcohol made dirty/large/slutty women seem like beautiful angels to me."

#/r/DesignMyRoom

**1,452** Redesigners for **24 Days!**

I have a problem. 

I am addicted to room redesign. Now, it's not so much a problem when I am forever rearranging or dragging new [thrift store hauls](/r/thriftstorehauls) in and changing out old stuff for new in **my house.** No, it's because I can't stop wanting to re do everyone else's place too.

I go to people's houses and I think this should be there and that should be here and sometimes I just want to move their whole living room *any way* but how they have it, and put some stuff on the walls, and put the TV where everybody wouldn't have to lean like they are all on a toboggan in order to watch it. And, I really am not OCD, but it does bother me because I really, really want to say something but know *it's not polite to actually act on it.* So I end up  feeling as overstuffed as a sofa and loveseat crammed into a too small corner of a too full room trying to hold it all in.

I once found this great vintage marlboro standing ashtray. It was like a combination between [this one](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m243f9a2lOVHELmnvpdHPeA.jpg) and [that one](https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKDQNytxVLb_BJuC9XuG91Tavx8h3DhKNkAzW_6qFyW6HjWoO9) but not really. The graphics were totally different. It was orange and red and white, but aging made some parts cream colored, some grey and then it had the chrome top. Part of it was peeling so you could see metal under that too. There was just a touch of black. I wanted to get it for my then-boyfriend and I totally redesigned his apartment around it. **In my head**. I had all the  **stuff picked out even!** and as I mulled over going back to the store to buy it, I realized, yeah, it was rude of me to want to redesign **his** apartment. And I realized, if I got him that ashtray (which I think now, I probably would've liked  a lot more than he would) it would be a reminder of how much I disliked the rest of his bad furniture and poorly laid out apartment and only really liked that one thing. It turns out, while it was easy for me to realize immediately I hated his grandma-ish sofa, (which was not a hand-me-down btw) it took me longer to realize that I *disliked him.* (It's ok. It turns out he is really unlikable.) 

And so, it was probably good I held in the urge and did not redesign his whole apartment. (yeah, I had thought that far along- to all the rooms- even the bathroom) only to leave him to have to live with a whole apartment completely changed by his ex-gf.

But now I just found this **great sub.** People who *want* to have people tell them how they might redesign their room! Permission. Finally!

Some people [need more help](http://imgur.com/a/9C8L5) than [others.](http://imgur.com/a/QRSYV#0) There's plenty of space for a [variety of ideas for the same room](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/z8i83/en_suite_spacious_room_owned_by_tasteless_me/) for the submitter to choose from.

But best of all submitters there really want help, and there are some awesome people giving great advice.

I recently talked with moderators IotaGamer and BarricadeLights and here's what they have to tell us about /r/DesignMyRoom: 

&gt;##1. What made you create this sub?

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** I was browsing /r/AskReddit and came across a post asking if there is any subreddit dedicated to users asking other users to help them arrange their rooms according to their taste. It struck my mind and I made the community. Our only mod, BarricadeLights, was also browsing the post at the time. I asked if he would like to help me moderate this community. He agreed and I made him the mod.

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** This sub began from an AskReddit Post submitted by user /u/PropaneFitness. I happened to be browsing the new section and having already had a strong interest in design related things, I was keen to be involved.

&gt;&gt;At that point, I was getting a bit dissatisfied with my reddit experience, and the magic was wearing off, so I thought being a moderator would be more interesting. I had never started a subreddit, being a fairly ""new"" redditor myself, however I was happy to help out so I offered my assistance in helping IotaGamer when he posted that he had set up the requested subreddit. 

&gt;##2. Are any of you designers?

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** Nope. I'm not a designer. Well, I don't really like room designing. It's just that, whenever I have some free time, I design my own room. So that's that. Organizing things really interests me. 

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** I'm not an interior designer, but I am a Product Designer! I am probably less knowledgeable than some of our users, but I do enjoy watching renovation programmes on TV and pick up some tips and tricks.

&gt;##3. Do you have any favorite room redesigns or ideas that either you did, or that have come up in the sub?

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights**  I enjoy those redesigns where we can discuss things with the poster, as opposed to the posts where they don't respond to propositions and questions. It really helps when someone talks you through about how they use their rooms. It makes it easier to try and analyse what might appeal to them, or suit their lifestyle. Giving useful advice is a lot harder when you are left with the bare minimum of details. I don't have a favourite re-design, since our subreddit is so new!

&gt;##4. What would you like people to know about /r/DesignMyRoom?

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** I would like people to know that /r/DesignMyRoom is a subreddit where you can get constructive, considerate help and advice about how to rearrange, redecorate or otherwise renovate your room. We aim to be a welcoming community that tries to redesign rooms to their best potential.

&gt;##5. Do you have anything else you would like to add? 

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** First of all, a big thanks to you for choosing our subreddit. We are really thankful to you for doing so. Secondly, I do not have anything else to add :P BarricadeLights covered all the aspects I had in my mind.

No, **thank you** for a cool new sub!

Like some of the other new writers here, I am an intern at /r/subredditoftheday and need to introduce myself. Unfortunately /u/Freakazette already used my [standard introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/zx02m/september_15_2012_rbeavisandbutthead_heh_heh_i/c68hvqu). 

So some things about me:

* I never, ever mastered the backward somersault.
 
* Like a lot of people I like [Mad Men](/r/madmen) and know too much [trivia about it](http://tomfoolery815.tumblr.com/post/23616288239/matthew-weiner-shows-some-love-to-andy-richter-controls).

* Of all the reddit jesuses I am the one that watches over the shittynetwork. Well, I may need to be more specific as there are probably more jesuses there too. I mod two subs, /r/shittyaskscience and /r/shittyaskhistory.
 
* And I like Louie C K as much as the next redditor, but really, I feel we could give [Bob Odenkirk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9DmZn1E05M) a little more love.

#/r/soda

**791** Soda Jerks for **2 years**!

I love soda.  I don’t make a secret of that.  Circle K Thirstbusters or Polar Pops or whatever they’re calling them these days are heaven-sent.  If you save your cup, you can get a 44 ounce refill for about $0.85, depending on what the tax rate for your locale is.  While I happen to like [one particular brand](http://i.imgur.com/dQiNk.jpg) of soda more than the rest, there are many delicious sodas out there.  Even I need to change it up once in awhile with some root beer or Dr. Thunder.  Yes, I said Dr. Thunder – I may have the sophistication of a redneck, but I am very snobby about my soda choice.

/r/soda is dedicated to all sodas and soda related things, such as [soda-flavored Hubba Bubba](http://i.imgur.com/fn3JVZq.jpg), [Pepsi Blue](http://i.imgur.com/EpvlGMT.jpg), [Salty Watermelon Pepsi](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/253156_286670278101486_89162301_n.jpg) and a discussion on how [Crystal Pepsi](http://www.reddit.com/r/Soda/comments/1353oz/i_miss_crystal_pepsi_twenty_year_anniversary/) is missed.  They even discuss soda tasting parties.  Oh, I suppose you Coke-heads think I should post something Coke related to be fair.

Well, then, you should have joined our internship program and beat me to this feature.  Link for said program is right in the sidebar.

Okay, [fine](http://i.imgur.com/OAnpKn7.jpg), but don’t say I never did you any favors.

I sat down with the /r/soda mods to ask them questions about their wonderful subreddit.

&gt;#1. What made you want to be part of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** I actually found the subreddit abandoned! I thought it would be fun to be a mod, so I went to the mod maintenance people and asked to be given control. That was about 2 years ago and back then there were about 30-40 subscibers.

&gt;#2. Is there anything in particular you expect from the community?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** One thing I love about this community is its steady growth and enthusiasm for all things carbonated. I always enjoy seeing posts about people wanting to learn how to make their own soda, posts about independent soda brands, or posts about soda flavors from other countries. I expect to see these kinds of posts increase as we grow larger.

&gt;#3. Do you have a favorite soda?  What is it?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** If I had to choose a favorite name brand soda, it would have to be A&amp;amp;W rootbeer. I really enjoy its more creamy taste. My favorite off brand would have to be Americana Huckleberry. It's very sweet and has a unique and familiar flavor at the same time!

&gt;#4. Do you think soda wars are tearing apart the fabric of our society?
&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** These so called ""soda wars"" are just a fabrication of the Big Coffee industry to keep our eyes from the truth that coffee is trying to invade and take over our way of life! Wake up, DPeople! Fight the grinds! Drink a cola!

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** Finding this sub and watching it grow to 25 times its size over the past 2 years has felt a lot like what Rick Moranis felt in [Honey, I Blew Up the Kid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104437/). It's been tons of fun and I can’t wait to see what comes next!

Thank you for that interview!  I'm going to kick back with a Pepsi Throwback and I hope the rest of you enjoy some soda this fine day."

#/r/VXJunkies
**53,576** junkies for **1 year!**

Have you ever wondered about how computers work? Have you ever thought about getting down to the very basics of what makes a machine like that run? Have you ever just wanted to mess with metal parts until lights lit up or smoke appeared, whichever comes first? If so, welcome to the wonderful world of VXJunkies.

In my case, the story starts in 1996. While most tech-inclined people were fascinated by the rapid rise of the Internet, I was more of the type to hang with my grandpa in his workshop. Right there, in his backyard, we worked with strange tools and wondrous machines, dodging the occasional pipe or offset valve. He kept using terms I only heard from him, constantly muttering something about ""ferrocores"" not complying with ""DL hashing standards"" or cursing under his breath at ""Yalgeth"" and ""her fu-- oh, sorry... very stupid limit"". I never quite understood what he was working on, but it was fascinating. I grew up, though, and eventually stopped coming over to see him. Life, school (and growing up in general) got in the way, and I never really heard of him again until I got a package in the mail a few years ago.

Friday, February 29th, 2008. It was raining. It was cold. The UPS guy hastily made me sign the receiving slip and retreated into his truck, pointing to the lumbering package he left on my porch. Shivering, I brought it inside. It was heavy, and... *vibrating* somehow. I slowly opened it, and there it was: a machine I had seen a hundred times, so familiar and yet so distant in my memory. As it turns out, my grandpa had passed on and left this box in my name. I had just gotten my first very own VX Machine.

It was a beauty of a VX4 Mark III. I flipped a few switches that I recognized by sight, and it gently hummed back to life. The 7-LED numerical display on the right showed my current delta: 0.07. Far from perfect - my grandpa used to reach 0.40 with ease - but I couldn't do much without any documentation. Fast forward a couple of years, and this is where /r/VXJunkies comes in: there I found [everything I'd need to get started](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewihz/) and more. With the help of the community, I've been able to reach the 0.40 Delta mark my grandpa had set, and I'm still learning and getting better all the time. For example, simply [upgrading my ferrocores](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewxef/) from the stock VX4 set to the ones I built (completing grandpa's blueprints) made my dephasing interval shrink from 9.10 to 8.02! Throw some adjustments due to recent discoveries regarding Holt's Junction, and BAM: 0.45 Delta, *on a VX4!* It might not be impressive to most, but it sure was to me. The folks over at /r/VXJunkies can help anyone get going with a basic module in no time - just add passion, patience and curiosity.

And now, a few words from the mod team:

&gt;##1. I see a few of you are directors in well known VX-related companies. Why did you choose to establish a presence on Reddit?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** This is where the community is growing. Just 10 years ago a CRD-20 cost over $62k for a unit with only 9 static pinboards, and which took 80 cubic meters to produce a dual-tachyotic signal! With the rapid advancement of the periolith coil comes less of a need for palladium structures and we are now seeing an improved legal environment for ultraband-O-K12s. Someday soon I fully believe we'll be seeing VX gear at Walmart and basic VXing as part of a general education.

&gt;##2. Could you share a highlight of your VX career?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** I am mostly known in the community for my 10e-16 Yalgeth Run and my 7 year tenure with Dr. Miljavic Ernada on parallel alignments with reduced harmonics, but nothing for me can beat the time I synchronized manually (no å-subD suppression) an entire ten-bay of copper prongboards on the first try. Best day of my life.

&gt;##3. What is the highest *stable* delta you've reached pre-Holt's Junction?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** We have a YL minus 10e-13 minimum delta requirement for modding in the community.

&gt;##4. What do you think will be the state of VX Modules in 10 years? 20 years?
&gt;&gt; **Dragonai** VX is to computing as Bitcoin is to currency. Currently, mainstream methods of achieving steady-state thermoefficient deltas are nowhere near as potent as VX modules, and yet, these lesser methods are popular in physics and chemistry labs all over the country (I'd venture to say even across the globe, though Switzerland and the Iberian nations are taking great strides to standardize). I'd say within a decade or two, every modern home will be host to a VX module. Raising kids with one in the home will pique their curiosity, and they will naturally want to tinker with ?-cohesion and Fankel geometry; it's a deep and ever-growing field and the barrier of entry is honestly lower than people think; ignorance is simply easier than understanding. :)

&gt;##5. What VX model would you recommend for soon-to-be-junkies reading this? Everyone has their preferences, but please try to be unbiased.
&gt;&gt; **Dragonai** The VX5 with a Rockwell chromatosilicate ferrocore, without question. Yes, this is against the grain. Most people would say I'm a heretic and slice my deimometer circuit out of disgust, but hear me out. The 5 lends itself extraordinarily well to low-resistance magnitude compression due to the copper gasket, which is perfect for the amateur enthusiast. They top out at about 4300 kTr, so no worrying about destroying any microwaves!

&gt;##6. Great, now if you could give them *one* tip (aside from ""Read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewihz/)), what would it be?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** It can be difficult for a new VXer to distinguish between pseudo-scientific nonsense (like compacting Yalgeth's Limit in a variable wavelength diamatic structure) and true cutting edge advancement in the field (such as some of the work coming out of Australia on uniform distribution of delta cohesion, or sinusoidal particulate structures). Stick to the basics. And for crying out loud, do not leave your diode clock uncalibrated! We don't need another Reykjavik '97.

So there you have it. Whether you're just starting out and looking for advice or you're a old-timer coming over to brag about your accomplishements, /r/VXJunkies is the place for you.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if you don't follow procedure and end up overvolting your cat/spouse/television. Phasing is a serious business. Always read and follow the label.

It describes various phenomenons using diverse forms of media, including - but not limited to - text, visual aids (both static and dynamic) and sound. After viewing Subject, Agents have reported symptoms ranging from slight apathy and distraction to heavy addiction. Experiment 1608-5 showed that personnel exposed to Subject for an amount of time as low as fifteen (15) minutes felt compelled to contribute to its storage of historical data. Caution must be exercised in such cases, as some subjects will attempt to submit accounts that are factually incorrect, either knowingly or due to faulty memory recall. Such subjects should be warned that their conduct is unacceptable, but should *never* be made aware of real reason for this rejection. That is, to comply with containement procedures, they must not realize that currently accepted data has been integrated in Subject because of its accuracy. Instead, the following boilerplate answers are to be used:

- The account's narrative style does not fit with accepted norms;  
- The account contradicts previously known data;  
- The account has already been submitted and refuted, or;  
- The account regards the termination of [SCP-682](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682), which leads to [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 1608-J-1:** To anyone trying to make more people aware of Subject ""since the public is allowed to view it, and besides, it's so cool that it deserves the exposure""... Please don't. The risk of memetic contamination isn't worth it. And besides, our stock of Class A amnesiacs isn't infinite, and it would *really* be a *shame* to need to upgrade to Class C just because some [REDACTED] Class D decided to tell all of his friends about this.

**Interview 1608-J-A:**

**Interviewed:** ElXGaspeth (AKA Dr. Kens) and Nivek12, /r/SCP mods  
**Interviewer:** Dr. G██  
**Date:** ██-██-████  
**Location:** [DATA EXPUNGED]  

**&amp;lt;Begin Log&gt;**

&gt;##1. How did you discover the SCP Foundation?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** I discovered the SCP Community after looking through several Unity game examples. Then I found the SCP-087 game which lead to the wiki and finally to this subreddit.  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** I found it roughly four years ago in a link on Reddit, I believe. I checked it out, joined the chat, and applied the next day. Got in, and have been a part ever since.

&gt;##2. What is your favorite SCP?
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** Can I say most of them? I kid, but in all seriousness I love [SCP-1959](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1959). There's something spooky and sad about it, about being unable to control your own fate as you orbit your home, never to be able to return.

&gt;##3. I take it you've written/contributed to at least a couple... Which one of those are you the proudest of?
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** I only wrote one - [SCP-922](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-922), but I do have two other tales floating around. My most popular one is the [Audio Logs](http://www.scp-wiki.net/last-man-standing) of Dr. Kensington. I wrote that a few years ago.

&gt;##4. What is your biggest pet peeve when people write SCPs?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** That people believe all SCP articles need a sterile/clinical tone or must have every single detail explained. I find myself liking Foundation Tales more because they build a world in the reader's mind by using imaginative descriptions that wouldn't fit in a formal document. The visual imagery in Foundation Tales can convey and trigger such a wide variety of thoughts. There exists a sweet spot between a blunt story and a vague jumble of words, but when a writer hits it, readers can feel the ""what ifs"" creep into their minds.  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** My biggest pet peeve is the same as Nivek's, but also the reverse case where writers will leave out too much and leave the reader confused about what was happening. It's a fine line to walk between telling and showing, but it's an important line to toe. Another peeve of mine is where people think ""Oh, and SCP article must be a scary/creepy/terrifying."" They don't have to be in order to be a good read.
Oh, and just because I'm senior staff doesn't mean I should be revered or whatever. I'm just another member like you, just with a few other duties. I'm usually in chat or in the forums if you need help.

&gt;##5. Any other words for aspiring writers?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** I believe that writing an SCP article shouldn't only be about how mysterious or creepy of an idea the author can come up with (though those certainly are characteristics of the majority of good SCPs). The author should also consider the impact on the reader. I'd say a good SCP is one that instills a strong urge/desire in a reader such that they would be willing to join a large community of strangers and devote hours to interacting with others who have nothing in common except for the author's article. What good is an idea if no one shares it?  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** Don't be afraid to ask for help. The community is there to offer support and advice. Sometimes ridicule, but take it in jest, not offense.
And for God's sake, learn there/their/they're, your/you're, and basic grammar. And don't use those black boxes everywhere. Like a good perfume, they should be used sparingly, not bathed in.

**&amp;lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 1608-J-2:** Ah, great. Now everyone knows. Well... If any of you really want to start writing, do us all a favor and read the [rather](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/y2w95/so_what_exactly_is_scp/) large [amount](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/150ufk/links_resources_and_suggestions_for_writing_new/) of [documentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18zof4/mod_post_we_need_to_have_a_talk_regarding_682_and/). Cleaning up after new researchers can be so tiring, so please read standard procedure - *and follow it*. We've lost too many [REDACTED] to [DATA EXPUNGED] ever since Dr. ████████ and SCP-███ came along.

Out of several hundred applications, I have yet to even get as far as a face-to-face interview. My most recent strategy has been browsing online job boards and submitting to just about every opportunity for which I feel qualified.


I have to admit that after this much effort, the job hunt is very demoralizing. Were my grades too low? Is my resume garbage? Do I need to get my EIT certification for opportunities to open up? Is it necessary to have a connection somewhere to get your foot in the door first? I'm at a loss.

**104,984** padawans training to become jedi masters for **4 years**.

Today is May 4th popularly known as [National Star Wars Day!](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH6Ug4TFr0K37VID2tI47taf) Today we celebrate the wookies, bounty hunters, slave princesses, ruthless villains with immense power, Heroes who rely on faith, old wise men with tales of the past, droids with one liners and everything in between. Today we Celebrate **EVERYTHING** StarWars. Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay its become a time honored tradition. It started when SROTD first [started itself.](http://redd.it/h3ppm) And last year's feature was even [better.](http://redd.it/t6ldf) I don't think I can top it. I mean for god's sakes man, there was a poem, a prologue and even a disclaimer! [Ah....](http://i.imgur.com/JQSzoAN.gif) We'd also want to take this moment and honor the fine Jedi MODS Masters and their wonderful achievements. But to do so, you need to know their past. Here is a brief history. 

A long time ago in a subreddit far far away. /u/Noche created /r/StarWars and it was good. Then came a mysterious fellow by the name of /r/jaxspider who promised to bring peace to the ~~galaxy~~ subreddit. And so he did. He vanquished the blogspam siths and did away with the boring default CSS stylesheet. He formed a council of wise Jedi masters to help him, first came /u/Wazow the ever present and motivated one. Then one day /u/ugnaught bumped into them and it was destiny. Over time the council has grown and become even more powerful. Even today they work hard to keep the peace in the subreddit. ~~For the night is dark and full of terror~~ Something something darkside. They are updating the rules as of late so stay on the lookout for that mod post.

Normally we ask the mods questions to make you, the reader, know more about the subreddit. But this is Star Wars. Its an American institution at this point. If you don't know about Star Wars... have you been living under a rock for 40 years? Go to /r/StarWars, HoverZoom over the pictures, comment in the discussion threads, and enjoy yourself. If you love any part of Star Wars, be it light saber battles, Expanded Universe questions or even  something nostalgic this is the right place for you.

&gt; To spice up this feature I'll  ask you the readers some questions instead!

&gt;&gt;1. What was your first Star Wars memory?
2. Whats your favorite scene and why?
3. How excited are you about the new movies?
4. Would you let the wookie win?
5. In your own words why is The Empire Strikes Back the perfect sequel? 
6. How would you torture Jar Jar Binks to the death?
7. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, young Obi Wan Kenobi. Fuck / Marry / Kill. Go.
8. Star Wars is not without it's cringe worthy moments. What real life moment related to Star wars do you still cringe to this day?
9. What one thing would you like to be officially retconned out of existence? 

**Warning** If I made a mistake or grammar error, please be patient with me. I haven't featured a post in a while. What with all these wonderful writers &amp;amp; super eager interns doing amazing work, I've become quite rusty."

#/r/GreenDay
 
**3,092 American Idiots** for **1 year**.

Green Day is surely a name that most of you recognize. The group has been constantly releasing various very recognizable songs for the longest amount of time, which are world-renowned today. I mean, who hasn't heard of ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams""? And guess what, that song has been released *nine* years ago, at which point they have long established themselves as one of the leading rock bands of its time.

What is now one of the most important punk bands of the past two decades began as a duo between the two childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike ""Dirnt"" Pritchard at age 15. After having adopted the name ""Green Day"", the group released numerous well-known albums to the likes of ""Dookie"" and ""American Idiot"" that ensured their rise to mainstream popularity. The group now has four regularly appearing members, which are the aforementioned Billie Joe Armstrong (Guitar, Vocals), Mike Dirnt (Bass, backing vocals), and the later joining Tré Cool (Drums) and Jason White (Guitar, backing vocals)

It is thus no wonder that a small branch of its fanbase have found themselves on Reddit, where they gathered themselves in a small, yet active sub, under the control of three mods, who are the founder /u/Garin2010, and his two minions, /u/MispelledName and /u/Slapdown, whom I was able to ask some questions:


&gt;1\. What brought you into listening to Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I discovered Green Day just as I was also becoming acquainted with other bands like The Offspring and Rage Against the Machine. American Idiot was given to me as a gift from a family member after it was released in 2004 and I immediately became a fan. From then on I moved on to listening to their entire catalogue and have been following the band ever since.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I actually got into Green Day because I saw them in the ""Thank You"" area of a lot of albums, especially my then-favorite band Good Charlotte (I was 14 at the time, don't judge). I kept hearing all of my favorite pop-punk bands saying that they were their inspiration in interviews, and it was love at first listen.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** I started listening to Green Day when American Idiot came out. I heard Holiday on the radio and loved the song, so I went out and bought the album and loved the entire thing. A couple of years went by and I saw the music video for 21st Century Breakdown on MTV and loved that song too so yet again, I went and bought the album. That was when I went back and looked up all their older songs and I knew then that they were my favorite band and still are to this day.

&gt;2\. Which one is your favorite album?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** As much as I would like to say that I have a number one favorite, I usually break down into selecting two. My first is Warning, I love the acoustic sounds of the album and also how it became the album that signified much of Green Day's style changing from their punk days, to the much more modern rock sound that we hear today. The second album is Insomniac, for it's raw sound and punk roots. It's one of those albums that I point to when anyone objects to their punk beginnings.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite album is American Idiot, because it was the album that got me into Green Day, and actually got me interested in playing guitar and bass. I've always loved concept albums, and you can't go wrong with crunchy guitar and well thought out lyrics.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite album would have to be 21st Century Breakdown because I love the music on the album and the lyrics. They just hit that spot we all have when listening to our favorite albums. I also tie that album in to being why I looked up all their previous records.

&gt;3\. What was your favorite experience with Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** My favorite Green Day experience was undoubtedly my first concert. I saw them in 2009 on their 21st Century Breakdown tour in Salt Lake City. I was a Verizon customer at the time and they hooked me up with free tickets, soundcheck passes, early access to the venue, the whole VIP treatment. I was extremely lucky to have such an awesome experience at my first concert, and I still consider it one of the best days of my life.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite Green Day experience is when I saw them on the American Idiot Tour in Dallas back in '05. I was right on the rail at the very front, and got to high five all of the guys. I even got a water gun blast right in the face from Billie Joe (No, that is not a euphemism).

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite Green Day experience I've had would be learning and playing the songs on guitar. My girlfriend inspired me to pick up guitar again and learn the songs about 2 years ago. I've been ""Having a Blast"" ever since!

&gt;4\. What motivated you to create the sub?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I created the sub about a year and some months ago after coming on to other band centric subreddits like /r/blink182, and also the fact that I felt that Green Day fans needed somewhere on Reddit to get together and discuss after seeing comments in Green Day posts get so hostile in other subreddits.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I'm so glad Garin created this sub, he's done a great job with it. Back when I first joined reddit, this was the first sub I looked up and it had barely any posts. Now, it's become a really great community.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** Garin has done an awesome job with the subreddit so far. Keep it up bossman!

&gt;5\. Do you wanna say anything to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I love the fact that our subscribers are very active! And if you ever see a helpless person lost in an /r/music thread, direct them to the sub! Also, there are going to be a number of changes happening that I think many will like.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** We have some pretty great posters, the only thing I really have to say is keep being awesome guys! Keep that good content coming! AND USE THE DAMN [MERCH] TAG!

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** All I want to say to the present and future subscribers is: You guys are the reason the subreddit is awesome, keep it up!

To finish this up, since I'm a new intern at /r/subredditoftheday, I would like to introduce myself:

My universal username is schampanes (shum-pun-ase), and I've had it for as long as I can remember. I've been on Reddit for just over a year now, following the path of one of my IRL friends, who introduced me to the site. I don't have a lot to say about myself, other than the fact that I like music of any form (which is the inspiration for this post), so I might be leaning more towards featuring music-oriented subreddits (or not, who knows?). 

Also, GreyWriter is the sexiest writer of all. ^(Now please put that gun away)"
2bmwid,1,2014-07-24,"Me [21F] with my ex-BF[22 M] were together for a year, broke up with me about 2 months ago. He wanted to remain friends, but won't talk to me now. Insight?",hermygoal,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bmwid/me_21f_with_my_exbf22_m_were_together_for_a_year/,"Background: We were together for 10 months before I left to study abroad for just 4 months. 2 months into my trip, he tells me he isn't sure if he still wants a relationship. 1 month later, breaks up with me. (Tells me Im great, deserve more, he just can't be a good boyfriend right now).2 weeks later, comes to visit on a ticket he bought awhile ago. We had a great time, didn't get officially back together, but had a week of fun, sex, and good open communication. We had decided to see how things go when we both get home (just 2 weeks later).

Upon arrival, he says he still doesn't know, so I think it's best to put things to a real end. No friendship, no weird limbo, just break up and move on. I have an internship this summer about 2 hours away, so we have some good distance between us. But he wanted to remain friends and remain apart of each other's lives. I wasn't sure if I could do that, even with a good amount of distance between us.

But now, he won't return a single call, text, or email, no matter what the subject matter is. The only time we talk is when we run into each other (about every 2-3 weeks) when we're in the same town. (I go back to our college town where he is every few weekends to see friends). Last time we talked, we were both somehow drunk and alone at night after a music festival, walking back to the campground. 

We both said some things that were mean, and some things that neither of us even remember. We were very, very drunk. But he told me that he's been depressed, and that he feels like everybody is against him and on my side. (Honestly, I dont think people give two shits about ""choosing sides"" and remain friends with both parties) He told me he feels like I've ""stolen"" his friends. (We met through mutual friends and when dating, I became friends with his friends. Why would I need to lose friends just because I lost him? I don't go out of my way to see his friends, but if we're in the same place, I'm going to say hi and have a drink or two with them. I haven't seen them in months!)

Essentially, I'm just worried about him and care about him, and he doesn't open up to very many people. I'd be lying if I said I don't still have feelings for him, but those come secondary to his wellbeing. I don't want to start a super close friendship or take things too far too quickly on that front, I'm just trying to reach out and also to understand what even happened within him to lead to our breakup. 

Breaking up was all his decision and thus should make him happy. He didn't get hurt, he hurt me. So why is he acting like the victim and refusing any sort of friendship from me? 

---   
**tl;dr**: He wanted a friendship, but doesn't return calls or emails, and goes rogue when we do see eachother. Why?"

The toasters over at /r/ToastersGW know how to have fun and they love to submit pictures of themselves being in mighty [dirty](http://i.imgur.com/3RM7Dni.jpg) circumstances and from time to time, enjoying some [weiners](http://i.imgur.com/jI8c3Ho.jpg) and some taking a whole [bagel](http://i.imgur.com/I4TbyzU.jpg). All these pictures are available for you guys to enjoy in a sanitary and understanding way. /r/ToastersGW do not allow slanderous comments nor do they condone interaction of the creepy nature. No, it is an environment where you can watch buns get toasted safely. Where everyone can enjoy the sight of a toaster in action but must stay respectful. Respect one another and we can all have a good time.    

I know what's on the end of your tongue and it's fine. I'll answer. You're welcome. I know it's hard to find what you're really looking for on The Internet. Sometimes, you get lucky and discover a place where your needs are fulfilled. Now that I'm sharing /r/ToastersGW with you guys, I hope you will share it with others. The others that you have seen looking at your toaster lustfully, that guy at work who always insists on cleaning the toaster and even yes, that dude at Ikea that spends his lunch-break in the appliances section. We know what you're doing and that's OK. /r/ToastersGW is here.

/r/ToastersGW has moderators, as I said, to keep us in check. Here is what they had to say:
 
&gt;##1. How did /r/ToastersGW start?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** ToastersGW was set up as initially a way for horny toasterers to express their ways, without interfering with the battle over at /r/toasterrights. Kind of like posting to /r/gonewild instead of /r/pics.

&gt;##2. What's your toaster like?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Silky smooth and sexy curves, right out of the Latino heartland.

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** She is a sexy deep blue Kitchenaid, with two slots for double the pleasure.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth** My toaster likes it real slow, real light at first. Then it gets crispy. ;)

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK** It has big ol slots for extra fun.

&gt;##3. Do you have a favourite post?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** No, I dont discrimate. I will spank the one eye wonder to any colour, gender, religon or creed (except the dirty toaster ovens)

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ToastersGW/comments/1gx4mx/close_up_double_penetration_two_thick_slices_in/

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth**  Not usually one for favourites, but... Toasty buns and big wieners.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  http://www.reddit.com/r/ToastersGW/comments/11x147/want_some_japanese_toast/

&gt;##4. What does this Subreddit do that others don't?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Accept everyone for who they are. We dont judge, either.

&gt;&gt;**META_FUCKING_POD**  As far as I know, this is the only subreddit to have hot pictures of toasters above the legal age of toaster consent.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth**  Pretty good role-playing thing going on. And come one. Perverse toasters.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  Toaster porn and high spirits.

&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your Subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Treat your toaster well, you may never know when accidents may occur. I lost my last SO to a thunderstorm where a power surge knocked the life out of her, I'm still grieving, years later.

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** Thank you for all the support you have given, and thanks for help expanding this subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth** Keep them coming! I'm running out of fap material here.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  We are going to start cracking down on Creepy PMs. This is just a warning.

Thank you very much for reading. If you too would like to write for Subreddit of the day, apply for the [Internship programme](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ywgo3/subredditoftheday_is_now_hiring_read_the_details/c7wwcxi).

HIMYM, or How I met Your Mother is a comedy of a father telling his kids the story of how he met their mother.  He ends up going way off track, and telling about all the fun times he had with his friends, things he did at the bar, and dating. People love the show's mix of comedy, romance, and seriousness.  

The [first episode](http://media.tumblr.com/ca5695005c71ab44ecb0914809abe7ee/tumblr_inline_mfjvetyYPk1r5g3i5.gif) of the final season of How I Met Your Mother starts tonight.  [Ted, the main character and father](http://i.imgur.com/6fDxMJk.jpg) has yet to meet his future wife, who was shown on the final episode of the previous season, so this season will be filled with their relationship.  Also, the majority of the season is said to take place at [Barney](http://i.imgur.com/lZ7TqJx.jpg) and [Robin](http://i.imgur.com/5J60hHT.jpg), two of Ted's best friends, wedding.  Me and many others are going to be sad that the show is over, and remember our favorite moments from the show.  Mine would have to be the slap bets, and Barney losing the bet with Lily and having to wear a [duck tie](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/25900000/7x03-Ducky-Tie-barney-stinson-25935299-1280-720.jpg)

Many people like the show for its mix of [comedy](http://i.imgur.com/qU0lOrH.jpg) and [romance.](http://i.imgur.com/jiQkEqH.gif)  I personally like the awesome things in the show that they spend tons of time on.  [Like the Bro Code](http://www.brocode.com/)  or the [slap bet countdown](http://www.theslapbetcountdown.com/), or [tedmosbyisajerk.com](http://tedmosbyisajerk.com), or [Puzzles The Bar](http://puzzlesthebar.com/).

The /r/HIMYM community is a fun place to discuss the show and share HIMYM related links.  You can go there to see How I Met Your Mother discussions, [memes](http://i.imgur.com/0wgIJbN.jpg), [other funny pictures](http://i.imgur.com/AL7aar3.png), and [references to the show](http://i.imgur.com/FAKqsAB.png).  The sub is fun to browse is you like HIMYM because if the endless funny references to the show.

[Remember, newer is always better!](http://i.imgur.com/vqD8jZh.gif)

Here are some Q&amp;amp;As I had with the mods of /r/HIMYM :

****

&gt;##1. Favorite episode of HIMYM?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** Oh wow, loaded question... S02E09: Slap Bet is definitely a classic. I love how this joke continues throughout the series. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** Favorite ep would have to be the one where Marshall finds out his dad died. Jason Segal didn't read the other lines in the scripts, so he didn't know what the countdown was for and his reaction at the en of the ep was genuine. The feels man, the feels.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hard to answer, but the one that sticks out in my mind is Bad News. Some people think the whole countdown aspect took away from a very poignant moment, but I really feel like it added a lot to the episode.

&gt;##2. How do you feel about the show coming to an end?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** I hate when any show I enjoy finally ends. Honestly though, it's run its course. As much as I don't want to admit it, it's time. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** I'm not going to know what to do with myself. 

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hate to say this as the (more-or-less) creator of this sub, but I am glad it's ending. I still love the show, but like atticus says, it's definitely run it's course. It's time.

&gt;##3. Any other shows that you especially enjoy?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** Oh man, where to begin? Some of my favorites are Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Trailer Park Boys, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia... I could go on all day, but I'll stop there. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm40e** Long list here. Scrubs, Entourage, True Blood, Breaking Bad, Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, Eureka, Warehouse 13, Stargate(all of them), Jeopardy and so many more.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Breaking Bad, Firefly, Black Books, Louie, Arrested Development, Buffy/Angel, Dollhouse, The Wire, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp;amp; Rec, Community, Chuck, The IT Crowd, Deadwood, Justified, GIRLS...I watch a lot of TV, and love most of what I see.

&gt;##4. Any thing else you want to share with reddit?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** For all you TV fanatics, you may want to check /r/television's recent updates. With the fall season starting, the sub features helpful info on season premiers, new TV-related subreddits and other stuff you may find helpful.
Oh, and check out /r/TelevisionQuotes and /r/StartledCats :)

&gt;&gt;**dm40e** I named my dog Swarley because of himym.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** **You are all beautiful wonderful people.** I am a tad drunk.




Also, because I am a new here, I am going to do a quick introduction.  I am a new member of the [internship program](http://bit.ly/15O0xJw) and glad to be here, .  I have been on reddit for about a year and a half.  lizardsrock4 has been my username for most things because of my awesome [bearded dragon](http://i.imgur.com/uWcmAbQ.jpg)"

#/r/cars 

**91,511** Enthusiasts for **5 years!**

/r/cars is a subreddit about cars, unsurprisingly. 

When I first thought about /r/cars, I was expecting a subreddit full of [pictures of cool looking cars that I will never have](http://imgur.com/a/qbRkJ). I was pleasantly surprised (and a little intimidated, honestly) with the content I saw. While I definitely saw ""pictures of cool cars which I will never have""™, I also saw people asking for advice on what to fix up and what to buy, as well as people sharing experiences and moments with each other.

/r/cars has to have one of the coolest communities I've ever seen. Strangers bonding over 2 ton hunks of metal that have a machine that makes explosions inside them, *and look really good doing it*.

/r/cars is great for everyone. With a community ranging from your average Joe who likes to see souped up rides, to hardcore racing enthusiasts, it's no wonder the subreddit is a favorite of many. Personally, I sometimes can't go near /r/cars out of jealousy, and the knowledge that I will never own such magnificent feats of engineering.

I am the type of guy who just likes to look at cars. [This kind of stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1n9u6u/does_modifying_intake_or_exhaust_increase_power/) is not what I'm about.

    Title: Does modifying intake or exhaust increase power on modern cars that use a torque demand based engine management system?

    Words I understood: *cars*

So if any of you gearheads want to explain to me what the heck that all means, please please do.


**Now...all this talk of cars makes me wonder, what kind of car do you own, SRotD?**

^^Subaru ^^Master ^^Race

--------

Here is what the moderators of /r/cars had to say:

--------

&gt;##1. Tell me about yourself 

&gt;&gt; **/u/mikasaur**: Mikasaur, reddit user for 4 years, 10 months. Came here after I got a bit tired of digg.

&gt;&gt; **/u/verdegrrl**: I'm a gearhead from my first memories. Have worked in the auto industry for many years and have been part of internet mailing lists and forums since the early days.

&gt;##2. How did you find /r/cars?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur:** I don't really remember. I've always been interested in cars so /r/cars was one of the first subreddits I probably subscribed to. It had ~12k subscribers or so back then. If even.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl:** Trolling for a client.

&gt;##3. What is your favorite post?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur:** My favorite post? I probably don't have one. I have a favorite type of post. I like posts that are about industry news. I love finding out about a new model or new technology. It's even better when there's good discussion in the comments.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl:** There are so many great posts. It's impossible to mention a specific one. But I like posts that give insights into how and why certain engineering choices have been made.

&gt;##4. What car(s) do you own?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur** I own a 1999 BMW M3 Convertible.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl**  Do I have to list them all? A gaggle of V6 Alfa Romeos - both rwd and fwd. Some Ferraris, a Maserati, an Audi S4, VW R32, and random other stuff. And yes, we work on most of them.

&gt;##5. What is your IRL connection to cars?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur**  IRL I'm a member of the BMW Car Club of America. I try to participate in as many autocrosses as I can throughout the season, as well as track days and driving tours. I'm trying to get into LeMons racing as well and help out a local team on occasion.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl** We're long time members of the Alfa Club of Southern California. They hold track events and a very affordable driving school. Wonderful people. We also do private track days with various small groups (basically folks who keep their egos in check and are just there to have fun).

&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur** Come check out /r/cars. It's a community that has grown a TON in the past several years. That growth has come with some challenges but we've kept it an entertaining, informative, and civil place.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl** /r/cars has a great blend of experienced car experts and new drivers. The challenge is to not stifle input while encouraging a wide range of expression.

---------

So come and check it out :)

A note to SRotD:

Hiya! I'm one of the new interns, /u/allthefoxes. If you have any questions for me, AMAA! "

#/r/TropicalWeather

 **828** readers for **6 Months!**

Most people know of hurricanes. You know, the giant storms from hell which are basically a big middle finger from mother nature. They destroy entire towns, destroy peoples’ posessions, and devasate entire regions. Each year, these storms affect people all around the world. This is why /r/TropicalWeather was created. This great group of redditors help predict, track, and cover storms and their aftermath.

This subreddit benefits all types of people, from the casual guy sitting at home checking on the tropics, to the person living in Miami whilst a hurricane or other tropical system is headed their way. The people who contribute to this sub are awesome and helpful as well, be they casual posters, or experienced meteorologists (yes, they post to this sub!).

Now for something personal. I grew up in the south, more specifically SE North Carolina, and I plan to move to Miami when im older to work at the National Hurricane Center. I was born in the late 90’s so I don’t remember Hurricane Fran or Floyd. From family accounts, however, it was horrific. Trees blown down everywhere, farms and roads flooded under feet of water, all that fun stuff.  We lost a ton of stuff at my grandma’s house in Carolina Beach, NC. Thank god all the important stuff was in the actual house for this scenario. Ive been through numerous minor hurricanes, but nothing major that I have memory of. But, the founder of this subreddit does, which he will talk about in the Q&amp;amp;A.

 &gt;##1. Tell us a little about yourself!
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky_** I am a lifelong resident of the Gulf Coast in various locations in Louisiana. I was interested in tropical storms and hurricanes since I was only 4 years old. I remember sitting and watching the weather channel while most other kids sat and watched Saturday morning cartoons. When Andrew was forecast to hit my hometown, I told my parents and was the first one to let them know that we should evacuate. We lived on the coast at the time and I was learning some weather basics then, and saw that the center of the track went right over my home town. We boarded up and left. I remember the excitement that I felt then, and from then on loved weather in general, but especially Hurricanes and Tropical Storms. I've since grown to ""respect"" them with storms like Katrina and Gustav, but nothing will ever take away my awe for tracking and watching them.

 &gt;##2. How did you get involved in /r/TropicalWeather?
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky_** I have been a member of online forums for a long time that are dedicated to weather, specifically tropical weather. I started at storm2k.org, but also frequented the weather underground forums. Once I got more used to Reddit, I learned there was a subreddit for everything. Post-Hurricane Sandy, it became even more important that we have a central place to discuss tropical weather. So I typed in /r/tropicalweather, the first thing that came to mind, and noticed that this subreddit did not exist!
So I created it. I recruited mods from /r/weather, people who are very good at what they do and who have been tracking storms for a long time. There was a lot of excitement because a lot of other people had apparently been looking for the same thing, a centralized place to discuss tropical storms and hurricanes.
The subreddit is still in it's early days. I made it right before this tropical season, and for what it's worth, most forecasters would say that this past season was a tremendous bust. I advertised the subreddit on city/state subreddits when storms were heading there way, but there was an extreme lack of tropical activity this season, so the subreddit did not grow as much as it would have if we would have had a serious storm brewing. This is a good thing though, in my opinion, because it allowed us to come up with a solid user-base and add things like flair as well as find the best mods for the job so that we can be in full swing next hurricane season!

 &gt;##3. What's your favorite post so far?
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky_** Probably the posts leading up to Hurricane Karen's ""landfall. Hurricane Karen was only a Category 1, but for a lot of us who had absolutely nothing to track most of the season, we were excited for at least a little storm. For those who do not know about Hurricane categories, Cat 1 storms are as weak as Hurricanes come, but stronger than tropical storms. They are mostly just an excuse to take off work, although they can produce some dangerous conditions. As long as you are cautious, a Category 1 is nothing to worry about. Anyway... it summed up the season pretty well. It looked like it was heading right for my hometown, and then poof... just disappears before it has a chance to hit land.

 &gt;##4. What lesson have you learned from browsing / modding /r/TropicalWeather?
 &gt;&gt; **_supernovasky** It's been really fun to start a subreddit from scratch. I kind of wish we would have started a little earlier before the season started, but /r/tropicalweather is a challenging sub to keep going. This is always going to be the case when your subreddit is entirely based on something that is seasonal. There will always be a chunk of the year where absolutely no new tropical activity is going on, and so I like to post every now and then a ""post your favorite x"" type post to at least keep people coming back. However, once tropical season is on, a lot of cities link to our subreddit and people come to us for first hand information. Next tropical season, our subreddit will benefit from what was essentially a dry run this last tropical season. We look forward to having people join us next summer!

In conclusion, /r/TropicalWeather is hands down the best sub for everything pertaining to Tropical storms and hurricanes. Go subscribe to them, it will make the guys over at Tropical Weather and I happy.

Hey guys! I am imnotarapperok, but for short I'm going by supahot. I'm an intern, I'm from NC, and I love the outdoors and technology. I am an Eagle Scout as well. I enjoy sitting on reddit while listening to classic rock. Watch out, because I'm here to stay (hopefully)!"

**10,672** challengers for **7 months!**

Tired of posting oh-so-clever comments and receiving only a [reddit silver award in response?](http://gfycat.com/IdleCheerfulBuck) Do you have dreams of getting into /r/lounge to [party with the big boys,](http://gfycat.com/DisastrousConcreteErmine) but haven't yet made a post worthy enough to deserve reddit gold? Do you have time on your hands, and need a fun, rewarding avenue to challenge yourself and perhaps help out another redditor at the same time? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions then /r/goforgold is the [subreddit for you!](http://gfycat.com/DirectDimwittedCockerspaniel)

In this subreddit you can post a challenge (most often with a month of reddit gold as the reward for the top response) and redditors will try their very best to help you out, make a fool of themselves, or create incredible things for you in response. Even one reddit admin, /u/yishan, got in on the action with his post - [""Eat nothing but burritos for at least 2 weeks.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5t5r/eat_nothing_but_burritos_for_at_least_2_weeks/) 

Others get extraordinarily specific like /u/alasknfiredrgn who was giving out a year of reddit gold to [someone who could create-](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1vchcy/1_yr_of_gold_for_top_voted1_month_for_2nd_and_3rd/)

*""a Shopped, or original sketch, painting, watercolor, or drawing, suitable for framing in a 16x20 print, of Verne Troyer (Mini-Me), head back, chugging a 2 liter bottle of Mountain Dew in one hand while holding an Israel Military Industries matte black .50 caliber Desert Eagle (pistol) in the other hand pressed to the temple of boy-King Joffrey (Game of Thrones) on his knees pleading for life, one pale and scrawny hand pressed in capitulation against the superior force of Mini-Me's tan naked gun wielding sinewy fore-arm.*

*In the background Clancy Brown (Carnivàle, Brother Justin Crowe) wearing a wife-beater, looks on through vacant black demon eyes, arms crossed, standing next to a stoic Kim Jong-Un and Dennis Rodnam.""*


Yeah I have to stop right there and post some of the [magnificent](http://i.imgur.com/c5Qx8fM.png) [highlights](http://i.imgur.com/96mw37o.jpg) from [that](http://i.imgur.com/jLP6WL3.jpg) [last challenge.](http://i.imgur.com/1MkrWjK.gif) 

Did I mention that [Verne Troyer turned up](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1vchcy/1_yr_of_gold_for_top_voted1_month_for_2nd_and_3rd/cf9r61a) to that thread himself and [posted this image?](http://i.imgur.com/1py1bWG.jpg)

Or maybe you just want to post a weird challenge like /u/tomtomglove did when he asked redditors to [""Go to the bank, try to deposit 100 hot dogs.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/) ...And /u/Ice-Z actually did it, and [videotapped himself for your pleasure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/cbr2k8h)

I mean really, this sub has everything! If drawing or depositing hot dogs isn't your thing, then why not help /u/Garm_Bel_Iblis and his wife [choose which carpet to put in their new house](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/21kdch/carpet_my_living_room_virtually/), or sing a song [Shatner style and post it to youtube for two months of gold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/21sq31/sing_a_song_of_your_choice_shatner_style_2_months/) The possibilities are certainly endless, and so if you're waiting to get [your golden ticket](http://i.imgflip.com/r8l0.gif) then this sub is definitely one you should check out. Now, let's hear more about the sub from the mods themselves. 


&gt;##1. Tell us about yourselves! (interests, hopes and dreams, the kind of person you are, anything!)

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I'm an American female communications student at a Texas university. I'm not sure what I want to do, but I'm pretty sure that professional beer drinker is not going to happen.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:**  I am a 19 year old American (NJ) male computer science enthusiast. I don't plan on doing college - but consulting and attempting to start companies is going well so far as I live right next to an amazing budding startup community. I also like photography and taro coconut bubble tea. :3 If you, for some weird reason, want more info - I have an internet majig [here.](http://nick.sahler.co/)

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** I'm currently a student who is working hard to learn and gain experience with 3DCG. I aspire to eventually get a job working with 3d Art, preferably within video games.

&gt;##2. How did you get involved with /r/goforgold?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** /r/GoForGold originated from a thread on /r/CrazyIdeas which is another sub that I frequent. The thread took off and /u/reduced-fat-milk launched it and began asking about mods. So I asked if he needed help and that was that.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:**  Like /u/19thconservatory said - the idea originated in a thread on /r/CrazyIdeas. I liked the idea so much that I decided to start the sub and see where it went. I modded a few people who asked, and we started going. I'm extremely happy that the mods I picked ended up being pretty smart, reasonable and awesome :D

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** When /u/reduced-fat-milk made it , I sent a mod mail to him offering to help him as a mod on the subreddit, and he sent me a mod invite.

&gt;##3. What has been your favourite challenge so far? Your favourite reply to a challenge?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I don't know why, but I like the challenges that are ""eat/chug this [food] in [timeframe]."" The videos are pretty amusing.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** My favourite is either the [hotdog banker](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/) challenge or the [morning wood](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/20v6zi/challenge_gold_for_the_first_to_complete_the/) challenge. I also like the [""buy a hobo breakfast""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k68bl/invite_a_homeless_person_for_breakfast/) challenge, because there's nothing like the smell of philanthropy in the morning.

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1ydodj/gold_for_sharing_a_porno_to_your_facebook_wall/) is probably my favorite challenge so far. The top response is also obviously my favorite reply.

&gt;##4. Has modding for /r/goforgold for the past 7 months changed your own mindset in anyway?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I now read all of the rules in sidebars before posting to unfamiliar subreddits. (""Flair your posts!"" reminders happened way too often in the beginning.)

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** I don't think so. My mindset has changed from other things which changed how I moderate and look at/r/goforgold, but I don't think /r/goforgold has changed it itself.

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** Not really no. The way I moderate hasn't really changed and the way I use reddit has been unaffected by it.

&gt;##5. Is there anything else you want to add about /r/goforgold or the community there?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** Our subreddit relies on the honor system for rewarding users with gold, and I'm really pleased with how much our subscribers come through with sending gold.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** One is that I like the silly, ""challengy"" challenges more than the ""do me a favor/job"" challenges. They are more fun and creative and warrant more reward. If you make challenges like that, I'll try to gold you and/or give you special custom flair. Also what I said before - Fantastic mods :D



Thank you to the /r/goforgold mods for answering these questions! As one of the new /r/SubredditoftheDay interns, this has been the first subreddit that I have ever featured, so let me know what you think, and if you have any suggestions for the future.

**18,429 porn connoisseurs who really love it for the story; Watching diligently for 3 months**

I've been holding off this subreddit for multiple reasons. 

1. The intern who was actually supposed to feature this... quit. [(ofcourse)](http://i.imgur.com/9YrMYfY.gif)
2. This subreddit's subject matter isn't directly NSFW, but its loves to [live on that edge.](http://i.imgur.com/kZkZt1M.gif)
3. The whole month of April was booked up before today.
4. I really wanted this subreddit to [grow](http://i.imgur.com/hwakG8F.gif) on its own for a [little bit longer](http://i.imgur.com/zccRe8O.gif), that is before I released the ~~hounds~~ neckbeards on it.

[No more excuses](http://i.imgur.com/HYltZy4.gif) now. Its time to introduce this majestic [*Garden of Eden*](http://i.imgur.com/k7rLlpR.gif) to the masses.

But the proof is in the pudding as they say. And I don't mean the jello kind.

What do you get when a [professional grade karma generator](http://i.imgur.com/GhGyKpc.gif) learns how to make [high quality gifs](http://i.imgur.com/DnrSZik.jpg) and has a [hard on](http://i.imgur.com/IQBlg54.gif) for pornos? ~~/r/GfycatDepot~~ /r/SFWPornGifs.

As I mentioned above, an intern was originally assigned to feature this [amazing subreddit](http://i.imgur.com/fdQ0nS5.gif). This was my first [mistake.](http://i.imgur.com/qycIkof.gif) I forgot that even in our own ranks the intern success rate is only [10%](http://i.imgur.com/XwKlODv.gif) on a good batch. Unfortunately due to unforeseen issues, this intern had to step down. [Apparently he took his Q &amp;amp; A portion with him.](https://i.imgur.com/aWG5wLH.gif) So we'll have to make due with what we got. One of the mods of /r/SFWPornGifs was [nice enough](http://i.imgur.com/uGopqbF.gif) to screen cap everything. Below is that butchered remains of the Q &amp;amp; A. So...

&gt;be me


&gt;be 12 with a father who has been smoking weed on a regularly basis around me my entire life


&gt;get the 'talk' from my dad that weed is okay, other stuff isn't


&gt;eventually try weed when i was 16 at a festival


&gt;proceed to smoke a fuck tonne of weed throughout teens with all my friends


&gt;start college, start smoking every day cos i live with my dad now, i pick up for him


&gt;got put off it several times throughout the years by 'whiteying' or vomiting from low blood 
sugar/too high


&gt;still carried on cos i enjoyed it so much


&gt;be 17 with two jobs, doing well at college, getting high


&gt;incident with some crazy cunt who burgled me makes me move back to my mums


&gt;finish 2nd year of college at my mums, reunited with two bestfriends from school (who get high)


&gt;get high all the time, get top grade at college


&gt;go to uni with two best friends


&gt;spend next 3 years staying in our rooms getting high playing games on PC


&gt;procrastinate, barely get by with work, still manage to be fair successful and produce some great work but didnt get the desired grade


&gt;be this person that now who smokes first thing at morning, all day and last thing at night, who spends a fucking fortune on weed.


- i've squandered opportunities because of weed

- i've become a master at making excuses cos of weed

- i've pushed people away, even the people i live with cos of weed

- i've lied to my parents about my money situation because of weed

- i've failed a university module cos of weed

- i procrastinated client work as well as uni work cos of weed, even though it meant i could pay rent

- i've produced work way below my capability because of weed

- weed makes me content with doing nothing

- i have become a dopamine junkie, smoking weed whilst alternating between tv shows and various computer games and masturbating

- im really really good at painting, but i can't paint when im high

- im really really good at animation, and its like walking through treacle trying to get it done




Being high as you all know, gives you this comfortable haze to live in. Your worries and responsibilities disappear, you don't have to do them til tomorrow. Weed has started impacting my life in ways I could never imagine and I always said I wouldn't let it do that. I quit once before for 3 months before I went to intern in Dubai. Whilst I was there I was waking up at 6am instead of 4pm. I was going to the gym every morning instead of ruining my back in my PC chair for 18 hours. I was working in a job I really enjoyed. I could breathe and I could run 4k within 2 weeks of being there, after failing 100m before being out of breathe on my first go. I was clear headed, my mumbling stopped, I could REMEMBER things, I DREAMED the most amazing dreams that I still remember. I was me and I was alive.


Then I got back home, sat on my computer chair and called my dealer.


Weed has cost me an entire year and more of university maintenance loan I received. I am skinny because smoking weed/tobacco staves and suppresses hunger more than induces it. I know all these things about my relationship with weed for so long. But I've been putting it off because I surrendered to the fact that living with 2 guys in the same shitty house who both smoke as much weed as I do (and laugh that I consider myself addicted). 

I'm moving out in September to brighter pastures and I'm doing a Masters degree. I'm gunna do it fucking well and fucking sober. I'm done with being an addict and it's got to stop. I'm actually excited to feel normal again, instead of being a sluggish vacant pothead. 

I decided to give myself a head start and quit now before I move out. But I'm going to make this time count. It's just a simple matter of not buying weed (oh how easy it is to say yes) and a simple matter of not putting anything flammable in my mouth.

I feel like I lack a huge amount of self-control. I'm here for the amazing support I've seen on /r/leaves over the past year I've been reading it. I've always been here, waiting for my turn to quit. I figured I don't have to fucking wait. If you have read all this and you are thinking about quitting. Join me. This is it. Thanks for reading and wish me luck."

2bn96n,3,2014-07-24,22/M feel as though I'm at the end of my rope,theypromisedmeponies,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2bn96n/22m_feel_as_though_im_at_the_end_of_my_rope/,"When I was 13 I thought for the first time that I would like to die. It was winter, and I’ve always hated winter, it always makes me down. Especially that period I think of as “the doldrums”, right after New Years but before spring. 

I was, for the first time and the only time since, being bullied in school. It was all rather elementary I suppose, there were only eight boys in the class, and lately, some had decided that the ninth boy in the class, who recently moved away, was a loser or whatever and began to make fun of him, for being stupid, or “a faggot” or whatever insults happen to occur to 13 year old kids. 
It was a victimless crime I suppose since the kid in question wasn’t around to hear any of the things being said. Then making fun of someone who wasn’t there got old, and the sights were turned on me. I was gay, and if anyone would ever fart in class it was blamed on me for no particular reason. It made me quite depressed. 

Being proud, I never mentioned it at home and earlier that fall, my parents had decided that we were moving out of the neighborhood where I had grown up and off into the country. 
The combination of these three things, combined with the fact that I was quite fat and very aware of it, made me really think that I’d like to kill myself. 

The bullying stopped in the spring (all bad things have always seemed to stop in the spring for me) and suddenly I had friends again, while some other poor boy became the object of harassment. 
Things got better for a while, until we moved, which is a different story altogether. 
But now sitting here, at 22, unemployed, once again slightly out of shape, without friends and prospects of a better life I can honestly say I wish I had killed myself in 2005. 

Since graduation, and indeed, for a very long time before, I sent filled out countless applications and sent out countless resumes. I want to guess that since graduation I’ve applied for at least 50 positions. 

50 jobs, and for none of them was I a suitable candidate. 

I went to a school you would probably not know the name of based mainly on affordability and still managed to rack up somewhere in the neighborhood of $60,000 of student debt, about 2/3 of that in private loans. 
I was accepted to, and therefore completed no internship.
It has to be admitted of course, that for the latter part of high school, with the exception of intermittent girl problems, I was very happy. I was in shape, I got good grades, I got accepted to some fine universities (which I did not attend due to the cost). I was good looking, smart and popular. 
The first year of college was even better since I discovered alcohol (my bottled fortitude until recently) and found a great circle of friends. 
Then, depression caught up with me, the knowledge of how screwed I was coming out of college never left me alone, nor did the knowledge of my ever increasing debt. 

I have never owned a car and never made much money during the summer, and couldn’t work during school without transportation. The frustration was maddening. 

Now, my self-esteem is at what I suppose is a 9 year low. Filling out job applications that will never be looked at, for positions I can’t even imagine anyone being that eager to fill is soul crushing in the extreme. My prospects of finding a job in the next three months isn’t any better than my prospects were in the last three months. 

Soon I guess I’ll have to get a part time position, hopefully one that pays enough to pay my monthly loan payments. It may be possible since I’m living with my parents, although that means I can’t even indulge in a cigarette and a drink if I wanted.   
Looking at myself, I see very little difference between me and the 14 year old who wanted to die in 2005. The difference I suppose is that the 14 year old had the option to do so. 

I’ve had my father cosign every private loan I’ve ever taken out and my death would ruin him financially (I believe he resents me strongly for it). 
I am a huge failure and can see no way things are likely to get better anytime soon. 

I don’t want to play video games, read or listen to music. I can’t imagine feeling joy from any of these things. I’ve felt like this occasionally over the last few years, but never this deep desolate feeling. It’s like I can’t even imagine what I would want to do, even if given the choice to do anything. 

It’s not as though I can even say “I wish I had a free vacation to the Bahamas” or “I wish I had concert tickets” because honestly I don’t feel the desire to do anything like this. 

**It’s as though I’m a ghost floating along, feeling indifferent to everyone and everything. It’s like I suddenly realize that I’ve been standing above a bottomless pit my entire life, and like a cartoon character whose run off a cliff, suddenly perceived it and fallen in.** 

I’ve always felt way worse in the winter than in the spring, but if things aren’t any good in July, when will they be good?

Unfortunately I have no portfolio because the only project I've worked on that wasn't under NDA is technically complete but not being deployed yet for dumb corporate reasons. I have a couple of decent references. 

I'd be thrilled with a junior web dev position or even an internship. Something that would allow me to make use of my skills while being honest about the fact that I'm not an expert developer yet, but I desperately want to become one.

2bnluf,2,2014-07-24,My credit score dropped 50 points sometime in the last month and I need help,ofeverygreatcity,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2bnluf/my_credit_score_dropped_50_points_sometime_in_the/,"First, let me provide some background. I am 21 and just started a new internship this summer. Towards the end of June, I decided to apply for my first credit card, a Chase Freedom card. The intent was to pay for gas, food, and anything else that I had funds for since I am making $2,000+/month. I was approved for the card with a credit line of $1,000.

  
Going back in time a bit, Credit Karma told me in April that my TransUnion credit score was 650. I assumed my credit score would decrease maybe 5 points so I never bothered to review my score again until today. Credit Karma now tells me my score is roughly 600 points. I do some research and see that it may be my credit card utilization which is at 61%. I did several days of research on credit cards before applying to obtain one and never saw any mention of what percentage I should remain below. I thought as long as I paid it all off before the due date that I would be fine.  


I was recommended to call Lexington Law for a free credit consultation so I did and their operator told me that I had 5 or 6 hard inquiries, but no other details about them. I declined paying any fees for service. After filing for my TransUnion annual credit report, the only hard inquiry I see is from the end of June when I applied for my credit card. Everything else is in good standing, so I believe Lexington Law's claim that I had five or six hard inquiries was merely a sales tactic.  


I have just submitted a payment to lower my utilization and plan on calling Chase tomorrow to find out more. The sole purpose of getting a credit card was to increase my credit score, that's it.  


Can having a high utilization really affect my credit score by so many points and if I were to pay it off without being late would my score go back to normal?  


I now know to keep my balance below 35%, but I would greatly appreciate any advice.  Thanks."

Ok, so I am going to be a Junior in High School this year and I have already decided that working at Riot Games would be my dream job. Although I still have 4 years before I can even apply for the internship program, I know that going through it will help in my quest to get a job at Riot Games. I enjoy coding and programming, but I have only two years experience with it. Also, the only major language I know is plain old Java. Now, here are the two questions I have:
1. What languages would be beneficial for me to learn?
2. What are some things I could do within these 4 years that would help make my application to the internship program stand out?
If anyone has any ideas, Riot or not, I would appreciate your answer!

2bnmx3,0,2014-07-24,Understanding girls better. What does it mean for a girl to share numbers?,Marcus_Augustus,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/2bnmx3/understanding_girls_better_what_does_it_mean_for/,"I, XY 23, ask you for your selfless advice.

Growing up with 3 girls (2 sisters and Mom,) I've always felt that I have a feminine part to my nature, not sexually but as a persona.  I'm straight and don't come off girly, but I do feel like I can relate to girls more than an average person.  I always thought that I could understand girls as I do make better friends with XX'ers than XY'ers, and girls seem comfortable talking to me.  But at the same time I know that people can come of creepy without realizing it, and thus any advice is highly appreciated.

Story:

Yesterday, my aunt called me up and she was a bit furious at me for some stuff. She demanded I see her right after my work to fix it, I agreed to do so.

I've been feeling sad/strange for a few days. Lot of lay-offs happening at my company, my internship's ending, starting my penultimate university year soon, miss my family ...
I didn't wanna go to my aunt, but I forced myself to go anyway.  So, instead of biking home, I got on this bus to the mall my aunt wanted me to meet at.

With the bus stuck in traffic and moving slow, I could picture my aunt fretting over me being late.
Bored as hell, I glanced over to what this passenger sitting next to me was reading. It was a familiar manga.  At this point the only thing I could tell about the passenger was that she's a young lady.

I've always wondered whether talking to random strangers was okay or not.  There have been many times when I could have gotten to know new people but I shied away, and felt a little regret afterwards(? I dunno :/ .)

This time though, it felt like I needed to step out of my comfort zone.  It felt like a decent time, stuck in traffic she was reading a manga I liked (I've read it.)

I am an introvert, and it's unnervingly heavy for me to gather myself to initiate a conversation with a stranger (especially if they're a girl.)  I'd probably only done so once in my life. This was wayyy out of my comfort zone.

I gathered the courage and said ""Is that &lt;manga-name&gt; you're reading?"" to which she pleasantly smiled and replied and talked on about it.  It felt like it was an invitation to continue talking, so we did. It was a fun little conversation and it turned out we shared many common interests.
I did most of the listening (60:40), so it was easier for me. We chatted for about 15-20 minutes, and then it was my stop.
I suddenly realized it was my stop and I dunno what I said at that point but I think it roughly meant ""Could I please get your number?"".
So she got off as well, saved my name/number and texted me a hello and asked me if I received it, I told her that I did and we bid farewell.
I still haven't replied to her text. :/

I don't know what to do now...  She's about my age, but she's in a relationship, and I'm not a jerk so I know I should not pursue her.

My ex and I broke up a year ago. Thus honestly, I know I am prone to being infatuated now.  But I still would want to talk to her again.

Thing is, I've never asked a stranger for their number like this before, that's why I don't know what and when should I text her...

It's been ~24 hours since we exchanged numbers.  And the last thing I'd want is to come off creepy.

I have a few questions:-

* Is it okay to invite her to my b'day dinner with my friends, it's in 10ish days?

* When should I text her? Should I simply wait till I have a get-together/karaoke thing coming up and invite her?

* What does it mean for a girl to give a guy her number?


Thank you very much for your time.


tl;dr - I met this girl on the bus, she has a bf. We exchanged numbers and I don't know what to do now."
2bnplb,0,2014-07-24,"Me[21M] dated [21F] for about 3 months, then I left for an internship. It is almost time to come back.",throwaway0368,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bnplb/me21m_dated_21f_for_about_3_months_then_i_left/,"Hey guys, so I dated this girl about 6 months ago but because of our schedules, we didnt really get to continue what we had going. To top it off, I had an internship in NY (We both go to school in Austin,TX) over the summer. I get back August 5th. Throughout the summer, we talked here and there, not too much. 

I would be lying if I said I didnt think about her the entire summer that I have been gone. We talked on the phone one day about a month ago, and we talked about a few things and I ended up telling her I miss her. She replied with the obvious I miss you too, but I couldnt tell if that was just in a friendly way or not. 

Well Last night we were texting a bit (I havent heard from her in about a week) and she told me she misses me. Once again I cant tell if its just a I miss my friend thing or not. But I replied that I missed her as well. We talked a little more but for the past few days, I just have these butterflies in my stomach. Two weeks is still a long time away. We did make plans to see each other when I get back (nothing is set in stone yet) but I just want to fucking give her the biggest hug and kiss I can attempt. 

The problem? I dont want to work myself up for this and then we end up not even seeing each other. Or I dont even know if she still likes me. Yes she told me she misses me, yes we made some plan to hang out, but these are things I do with my other female friends as well, and those relationships are strictly platonic. 


I really have no idea what to do until that day. I feel like I am going to do/say something stupid and mess it up.

**tl;dr**: I left for an internship, 3 months later I still can not get this girl out of my head."

2bnr0r,42,2014-07-24,I want to quit. Being an ambitious woman from a conservative Muslim background sucks.,throwaway91000,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2bnr0r/i_want_to_quit_being_an_ambitious_woman_from_a/,"I really need to vent and if anyone could offer me any advice, I’d be grateful. I come from a conservative Muslim background, my family lives in the States. Women in our family typically get married as soon as they complete their education and, from my observation, basically live off of their husbands, rarely leave the house, and essentially do whatever their husbands’ request of them. I was weary of this since I hit 12 and visited my parents’ homeland, I hated how women were treated and yet the women were made to think that they were taken care of and protected and that it was okay not knowing anything outside of your parents’ and husband’s homes. I vowed I would never live a life like that. I don’t want to live in a cage. 

Consequently, I worked hard in school and acquired a full scholarship to a private college. I wanted to be a lawyer at that point and studied International Relations and Political Science. However, my goal changed as my kickass feminist advisor encouraged me to push boundaries with my parents and take advantage of my scholarship to travel and intern abroad and in other states (I was living at home while attending school because even living away from home was considered bad). Hence, after struggling and begging, I was finally free, saw the world, and questioned everything I had been raised with. As a result, my career goal shifted to working with the UN someday to educate girls and utilize microfinance projects to alleviate poverty or even becoming a Diplomat. I graduated with top honors, travel experiences, and several volunteer and internship experiences combating international poverty &amp; human trafficking. During my spring semester of senior year, I was accepted to a top program in foreign affairs for international finance, this school has produced the most amount of ambassadors and World Bank/IMF employees. I was essentially riding high until I was not granted any funding and would have ended up in boat loads of debt. Upon speaking with the school, they suggested I take a year off and acquire more work experience. 

I took this year off and ended up risking homelessness in order to intern at an Embassy…it worked out somehow. I received interviews, but not even retail or customer service jobs came through. Being unemployed, educated, and seeking financial independence to not deal with cultural expectations, I ended up in a full on depression…I felt trapped. Especially since everyone kept asking me and telling me to get married because it’s my job and duty as a woman (ugh). I think my parents realized I had grown wings and that working outside of the state would be bad. They guilt tripped me into passing up a job that paid well, but was outside of the state, again, full on depression. I also have had health problems which include chronic bodily pain and the pain tends to increase with emotional stress.  At this point, I was in hell and the fights with my parents were ridiculous. Not to mention, other girls within our ""Muslim community"" talked smack about me spreading rumors about what I might've told my parents to get them to let me leave/explore.

Women aren’t encouraged to pursue careers; you get married and have kids. You’re considered a minor your entire life. My cousins who have gotten married were not permitted to talk to their husbands or meet with them in private. My family is PRETTY conservative, so to have broken tradition and accomplished everything I have thus far took an immense amount of energy and fight. I basically spent the entire year applying for all the fellowships in my field (received none), being broke, depressed, sick, and yelling and screaming until April when I was selected as one of 40 people nationally to be interviewed by a US Dept of State (which Hillary Clinton once headed) for a $90K fellowship and five year contract. 20 people were given the fellowship in total, I was selected as an alternate fellow in the case that someone fails security clearance. I thought I would take another year off and reapply for the fellowship as I had already secured an opportunity to work in South America with an awesome NGO, it did not pay, but food and shelter were guaranteed. I ended up not taking it because of health problems. 

Now, my family is willing to put all of their savings in to help me partially with grad school. I’d be guaranteed a job 98% upon graduation and could clear my debt within a year, but I’m sure they’ll want me to marry ASAP. I am grateful for their support finally, but don’t know what to do. My family has never had much, I feel selfish and I feel as though just getting married now and doing what they want now would be easier. I’m not as religious anymore either (which is also really bad), but my parents still think I am. Hence, I’m certain the person they pick will be someone I’ll detest due to their conservativeness/religious bossiness. My parents wouldn’t force anything, but the all powerful guilt trip will work on me. They’ve sacrificed a lot for us and my parents came from absolute poverty. Because I’ve been a financial burden (health) in the past and because my father just retired, I know my family isn’t doing so great financially. I want to follow my passions and help girls like myself in the developing world, but I also just want a job to take care of my family financially without having to marry someone I do not choose.  It seems hopeless because I can’t even get a regular job or min. wage job right now. I'm tired of working for free. If I take all of the loans out myself for my dream school/job, the interest rates are so high that I will never be able to pay them off. I feel trapped and it seems like I’m destined to struggle financially. I’m a burden; I just want to put myself out of this misery. My family could also disown me if I find someone to marry myself in the near future, but I can't because I'm not financially independent. I also have acquaintances that are so well off that they are educated, healthy, and everything else, but risk it all by partaking in high-end drugs. This world never makes sense.

TD; LR: Too ambitious woman from Muslim background and can’t find job to escape cultural expectations. Got into awesome grad program a year ago, I can take all of my parents $ and be more of financial burden and then marry someone they choose for me or take out loans @ high interest that I can never pay back and try to be independent financially while escaping cultural expectations because I'm a feminist. I also have siblings I’m trying to be a role model for so I can't jeopardize their futures by taking my parents $.

*EDIT: My post was posted into another discussion and I just want to point out that I am not at all privileged. My parents are not rich, I do not come from privilege. It may seem that way since they've offered to help. Again, you do not know what they are sacrificing/what they are doing/where they are borrowing from or what they are selling just to lend me the $. Their savings aren't actual savings. Also whatever they lend is not enough to cover tuition, I will still be borrowing around $70,000 at high interest from the government. To clarify, my father has been unemployed for about 4 years now, is about to file bankruptcy, my mother is disabled, and my family will be surviving on his social security  ($600 a week...family of five...do the math). I've accomplished what I have thus far because I got a full scholarship for undergraduate studies + stipend. Not because ""mommy and daddy"" helped me so I am immensely grateful for their support now, but it kills me to take money from them knowing how they will be acquiring the money. I didn't want to provide further financial details to seem like I'm complaining. Please don't assume and judge. The depression roots from poverty, not privilege. I will be taking out the full amount myself at this point because I'm terrified of unexpected emergencies.

#EDIT: I did get a job after months of trying (10 months), but I had a complete breakdown after a family fight when I did actually stand up for myself and being told no to every goal I've ever had. I can't even repeat the things that were said. And then the following days were spent in breakdown mode. So I missed my train (literally) and the opportunity was gone. It was completely my fault, but I can't say I didn't try.

 The second opportunity I passed was working in South America, most specifically Colombia, which would've started August 1st so next week. I would've been in a rural village with very limited healthcare. I don't have insurance now and wriggle around in pain all night. I've had procedures done and was on meds when I did have health insurance via undergrad. I did not want to cause any problems for my boss (as he had warned about the inconvenience of unnecessary problems ahead of time) at the NGO or the family I'd be staying with. I did speak with my parents about this and they actually supported the idea after I did in fact stand up to them. Me passing this was purely due to health concerns.

*Update: Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this and for your responses/support. I will be taking out the entire loan myself and will basically try to get work at a private organization, pay off my loans, and follow my dreams where-ever they may take me. I wish you all the best and loads of health and happiness. Take care please."
2bo68d,0,2014-07-25,Help Needed! My First Resume! Please Critique...,Confused_Sys_Admin,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2bo68d/help_needed_my_first_resume_please_critique/,"Hi Guys
It's my first time writing a resume and i would really appreciate it if someone could take a look at it and help me polish it up a bit!
a little background about me: I started out as an intern at a small IT consultancy business and stayed there for 5 years. during my time there business went from small to getting huge accounts and big projects.
I went from intern to junior consultant to lead consultant pretty quickly because i delivered on their projects and although i'm pretty young(25), have never let my bosses down. 
So this is the first time that i had write a resume and i can really use some help.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8kAbMLOw96cURsNmNlUVhaMGs/edit?usp=sharing
Thanks guys!

Edit: Here's a couple of projects that i had. hope someone can tell me how to use it in my resume.
* Monitoring 500 Servers and 250 Network Devices using SCOM. it used SQL failover clustering, different permissions for about 15 admin and included tons of dashboards, servers Os ranged from windows servers, Oracle, Redhat and... . also monitoring Exchange and Vmware and differen web and sql servers. (i've had about 10 different projects about the same size or a bit smaller again using SCOM 2007 and 2012).
I have no idea how to mention this in the resume.

* DPM disaster recovery, kinda simple 200 servers, had SQL, SharePoint other good stuff. actual disaster recovery experience (definitely not fun!) (I've had about 5 of this type of project)

* I'm support for about 10 AD Domains right now. they all have dedicated admins but if they can't make something work they escalate it to me.  (Again have no idea how to translate this to a good point on a resume_

* SCCM for 3 different projects for about 500 clients. (it's not huge but it's something i guess?) including almost all it's features.

*Exchange 2010 : 2 migrations from 2003 to 2010. one for 5500 users one for about 1000. also designed 5 from scratch and currently support them. (they have dedicated admins but problems get escalated to me)

That's all I've been doing the last 5 years. add a couple of VMWare support cases. all my career my job has been problem solving. someone would mess up... they come to us an we solve it for them so i had to get up to speed on different technologies in a hurry and be ready for when shit hits the fan!
Now that i want to move on to a different company i have no idea how to make good resume from this.

again would appreciate a couple of examples on how to make this look good on a resume!

2bo81g,7,2014-07-25,Starting AI Late (Rising Junior): Steps to Get Into the Field?,justgivingsomeadvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bo81g/starting_ai_late_rising_junior_steps_to_get_into/,"As the title states, I'm a rising junior at UCSD. I'm doing a web dev/SAAS/business internship thing for my dad this summer, and I'm realizing I'm not really into software engineering/development. I like coding, I like coming up with solutions, both of which I'm doing. But too much of the focus seems to be on learning frameworks. Mobile programming is a bit better in this regard, but it's still not quite my style.

I've always been really mathematically oriented, I love the theory behind computer science, I love statistics (math minor in this field), I love learning, and I want to be on the cutting edge of technology (that's what drew me into CS in the first place!). So for me, AI seems like a natural fit. Unfortunately, like I said, I'm a rising junior, which means I'm getting in the game late for research. (I've done some research work but for completely unrelated stuff, and it's not much). Also, I haven't actually taken any AI courses yet (taking them this coming year), so the possibility is there that I don't like the field (I doubt it, though).

Basically, my question is twofold. First of all, are there any resources online that people recommend checking out to get my feet wet? I'm looking for something that would be good for people with a good understanding of CS and math (so, not too slow-paced) but also for someone fairly new to the field. I've already emailed a professor about doing research, but I would like to have a decent understanding of the field, key theories, what it entails, as well as some understanding of programming principles. That way, when the school year starts, I can make serious contributions and try to get my name on some publications.

Secondly, should I spend the Summer of 2015 doing an internship or just doing research? Ideally I want to get into a top program (e.g. Stanford, MIT), and I know that means I need to do a lot more in terms of research. So it makes sense to do research.^1 On the other hand, I do have an interview with Microsoft in September about a regular SDE internship for 2015, and I know that's usually the type of internship you should take.

Thank you for your input! I'm happy to hear about anyone with relevant information, but especially I'd love to hear from

^1 I should add that UCSD has a 5-year MS/BS program, so basically if I do one more year at UCSD, I can graduate with a Masters. It might make sense for me to do that, specializing in AI, and spending that extra year to get the sort of publications they need. On the other hand, UCSD's AI program is not nearly as good as the rest of the CS department, so that might hurt me in applications since I don't know if there are any big names in the field, which I hear helps your application.

Bonus Question: Would graduate schools care if I took my math minor's statistic courses pass/no pass? You can do that at UCSD, and that was my plan originally since I have a heavy courseload this coming year. They're relevant to the field, but if I take some grad-level AI courses and got good grades, and I had a lot of research would it matter? My GPA is pretty good (3.9) but it's probably right at the threshold for acceptable GPAs for top grad schools. Thanks!"
2bo8p8,7,2014-07-25,Advice needed on shame and going back to college from medical leave(19f),extremelyscared,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2bo8p8/advice_needed_on_shame_and_going_back_to_college/,"I feel like I'm at a crossroads now and need advice before it turns into a dead end. I took a medical leave from university last year and am scheduled to back back next month, however as it's getting closer I'm getting afraid that I'll have the same problems I had before + more. The background isn't strictly necessary so you can skip it if you want since this is already a wall of text.

Background: Last year was supposed to be my freshman year at a large university majoring in engineering, however I ended up going home on medical leave for anxiety and depression after about a month and a half. It seemed to start out fine; I was rooming with a good friend from high school, in the honors program, and quickly gained a small group of friends in my dorm during the welcome week. However once classes started, I became incredibly overwhelmed and stressed. I was immediately intimidated by the ""quick"" students in my honors classes(orgo and calc 3). I am extremely perfectionistic, so I am already really slow at learning as I compusively can't move on from something if I don't understand it completely. This resulted in me getting extremely behind as the material was so difficult I didn't have time to keep up while learning to ""completion"". I got somewhat depressed, however I still forced myself to attend all my classes(and even all the office hours). My real downfall my depression caused problems with my roommate which greatly compounded the depression. She would yell at me for crying in the dorm room ect. which was especially upsetting bc she was an old friend, and the dorm room became an unsafe place even as I needed a retreat more and more. Long story short this led to a breakdown and me taking a medical leave.
End background.

I am extremely scared because I am worried that going back is going to be a repeat except on a harder difficulty level. For one thing, it's been almost a year since I've done intensive studying and my general knowledge and mental stamina is much lower than when I just graduated high school. I also won't have welcome week to meet people or someone I already know, and making friends is extremely difficult for me. 

My biggest problem is the shame. I haven't had a conversation with a friend all year. A couple of good friends have tried to contact me(I had few to start with), but I feel so embarrassed that I haven't replied. Also the old roomate is in the same circle as my high school friends, and I basically don't want to see her ever again. I have a hard time even attending extended family gatherings because I'm so embarrassed(and I know I shouldn't feel that way in that situation because 3 of my cousins also had to take medical leaves in college for mental health). I'm worried about even how I will introduce myself to people. The first thing someone asks you is what year you are, however I feel like whatever I say will be a lie. I don't really feel like a freshmen because I won't be doing any of the orientation/welcome week stuff and based on some things it would be obvious too others too that it's not my first time around, however I'm too embarrassed to explain my situation to anyone. I'm also really afraid of going to clubs alone. Realistically, I think this will probably result in me avoiding interacting with people completely, which I might be okay with, however I am worried being isolated will negatively affect my academics(they basically said in my classes that study groups were pretty much integral to passing later engineering classes), and job prospects if I am not able to participate in extracurriculars. I also have no idea how I would explain the time I've taken off and the Ws on my transcript when going to interviews at career fairs, applying for research and internships ect.

This all makes me extremely anxious. I am supposed to be studying calculus and physics on my own this summer to prepare myself, however when I try to do it it makes me so anxious and upset that I have to stop. Thinking about the university makes me really upset in general(I can't even look at my college shirts). I have such negativity associated with this university that I wish I could go to another, however I have large scholarships for this college so I'm limited. My parents are pretty understanding, however if I went somewhere without the scholarships they would have to take another mortgage on the house, and I would feel guilty especially considering the likelihood I could fail equally somewhere else. I also know that the longer I stay at home the greater my shame will be and the harder it will be to go back. However, when I think about going back to school, increasingly the only thought that makes me feel better is 'at least on campus there's a bridge over the Mississippi River'. I really don't know what to do and am afraid I might actually end up killing myself as if I can't make this work it seems like the best option. I would appreciate any advice on what to do, and how to deal with the embarrassment in ways other than complete avoidance."

And that issue is, we shouldn't allow health care and health concerns to be ""gendered"".  

Also, being MRM shouldn't just be about pushing back against misandry. It should also be about thinking about maleness as an aspect of your identity, and how maleness is defined by society as well as one's personal definition of maleness.

There is a stereotype that when men have a medical problem, they tend to keep it to themselves until it becomes very serious...I don't know how true it is, and I don't know if it is self-inflicted behavior or instead something that society subconsciously pressures men into doing. 

There is no relationship between strength and health. But people often get the two of them confused. Yes, people who are fit and can bench press a significant amount of weight tend not to experience certain diseases. But people who are in extremely good health otherwise can also experience cancer, heart disease, and a wide variety of other catastrophic medical conditions. Bruce Lee, who was one of the fittest and healthiest people on the planet, died from an accidental drug overdose/mixture of two prescription drugs. 

Just because you are a strong male with good physical fitness doesn't mean something can't happen to you. This is an attitude all men should adopt, and one that men should **force** the rest of society to recognize. That means if you should a) take responsibility for your health and take care of your body, and b) if you feel something is seriously wrong, you go in to the doctor, INSIST you be checked out thoroughly, regardless of whomever at the hospital thinks you're acting like a 'sissy' or a 'hypocondriac'. 

When I was 27, I got out of the shower one morning and as I was drying myself off, I felt a hard lump directly under my right nipple. It was about the size, shape and hardness of a lima bean or a kidney bean. I immediately went to my local family medicine clinic. I explained the situation to a 25 year-old female intern, who treated me skeptically at first, but after examining me decided to refer me to an oncologist. I think she probably did so out of inexperience, but I appreciated the fact that she behaved professionally and took me seriously.

The oncologist was a male in his 50s. After interviewing me and reading the intern's chart, he looked at me skeptically as well, but I remember how quickly his face changed once he started palpitating my chest himself. He didn't say as much, but I could tell by the look on his face he recognized he was wrong to doubt either me or the intern. He scheduled me for an immediate biopsy; fortunately it didn't turn out to be breast cancer (which DOES occur among males, although very rarely), but I was right to push the system and get to the bottom of the situation. 

My point is, health care and health care concerns shouldn't be gendered. And MRAs should not let anyone ""gender"" any health care concerns they personally might have. If you are concerned about something and you go in to see a doctor/nurse and they don't take you seriously, MAKE them do so. REMIND them of why they are here and that you expect them to act like professionals. Remind them you are well within your rights to ask to be treated by a male health care professional, if you feel they are not taking you seriously. And let them know, out loud, your reasons.

2bowo9,172,2014-07-25,They hunger,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bowo9/they_hunger/,"In 1994 Kevin Carter took a photograph that would win him the Pulitzer Prize. It depicts a small girl, a toddler in Sudan. She was struggling to reach a food distribution point and suffering from severe starvation. As she lay on the ground a large vulture landed on the ground behind her. The only thing that I can say about the young girl is that whether or not she survived is unknown. Carter took his own life that same year.

That was the photograph that got me interested in photography. I dedicated the next two decades of my life to capturing the images that defined life on Earth. I’m currently employed as a photojournalist for a small company that subs out the photos to larger magazine and online corporations. We go into the places where big names can’t. My old boss started the company back in the 1960’s and it’s been family owned ever since. He started his career following Soviet tank crews in WWII and diving into the jungles of Korea and Vietnam and had always said that he’d either retire at ninety or die doing the job he loves. I thought I’d do the same thing, until very recently. 

It started years ago. In 2001 we were given a contract with a larger company in need of photographs of the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo during the Second Congo War. The region was rife with conflict, and pictures coming out of the region were all propaganda. Everyone knew that atrocities were being committed, but no one knew to what extent. We were provided with a driver and a guide for our group. The driver was a local man and the guide was a Congolese woman of incredible beauty. I was a little worried at first; women in the DRC are frequently treated as second class citizens, and, especially in war zones they aren’t generally welcome among the DRC soldiers. Our guide wore the military garb of a DRC soldier, but did not carry a weapon. She claimed to be neutral in the conflict, despite her outfit, and told us that her name was “Aleeth.”

We flew into a small outpost just north of the DRC and headed south in a black Jeep that had seen far better days…possibly prior to 1950. After crossing a small wooden bridge we were immediately stopped by a group of at least ten or twelve haggard looking guards with assault rifles. They were a group of local militia and it appeared as though it’d been some time since their last proper meal. After talking to our driver for a few minutes they brutally dragged him from the vehicle and forced him to kneel in a ditch with his hands behind his head. As we all waited for the execution to take place Aleeth abruptly broke the silence by saying “cɔl. Ne la.” I understood very little of that; I know the Dinka language just about well enough to ask for a bathroom. At that exact moment the guards fired a barrage of rounds into the ground directly next to the poor man’s head causing my entire crew to jump at the noise. He staggered back to the Jeep with blood slowly trickling down from his right ear. I couldn’t tell if it was an injury from the noise or from a ricochet of debris, but as soon as he was able he pushed the old jeep to its absolute limit and left the small camp in the distance. 

Aleeth explained to us that our driver was from an opposing village that supported the opposing political party; the Rally for Congolese Democracy. Apparently he had denied having ties with them but they planned on executing him nonetheless. Our guide had an unusual amount of authority for a female in a largely male dominated country, and I hadn’t seen anyone refuse a single order handed down by her to this point.

We traveled to a large temporary village that was home to some twenty thousand people. They had been relocated from their homes due to the fact that some of the men had joined the rebellion. The DRC soldiers then rounded them up, man, woman, and child, and marched them miles from the places they called home, and forced them to live in squalor beside a small, very dirty, stream. The water was, simply put, toxic. No one could safely ingest it without becoming violently ill, and the land was of incredibly poor soil that could barely sustain even the hardiest of crops. 

Every few days the DRC soldiers would come and raid the village. It wasn’t pretty. They would “cull” the population as they called it. It usually happened first thing in the morning; there’d be some screaming, occasionally the sounds of a fight, and then the inevitable barrage of gunfire. The survivors were left to dispose of the dead either in the stream, which was about 4’ deep in places and swift enough to carry a corpse away, or in the mass graves…which were filling up rapidly and not just from the culling.

Food was more than scarce; any villager who got his or her hands on food usually didn’t last long; the DRC soldiers would usually kill them off to feed their own ranks or fighting would erupt between warring villages over who controlled the food. Either way the guards usually became involved and ended things quickly and brutally. Over the course of a few days I saw a small sickly looking dog wander into the village, and then I saw his bones picked clean less than twelve hours later, and finally I saw the bodies of some of the people who’d eaten him floating downstream.

At this point I realized that the satellite phone we’d been loaned had stopped transmitting. I’m not overly familiar with them, but it had essentially lost its signal due to a mechanical failure of some sorts. As we were, more or less, treated with some version of immunity by the DRC soldiers, my travelling companions were mostly unconcerned until a group of DRC soldiers raided the village in a spot right next to where we’d set up camp. More than one stray bullet tore through our tents and one of our interns took some shrapnel to the arm. Our medic stitched him up, but at that point we had to make a decision to move or stay put.

I spoke with Aleeth and she apologized for the soldiers. “They’re just doing as commanded; they can’t disobey his orders,” she said as-a-matter-of-fact, “even worse is that I have no power over those soldiers. They don’t have to listen to me if they don’t want to.” I didn’t really understand; why did she have power over any soldiers? At this point I began to wonder exactly who this woman was, and why she’d been hired to be our guide. We were slated to be in the camp for another month and she managed to convince us to stay where we were as moving our small camp to the outskirts of the village only put us at greater risk.

I finally was able to send a letter to the company that hired us to take pictures. They’d wanted documentation over the course of six weeks, and we were two weeks in when we were shot at. I told the details of the journey in and explained our current situation. They paid us half of our contract fee up front so I sent them a few photos of the miserable living conditions that spread across the countryside. I asked them if they had any sections they specifically wanted us to visit, or any other special requests, mentioned that our satellite phone was currently inoperable, and lastly, I asked them about our guide. All I had was her first name, Aleeth, and nothing else to go on. It was a very offhanded mention at the bottom of a long letter. I assumed they’d get back to us within a week.

A few nights later I was developing some film, yes we did actually use film still back in 2001, when I heard a shout come from our main tent. It was one of my camera techs who had nearly as much experience as I. I ran to see what was happening and I saw an incredibly large DRC soldier, at least six and a half feet tall, holding him against a pole by his neck. In his other hand he wielded a machete. The camera tech was a pretty big guy himself, but next to the DRC soldier he looked insignificant to say the least. A crowd of fifty or so villagers had gathered around to watch. They looked thin and sickly, and almost as if they were entranced by the entire situation. I didn’t know what to do and the soldier had raised his machete as if to behead my friend and coworker. That’s when I heard Aleeth Speak up.

“Näk yen.” She said nonchalantly. I recognized this; it’s something the locals say when they kill an animal during a hunt. As best I could tell it loosely translates to “Kill the animal.”

I watched in horror as the large man’s eyes became wide and he began to swing the machete in a huge arc towards my friend’s neck. Then something odd happened. His massive arm was intercepted by at the elbow by one of the villagers. Soon several more jumped on the man’s back. He was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of villagers as they proceeded to pile on the man while he fell to the ground. I couldn’t see everything well enough to understand exactly what was going on at first, but after a few seconds it became apparent; the starving villagers were eating this man alive. Within a minute or so he’d stopped struggling and had likely succumbed to blood loss. The villagers continued to feast until he was merely bones. Only two from my crew were there to witness the event; myself and the tech. We hurried back to our tent and stayed hidden the remainder of the night. I did not take pictures. 

As we ran back to our tents another rather large DRC soldier stopped us with an assault rifle in hand. He had a sizeable bite to his neck and was bleeding rather profusely at this point. He warned us to stay in our tent and staggered away. Gunfire could be heard intermittently across the village, however, not consistently; it came in sporadic and unusually short bursts. I had one small caliber handgun but was told to never brandish it; the soldiers saw anything that was holding a weapon as a threat and were trained to dispatch it immediately. I didn’t stand a chance against a trained soldier, so I did the next best thing; I rigged several of our cameras up by the opening of our tent. I set the flashes to maximum intensity and tied a series of fishing line to the path that led to the opening. If anyone was going to try to sneak into our tent they’d lose their night vision to the impending flash. It wasn’t much but it might be enough to give us the upper hand and survive the night as it was equally unsafe to try to leave and travel after dark. The fighting continued through the night and the cameras by the tent were going off almost nonstop. I’d left film in all of them so they’d be taking pictures as well. No one slept, but when dawn finally arrived none of us had been harmed either.

The village seemed empty in the morning when we woke. A thin acrid smoke hung in the air mixing with the morning fog. At first I only saw two other people outside, a large soldier with a sword at his side, and a smallish man who wore glasses and the attire of a surgeon. He seemed to be speaking to the soldier. I was too far away to hear what they were saying and they didn’t exactly appear inviting so I left them be until Aleeth stopped me.

“I’m sorry you had to witness that last night.” She said with the slightest hint of a smile.

“Thank…you…for saving his…our lives.” It was all I could manage to say.

“I wish it were another way; I have no power over the soldiers. But I do have the villagers; they hunger.”

With that she walked towards the two men in the distance and joined them in conversation. I gathered my crew preparing to leave; our lives were clearly in danger at this point. Our driver, who had blindly trusted our guide to this point readily, drove us out of the village and to safety. On the way, however, we saw the atrocities that had taken place during the previous night. Bones lay everywhere; stripped clean of flesh, they almost didn’t smell. The carrion birds were left wanting that day; there was almost absolutely nothing left. We made it out of the DRC and I immediately questioned my boss, who at the time was in his late seventies about our guide. He claimed that the company who hired us to do the work had hired the guide as well. I called them and they immediately denied hiring anyone but the driver. We had no other leads so I backed down. My boss took our photos and I never got to see them beyond what we developed in Africa. Due to a contract dispute most of the photographs never left our lab.

This past May my boss fell ill with pneumonia. He died in June and left the business to his son to run. He’s been managing things for several years now anyways and is nearly as good as his old man. I was actually included in the will and was left a small lockbox. It contained photographs taken throughout the ages, from WWII all the way to the present, and I’m assuming they were taken mostly by my old boss. 

One of the last folders I came to read 2001 – DRC. I gingerly took it and looked. The photographs weren’t the best due to the fact that the flash was a bit off for the extreme darkness, but I could see them. Thousands of them, milling around our tent. Blank dead eyes staring at the flashes and wondering what was behind. None of them advanced on our tent, but occasionally I would see a corpse of one of the DRC soldiers as they tore into him. My boss developed all of the film that we’d used in Africa. Film that was never seen by eyes other than his. It was almost more than I could handle…and I’d been there in person. 

Finally I saw that only one small folder remained in the box. It had been labeled at one point in time, but all I could read now was a small “A” scribbled on the outside. Inside were pictures of what could’ve been genocide for all I knew. Horrible events that I’d never even heard of. Massacres, at least that’s what I assumed they were, of tens of thousands of people, or what used to be people; they looked like husks of human beings. That’s when I realized that some of these people on the ground were still alive. I started to notice someone in the photos around the time of the Vietnam War. She was pretty and had uncharacteristically dark skin. Once the quality improved I thought I could make the face out.

I dropped the photos and staggered back. Once I built up the courage to look at the remaining few I found that they were mostly from America during the Great Depression. The last one was old, very old. It showed my boss as a very young man in 1935 judging by the writing on the back. He was down on both knees with the most pained expression I’ve ever seen on anyone’s face. Cradled in his arms was the corpse of a very young boy. I could see that the boy was dead; he had finally succumbed to either dehydration or starvation or some combination of the two. They were both rail thin and the boy couldn’t have been more than two years old. It broke my heart; I knew my boss had lost a child during the great depression but I’d always guessed it’d been to illness. Lastly in the background I saw a woman. She stood a few feet behind him. It wasn’t his wife. The woman stared directly into the camera and gave the saddest sort of smile. Aleeth.

Yet something has been bugging me for a while which is as the title described acquiring 'more' knowledge about server/computer hardware architecture (Mainly server). My knowledge on this topic is somewhere in the middle. I've done internships where I managed and maintained a datacenter for 4 schools. During this period I didn't had to do any major planning on acquiring new machines or implementing new storage solutions. This wasn't part of the function I was assigned back then ( Mostly Networking , redundancy , infrastructure designing ..). Yet I've always wanted to know more about the datacenter infrastructure itself. Servers,Storage Solutions, Xeon processors.. and the technologies behind it. In my perspective I lack a bit of knowhow on the server/datacenter/storage,.. side whatever you may call it. For example the designing of a small datacenter based on the needs of a company (What kind of processors? Storage Solutions ?) And how everything ties together. I'm wondering If some of you could point me in the right direction of where I might learn about these kind of things (More in-depth). I've been looking for books, but most of them seem out-dated. Any recommendation I'm grateful for. Thanks in advance!  "

I'm currently in a long-distance relationship and we are both each other's first significant other. In order to make things work, I plan on eventually moving near him. However after graduation, I have hit a low. All these job descriptions I keep reading make me feel like I can't possibly qualify, so I end up not replying. 

I have felt lack of self-confidence and in my own ability. I have had internships before but I struggle to believe that the things I want are tangible. I've talked with my bf but he seems to be really off-put by me whenever I talk to him about applications or my stress. I feel like a nuisance, so I end up being quiet about my issues. He has been out of school longer than I have; he's gone through the application process and has been successful, especially given his degree in CSE. But I don't have that same ability, and I feel like I'm inadequate next to him. 

I don't really know if I should tell him how I feel. What can I tell him? ~~I regret picking a major that interests me and absolutely does no benefit whatsoever, and I tried to follow my dreams, but in the end, I dreamed too far, and I ended up in a pit of despair?~~ He tries to be helpful, but it's coming off kind of mean with comments such as: You aren't really working- it's not a real job (in response to when I was doing some part-time work for my relatives) or that I have so much free-time. It hurts so much.

I just don't know, and it's affecting how I feel about myself and about my relationship. The closest thing I have told him about these issues I have is that I don't feel ready to grow up and that I hate messing up. I don't like getting rejected, going through the interviews, or realizing that I am not capable of doing the job right. 

I feel like part of the problem is my ability to believe in myself, but the other part of the problem is that I don't know if I'm ready to leave my home. Sometimes I don't know if he sees himself having a future with me. I don't want to ask him things like, do I still make you happy? Do you still love me? It pains me to even think that these past 2 years are years which I am still unable to talk to him about my problems and I care about him so much. 

I wanted to talk to my friends, but I don't have any to speak of whom I can tell these thoughts to, so I'm trusting the reddit community. Sorry for the long-post.

This company had been around since the early 1800s and has been making the same products since they started. 

Being a factory, there are a lot of people in high up positions who started 40 years ago in a very low level position. 

I believe, these are the people who really do a great job of running the company. They have worked here forever, and with a business degree or two under their belt ... they are in a good position to make decisions. 

The downside is, often, they do not mix well with technology. 

We had a few repeat offenders.

Such as the people in accounting with Gateway Desktops that had swelled capacitors. They refused to leave the computer ON over the weekend. In order to get their computers to boot on Monday morning, I would have to pull the power cable, remove the RAM, hold the power button, reseat RAM, then power back on. 

This particular call came in from another repeat offender. Very good business man, great person to work with (didn't belittle people who weren't at his level of management). He had been travelling and could not get his computer to boot. 

It was a brand new Dell Latitude E6500. Very high spec'd laptop ... for us.

I had determined his computer was trying to boot from the media center printer (WHY do people buy these things for an office?????). Pretty common for the HP printers.

Until ...

""Well there's this whirring noise  coming from it""

""Oh, ok, sounds like there might be a CD or DVD inside of it - can you remove the CD or DVD and try again?"" - ME 

""Hold on here, let me find something""

This didn't phase me. I thought that he realized he left a DVD in it and was looking for the cover.

*Popping noises over the phone*

""The whirring noise stopped but I think something broke. Can you come down?""

So, I grab my mobile and head over to his office. Wow, was I surprised! 


Apparently when I said ""remove the CD"" he didn't think of just, you know, pushing the button to eject the tray. He took a screwdriver and went to town.


The laptop was done-for. He managed to:

- Break the CD into 10 or so pieces

- Broken tray to CD drive

- Broken CD drive itself

- Mangled laptop palmwrest/case

- Cracked part of the motherboard off (apparently he went ALL the way in with the screwdriver).



My solution:
""Is it okay if I take this upstairs to take a look"".

Carried it upstairs, set it on my Boss' desk and made him take care of it. "

I'm back again and figured I would do what some posters on here are wont to do and take a trip down good ol' memory lane; back to my beginnings.

***

So the year is early 2006, and I'm fresh out of a ""wandering"" phase after my US military (the few, the proud) service. Read: doing nothing.

A childhood friend of mine has landed a sweet gig as desktop/sysadmin in a far away state that is known for the ""dry"" heat, rivers of salt, and snowbirds. 

He happened to have a newly created need for an intern (Thanks to: Dude who left for more money). He and I both started in computers together, playing and experimenting on his 386 pc back in the day. Good times. Needless to say I was up for the task of being a paid intern; it was to be my foothold into an industry that up to this point was a hobby for me. There are several stories I will be sharing, and this one seems to be a good one to start with. 

***

During my onboarding, aside from the standard introductions, tours, job descriptions, and overviews, I was warned about a few people; stay away from that one, watch how you talk to this one, those people over there will hang you out to dry, you know, the usual. Most turned out to be sage advice, with the definitive exception of one: the ""stay away from that one"" one. This person had just returned from her vacation from parts unknown, so up until now I had known her by name only. 

I see her in the elevator, we introduce ourselves (first names, last name would have triggered the warning) and kinda hit it off, turns out she was pretty cool. I find out later from my friend that she was the one I was supposed to stay away from. (I never found out why FYI) every now and then she would have an issue with her laptop, and I would dutifully go down a floor and fix it for her. One of her reoccurring issues was her keyboard keys were fading out. I was baffled as to why, until I look over her shoulder for the suspect. Hand lotion. The lotion has some sort of oil or whatever in it that would eat away the white of the letter to where is would fade/corrode away. And it had a side effect of making the whole thing feel slimy. (to me anyway) So I would make it a habit to bring some disinfecting wipes with me each time I went down there for any other issue just to make sure to remove any build-up. It sorta became the running joke between us about her ""slimy"" keyboard and me having to touch it. It was fun, I got attention, and she was pretty [Dur-Hur](http://i.imgur.com/4VYS8D3.gif)

I was so good (ha) that eventually all her issues were resolved,(It helped that I trolled the ticket queue for anything for her) and I was seeing less of her than I wanted to. I being the intrepid intern that I was, began to find things that were ""wrong"" with her laptop. Y'know, like revoking her client certificate so I would have to go and generate a new one (on her laptop of course), or gently dislodge her cat5 cable...

Childish, I know, but I liked the gal; I liked being her personal IT hero as often as possible. She wanted to thank me one day, and decided to take me to an establishment known for its chicken wings, waitresses in tights, and their ""owls"". I thought this was pretty awesome, had a few beers, and a great time. We ended up dating within a month or so, then we married in late 2007, and now have two beautiful children together. So much for staying away from that one... :D

***

TL;DR: Told to stay away from ""that one"", end up marrying her.

*[Warning: rant/wall of text incoming]*

I'm an aerospace engineering student, and I will be a super-senior this fall, with at least one more semester to go after this year. As far as the list of ""*Things every engineer needs to do to get employed*"" goes, I basically score a big fat zero... 

&gt; You *need* to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA in order to be competitive.

I have a 2.8. Granted, this does include some failed classes that I intend to retake at a later date, but the simple truth is that I'm not an 3.0 student. Of the classes I've passed, C's are my average grade. Personally, a B means I did well and fully understood the material, and  I only get an ""A"" in classes I found truly easy (aka, no engineering course ever). I've been this way since high school, and given that there's no honors 5.0 scale to save me, and no ""fluff"" classes for me to take, I don't really see myself really ever getting back to to the magic 3.0 mark. 

&gt; Make sure to get an internship or co-op before you graduate.

No such luck so far. I only have one summer left in which I could do an internship. My wife graduated in may, and is waiting on me to graduate before going to grad school, so co-ops aren't an option. I've tried to get an internship at the annual career fair for the past few years, but have gotten no real response. I've been brushed off for the most part, with the exception of companies who were more advertising than actually hiring interns. I got a lot of ""*Come back when you have more on your resume.*""  (although not usually stated  so directly), and a lot of ""*Great! why don't you apply online when an opening shows up in 3 months?*"".  Given that I still don't really have much on my resume, my intense dislike for the networking/job seeking game, and my general social anxiety, it looks like an internship is a long shot. I'm not even sure if I could relocate if someone were to offer me one...

&gt; Internships aside, other employment and professional activities can help fill a resume. 

No employment history. I've literally never had a job. I am the president of a club on campus, which helps, but it's far from professional: a poker club. My resume is basically just my leadership experience from this, and relevant course work. I'm really ramping up my courseload this semester, so I doubt I have the time for a job, or to take on more engineering focused extra-circulars. 

&gt;When looking for a job, don't be afraid to send out upwards of a hundred resumes, all over the country. Don't limit yourself to one particular area. 

I'm going to need a job in whatever city my wife is going to grad school in. While there is some room for compromise here, as the school can be selected based on where I get job offers, the reality is I'm only going to be able to apply for job in 3-4 small areas. There's no way I'm going to be able apply for dozen and dozens of jobs; I expect to only being able to find one or maybe two aerospace jobs in each location. 

*****
My funding for school will run out at the end of this next school year. Given that I may have to incur significant debt to complete my degree, and that pursuing my degree is currently inhibiting my wife's professional pursuits, do you think it's worth it for me to stick with Aerospace engineering? I do have a certification that could get me a casino job, which pays somewhat well (at least relative to how difficult it is). I'm interested in pursuing that as well as engineering, but I doubt I want to make a career out of it. 

Should I keep at an engineering degree, or just accept the facts, suck it up, and get on with my life? "

I had a basic introduction to SQL, and a very basic introduction to html and jquery, but that's it. during this internship I'll be coding in c# with the .NET framework, none of which I ever did before. they told me that they expect that at the end of the internship (4 months) I'll be as good as a regular employee, and doing the same tasks as a regular employee. that makes me a bit nervous to be honest with you. I don't want to be a nuisance to them, and even though I know I'm doing an internship to learn, I don't want to walk in there and be completely oblivious about everything. I'd like to be resonably competent from the start,  and I tant to take some of my summer free time to learn some basics 

can you guys suggest a good tutorial, maybe followed by a realistic little project that I can do in the next weeks?

2bq8fv,0,2014-07-25,Going to do my Master in Erlangen. Need some inputs.,master_in_erlangen,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/2bq8fv/going_to_do_my_master_in_erlangen_need_some_inputs/,"###Background
This September I will start my Msc. in Computational Engineering in Erlangen. A more appropriate name is perhaps applied scientific computing. Particularly, I chose computational material science as the application field since I did Physics for my undergraduate degree. The program can be mostly completed in English. Some courses are only offered in German however.

I am kinda interested about what I should expect studying in Erlangen. A few concerns:

###Study
The program has a tight course schedule. The [curriculum](http://www.ce.uni-erlangen.de/students/standard-studienkonzepte-master/?topic=cms) requires me to devoted most of my time on coursework with an additional Thesis project at the last semester. Rather than a research degree, it's closer in structure to a bachelor degree. With Germany reputation for difficult technical courses, I wonder if I can do well there.

###German
From reading around this subreddit and toytown, it seems the consensus is that there are enough engineering jobs here. Mainly in IT and automotive industry. But they also requires a reasonably high level of German language skills. I wonder if I can accomplish this under 2 years time, in addition to the heavy course workload.

My plan now is to follow Assimil, and see how far it can take me after half a year. Erlangen says it doesn't offer beginner German courses. So I need to study the basics myself.

###Housing
Seems impossibly difficult. I haven't got any accommodation until now. Applied through the Studentenwerk, but failed. For now, I am just sending email applications to Privat Studentenwohnheim. Wish me luck. Any advice would be great.

###Internship
I originally planned to take an internship after I finished my first year. But I am confused with the semester system at German universities. They list summer semester starts from April until September. And winter semester starts from October until March. Is there any long vacation period? Or is it just a convenient way to split the academic year into two? I assume the effective semester, including the lecture and exam time, is much shorter.

###Cycling
Seems cycling is a must in Erlangen. If anyone can tell any peculiarities of cycling in Germany, that would be great. I have also read that there is a regular bicycle auction in Erlangen. Perhaps I should visit it on October.

I guess for the first few months, I will rely on the semester ticket.

###Insurance
It seems there are other important insurance than the compulsory health insurance for foreign students. Liability insurance and bicycle insurance are the most commonly mentioned. Any thoughts about the necessity of those two?

###Banking
Non-EU students are required to make a student account with Deutsche Bank. Unfortunately, the account doesn't include a credit card. Will a debit card be enough for live in Germany? There is a thread in toytown where a student cannot use his debit card to purchase items from Amazon.

Just worried a bit here. I appreciate it if anyone can give inputs or advice concerning studying in Erlangen, or perhaps Germany in general.

I've been working here for around a month and haven't had any issues that would require the work of IT until today.

For some reason, the macros I set up in our database to aid in my work got all messed up.  As I said, I'm an end user so I don't know many technical terms.  Basically, they weren't working the way they used to and I couldn't get them to reset.

So I called the support desk and within two minutes one of the tech support personnel (we'll call her Nina) arrived at my desk.  Nina is a very short, but very intimidating Russian woman with a thick and burly accent.  I was afraid she would go off on me for having such a simple issue to waste her time with.  

I explained the issue to her and she was able to fix it within 10 minutes.  After she left, I was afraid I'd left a bad impression on her so I decided to do something nice for her.  (hearing about all the crap you guys go through on here was motivation as well).

So on my break I went and got her a tea (I always see her drinking tea and I asked her coworkers what her favorite kind was).  When I brought it to her, she almost burst into tears.

""What's wrong Nina?""

""I just can't believe you would do something so nice for me!  You wouldn't believe how mean and unhelpful people can be when you're trying to help them with computer problems.""

Thanks to all of you on this sub for helping me not take for granted the efforts of tech support.  And thanks for putting up with ungrateful/impatient end users!

None of the people who could relate to this story speaks english fluently enough to come to /r/relationships and read this, but it makes me feel at ease.



I'm a 22 years old student and this year I met the perfect girl for me. She was studying in the same field as I do, we liked the same shows, same games, same books, etc. 



But the most important thing was that every time we spent some time together it was perfect : we could just sit down in the grass and talk about anything for hours.



I had dated some girls before her, a few, but never felt so attracted by, and interested in, someone. 



We hung out as friends for a month, spending a lot of time together as we studied in the same room (we were both doing an internship in a public research lab which happened to be in the same campus as our university) and sharing a lot.



We then quickly became best friends as we'd abandon anything we were doing just to talk together for a while. She also became my confident and biggest moral support as I my life tends to get extra hard from times to times thanks to a lot of family issues and illnesses. 



Once I became aware of how attracted I was to her, not just as a friend, I tried to become closer to her, but she was weirdly distant at the time. 
I didn't know yet, but she was attracted too, but chose to put some distance as she knew that, at that time, I could possibly move away to another country for work reasons (this is not an option anymore, I'm staying where I am). 
This disturbed me a lot because she stopped hanging out with me and started going out with a guy who, she admitted it herself, she totally wasn't attracted to. 



Then, one day, when she told it to me in an official manner, I blurted out : ""It should have been me"", but she didn't react right out of the bat. It was only a few days later, at the university's end of the year barbecue that we had some time together to talk about it, as she left her boyfriend alone and came to talk to me.



She confessed dating him just to have someone, we talked about a lot of different things, how it would be if I moved far away, etc. And at the end of the night, we cuddled and realized we should be together. 



We texted a lot that night, for hours, and I received the cutest (and nerdiest) love messages I ever received. The day after that, she dumped her ex, who wasn't even sad nor mad, and we went for a movie. Cuddles during the movie, kissing at the end, I felt like I was 15 year old once more. We ended up at my home, talked a lot, she asked me if we could trade our sweaters to which I agreed, had fun watching futurama on the TV, had sex and went to bed.



We woke up the day after that, stayed in bed for the whole morning, talking and cuddling. Then I think I made a mistake when I confessed that I felt a lot of things for her, and that I might well be in love.



She thought at first that I should just say that I liked her a lot, but we didn't talk about it more than that.



I drove her back to her parents' home, but she refused to trade our sweaters, even though she was the one who asked at first. Drove back to my home, and worked a bit.



I had a bad feeling about the whole sweater story, but felt like I was over thinking and stopped thinking about it. But a few hours later she sent me a text saying that we needed to talk whenever I was free. 
This is where it becomes really bad : I called her back (couldn't drive to her home to see her face to face, no gps and the path is really hard to memorize), she told me she had confused her feelings for me, that she loved me, but only as a friend. 



I asked her how she knew that, she said that she just knew, that it took her hours of thinking but she knew and she didn't want us to be together anymore. But she wanted us to remain best friends, as we were before going out, that she didn't want to loose me as she would suffer a lot if it happened. She was ready to wait as long as it would take, but I made a mistake and said that we could hang out as friends as soon as she wanted. I was heart broken and felt like I couldn't stand loosing her completely.



The day after that, I took some days off work just to hang out with her. We went 8-pooling with some common acquaintances, but we both felt down and it kind of ruined the mood. I drove her back at the end of the day and we talked a lot in the car in front of her home.



When I got back at home, she was already messaging me on skype about what we would do the day after that. She chose disneyland, to which I agreed. She had some hesitations, but was really hyped about it. 



Disneyland day, we have a lot of fun, a~and thanks to my own stupidity : I end up cuddling a lot with her. Great day, lots of fun and talking. We end up on a bench before hitting the road and talk about where we are in our friendship/relationship.
She told me that she was a bit weirded out by the amount of cuddles, that she loved them and wanted them but that we shouldn't cuddle because that's not what friends do. At this point, I knew that I wasn't over her at all, but kept going with it, stopping everything would have killed me.



We drove back to her house, ate with her parents, watched the movie. Fast forward two days after that : same kind of setup : end of the afternoon and night together, work on a drone, cuddles, hand holding and head scratches, sometimes she initiates, most of the times I do, eat with her parents, movie, hand holding during the movie.



We have to drive back her sister to her home, proceed to do so, talk a lot in the car when we're just the two of us, talk about where we are in our relationship (again), she wants to keep what we have at that time, but still feels like we really should stop the physical proximity, but wants it too. Hours of talking about everything again.



Fast forward to three days later, during which she never texted me nor contacted me in any way, something happens to me that leaves me really down, emotionally crushed. I text her, telling her that I need to talk to her about what happened (we did it a lot), she agrees, we meet in my car in front of her house on a sunday night.



We talked for 6 hours straight this night, about what happened to me, once again about what we should do about our relationship, she confessed a lot of things that night : that she was still attracted to me and that if I were to make a move she would probably don't know how to react which would be why we should stop seeing each other for a short time, that she had just started texting her ex of two years (she broke up with him two months before we met, and had an on again off again relationship with him), that she didn't know how she felt about him (though I felt like she was still in love with him, at least a bit).



Around 4 am we started cuddling as we were a bit sleepy, she started sleeping on my lap while I was cuddling her, woke up and said we needed to sleep, that she was going home.



Then I made the biggest mistake of my life : I went on her lap (horse rider style), looked at her in the eyes and kissed her. After all she said that night I couldn't just leave her like that, knowing that she would probably ignore her feelings for me and go back with her ex, forcing me to watch from afar (she admitted herself that if they went back together, we would probably not be able to see each other, and wouldn't be able to see each other one to one for sure).



She didn't stop me, nor did she protest at first. She kissed me back, put her hands on my back, then stopped. Saying that we shouldn't, that it would change everything. I reassured her, saying that even if after that she still didn't want us to be together I wouldn't disappear, that we would be friends together. She promised me the same and we continued kissing.



As she was cuddling me even more, I started touching her (you know what I mean), she felt great, was vocal about it, but at one point she started saying that it was all a mistake and that we should stop because that's not what we wanted.



Unfortunately, it took me nearly a minute to stop, way too long, and I still feel bad about it. She panicked, as she had dropped her keys and felt too vulnerable. I stopped everything, went back on my seat, fetched her keys and gave them to her, tried to reassure her, but I soon realized what I had done :  I made her feel unsafe. I felt bad, so bad that I had to step out of the car and puked in a garbage bag.



She stepped out too, we sat down on the ground, and started reassuring each other, her saying that I didn't hurt her, only made her feel unsafe for a few seconds, that it was no big deal and that I wasn't the monster I thought I had become, and me telling her how sorry I was, how I treasured what we had and how much I didn't want to lose her. We cuddled for a while, still reassuring each other.



She made me come to her bedroom. We talked for a few minutes. Then she asked me if I would try anything sexual if we slept together in her bed. I promised her I wouldn't, we went to bed, cuddled. We talked about how much we liked each other, vowed never to hurt each other and never stop seeing each other, then she held me, really tight, breathed in and out really strong for a few minutes, and started sleeping.



The day after that, I went to work, she hugged me when I was about to get out of her house and reassured me once again. 
I received a text from her, saying that I wasn't a monster, that we were just two lost people who couldn't deal with their feelings. That she felt unsafe that night, but that I never hurt her and that I stopped fast enough. We exchanged a few texts, I took two weeks off work (had planned to do that anyway) and we skyped during the afternoon.



It ended in her telling me that she needed a break, that we would just stop talking to each other for a little while and that we would see each other right after that. I agreed.



Fast forward one week after that : no news, not a text, not a message, nothing. I texted her to know if she was ok with stopping the break (family issues had left me, once again, very sad). She replied saying that we might not have lived the events the same way, but she didn't want us to be friends anymore, and not in the good way. She had already blocked my calls (I tried calling her once after getting her message because that's not something I like to discuss about via text messages), then answered my text asking her why she was doing that : she would never forget what happened on that night, she would never trust me again and that she was really sad to do this but she wouldn't change her mind.



I was supposed to send her a message about my feelings, but never did.



And here I am, nearly two weeks later. I still think about her and what happened every single day. I have a hard time sleeping because the moment I lay down in bed I start reminiscing everything that happened.



**TL; DR :** Met a girl, became best friends, lovers, she panicked, dumped me, we kept hanging out ""as friends"", but acting more like a couple, I made a mistake, kissed her, we started preliminaries, she panicked, felt vulnerable, I felt sick thinking about what happened, she asked me to sleep (only sleep) with her, we reassured each other, she kept telling me we were ok, hugging me, telling me she didn't want to lose me. 



She asked for a short break, we stopped talking, I texted her a week later, she told me I was mistaken, that she didn't want us to talk anymore, nor to be friends anymore. I feel like crap ever since and can't stop thinking about her and what happened.



Now, what I wanna know is : 

- Am I some kind of crazy guy who just went nuts, am I a creep? 

- We will meet, see each other at the university next scholar year (small campus, our classrooms are in the same building, I work with a lot of her teachers on different research projects) like a lot. Am I stupid to hope, to think, that we could be friends again? I know it will never be like it was before, but she was much more than my girlfriend.

- Is there any chance she still has feelings for me? I know I shouldn't think about that, but I can't control it. The way she did this, after constantly telling me and showing me we were alright, always makes me think she talked about what happened to someone and chose to ban me from her life despite still wanting to at least talk with me.

- Any advice on how I can at least retrieve some sanity? Yes I still love her, and will probably for a long time, but if I could feel a bit more at ease with myself that would be great.


Thanks.

Advice for further education?",vyrnhorn,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/2bqpgw/ive_been_selfemployed_in_gis_for_a_year_now_but_i/,"Hello all! One year ago I graduated with my bachelor's in Natural Resources. During my undergrad I took two classes in GIS (roughly half theory, half ArcMap) and quickly started contributing to my group projects in other classes via GIS work. After I graduated I found myself with short internship with a wildlife researcher once again making maps and handling data management. It's been a strange road since then, but I've become the GIS equivalent of an odd jobs worker, taking small projects from public institutions, non-profits, and private individuals. I seem to be, and correct me if I'm wrong, a free lance GIS technician?

Anyway, I'm barely making any money and have no idea how to run a business but I so thoroughly enjoy my work that I'd like to do this sort of thing as a career. Ideally I'd like to do GIS work/field work for an environmentally focused company, but it seems like a graduate degree is very important. Therefore, I want to go back to school to study Geography. Which leads me to a few questions:

How well does an Environmental Science degree (Natural Resources specifically) lead to starting a graduate program in Geography? Are there undergraduate classes I should look into before then? What about Esri certifications? What sorts of specializations do geography programs have, and what sort of study/work do they lend themselves toward?

This is a world of work and study upon which I simply did not focus my attention in college, and I could use all the help I can get.

Edit: I should also add that I know (""know"") Python and would love to pursue further computer science instruction if that is particularly useful."

Situation: I got offered an internship out of state while she still has one semester left to get her degree. I accepted it because we had already talked about doing everything we could so as not to sacrifice one of our careers for the other. She came along for 3 weeks before she goes home for classes in August.

Our normal sex schedule (yes, a schedule... I fucking HATE the idea but she's never in the mood without warning and it seems to make waiting easier for me and getting in the mood easier for her, even though I'm still the one doing all the work... T-F-Sa) has been put on hold I guess because of the move. Now it's been a week and a half since any intimacy, and she's even distant when we're out and about. Even when she promised to get it on the next day, she doesn't try... Just lies there looking at me.

It's making me feel like shit. I know guys almost always have a higher sex drive and get turned on faster/easier, but this is stupid. It's like she doesn't even care about making me feel appreciated. I work hard to do things she likes--massages, soft kisses, go down on her every time (and in doing so I start to like it)--but feel I put way more effort in to satisfying her than she does me.

We have a great relationship otherwise... Talk about everything, laugh and hold hands, share books and movies. But she doesn't understand how sex relates to affection and appreciation for me, no matter how many times I try to make it clear.

I don't know what to do anymore. The next 2 weeks before she goes home will be hell if she is constantly distant and anxious. I'm trying to include her, keep us close, make her happy. She just complains every morning or evening about aches and cough and other bullshit.... I'm really sick of it and am feeling awful.. Am I doing something wrong? How can I break through to her? I do NOT want us feeling disconnected when she goes home for 5 months."

2br0b0,0,2014-07-25,Out of region recruiting,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2br0b0/out_of_region_recruiting/,"Hi Everyone, 

So I have been struggling for a little while as to where to look for a job in public accounting, and I think I have made my decision, but I'm not sure how to make the connections needed to get there.

For some background, I recently graduated from a solid northeastern school with a pretty strong Big 4 presence that primarily sends students to NYC.  I was a good student (3.62 GPA, BAP Member, etc.), but I have never had any interest in working in that area, so I generally tried to express to recruiters that I was interested in going to Chicago instead.  Why Chicago?...I don't know exactly, I wanted to be in a major city that wasn't in the northeast, so I guess Chicago made sense.  I got the feeling that recruiters at my school didn't want to go out of their way to accommodate this, and for that reason and others (I'm generally a quiet person, not the best at networking), I didn't get any Public Accounting internship offers.  I am now interning with a mortgage company in a non-accounting role.

I will be starting my Master's program at Notre Dame this fall, and I have decided that I want to work in Los Angeles, ideally in a practice relating to entertainment (I ultimately want to work for Disney someday).  So I finally know what I want to do, and I know the general recruiting advice (network much as possible, go to events, etc.), but I want to do everything I can to make it happen.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? If so, how did it work out/what steps did you take to get where you wanted to go? If there are any recruiters on here that deal with students who want to work in a different area, how easy would doing something like this be, and what can I do to make this process easier for all parties?

**TL/DR** Master's student interested in going to LA from the Midwest, what do I need to do to make this happen?

* At this point, I'm more scared to go into work every day. I almost worry full time about what I'm going to do. The stress of the situation does not seem worth the pay or the future reference. 

* I am a high stress guy and will admit that I was hospitalized for trying to end my life last summer. It won't come to that here; I just wanted to say this is the 2nd most miserable I have probably ever felt. 


I'm going into work on Sunday for a few hours (my own choice). I really just want to type up a document that details how to use my last 2 projects, where this current one can be picked up, and be done with it. 

I had written up a 2 week notice (I wanted to quit August 8th anyway), but it seems pointless for me to be around for 2 weeks when I am unable to move this project forward. I'm also sure I would feel the guilt of abandoning this project, since I am/was the *only* person working on it (god damn I wish they had a full time dev...).
I honestly don't think I can look them in the eye enough to quit in person, let alone *stay around* 2 weeks after declaring my resignation.

Never - this will always be my answer to this question.  ""Bloodhoond, there's a party going on tonight and everyone wants you there...""  Is that so?  Everyone is clamoring for my participation?  This party will not, must not, get off the ground without my attendance?  Forgive me if I'm skeptical, but I do not wish to attend your party, nor any party for that matter.

What do parties entail?  Let us break it down - you arrive, slightly buzzed and are greeted by the sight of a stinking, writhing mass of people you've never met, nor cared to meet, in your life.  Throughout the night you are forced to be charming and make small talk when all you can think in your mind is ""Dear God, I wish I was home right now..."". Oh you made a funny, maybe even a good impression on these innocent strangers.   ""My, my"" they'll think to themselves ""what a funny man... I wish I was as charming as he is...""  I am in hell, sir.

What a fool, you think, what an absolute fool... ""Oh good for you, you've almost graduated law school, how absolutely fucking fascinating!""  ""Peace Corps?! Do tell!""  ""My, my that internship sounds mighty intimidating!"" ""Please give the starving orphans in Zimbabwe my regards!""

And so 1 AM rolls around and you are still trapped in the tangled web that is what you've come to call ""Utter Bullshit"" with no observable way out. And all the while you are dreaming of going home and sidling up to your one true companion, Mr. Canadian Club - oh how good he is to you...

You make your escape, disregarding any other voices and find yourself at home.  ""OOOOHHHH CAAANNADDAAAAA!"" you bellow as you are home - for it is only the whiskey that will truly treat you as have always wanted. Only you, Mr. CC, understand me, only you ever will...."

I proceed to mess with them.",WilliamtheV,linuxmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/2brfrz/phone_scam_claiming_to_be_windows_technical/,"So I've been working from home this summer, as part of an internship with my astronomy professor. Since I've been working from home, I get bored sometimes. Then this happened.

I get a call from a number that some quick googling confirmed was a spoof. There's a guy on the other end with a thick accent, claiming to be from ""Windows Technical Support"". I'll call him TS. 

My grandfather had recieved a call from TS a few months ago. Luckily didn't pay him anything, but at least I was aware of it. They had also tried to dupe me a couple days before, but that call lasted a minute or so.

According to TS, ""Certified Genuine Windows machines had sent them the errors through the main server"" and the Windows Technical Support team were calling to fix it.

I, in what I believe to be an oscar winning performance, played the part of a hapless luser. ""I'm not very good with computers, I'm not a computer person or anything. Can you help me out?"" I quickly grabbed my laptop and fired up ubuntu so I could google the various Windows bits they were trying to fool me with.

After ten minutes of them trying to guide me through running event viewer, ""Those errors are because the virus has corrupted your critical system files"", and then trying to get me to install teamviewer, the call drops.

I figure, whatevs. I had fun with it, and I'd recorded it to share the audio with friends. 

[THEN THEY CALL BACK.](http://youtu.be/a1Y73sPHKxw)

They then try again. After we get to the part where they ask for money, I drop the act, and let them know that

A) I'm aware of what they're doing, and it's illegal.

B) I use linux, not windows. 

At this point, the guy on the phone tries to tell me that I'm not using ""the Linux Service"" but they wouldn't have it. He keeps on trying to convince me that I use windows, and that the linux is a separate service. He then transfers me to the original dude who called me, whom I quickly frustrated as well. ""Sir, let me tell you one thing! We are trying to help you with the Windows!""

Then they hang up.

tl:dr Phone/Fake IT/Malware scam calls me up, and I use my knowledge of (l)user behavior to waste 15 minutes of their time.

2brh0s,23,2014-07-26,"Update:Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2brh0s/updateme_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/,"[Previous Updates](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25soq4/updateme_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/)

Hey guys. Sorry to bother you...I just thought I'd update. I finished my internship. It was amazing and exactly what I needed. I'm glad I got to be away for the summer and spend time with my family. In comparison to my dad's marriage, they're normal and happy and are a very good influence on me. It was nice to be around people that I don't have to walk on eggshells with or hide things from because I'm afraid of a fight. Being here really made me realize how screwed up my dad's marriage is and how deep I was sucked into their shit. After being here, I know I have to get a job and a place as soon as I graduate to ensure I never ever live in that household again. 

Some people might not be too happy with me but after I got here, my uncles said a condition to living here was talking to my dad twice a week. I did ween conversation back before I left because he had gotten a letter from the bank about a change in address and I didn't want him draining my account since it was my saved money and not his. He used it as a tool to speak to me about our issues. I posted more about it on /r/raisedbynarcissists and they made me realize my dad might actually be more of an enabler rather than an actual narcissist and only has certain traits now because he's been so deeply exposed to my toxic stepmother. 

So yes, I've been in contact with my dad. He calmed down a lot, but the subject of me coming home was like a giant elephant in the room for the few months I've been here. When we discussed the banning a while ago, it was turned around as, ""I didn't ban you. Coming home was conditional depending on when you apologized to my wife. You could have come home any time you wanted to."" We've come to an understanding that the apology just isn't happening and became more about me just being plain uncomfortable coming back. 

Which is true because even if he welcomed me back [which he sort of has?], his wife, who has done this before, would throw away my toothbrush and anything else that might have been a sign of me living there before, put away my pictures that were on display, rearrange my bedroom, ignore me very obviously, stomp around, slam doors, and stay in her room the entire time I was home. So pretty much telling me I'm unwelcome by her actions. 

Also, in case anyone is wondering about student loans and what not. I was denied loans right before I got here because I couldn't provide parental information that was necessary and because I'll be part time. I couldn't get my dad to give me the information I needed but I still told him I would go to a bank for a loan if I had to. He kept insisting on paying for schooling and I told him that my education is mine, no matter whose paying for it and that he needs to understand I am the last person that wants to sabotage it. That if he's going to pay, we have to learn to get along and respect each other and the cursing and fighting needs to end. He agreed and hasn't fought with me since and has been apologetic about his behavior for the most part.

Anyway, after avoiding the subject for two months, my dad finally asked where I would be staying when I come back, if I was staying at home, etc. I said since I'm not welcome back, I already have plans to stay with a friend. He said we have to approach his wife delicately [since she's still apparently heated] and go to therapy together to figure out how to approach her. We had agreed I'd have a session alone, then the two of us, and eventually all 3 of us. 

I had told him I was still uncomfortable with the 3 of us but I was willing to compromise because my therapist actually suggested I do it after the two of us talk to his doctor because I clearly have a lot of issues with her. I've come to accept the way my stepmom is for a while now and there is no point in me going to therapy to tell her what a horrible truly disgusting poor excuse for a human being I think she is. Instead, I just want to stand my ground, show her I'm not going to let her control me the way she does my dad, and establish and assert my boundaries. Rather than my dad do it for me, I'm telling her directly my phonecalls and conversations are my business, my relationship with my dad is my business, my schooling is my business, and anything that's my business is not her business and doesn't entitle her to rudely push herself in the middle of it. I'm debating whether or not to tell the therapist about the conversations I recorded. My dad already claims he can't remember what we argued about and I have it all saved and backed up.

My stepmom is about to take her second mandatory Caribbean vacation this summer so fingers crossed she comes back easier to deal with. My dad CC'd me on an email to the therapist about two sessions to schedule, but did not include the one with just the two of us we agreed on before the 3 way therapy disaster. I'm going to be bringing this up to him and the therapist obviously so I'll see how that goes. 

Anyway, sorry for the novel. There's a lot more I can write about this subject honestly, but it won't change my parents. All I can do is really just keep establishing boundaries. At least I had a great summer and my family here has been really supportive of me.

TL;DR Been in contact with my dad. Going to therapy together at some point to figure out how to let me back in my house...this should be fun...

Was never in a 'serious' relationship before, a brief fling during college but beyond that nothing.


I met this girl while working, also an employee at the company. Originally she was assigned to the front desk; an internship of sorts. She was forward, made all the moves, swept me off my feet so to speak. Don't think I've ever fell this hard before, it was an amazing feeling. We started off dating a few times, then things started getting serious. There were a few culture differences along the way that I've always tried to be mindful of but I think I handled them okay. A couple weeks into her internship she gets pulled into my department where we hit it off even further.
 

Now a little about her: she is absolutely gorgeous, radiant, funny, and upbeat. It's not unusual for her to go out and have several guys chasing after her. I'm not the jealous type, truly. I freaking love this girl, I trust her. 


After about a year of dating her internship is up. It's time for her to graduate and she asked if I could go along with her; I was ecstatic--dropped everything and went for a week and a half vacation. Met her friends (her brother and aunt as well but not her parents). We did have an argument while traveling that did put a damper on things. But (I think?) we resolved that quite well. 


Now fast forward to now; last few weeks have been rather difficult. The arguments keep on cropping up. I'm not into conflict; tend to avoid it by nature. These arguments are taxing; but I love the girl. My term here is done and I'll be heading back home for awhile which seems to be the root of most the problems. I've assured her multiple times but I'm feeling something gets lost in the translation. I'm one of the hopeless guys that envisions a whole future--house, kids, traveling, the works--of us together. To make that a possibility I have to head back home to work. Not for the sake of a career as I just view the career as a means to an end. 


As I mentioned above the arguments keep happening and with all conflicts both sides feel it; I know it's not easy for her being with me and that hurts most of all. I can't help but feel I'm holding her back. When my term officially ends I'll be heading back for I'm guessing two or three years and in that time we'll be long distance. I'll be able to squeeze in a few visits but nothing long term. Do I let her go or am I being selfish in wanting this to work?

tl'dr; i'm a shit boyfriend, love the girl, think she deserves the best, want to be that guy but am not there yet, do I let her go or keep trying?"
2brpz6,2,2014-07-26,Gift giving: How much is too much for friends?,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2brpz6/gift_giving_how_much_is_too_much_for_friends/,"**Tl:DR spent $116 on a very good friend's gift. How much do you guys spend? What's normal?**


So I recently bought my friend a gift that amounted to $116. Technically, I do owe her two birthday gifts and, after a serious of very awkward events, I feel like I owe her.

My Ndad promised a very extravagant, all expense paid summer experience and internship for her. When she got there, nothing was planned out, he told her she had to pay for all the travel arrangements in the country. When he offered to bring one of my friends with me (he know I hate staying with him, so he always offers), I told him she was poor and couldn't afford it and he assured me he would pay. His Nwife inferred she was fat over and over again and treated my friend like she was some lower level human. My friend ended up sent back to the US after a couple weeks. Also, the whole time she was there, there was no food in the house because everyone in that house hold has a weird outlook on food that borderlines eating disorders. She was also the one to really point out how fucked up everyone was. I was starting to suspect there was something wrong with my family, but she really helped point out the gaslighting. I associate food with guilt and she's one of the first people I shared it with and she always pushes me to be less conscious about it. She convinced me it's okay to spend a little money on nice things and to treat yourself (I don't think this is out of jealousy, as she buys really expensive stuff for herself when she can). Plus, I should have realized this would happen. I don't know why I believed my father would treat an outsider differently.

I've only known her for two years (we met halfway through out first year in college). Our current financial situations are complete opposites. There are one or two times where she has taken advantage of this. One time was just to purchase a shirt we would share, but she would obviously wear more, so I'm not sure that counts. The second time was for a travel cost for trip my father promised was all-expense paid (so maybe that doesn't count?). Technically I lent her $300. She hasn't paid it back, though to be fair, we haven't had a chance to. I will bring it up when we get back. She only owes me about $150 or $200 ish now anyways. She did accept the all expense paid offer (but that's kind of hard to hold against someone...). I was the one who brought the trip up since my dad always went on about how I could bring a friend over.

My parents both say she's using me, but we're closer than ever after that whole fiasco, and her mother even offered to let me stay with them rather than go back to my home. I feel guilty because I used my dad's money. I can pay him back for it with my birthday money... I can't tell if it's because I spend too much or because of the weird interpersonal relationship habits and money habits my parents bred into me (my mother just doesn't have friends and my dad ALWAYS promises things the fails to deliver, or gets upset that the people around him don't grovel at his feet). When she did go to the foreign country with me, she could have expressed her gratefulness more, as the plane tickets were so expensive (although, I guess it's difficult when the day after you get to a 12 hour time zone change in a non anglo-saxon culture, you're thrown around like a pancake and no one tells you why). They always tell me friends aren't everything, but in my case, my friends may come and go (mostly my own fault, I tend to cut off ties for no reason) and have always provided way more support than they ever did. 

sorry this is long... but my parents really hate her. Despite everything, my mother has a tendency to be right. Plus I feel bad for spending so much of my dad's money (I had to buy some expensive shoes and cooking supplies, and he spent a ridiculous amount of money on for my birthday)... Idk"

I'm graduating from university at the end of this year, and want to live in China for a year. I'm a male Caucasian, born and raised in Australia and am 26 years old. I did a Bachelor of Information Technology at university and majoring in Software Engineering. I have not yet graduated, but my GPA is currently 6 (out of 7). I'm very good at Information Technology; with knowledge ranging from web programming (PHP, Apache, HTML, CSS etc), Networking (Have a advanced diploma in network engineering), System Admin (Am proficient with Debian distros, ARCH Linux and know my way around Windows Server), plus a few other technologies that will make this post too long winded. The job does not have to be IT related.

I'm currently self learning Mandarin in my spare time, and learning general knowledge about China, such as manners, culture, history etc. My Mandarin is no where near anything usable, but I'm going to take professional lessons before heading over, depending on my free time, or after I get there. My reasons for wanting to work and live in China are to learn another culture, language outside of my own and I believe it will be a great life experience. I recently was in China for 3 weeks on a cultural exchanged and internship program. I studied Mandarin for a week at BLCU, before spending my other 2 weeks in Shenzhen. Had the time of my life there.

I'm willing to work in any city on the main land, but would prefer (In Order) Guangzhuo, Shanghai, or Beijing. My wage is negotiable, but I've heard around 10, 000 - 20, 000RMB/month is a good wage. I'm obviously prepared to pay for my own flights, immigration costs, cost of living and that while over there. I don't need to live the high life, but a comfortable one is good.

What would you suggest for me to do? I have no idea where to start, but really keen to go.

Since March, we haven't fought about anything, we enjoy the same activities, same movies, same tv shows, we're both involved with each others families. I love him so much, he's my best friend and we always have so much fun together. We both just graduated from the same school in the same degree, but only I had found a job before we graduated - and that's where the problem arises. 

Back in April we had the big talk of ""what do we do when I move 12 hours away?"" and he couldn't give me an answer. He's had 2 bad LDRs, one of which ended with him being cheated on, and so he was hesitant to say either way, I on the other hand did LD for 4 years with my last bf and then stayed together for another year after the distance was resolved, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with LDRs going right. This resulted in some tense times, because every action made me think ""is this going to make him want to stay or make him want to leave?"" and so we had the talk again.

He said it was better to assume we wouldn't stay together so that I would be hoping for the best instead of waiting for the worst. And also because he just doesn't see long distance going well for him and he is already under a lot of pressure looking for a job. His family wants him to take any job he can get, but we have the kind of degree where you can be picky and get the job you want. He's interning 3 days a week right now to get more experience before applying for jobs in the fall, and all his parents seem to care about is that it's an unpaid internship. 

Anyways, I accepted this, but was obviously upset and still hoping for the best. I went away to travel Europe for 4 weeks and we did really well as far as communication went. We scheduled times to Skype and texted when I could, which ended up being a lot more frequently than I'd thought. Of course this got my hopes up even more.. If this is how well we do without being able to talk whenever we want then it could only get better when we're in the same time zone and country.

I bring this up a few weeks after the trip, if we're still breaking up and he says ""well I thought that was still the plan"". I bring up all my points and he says ""I know that long distance would be easiest with you, but if we stay together I'm going to spend my time wondering what you're doing and feeling unmotivated when I have to be focusing on finding a job."" It's still a possibility that he could get a job where I work, and he said that if he does then he wants to be with me again when he gets up there. 

It's been pretty rough since that last talk. It's hard for me to understand his point of view, because if we break up I see myself as wondering what he's doing and feeling unmotivated. All I can think is that if he loved me enough that he'd want to try, but to him it has nothing to do with that and I just don't get it. As it stands now, we're breaking up in exactly 2 weeks. He's driving me up to my new apartment and staying for a few days before flying home and that will be it. 

He says it's up to me if we want to stay friends or not, though he says he'd like to, and that's the main issue I'm struggling with now. There's still a chance we could end up in the same city, so what happens if we go no contact and then 4 months from now we're back in the same city? I'm also moving there with our 3 best friends/ roommates from college, so he really wants to be there and keep our gang together, so to speak. How would that work if we hadn't spoken? He's talking about coming to visit this winter to go snowboarding, then what? I just don't know what's best.  My hearts breaking, we're so right for each other I can't even picture a better relationship. What should I do?

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I are breaking up in 2 weeks because I'm moving away, although there's a possibility we could end up back in the same city come January. I'm also moving with our other best friends so regardless of the job he wants to come visit anyways. Do we stay friends? "
2bs51p,11,2014-07-26,What should I expect for a starting salary as an EE?,arbartz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2bs51p/what_should_i_expect_for_a_starting_salary_as_an/,"So, I've got 3 years ahead of me yet before I actually get my B.S. in EE, but I managed to score a sweet internship for this summer and the foreseeable future.  I just had my midterm performance review and they had nothing but good things to say.  They also made it clear that they could like me to stay on throughout my remaining 3 years and that if I do it will likely mean a guaranteed full time job as an EE.  

So no job searching, great, right?!  

Well after talking to some of the other engineers that I work with they asked me how much I think I'll make fresh out of college, I said somewhere between 65k and 75k...they laughed.  They didn't tell me any actual numbers though so I really don't know how high I was on my expectations.  Something to note, these were all ME's, I would be the company's first EE.  Which is surprising to me because I don't know how the company got to where they are today without an EE.  (We do LED lighting)

Do you guys have any thoughts on this in general or just what I can expect to make out of college?


Thanks!"

I was wondering this because, if i apply early wouldn't i need a college transcript of my classes, and wouldn't i need some programming experience, considering i have little to no knowledge of programming by the time i apply this September. i just wanted to know if their were people on this sub who applied really early and got into the programming who had no previous programming experience.

2btebo,2,2014-07-26,TIFU by telling a friend they could visit without specifying a time frame...,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2btebo/tifu_by_telling_a_friend_they_could_visit_without/,"Here's the story...

3 years ago this lovely foreign exchange student did an internship at my place of employment. We flirted heavily. One night I went to a party with all the students, and much to my surprise she ended up making out with one of them. Broke my heart to see it, I seriously thought we had some serious chemistry.

So, I faced reality, figured she was moving back to her home country anyway and dealt with the embarrassment of my shock at the party, which was made apparent to everyone by my actions of storming out of  said party immediately.

I tossed the emotions out of my mind after some time. Eventually, a year or so later we got to chatting here and there on the ol' FB and skyping from time to time. She has occasionally told me how sorry she was and she really made a mistake. We gave each other general compliments but never got romantic so to speak over the net.

Recently she told me she was going to vacation to America. Yay, right?! 

I told her she could definitely come visit, but we never really planned out or discussed a time period. 

I should mention I just took a new job as well, and am ridiculously busy with it. She knew this, but wanted to come visit anyway.

She sent an image of her plane ticket to my area, where I am the only one she knows(I've since moved states since she was here).

She plans to stay three weeks

Three! That's an eternity for a guy who generally likes his alone time, especially when dealing with a new high stress job.

Now she's here and she's been a saint about whatever I have to do. Hasn't complained, hasn't made it too tough on me.

However, she's come assuming I'm still extremely into her. She's pushing herself on me every night and as much as I like her as a person I can't just drum up these serious feelings for her over night, or even three weeks. I'm afraid I'm not goin to be able to feel anything. 

She's talked of how she's had dreams about me for the past couple of years. She's ridiculously into me for not having really talked to me consistently for a long time.

I've told her how stressed I am and how tough this is for me, going over a lot of what I mentioned above and how hard it is for me to just gain these feelings for her, yet she hasn't stopped pushing it.

What the hell should I do. She's got two weeks left here and I'm going batshit crazy.

Thanks reddit, had to vent. Here's hoping she or her friends aren't big redditors!

Any advice, much appreciated. Even a laugh.

I'll be a sophomore in the September, and I'll be starting my search soon for an internship in Summer 2015. I'm starting to look around for companies that I could apply to. 

So, there are a lot of questions on this subreddit that go along the lines of ""Should I work at a large megacorp or a trendy startup?"" And what I get from many of them is that if you're sufficiently young, you should be working for a startup. But very few of these talk about what kind of startups are good to simply intern for, the choice being between seed-stage startups, Series A companies, and Series B+ companies. From what I've been reading so far, seed startups will give you the most experience, although you'll also be compensated least for it, especially because stock options for internships are supposedly extremely rare, and the job security will be fairly unstable as well. Series A startups seem to give the best balance, but I'd like further insight from others.

I'm definitely leaning towards working at tech startups because the degree of flexibility they seem to be able provide and the casual working environment appeals more to me as a youth with no obligations, but I'm still not discounting large corporations. Overall, however, I just want to gain valuable technical experience working on projects I'm passionate about. 

So... any recommendations?"
2btiti,1,2014-07-26,"I'm a non traditional student in a few ways, I'm studying engineering, and I need some ideas to help boost my GPA (explanation inside). Any suggestions appreciated!",gwhlives,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2btiti/im_a_non_traditional_student_in_a_few_ways_im/,"So, I'm 29 years old, pursuing a bachelors in Electrical Engineering. I already have a degree from when I was younger from the same school, but back then I was an idiot and didn't care about anything important so I graduated with a 2.3 GPA. Now I'm back in school, my last three semesters were 3.7, 3.8, 4.0, but my cumulative GPA includes that first degree, so I am having some trouble breaking the 3.0 barrier that I need to start getting internships and that kind of thing. 

If I continue to perform as I have been, and I only take the courses required in my degree program, I will have a 2.94 by next summer and it HAS TO BE a 3.0, because the internship I really want is a government thing and there are no exceptions. I want to add some extra courses but the thing is, these next two semesters are the ""weed-out"" semesters for my program. The classes I am taking are all supposed to be super challenging, and I will have no free time at all as it is... so whatever class I take has to be something that has very little time commitment, so a low level math class would be perfect because I am pretty good at math... Ideally I could just show up on test day and hammer it out.

I was thinking of taking pre-calculus or something super easy since I've been living and breathing calculus for the last three semesters... Just finished Differential Equations this week. That's only three credits though, and I'll need at least six. Other then that though there isn't much I can think of, because I took college algebra back during the first college go-around... 

Winter session classes are probably not going to be an option because my student loans are only enough to cover spring and fall semesters, but worst-case-scenario I can take out a private loan because I simply have to have a 3.0 by next summer, end of story. 

Basically I'm just asking for any advice, ideas, tricks, ANYTHING that I could do to bring that GPA up with a minimal time commitment.

2btklk,87,2014-07-26,[f]ucking the older [M]an i've been wanting for months,lustyand20,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2btklk/fucking_the_older_man_ive_been_wanting_for_months/,"This is the story of the first time I tried to seduce someone.

I'm an intern in a small office with a mostly older staff. I'd been working there part time for about a year, when they filled the new office manager position with an outside hire. Charlie was 40ish, bearded, bespectacled and a little heavy around the middle, but I wanted him so badly from the moment I was introduced to him. I can't tell you why, but he was just so nervous and sweet and there was something sexy about the way he carries himself. But being a mostly shy girl, and realizing that a presumably married man of nearly fifty wouldn't even think about fucking the 20 year old intern, I tried to let it go. Well, I just masturbated furiously to the thought of him fucking me on his office desk. I couldn't stop myself from smiling at him in the hallways, or walking past his office while sucking on various phallic food objects (which makes me cringe thinking about it).

Two weeks ago, I was locked into an unbearable conversation with some of the office troll women, talking about Charlie's nasty divorce. Apparently his wife had cheated on him with some one she worked with. The thought of Charlie single and down to fuck made me so wet, and I decided to fuck all convention and stop being a quivering pussy about it. I've spent the last two weeks wearing see-through shirts and black bras. My skirts have been showing a peek of red thong anytime  he was looking for files near my vicinity. I could tell he noticed, he'd taken to staring at my forehead while having conversations with me, and avoiding me around the office, only to eyefuck my tits and ass when i was cleaning my glasses or ""working"". 

Last friday, I decided it was time to act. The office staff had left by 4:30, and he and I were basically the only ones in the office. When he left to talk to the boss, down the hall, I snuck into his office and stole every pen. Desperate, I know. I sat and waited for him to return, anticipating my move. I heard him coming down the hall, saying goodbye to my boss, who was leaving for the day. I poked my head around the hall and said goodbye as well, and lingered outside Charlie's desk, waiting for him to realize and run the supply closet. As soon as he did, I followed, waiting until the door clicked shut. I quickly stripped off my sweater and opened the door, locking it behind me when it shut. 

He was surprised to say the least. He turned around quickly and his face was priceless. The sweater I'd been wearing was hiding a tight, mid drift reaching white camisole, my tits bursting out of it with the help of a push up bra. He was in a panic, but I could see him staring at my now heaving chest. I'd never been so nervous as I took the two steps to basically press myself up against him. I kept eye contact as I reached over to stroke his groin. Through the thin fabric i could feel the outline of a giant cock. I had to dart my eyes down to make sure I wasn't crazy, and there it was, straining against his pants, and absolutely huge. I looked up at him with big doe eyes, and whispered ""wow"".He looked like he was about to die as I grabbed his now hard cock through his pants and put my other hand on his face. I pulled him into a kiss, my heart beating like crazy. His mouth was soft and hesitant and i could feel his cock twitching under my hand. I undid his belt and reached inside his briefs. My mouth dropped open, my small hand could barely fit around his fat dick. He could see it too, and he moaned softly. I stroked him once, my thumb circling his head. He still seemed nervous, so I pulled back, retracting my hand from his now bulging cock. I grabbed one of his hands and moved it under my skirt, to my soaking wet thong. He started breathing heavily as he touched my wetness.

I leaned into him, my breasts pushing into him, and stood on tip toes to reach his ear. ""See how wet I am?I want you. Monday.""

And I left. The friday cleaning crew would be there any second, and I didn't want to risk it. That weekend was the longest two days of my life. I even held off on masturbating because I wanted him to take me completely and full force-the anticipation would be worth it. 

When Monday rolled around, I couldn't even sit still at work. But I knew he wouldn't make a move until the office had emptied out. There was no cleaning crew on Monday, and most people would be gone by five. I focused on my work , ignoring his stares and gawks all day. 4:59 I got a call from his office extension.

""could uh.. could you come into my office please""

I forced myself to walk across the hall slowly. When I walked into his office and closed the door, he was standing, looking sheepishly at me, the outline of his hard cock visible through his pants. Oh god. I started freaking out inside my head that it wouldn't fit. But I tried to be the confident sex crazed office intern I needed to be to get that man inside me. I leaned on the door, and smiled at him. Fuck, I was too nervous to actually say all the dirty shit I had thought up from months of fantasizing about this moment. He smiled back and walked towards me, stopping at the edge of his desk. 

""What was that yesterday?"" he was clearly still looking for the go ahead, so I took two steps to him.

I looked up at him, towering over me. ""I want you to fuck me"" and I reached out to stroke his cock. ""I saw how you looked at me yesterday, when I touched you, and I can tell you want me."" He watched me as I lightly squeezed his dick and kept looking up at him. Fuck I was going to have to go further. He'd taken off his belt, so slick, so i undid his pants and pulled out his cock. He was so turned on, and as I dropped to my knees, i knew I'd have to be careful with how I touched him if I wanted him to impale me with that monster dick. I could barely get it in my mouth, my horrible gag reflex choking me with every inch i took. He was moaning like crazy, and grabbed my head with his hands. ""Oh, suck it, fuck, oh fuck"". The words almost made me pass out. I pulled him out of my mouth, licking the length of his shaft, and stood up.

"" I want you inside me."" He wasn't about to argue. I slid off my panties and hiked up my skirtHe started fumbling through his drawers and pulled out a condom, raising an eyebrow at me. "" I'm on the pill"", I said while sitting up on his desk. I took his fat cock and started rubbing my cunt lengthwise. He pawed at my shirt, managing to yank it over my head. He moved the soft cups to the side and began sucking on my now hypersensitive nipples, biting and licking  and moaning against them. It was unbelievable. He pulled back, grabbing his cock from me, and positioning it right at my opening. I looked up at him. ""When's the last time you were inside a 20 year old girl?"" He sank into me, the feeling was so tight and full my eyes rolled back into my head. He let out a loud groan.

""Fuck you're so tight. God oh fuck"" he moaned over and over as he started to push in and out of me, slowly, filling me more and more with his cock. He pushed me back onto the desk, as i wrapped my legs around his thick waist, letting him pound his girthy dick into me. He started to groan and seethe, and i was pretty sure he'd blow soon. He kept it up for much longer than i expected, letting me rock into him. My orgasm was building, and I could feel all the anticipation making my toes numb and my face hot. ""Fuck, I'm so close' I panted into his ear. Charlie looked at me with just lusty eyes and a half open mouth, and slammed his cock into me over and over, fucking me so hard my sweaty ass almost slid across the table. I let out a half scream, my orgasm sending shakes across my body. He pounded into me for a second or two more before he came, groaning loudly into my chest. He kissed my nipples as he pulled out, making me groan. He stretched me out like crazy, and I could barely get off the desk. He pushed two fingers inside me, and felt the sloppy wet mess inside my pussy. ""Is that what you wanted?"" he asked me, looking me dead in the eye as he withdrew his fingers. i sucked them dry and smiled, and he slid me off the desk and sank into his office chair. I sat on his lap, playing with his flaccid cock, pretty sure he was spent for now. We made out for a little, but I saw little point if i couldnt have his dick inside me, so I helped him clean off the table, and pulled down my skirt. He pocketed my red thong, before slapping my ass and telling me to get out of his office. 

This isn't the only story, let me know if you want more. "
2btp08,7,2014-07-26,What should I be doing to get a job in professional astronomy?,khyperiaa,askastronomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/askastronomy/comments/2btp08/what_should_i_be_doing_to_get_a_job_in/,"I hope this is a good place to ask this question... I'm not sure of where else I could.

Last night, I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jI92PTrO9E), and something dawned upon me - that's something that I would utterly love to be doing as a job. However, I'm clueless as to where to start and what to be doing to get to that.

Some backstory, hopefully gives you some ideas of where you could point me: I am a recently-graduated high school student going to college in a month to study computer science. I'm a mostly self-taught programmer (with a few formal classes that didn't help at all), [here's](https://github.com/khyperia/Astropress) an example of something I just did related to astronomy. I've completed calc 2, basic high-school physics, a college astronomy course, all that fun stuff. Currently have a digital signal processing internship, doing programming. I'm very into [amateur astrophotography](http://www.astrobin.com/users/khyperia/).

So, what I would love to be doing is professional astronomy software development - perhaps not the science of astronomy itself, more the technicals behind it (the scope, the software, the processing). I did some googling around and stumbled across [this](http://www.maunakeaastronomyjobs.org/jobs/temporary-system-programmer.html), which sounds incredibly perfect (albeit out of reach, given that I haven't even started college yet). So, my questions:

* What should I be studying in college? Where should I be focusing, etc.? (Masters CS program, or physics, or what?)
* Are there any resources you could point me to so I can learn more? I know almost nothing about professional astronomy, other than it is incredibly fascinating and that amateur astronomy is very fun for me.
* Are there any programs (e.g. internships) based around astro programming that I can get involved with ""soon""? (as in within a year or so)

Thanks! And again, if this is a bad place to ask, could you possibly advise someplace better?"

Lots of little worries piled up.",h2g2guy,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/2bu289/half_rant_half_asking_for_advice_lots_of_little/,"Please bear with me; this is probably going to be long and more or less 'stream of consciousness'.  Before I begin, let me just say that the purpose of this is half to just get out all my worries, fears, and issues, and half to search for some semblance of advice or helpful encouragement.  

-----

By all reasonable metrics, I live a good life.  Going into my fourth year in college; happy, calm home life; no significant money troubles; and I've got pretty much all the material possessions I need to do anything I enjoy.  But so many little fears and worries and difficulties have been adding up lately that I'm starting to have some real difficulty handling it all -- and for some of this issues, much is at stake.  

First off, in order to get my degree, I'm required to do two semesters of 'cooperative education' (co-op), which is essentially being a paid intern for a semester and having my employer report back to the college on the experience.  I've got only one semester of classes left, and I haven't done any co-ops yet.  I don't even have one lined up for the fall, and I didn't register for classes for the fall in anticipation of getting a co-op.  

And everything inside of me is fighting against me even applying.  After a terribad first career fair a year or two ago, my confidence (which used to be through the roof) is completely shot.  I don't feel capable of getting any position anywhere.  And considering that I'm majoring in game design and development, and the market for that field is already saturated, the few applications I do send go absolutely nowhere.  The particularly interesting this is that I'm the guy most of my friends go to for programming help, and I generally consider myself a pretty good applicant for many of these jobs... I just have no confidence in my ability to actually *get* one.

But enough about college; I just need to start getting out some resumes to solve that problem.  

I like to draw ponies.  It's something I can really enjoy.  It's the process more than the finished result, though I always do like looking at stuff I've drawn that I'm happy with.  

Trouble is, I can never think of something good to draw for any period of time.  Maybe I'll have a good stretch for a few days, but then that dries up and I end up not drawing just because I can't come up with an idea I'm satisfied with.  And since I don't draw for a while, when I come back to it, my quality's dipped because I'm out of practice.  Then I get frustrated and fed up, proceed to not draw for a longer while, dip in quality even MORE, and come back once I'm ready to tackle the learning curve again.  This has been repeating ad infinitum pretty much since I started drawing 2 1/2 years ago, with the only redeeming quality being that there has been significant improvement in my skills over ALL that time.  

I also enjoy sewing and making plushies.  Can't find the motivation anymore, though.  It's too much work just to get the stuff out, much less drafting a pattern and trying to figure out what happened when things don't turn out right.  (Not to mention that I really, really want to make a hat for myself to wear at Bronycon.)

Ah, yes, Bronycon.  The one bright spot on the horizon.  I'll get to see a great friend that I only see about twice a year, and we'll have a spectacular weekend of fun.  Except...

At the last Bronycon, the ending ceremonies contained a live performance of ""Proud to be a Brony"", and I couldn't help myself not to think that my overall attitude and the kind of person I had been in the preceding year had declined.  I used to be a 'capital B Brony', attacking life's challenges with the morals and teachings from the show, and overall trying to be the absolute best person I knew I could be.  But starting probably sometime around a year and a half ago, things started changing, and I slumped back into the depressive, bored, ambivalent, sad sack that I had been before discovering the show.  Something feels missing.  I just can't care about anything as much anymore.  And when I look back at the person that I was -- an optimistic, fun-loving person who cared infinitely about everything and everyone -- I almost feel like something in me is dead.  

One spark of light in the tunnel was a few days ago, when I decided to test myself.  ""The Smile Song"" means a lot to me.  It was one of the parts of the show that I wanted to emulate the most -- I, too, really enjoy making others happy, which is why I used to frequent this very subreddit from time to time trying to help other people.  

So I put on that episode, and when the song came on, I almost cried.  A beautiful, glorious rush of emotions, just like I used to have.  That bit in me that I thought was dead, isn't; it's just locked away somehow.  

But the next day, all of that was forgotten, and I proceeded to go back to my slothful, depressive day-to-day life.  

-----

I think that about covers it.  Again, I apologize for the length.  

I feel like my first step in getting out of this slump is to unlock that light inside of me.  The second step is to start doing things I love again, like drawing, sewing, and communicating with friends.  And the third is to transition into being a productive person again.  

The problems with this plan are twofold:  first off, I have no idea how to do step one; and secondly, I really need to start sending out resumes and job applications sooner rather than later, and I just have no motivation to do that.  

Thanks for listening, and if you've got any sort of questions or comments or encouragement, please comment.  Talking to someone who cares about the situation will, at the very least, help me in the short term :)"

Her and her husband are swingers so he doesn't care if she sleeps with other men but the other guy's wife doesn't know. She says the wife deserves it because she doesn't have enough sex with him.

She calls me drunk and says horrible things about my other friends, who are nothing but amazing to me and can take care of themselves. Texts me at work telling me she feels disgusting and fat. You can see her abs and she is about 110 lbs and I am about 145. I feel attractive and everything but it's like....does she not think about how that might make me feel? To be fair I do talk about how I fill out my clothes better and get attention from guys and stuff so even just objectively I know I look good, but still. If I was a regular insecure girl I would be super upset.

I gave her a pair of shoes which were my first pair of heels, I got them when I was 19 because and gave them to her because she was super upset and kept saying she felt ugly. They do have sentimental value to me but she's my friend and she loved them so I gave them to her.

She hacked them up with a steak knife. Literally she said they were better this way even though they are incredibly malformed now. I could have kept them or given them to one of my other friends who liked them. She said who cares as long as I still wear them? [That friend that wanted them also who I said no to] is a horrible person anyway. Fuck her she doesn't deserve them, she said. Who the fuck destroys a pair of shoes or even just a gift for no reason. I HOPE she was drunk and not sober, jesus christ. I told her I was angry because it was a waste she said oh is this [other friend's name] talking? as if I cannot disagree with her (anybody that disagrees with her is automatically the worst person alive and yet she goes on weird daily rants about how she hates close minded people). She said talk to me when you calm down and when I didn't in the morning she said ""is our nearly decade's long friendship less important to you than a silly pair of shoes? okay. petty.""

4 rounds to ZERO not ten. That is very manipulative and a blatant stupid ass lie. 

Am I within my rights to be like please just talk to me when you're sober? I work 40 hours now at an internship, soon I'll have school, I'm working on a programming project outside of work, I have other friends and am trying to date. I am fucking **TIRED** to be dealing with this all day every day. 

edit: my friend just brought up that I work in IT, friend she hates the most is doing residency and thus a doctor, other friend she doesn't like is also a programmer. She tells me I am lying that programmers have good job prospects and I don't understand because I am too young and naive and she has real work experience. She can only get temp jobs because she did not study very much and didn't seek out internships or anything so he said she probably HATES that we are all doing well in our careers. "

The two classes are both required CS classes, one being Design and Analysis of Algorithms and the other being Stochastic Models for Computer Science. I already took a Data Structures and Algorithms class, so I already have experience with algorithms, but I know that a whole class of algorithms would probably be very helpful when I apply to internships (and if I get interviews) like I am planning on doing this winter. However, the professor for this class has really terrible scores online (not just scores saying he is a hard teacher, but that he is a BAD teacher) while the stoachastic models professor has pretty great reviews (he is hard, but a good professor). I have passed all of my classes but some of them haven't been with the best grades, so I don't really want to end up taking a class with a bad professor since it might hurt my gpa even more, but I also feel like another Algorithms class would be very useful to take. Can anyone offer me any advice?"
2buj6n,2,2014-07-27,I don't love my girlfriend,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2buj6n/i_dont_love_my_girlfriend/,"Throwaway. This is probably super mundane but I need some way to vent.

I'm a male college student and I've been in a relationship with a girl for 11 months now. This Summer I took an internship at a company that's far away from where she's living, and we've been doing the long-distance thing for these few months.

I realized there was an issue when I started to have a crush on one of my co-workers. She's smart and sophisticated, well-travelled, very pretty, multi-talented... We also share several similar interests and have developed a great rapport between us over the course of the Summer. 

So many of these things I just cannot say about my girlfriend. We have a very narrow overlap of interests. I can't talk about anything remotely philosophical with her; she says I'm being ""too deep"" and shuts down the conversation. She hates traveling and is fearful when it comes to discovering new places, ideas, and people.

I feel like an asshole for saying this, but I feel like she's not all that attractive, and that I could do better. I've literally had people look at pictures of her on Facebook and say to my face, ""I guess you just like bigger girls,"" and, ""yeah I mean she looks ok, I guess."" It makes me wary of telling people that I have a girlfriend. Of course attractiveness is not the sole reason to date/not date someone, but it still has an effect on how I view her.

So a thought that you (and I) might have is, ""well, just break up with her."" What would I say? How do I explain that I've fallen out of love with her, or never even loved her in the first place and simply said/say the words ""I love you?""  I feel so guilty for wanting to break up with her, given that she's literally done nothing to me to deserve it. She's one of the sweetest and kindest people that I've met, she really does love me, and I can tell that I'm hurting her when I can't show the same love in return.

Her group of friends would make breaking up with her even more complicated. She's had a number of bad boyfriends in the past who have cheated on her or otherwise been shitty, and her friends have become very protective of her. I've had friends of hers tell me that if I screwed her over, they would kill me. I don't know how seriously to take that threat...

I feel stuck going down one of two paths. On one path, I try to patch up or force down these feelings and continue to be with my girlfriend. On the other path, I break up with her and deal with the emotional (and potentially physical) fallout, along with damning myself to the single life again.

My current solution is to wait until this Summer is over, spend some time with her in person, and see if these feelings persist. If they do, I'll break up with her, which would be shitty but necessary. This intervening time seems sooooo loooong though. It's killing me that every time I talk to my girlfriend I get this sense of dread that everything that once felt comfortable and right and happy is now so unsatisfying and irritating and even boring, while every time I talk to my co-worker crush I get all excited about the idea of us being together.

How do you gauge whether or not being alone is better than being with someone you don't love?

TL;DR: I feel guilty that I don't love my girlfriend. Neither breaking up nor staying together seem like ideal solutions."

Apologies in advance, that this is a paste from german, as english is not my native language (the model names are english though)

Here is the current build:


1 x CPU Intel Core i5 4570 4x 3.20GHz So.1150 TRAY

1 x MB Asus Z87-A (C2) Intel Z87 So.1150 Dual Channel DDR3 ATX Retail

1 x DDR3 16GB (2x 8192MB) GeIL EVO Corsa DDR3-1600 DIMM CL9-9-9-28 Dual Kit

1 x PSU 630 Watt Thermaltake Berlin Non-Modular 80+

1 x CPUK Scythe Katana 4

1 x SSD 120GB SanDisk Extreme SSD 2.5"" (6.4cm) SATA 6Gb/s MLC synchron (SDSSDX-120G-G25)

1 x HDSA 1000GB Seagate Desktop HDD ST1000DM003 7.200U/min 64MB 3.5"" (8.9cm) SATA 6Gb/s



The problematic part is currently the mainboard, because the PC refuses to boot and shows a red cpu LED which is, according to asus forums, a relatively common problem with the series. It could be likely fixed with replacing the PSU - according to asus forums - but my friend wants to be sure and buy a new mainboard.

What would you suggest as an alternative?

Thanks in advance!"
2butr0,31,2014-07-27,Episode 1 Questions,[deleted],jakeandamir,https://www.reddit.com/r/jakeandamir/comments/2butr0/episode_1_questions/,"I recently realised that a lot of the bits and jokes we love in IIWY are usually related to questions; that's how I figure out which episode *I'm* looking for. So I'm writing up the questions from episodes for y'all, and maybe those of you who are devoting years of your lives to transcribing the show can use this to save a few months of typing. I'll edit this over time.

**Episode 1**:

* *I have a huge crush on my barista. How do I ask her for her number without seeming like a total creep? Also, I want to be able to go to their Starbucks again.* - Tram Hamburger
* *My girlfriend and I was invited to a fancy dinner by my boss and his wife. We want to say yes, but we can't afford it. Do you think we will pay, or they will pay? Do they expect us to pay? How do I go about asking them?* - Girlstend Den
* *My best friend wants to work at my company, and my boss emailed me to ask for a recommendation. I love her, but I know she will be an awful employee. Do I tell the truth and have her not get the job? Or should I be a good friend and recommend her?* - Taminy Jenkins
* *I live with 3 dudes and we want to move to a place with just 2 of them. Do we just kick the third guy out, or move to another place? We love our apartment. Help.* - QD Zeb
* *My mom painted me a gift for Mother's Day (I just had my first child), a painting of me holding my infant daughter, which seems nice, but it's really ugly. Do I need to hang it up?* - Boxalina Jarface

**Episode 2**:

* *I am a male in high school. I recently caught my best friend's girlfriend cheating on him. We have been really close friends for a long time and I know how upset he would be if he found out. Should I tell him about this, or should I let him find out about it on his own eventually? I already talked to the guy she slept with, and believe me, he got what he deserved. Any advice.*  - Kardick Minst
* *I own a cat. It constantly wants to cuddle with me, but I'm allergic. Help! What do I do?* - DeJordan Molasses
* *Hey Amir and Jake, my brother's thinking about buying a motorcycle, but I think it's too dangerous. He's wrecked every single car he's owned, and has miraculously survived them all. I think if he gets a Harley he might be pushing his luck. Please help me convince him that he has more to live for, or to convince me that I'm just being over-concerned.* - Fence L
* *Hey Amir and Jake, going on a vacation with a friend and a group of her friends who I have never met. Hoping to make a move on my friend whilst we're down there, however, would this be considered a bad first impression upon the ex-boyfriend, who is part of the group that I don't know? From your long-time admirer in England.* - Professor van Strassenbourg
* *I just moved to the middle of Butt F. Nowhere in Ohio for my internship and i'm extremely bored with nothing to do. I finished exploring, and the Internet here makes a hour's show on Netflix take four hours to download. What should I do? Don't say masturbate.* - Skinny Dennis
* *What's the fastest possible way to get a six-pack? Don't make this a joke about going to the supermarket. I'm not fat, I'm really lazy, and I want to spend as few minutes as possible working out. Maybe you guys have some tips.* - Portrend Dale
* *Hey Amir and Jake, just finished my senior year of highschool and I've recently met a girl that I like. We live in Long Island and I'm going to the University of Vermont, which is a 6 hour drive from my house. My question is, should I get into a full-on relationship with her considering college is only 3 months away? If so, do I end the relationship before I go to college, or try long-distance?* - Sanny San

**Episode 3**:

* *My problem is that I hang out with a group of kids in my school that would be considered as 'the cool kids', and I feel like they don't really like me. I don't know why since I try my best to be fun; I always try to smell great and I'm usually the funniest guy in the group. We like hang out a lot in school, but after school it seems like they try to avoid me and keep me from hanging out with them. So why do they only like me in school and not afterwards?* - Peter
* *I'm 21 and from Australia. I was at my girlfriend's house the other night and I needed to fart badly. We've only been dating for a month, and we're still in that honeymoon phase where everything is cute and innocent. I held it in for hours and let it brew until I got home. As I was leaving her house she hugged me so tight it forced it out of me. Needless to say I was terribly embarrassed. What would you do if you guys needed to fart badly in that situation?*
* *In the office I work in we have a lady who that sits nearby and eats her lunch at her desk each day. The issue is she brings in this one meal in most days of the week and it smells very bad. It's some sort of microwavable Asian noodle dish and it smells very pungent. It almost burns your nose. My friend and I can only describe it as smelling what MSG might smell like along with large amounts of sodium. It takes about 30 minutes for the smell to die down in the room we're in... gross. My friend and I comment how bad it smells. (Basically what would you do if you had to tell someone at work that her food that she brings in everyday smells so bad?)* - Don
* *Hey guys, I hooked up with one of my friends for about a week. One morning after I left her apartment she told me she didn't want to keep it up, because she was developing real feelings for me and she couldn't do that because she was moving across the country after college. She said we could still be friends and i was totally cool with how it ended. Since then we haven't talked, and every time we run into each other she avoids eye contact and tries to keep as far away as possible.*
* *I've just started dating a girl. Things are going really well, though she keeps texting me at work all the time. It's kinda cute, I guess, but I also have a lot of work to do. What should I do to get her to text me less, without just ignoring her?* - Peggy
* *Dear Jake and Amir, I just finished my freshman year of college at Syracuse University, and I didn't really like it because there were too many leggings and Ugg boots, so I applied to transfer. Now I'm deciding if I should go back to school at Syracuse next year, or if I should go to the University of Wooster in Ohio. The people at College of Wooster seem cooler but the academics aren't as good. What should I do?* -Joan

**Episode 4**:

* *I've been feeling pretty guilty about what I've been doing to a girl who likes me. I know that this girl is into me because she has told me that she is, and has asked if I wanted to date her and when she did I told her I thought she was really great but I couldn't be where she is right now because I have a lot going on, which is a lie. I just kind of like the fact that she's attracted to me. Am I a dick?* - Jamie
* *Hey guys, long time listener first time writer. My girlfriend is still really close to her ex. Whenever I tell her that I don't feel comfortable with him being in her life, she gets really offended and says things like ""Do you not trust me?"". I trust her, I just don't trust him. He's been at the centre of most of our relationship problems and I don't think it's healthy for her to be friends with him. What should I do?* - Rob
* *I have a girlfriend, but I think I want to be single. Things are going smoothly and she has no idea I'm having doubts. Is it better to attempt to distance myself to give her an idea, or just to be straight up and come out honestly, and tell her I want to break up?* - Tyrion
* *Help! I told my school counselor that I wanted to kill myself last week (as a joke), and now they want me to come in for weekly Suicide Watch check-ups, but really I was just being dramatic and I don't need their help. How do I get out of it without everyone thinking I'm suicidal?* - 
* *Hey Jake and Amir, I've started seeing this girl. She's really nice and everything, but I recently found out she's a virgin and plans on saving herself for marriage. To me, a physical attraction is important to a relationship, so should I stop seeing her, or are there ways to be intimate without going past 'second base'?*
* *Here's my problem. My friend is 230lbs. I, on the other hand, am very petite, so when we go out partying I wear revealing clothing, and so then she thinks it's okay for her to do the same. I want to tell her she's embarrassing herself but I don't know how. How do I tell her that the clothes that she wears aren't flattering, without straight-out telling her that she's fat? I still want her to come out and party with me.* - Ahria(?)
* *Hi, I'm a female in high school, and I have to apply for colleges in the summer. I have had my mind made up for a couple years that I'm going to school for engineering, and all the schools I've looked at are mainly engineering schools. All of a sudden, I feel like I don't want to be an engineer any more. I told my parents and they got mad. I know it's too late to change my mind now, and I don't even know what I'd rather do, but I feel like this is going to be the biggest regret of my life.* - Cerce

**Episode 5**:

* *I'm in secondary school in the UK, and I'm starting to be accepted into the more cool/normal group, however I've many nerdy/weird friends and they often invite me to gatherings I don't want to attend. Also, meeting the nerdier group damages my friendship with the more normal group. How do I break away from them without seeming mean or obsessed with being 'cooler'?* - Lucille
* *On the bus to university the other day I was talking about how much I wanted to slam this girl, only to find out she was sitting 2 rows behind me and well within earshot, and was 'disgusted' by what she heard me said. How should I go about rectifying this situation so we can still hopefully get down and dirty in the near future? Jake, how do I go about this?* - George Michael
* *Hey guys, I'm really excited to get my first car and my Dad can't wait to help me and advise me on one. He always talks about going to a car auction to get my first car and is clearly excited about it. However, I don't feel as if he has a great knowledge on cars, and I don't want to risk getting a terrible car that keeps breaking, but I also don't want to hurt his feelings. Do I go with him and spend money on a potentially bad car, or go with someone else, such as my best friend's Dad (who is a professional mechanic) behind his back?* - Tobias
* *It has been a long, lifelong goal of mine to catch a foul ball at a baseball game. I was at a baseball game recently with my girlfriend and we were sitting on the third base line. It was the top of the fourth and I hear the crack of the bat. All of a sudden the ball's coming right for us. I brought my glove to the park that day; I reached up and I caught it. Here's where it starts to get tricky. I showed it to my girlfriend and she told me to give it to the kid who was sitting next to me. I tell her ""No, this is mine, I've been waiting 23 years for this moment"". The kid heard her say that I should give the ball to him and now he's staring at me. I still decline. After an argument I reluctantly give the kid the ball. My girlfriend is still pissed at me that I didn't give it to him right away. What should I have done/do?* - Buster
* *Hey Amir and Jake, my name is Lindsay, and I'm in a bit of a predicament. I live in one of the rougher neighbourhoods in Canada and recently learned that one of my best friends stole my LED TV. It went missing a month ago, and just two weeks ago my friend invited me over to play XBox on what I think is my old TV. I'm afraid to confront him about it because I don't want to lose him as a friend. Help me Amir and Jake, you're my only hope.* - Lindsay

**Episode 6**:

* *My parents despise tattoos. They just really really hate them and privately make fun of people with tattoos when they see them in public. My new boyfriend has a tattoo on his neck and shoulder to the lyrics of Hey Ya by Outkast (don't ask). My parents want him to come over for dinner. Covering up the tattoo with a scarf would be very difficult since the weather is warm right now. What should I do?* - Lucinda
* *I just started a new job last week which I'm extremely qualified for, and know I am capable of doing any task they give me, but it seems that because I am pretty good-looking they have been assuming that I am stupid and have only been giving me really simple jobs, and when they do give me something more challenging they always check up on me to see if I need any help, but I don't. How do I get them to stop treating me like a moron?* - Luanne
* *So I've been dating this girl for 5 years. Out of nowhere she breaks up with me through text message. WTF? She says it's because I'm not happy, she says it's because she wants to be in love, she says it's because she's depressed. She's telling me all these conflicting things and I'm just one confused puppy. What should I do?* - Louis
* *When I was younger my sister and I would talk about naming our children after each other. Well, now I'm going to have a baby in December and she's constantly asking what I plan to name the baby. I hate to break her heart, but there are so many other baby name options that i can't decide whether to stick to our original plan of naming the baby after my sis, or choosing a new updated and modern name. If you were me, what would you do?* - Laura Dern
* *I don't usually date girls, I generally just have one-night-stands and friends-with-benefits relationships. However, girls always ask me to date, even though I'm an asshole. My question is, how do I tell a girl I'm scared of getting into a relationship and I don't know why, without hurting her or making it sound like the whole 'it's not me, it's you' routine?* - Leviathan

2bv5zr,2,2014-07-27,My boyfriend [31 M] of 1 year just broke up with me [24 F] after long distance of 3 months. Should we get back together?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bv5zr/my_boyfriend_31_m_of_1_year_just_broke_up_with_me/,"Please help; I feel like a wreck.


   My boyfriend and I met at graduate school. We've known each other for 2 years and have been dating for 1. Neither of us are from the city that we're going to school in. Our respective ""homes"" are about an 18 hour drive from each other this summer. The way our school system works, we have an internship during the summer and we're both back home during this time. The break lasts about 15 weeks.



   While we were together at school, our relationship was very healthy. We're both motivated and driven. We were emotionally supportive of each other, trusted each other completely, made time for each other, made each other laugh, were attracted to each other, and there were no jealousy issues. We both did sweet things for each other like picking up a treat or flowers at the end of a long week for the other one. I was in awe of being in such a healthy and happy relationship. I think he was too. We were also a large part of each other's escape from the grind of school.



   The summer has been... challenging. He's at a much more prestigious company than I am and has been working very long hours. He sometimes won't be home until 10 or 11 pm. For the first half of the summer, I dealt with it with no complaints. I also visited him in early July for 3 days. The second half of the summer, I was a bit more vocal about feeling as though we weren't making enough time for each other. I maybe was a bit unfair about the amount I blamed him for it, but in reality it was his work schedule and the fact he wanted to go out with work friends. (He ALWAYS told me where he was and texted me when he got home safely. I have absolutely zero suspicion of cheating occurring.) 



   Two days ago, I told him I was feeling neglected recently this summer and as though he was prioritizing a lot of things over his time with me. I expressed concern because we will be graduating in 2015 and each have jobs lined up in our respective homes. We've discussed this before and we're both open to moving to each other if we're still together then, but it hasn't been established which of us would move. I said that I just missed him and wanted to feel as important as I did at school to him.



He agreed that I hadn't been a priority and said that he was sorry. He told me he loved me (this was the first time he had told me that, I hadn't said it either yet) and he had for a long time. He also agreed that the summer hadn't been working.



   Then he dropped a bombshell. He said that didn't see this being different after school and he didn't see us surviving the distance. He stated that he didn't think he could have done the summer differently and he felt as though he wasn't giving me his best. He concluded that because we wouldn't survive then, he didn't want to be together now because it would just make it all the more painful when we eventually broke up. He told me that he was heartbroken and he hadn't planned on breaking up with me, but that he knew the distance wasn't going all that well when I agreed to go see him instead of him coming to me this summer. He just kept saying ""I'm so sorry"" over and over. He said that he never once doubted our relationship until the summer began and that he was surprised that it was ending this way.



   Eventually he told me that he just had to go, as it was late and his brother was coming into town the next day. This was Friday night. It's now Sunday and we haven't spoken or exchanged any communication. I'm trying to give him a little bit of space to think this over. Right now, my plan is to wait until his brother leaves (Tuesday) and then give him a bit of time to be alone and reflect. I was planning on contacting him this upcoming Friday or Saturday (7/8 days after we talked). He's a very pessimistic person about a lot of things (exams going well, getting internships, his sports teams winning) even when usually things go right for him. I think that could be at play here as well.



  When we talk, I want to ask him whether it was the distance or the relationship. It doesn't sound like he ""fell out of love"" with me, it sounds like he had a hugely busy summer and feels guilty about not making enough time for me. I can deal with compromise for a year or two while he establishes his career.  I also haven't been sitting around pining; I've been busy with my own thing. 



  Reddit: Do you think I should try to talk to him or just let it go? He and I have huge odds to overcome but I didn't have a single doubt until now. Frankly, I'm scared of moving away from my home with all my friends and family. But I also don't believe in everyone having ""the one"" and I don't think he's my absolute last shot at happiness. I just know that he complements my life extremely well and I haven't felt like this about someone else before. 



  Do you view his reasoning as valid or do you think that he's just afraid of losing me and is bailing before it get worse? How could I trust him not to bail as soon as things got challenging again? Is it possible this is just a line (i.e. he fell out of love and just doesn't want to hurt me)?

tl;dr: After 3 months temporary long distance, boyfriend broke up with me because it was hard and a longer separation is looming in the future (with it being necessary for one of us to move to the other). Want to know if it's worth fighting for and hear other experiences similar (both failed and successful). Also would like input on what to say when I call him back"
2bv7ze,5,2014-07-27,(17f) wants to be friends with me (17/m) a week after she dumped me in a 2yr relationship,michaelcooll,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2bv7ze/17f_wants_to_be_friends_with_me_17m_a_week_after/,"I posted in the Sunday thread but I felt as if I needed a whole long post to explain everything and how I feel and what exactly is going on. We were friends for about 6 months prior to our relationship but we had feelings for eachother within the first month. She's the type of girl who doesn't like relationships and it took me 5 months of an emotional rollercoaster to get her to date me. The first year was great we did everything together. We hung out 24/7 texted and talked on phone/Skype. But I have anxiety and it makes it hard for me to sleep. I would get 2-3 hours a night and at first I felt I could handle it, but the past year has been rough. I'm tired all the time and was really irritable and it started to affect my relationship with my friends and with my at the time girlfriend. Basically it was going downhill we pretty much only had sex and that was it. She would come to my house but I would just fall asleep on her. Recently she moved about an hour away to pursue an internship and our relationship would have to survive off of communication. Needless to say it didn't. She said she just wants to be friends and I think she says that because she misses how we were freshman year and all the great times we had together. And I'm okay with being friends too. I miss 9th grade us too. It's not like I liked our relationship either it was rough. But now I just miss her and I know she has no interest in being with me again it seems like. She's on vacation so she has been giving me a little bit of the cold shoulder because she needs space but she tells her friends that she wants to be friends and only friends. My concern is that if we consistently talk/hang out and generally have a good time my feelings for her will resurface and hers won't. That's how she is. She's stubborn and tough. She doesn't let emotion control her.  And at this point I'm back and forth on a emotional rollercoaster telling myself one moment that if I be her friend long enough I don't see why we wouldn't get back together if all goes well but the other part of me believes what she's saying, but I also feel it's a lot easier to say the kind of stuff she is telling me and her friends because she isn't around me and all she remembers is why she broke up with me. We are hanging out Thursday and the anticipation is killing me"
2bv8gh,2,2014-07-27,Should I defer school? How do I build up a strong case for that?,superfroyo,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2bv8gh/should_i_defer_school_how_do_i_build_up_a_strong/,"Hi Reddit, 

I do not like what I am studying now (Business), I only took it because I knew I could score well in it if I put in the effort to study, and also because my parents say that getting a diploma in what I like (mass communications) is 'useless'. This also seems pretty lame but I also went into Business because I thought the school culture would be fun, but no.

But in order to enter the course, I just said that I liked business... WELL, yes I do intend to start my own business in the future... but yeah.

Sure enough, I've a rather good GPA of 3.7 out of 4.0. But honestly I feel so drained whenever I do my assignments because it really bores me, and I don't see the point in pursuing a business degree, honestly how many successful entrepreneurs even have one? 

and now I know that I would much rather do something I like &amp; gain more experiences out of it. 

Here is the situation, I can't transfer courses anymore because it's my second out of three years. 

I can either choose to fight to defer one semester in order to take marketing communications, which is the most closely linked 'specialisation' to my field of interest -- mass communications, because I really like to design and honestly I love the media industry even though I may not go into it in the future... I guess it's just the self motivation to learn more about it even though I don't necessarily have to, like how to photoshop and how to use illustrator, teaching myself in the process!

Or I can choose not to defer (which the school wants me to do) and just specialise in entrepreneurship &amp; marketing (without the design aspect...), and I feel so tired just thinking about that. And I know for sure after I complete my studies, I probably won't want to go into mass comm because I am not interested in the overly theoretical aspects of it, I want hands on experience and at where I live, my school is the one of the best places for that.

If I manage to defer school, I would really like to intern in a media company! Either that or nutrition, which is my second field of interest!

Yet if anyone asks me what I would want for a future career, it will be most likely to be nutrition, as I feel its more sustainable and able to impact others lives more! :) 

TL;DR: Is it wise to defer school for a semester in order to specialise in my field of interest, or just finish up whatever I am studying even though I am bored to death with it???"

I've just finished my freshman year of CS studies in Poland, and I really want to get some more knowledge of programming, so I can score an internship throughout the next summer break. I am not too advanced, but I am sure that if we pick a right project and tools for it we can work through it and learn a ton while doing so.

I don't have anything particular in mind, it could be a game or an app,                 anything really that we could do in a month or two. We would use SVN and whatever site/app you wish to communicate. If you are in the same spot as me, reply!

This client wanted a no compromises MONSTER of a first gaming PC: the complete 1440p/120hz package. Every component was chosen carefully to maximize performance and aesthetics, and the system was meticulously built with the highest quality control standards. 0 finger print delivery, heavily overclocked, full stability testing, controllable LED lighting, full photoshoot, full product tour, full warranty covering parts and labor, and continued customer support. This client knows how to enjoy life, so I won't be too surprised if this rig goes under water next.

Turns out he's also a Houston firefighter that covers my neighborhood and an overall very cool guy.  I couldn't have asked for a better client, and gave him a brand new Razer Deathadder 2013 as a token of my appreciation.


**Just as a reminder, these prices from pcpartpicker are not what the customer paid.  They are the default vendors and values from PCPP.com.  I only simply provided a spec sheet through them because that's what redditors seem to like to do.  Hope that clears some confusion.**

***Frequently asked questions and complaints***  
In an attempt to clear up more confusion for the know-it-alls, I'll go through the reasoning for some of the common complaints as if this is their system or something.  

**OMFG WHY DID YOU PAY FOR UNNECESSARILY FAST 2400MHZ1!?!**  
It costed $81, not the $134.99 that PCPP listed.  This was cheaper than any name brand 1600mhz kit on Newegg.  There is literally no reason to not pick the higher quality, binned IC, aesthetically pleasing, faster RAM for less money.  

**WAIT, 1600MHZ CL6 RAM IS JUST AS FAST AS 2400MHZ CL9**  
Good luck finding a 8GB of CL6.

**YEAH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WTF YOU'RE DOING CUZ YOU ONLY GOT 8 GIGS**  
Please speak ONLY from personal experience here.  I routinely run 2 AAA title games, 2 voice chat, 2 text chat, and anywhere from 10-50 Chrome tabs at once.  Every day.  My system never exceeds 7.2gb RAM.  If you think a dedicated gaming and web browsing rig needs 16GB, then you're just daft.  Stop reading getting your advice from the comments section of Youtube videos.  Also, if my client wants 16GB ram, he can literally buy another kit and plug it in.  But he won't need it.  

**BRO WTF 1200 WATTZ IS SO OVERKILL OMG WHAT A WASTE OF PRECIOUS ENERGY CUZ EFFICIENCY PEAKS AND STUFF!!!**  
The client had several choices ranging from 850W to 1000W.  At the last second, the 1200W was thrown into the mix.  Why?  Try a custom bios and overvolting 2x GK110 chips.  This client is an enthusiast and wanted to be ready for watercooling, as well as *any other dual GPU setup in the future*.

**OMG $100 ON FANS THAT IS THE MOST BATSHIT THING I'VE EVER HEARD**  
Umm, okay.  Sounds like you won't have a watercooled PC any time soon.

**HOW DARE YOU MAKE A LIGHT HEARTED COMMENT ABOUT WINDOWS 8. WINDOWS 8 IS A SAINT!!**  
Like I explained, Windows 7 is what the client chose.  And contrary to Reddit, most people dislike Windows 8.  

**YOU SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A CHEAP MOTHERBOARD, 2 FANS, DITCHED THE 780 SLI SETUP, AND GOTTEN A 780 TI AND GONE 4K**  
The client loves the looks of the board.  It's over built and perfectly suitable for Haswell Refresh overclocking.  A 780 Ti is not sufficient for 1440p, especially compared to 2x 780's.  This is a big case with hot hardware, it needs more than 2 fans.  

**YOU WORK FOR PHANTEKS BECAUSE YOU LIKE THEIR PRODUCTS AND TOOK NICE PICTURES OF IT**  
I must be the unpaid intern they don't know about :/  

**BRO WHY DIDN'T YOU GET A 512GB OR 1TB SSD?!  250 IS WAY TOO SMALL**  
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to buy 873 Steam games and install them all at once.  Also contrary to popular belief, the client can add an SSD at any given time if the desire strikes.  I did not force him to pay extra for a larger SSD that he might not use, just like I didn't force him to pay extra for 16GB ram that he'll actually never use.

**HOW DARE YOU GET NICE PARTS INSTEAD OF SPENDING EXTRA MONEY ON THINGS YOU DON'T NEED!!  GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!**

2bvjyl,8,2014-07-27,On quitting grad school,Tijuanaherb,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/2bvjyl/on_quitting_grad_school/,"I don't know if this is the appropriate place to talk about this, but I've always valued the ""real talk"" here so I figured I'd tell y'all about this:

I probably didn't go to grad school for the right reasons. I had no idea what I wanted to do upon graduation and was still closeted, yearning to maintain the safety of college. So I enrolled in my University's MPA program. Turns out I've really loved it. It has taught me so much about government, policy and non profits and I've made great connections with other students who I know will go far in this arena. The best part was getting an internship at an amazing non profit, where I am right now. 

In this new city, I got to know one of my neighbors. She's an older woman who has worked in government agencies and is very intelligent, but she's also known to be an unhappy old woman who can be very bitter. Still, she invited me to Church yesterday and then dinner so I said yes.

At dinner, after 2 glasses of wine, she basically unleashed on me, saying that she thinks my MPA program is useless and it's not going to open up any doors for me, and I should stop being idealistic about the big things I want to do in my life. She thinks I should drop out of the program before school starts in a few weeks, and either move back with my parents or find any kind of job available in my college town, or maybe just enroll in some classes that might be more useful (in her opinion).

The problem is that I have already signed my lease for another year, and as soon as I quit grad school, my student loan payments will kick in. That will be very tough to handle. I also don't want to move back home because my parents are going through financial troubles and probably can't support me right now. 

I certainly am not excited about spending several more thousands of dollars on grad school, especially on a program that she doesn't seem to think is worth anything. But I also really enjoy it and would hate myself for quitting when I'm only a year away from earning my degree. Yes, I have heard people say that it's useless, but I have heard just as many people say that it was a worthwhile investment.

Since then I have spoken to several people who know me very well and they say I should stay and earn my degree. They believe that just having a masters degree will be an asset for me. I'm just so confused though. Should I even be listening to a woman who barely knows me and is known to be unhappy and bitter? 

I guess I took it to heart because she personified the voice in my head that tells me I'm not good enough, I'm not that smart, and I'm wasting my time getting a masters degree because it will be worthless. I really need some feedback from people who have been through this. "

I feel like I'm way overstating my confidence in languages I am familiar with, especially C++ and Javascript. I've used C in classes a lot and PHP/Python at work, and I'm reviewing my Java, so is there a way to separate those two categories out, or should I just leave out the ones I'm not too familiar with? I also feel like the high school internship part is not very relevant to the jobs I'm applying now, not to mention it was 6 years ago and is filled with jargon. Should I even include that? Finally, I did pretty much the same thing in both my internships, so is it ok if the job description for both of them are pretty much identical? Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I am currently in grad school and need to start thinking about my internship for next summer. With that in mind, I want to be strategic about my placement for next summer and try out cities where I could realistically see myself living for the next couple of years once I finish grad school. 

With that in mind, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on the following cities/areas:

* Seattle, WA
* Portland, OR
* Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill, NC
* Northern VA/DC 
* New York, NY
* Minneapolis, MN
* Atlanta, GA
* Los Angeles, CA (and surrounding areas)

Some things to keep in mind:

What is general vibe of the city? 
Are people more friendly, more reserved?
Is the area diverse? 
What is the dating scene for black women in the area?
Is the area progressive?

Since March, we haven't fought about anything, we enjoy the same activities, same movies, same tv shows, we're both involved with each others families. I love him so much, he's my best friend and we always have so much fun together. Being with him has always felt so natural and easy and just, right. We both just graduated from the same school in the same degree, but only I had found a job before we graduated - and that's where the problem arises.

Back in April we had the big talk of ""what do we do when I move 12 hours away?"" and he couldn't give me an answer. He's had 2 bad LDRs, one of which ended with him being cheated on, and so he was hesitant to say either way, I on the other hand did LD for 4 years with my last bf and then stayed together for another year after the distance was resolved, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with LDRs going right. This resulted in some tense times, because every action made me think ""is this going to make him want to stay or make him want to leave?"" and so we had the talk again.

He said it was better to assume we wouldn't stay together so that I would be hoping for the best instead of waiting for the worst. He says that e he just doesn't see long distance going well for him since he is already under a lot of pressure looking for a job. His family wants him to take any job he can get, but we have the kind of degree where you can be picky and get the job you want. He's interning 3 days a week right now to get more experience before applying for jobs in the fall, and all his parents seem to care about is that it's an unpaid internship.

Anyways, I accepted this, but was obviously upset and still hoping for the best. I went away to travel Europe for 4 weeks and we did really well as far as communication went. We scheduled times to Skype and texted when I could, which ended up being a lot more frequently than I'd thought. Of course this got my hopes up even more.. If this is how well we do without being able to talk whenever we want then it could only get better when we're in the same time zone and country.

I bring this up a few weeks after the trip, if we're still breaking up and he says ""well I thought that was still the plan"". I bring up all my points and he says ""I know that long distance would be easiest with you, but if we stay together I'm going to spend my time wondering what you're doing and feeling unmotivated when I have to be focusing on finding a job."" It's still a real possibility that he could get a job where I work, and he said that if he does then he wants to be with me again when he gets up there.

It's been pretty rough since that last talk. It's hard for me to understand his point of view, because if we break up then *I* will be  wondering what he's doing and feeling unmotivated. All I can think is that if he loved me enough that he'd want to try, but to him it has nothing to do with his feelings and I just don't get it. As it stands now, we're breaking up in exactly 13 days. He's driving me up to my new apartment and staying for a few days before flying home and that will be it.

He says it's up to me if we want to stay friends or not, though he says he'd like to, and that's the main issue I'm struggling with now. There's still a chance we could end up in the same city, so what happens if we go no contact and then 4 months from now we're back in the same city? I'm also moving there with our 3 best friends/ roommates from college, so he really wants to be working there and keep our gang together, so to speak. How would that work if we hadn't spoken? He's talking about coming to visit this winter to go snowboarding, then what? I just don't know what's best. My hearts breaking, we're so right for each other that I can't even picture a better relationship. What should I do?

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I are breaking up in 2 weeks because I'm moving away, although there's a possibility we could end up back in the same city come January. I'm also moving with our other best friends so regardless of the job he wants to come visit anyways. Do we stay friends?"

Job options?,zeheroe,MilitaryFamilies,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryFamilies/comments/2bw4e9/marrying_military_job_options/,"So, in September I become an active duty military wife. He's career, so we're in this for the long haul. I come from a military and law enforcement family, so I understand what I'm getting into -- although I know it's well intentioned and the heart is appreciated, I'm not looking for encouragement; just advice based off of experience.

I have half of a degree in Comp. Sci. with a minor in Bioinformatics, and after two internships, no longer have an interest in entering th(os)e field(s). I currently work as an assistant manager at a gym and volunteer on the mounted search and rescue unit for the local Sheriff's Dept (but have never had any ""official"" or auxiliary training). 

I want to keep working, but know we'll be transferred within three years, and probably every 2-3 after that. What is something that I can take with me? The thought of starting over each move is discouraging, but so it the thought of not working and feeling like I'm contributing. I've often considered entering law enforcement, and have also considered starting my own business (I sew and am rather handy, and we are both involved in training horses) but don't know how that transfers across state lines. Either with LE training, or business licensing. 

Any insight? On either topic?"

Help is greatly appreciated!",absoluthysterics,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2bwdcj/after_2_years_i_finally_got_a_job_but_still/,"I'm going to try to be short - but I apologize ahead of time if this post gets too long.. and I'm on my tablet so sorry for shitty formatting too..

Anyway, 24 year old B.S. Mechanical Engineering graduate of 2012 - didn't have a great gpa, one crappy internship under my belt, and severe depression in and out of school. I've applied hundreds of times, made all the personalized resumes and letters, had a bunch of in person and phone interviews, tried my best to 'sell myself' - and got jack shit. Everyone kept saying ""oh you'll find a job you're a female engineer"" (bullshit) or my parents would try to set me up for jobs (still despise them, would like to move out quickly but has always been financially strapped to do so...)

More depression settled and I finally ended up with a law secretary job thru craigslist... $12/13 an hour working about 35-40 hours a week. But most of my earnings went towards my loans, and my shitty car... ($800 for loans, $200 for other loans, $125 for car insurance, about $80 for gas - a month) Luckily I qualified for medicaid so my antidepressants are covered.

Why do I owe so much? Basically really expensive out of state university said ""either get another loan to pay or we're kicking you out of school."" I've never been taught good financial skills besides ""save as much as you can and don't buy anything"" - I did have a sports scholarship going in but lost it (then regained a little back) because of my grades... A mix of burnout, depression becoming severe, family tension, and a general feeling of unfulfillment. Anyway, money has always been a major trigger in my depression... In my panicked state of almost being kicked out of school my dad told me to take out loans **under his name** which is *incredibly stupid* on my part looking back but I didn't know any better ($85k- they didn't know I lost my scholarship for a bit and still don't). This where I give my monthly $800 check to my (now retired, former breadwinner of the family) father.

I also took about $30k under my name which is currently still in forbearance until December... And I drive a POS 2001 Nissan which I paid $900 to get it repaired (I know I should've junked it but money makes me panic and hyperventilate easy).. and I still have a dumb phone to keep the costs down. The other loans under my name are about $25k, where that other $200 is going to.

So now I got a break from my uncle and I got a job where he works (medical life support devices) and they're offering me $40k a year- 3 weeks vacation, medical and dental 100% covered and doesn't come out if my paycheck, and things about 401ks I don't understand (like I said, never been properly taught how to manage money wisely)

*What kind I do to set myself up for the future? Hopefully getting a new car, moving out and general independence?*

I'm also trying to establish credit so I have a chase card that I'm primarily using for monthly expenses (gas, insurance, etc.)- since I missed a couple of loan payments because I was too depressed to do anything about it...

I know I can save money by continuing living at home but I really hate the toxic environment that is my house. I can't afford therapy because my family doesn't know about my depression and do t want them to find out. I have been taking yoga daily through Groupon deals which have helped me **tremendously** - $150 for 40 classes. I'd like to continue but unlimited classes at $150 a month seems too steep.

I am also stuck being the maid of honor for my sister, who is getting married this November- I already got my $300 dress and I'm in charge of the bachelorette and shower.. Because I have to. I personally don't want to be the maid of honor because I hate weddings and don't give a shit - but I'm doing it because it was ""get shit on by family for years on end for refusing to be maid of honor"" vs. ""Get shit on by immediate family for a year until wedding is over"". So if anyone has advice on how to stay financially sane with a bossy older sister that'd be great too! (Paying for bridal shower, makeup and hair trials, alteration,etc.)

*TL;DR*

*Expenses:*

*$800 loans under dads name*

*$200 loans under my name*

*$80-100 for gas (Long Island is stupid expensive)*

*$125 for car insurance on POS car*

*(Have been reliably paying all for the past year and a half)*

*Sometimes getting food and cooking myself since family is also incredibly unhealthy*


*Assets*

*$1200 in checking account (from old secretary job)*

*New job that will pay $40k a year*


*Has chase credit card that will pay off every month to build credit.*

*Would like to move out if possible - i'm generally an independent person in my toxic household, cooks, sews, crafts, etc.*

*Currently stuck being maid of honor for sister.*

*Facing depression, paranoia, anxiety, doubt, lack of confidence - finally on medicaid meds which are helping plus Groupon yoga.*

I'm sorry if anything doesn't make sense- like I said I've never been too keen on money."

So about 7 months ago, a girl and I started dating. We agreed to keep it casual, since I may have been leaving for medical school and she was moving away for an internship. Now that moment has finally come, but our idea of keeping it casual didn't work. We went so well together, and really started falling for each other. 

Now I have to move across the country for medical school, and once her internship is up in December, she doesn't know where she's going. We explored her moving closer to me, but her line of work may not allow it. She also doesn't wanna be anchored down to that state for 4 years like I would have to be, but was considering it if it mean we stayed together.

In addition, my schedule is going to get crazy, and I don't want to ask her to move down there only to ignore her in favor of my studying, that wouldn't be fair to her. We don't wanna anchor each other, but we don't wanna leave each other either.

That didn't make it any easier walking away today. We both cried and are sti having a hard time letting go. 

tl;dr I'm moving away for school and we are probably breaking up, but it's so hard to do.

Part Six

It’s 4am, the morning after the night before and I’m still awake, my arm heavy and itchy under plaster. My wife, my poor, long suffering wife is asleep under my jacket in a chair. She hasn’t left me since I got here just after 7am. The hospital is tiny, more like a large GP’s office, but they were insistent on keeping me overnight because of my apparent head injury. Whatever it was that whacked my skull was blunt and heavy, Christina insists I’m lucky my head wasn’t caved in. 

 I’m awake because of the pain, the itching, the guilt of the worry I’ve inflicted on my wife. I’m awake because Cathy Robbins held my hand tight all the way through a preliminary examination, and not once did she make a sound. Her pale eyes tell the same story of every child I encounter at work; fear, mistrust – the eyes tell the same story as soldiers, trauma doctors and old homicide cops – stories of too much horror, too many unhappy endings, the witness to the worst humanity has to offer. I feel the weight of those stories in my heart and I wonder if I should quit before I turn into an old cop, a relic, a man with too many lines around his eyes and a heart encased in stone. 

Christina is silently fuming with me for not telling her the truth, for putting the fear of god into her when Sandy and Curly turned up on the doorstep at 2am saying they’d lost contact with me during a field operation. My plan to not worry my wife had failed miserably. Sylvia stayed with her the entire time, on the drive to the hospital outside of town, during the agonising wait for news, and finally crying with relief when we were reunited. She called her son in Jamaica and told him she was getting the first flight in the morning. The fear of losing someone we love unexpectedly makes us realise how short life can be, and as she said “I’ve lived a good long time, but it’s time to stop working and hold my Grandbabies again.” We’re devastated, but fully understanding. She’s become family this last six months. Christina has put aside her anger for now, and not left my side. 

At 4am, the world is particularly quiet. Not eerie, like in the town, but at total peace. 4am is also the lowest ebb, and it’s often when most critically sick people die. 4am is a phenomenon, a silent statue of an hour with eyes that see everything. This particular 4am I was thinking of my Father, and maybe I should reach out and reconnect with him after all this time. I think of the Robbins family, and wonder how it – or any of the other children’s families – will begin to heal from here. If these kinds of wounds cut too deep to ever heal fully, and what kind of scars will be left behind. 

It will be a long time, perhaps an eternity, to fix whatever damage was inflicted on those children. Jason is in protective care, reunited with his Mom, but by all accounts he hasn’t suffered any physical abuse, but we can’t say for sure on what he’s witnessed over the last week. The other two children, their respective families have been contacted and are flying in from out of state.

At 4am, Danny is back at the station with the Cap, the team and the FBI. Somehow, in-between my disappearance and escape, the powers that be have decided to get involved, hence the riot van peeling into the town. We could have done with them before this whole damn thing even truly started. I’d given my statement to one of the agents earlier, but he wouldn’t give anything away. They’d recovered the first cop, but he wasn’t “in a fit state to be interviewed.” The old guy, the second cop, he was dead. 


I pick up my phone, a heavy crack down the screen from my initial fall and scroll down to my Dad’s home number. It would be 9am in London, my ever early bird Father would have been up for at least four hours already.  I run my thumb over the crack in the screen, trying to muster the courage to press “Call” for the first time in six years, when my screen lights up with an incoming call – it’s Danny. I get up and move into the narrow corridor, hoping not to wake my wife or any other patients. 

“Danny? What’s up?”
“Sorry Jack, I know you’re meant to be resting but if I know you, you’re not sleeping.”
I smile. “What’s going on?”
“The Feds are all over this, but there’s still some legwork for us grunts, do you want to finish what you started?”
I look back at Christina, sleeping peacefully, her face relaxed and not racked with worry or fear. For a brief moment, I consider getting back into bed, but I remember Jason’s face and Cathy’s hand in mine. 
“At the risk of sounding corny; let’s finish this.”


Danny and Davis pick us up, thankfully we have a not-so-dreadful cell where Christina can sleep; she won’t be alone in the house and she’ll be near me, for some reason I don’t want to let her out of my sight. 

As I start looking through the file Danny passes me in the back seat, Christina leans over my shoulder. “Hey wait, go back to that photograph.”
“This is confidential police work.”
“Shut up, go back.” 
I flip the photo over, it’s one that Officer Barnham took in the basement. “I’ve seen that before.” She points to the wall behind the bench. I look at her, puzzled. “What, the circle?” She picks up the photo, studying it. “Definitely. I remember when I was an intern at Brookdale, we had a homeless guy come in – he had that mark on his back.” Christina looks up at me, her tired eyes suddenly alive again. “Like a tattoo?” “No, more like a burn or a brand. Fresh.  It was like, 5am, I’d been on shift for fourteen hours and he was incoherent, the doctor treated the burn but wrote it the babbling off as intoxication and sent him to the drunk tank.” 
“That was considerate of him.” 
“It was a heavy night, there’d been some traffic pile up. Look, I know that’s the same.” Danny twists around from the front seat and joins in - “How can you be that sure,? Surely this was like, what, ten years ago?” Christina raises an eyebrow – “Danny, I’m not stupid, I remember it clearly because it was my first week and the guy had third degree burns. The doctor just looked at it, decided it was probably drug related and got me to clean and dress the wound, but I remember staring into it and feeling like… you know the sound something makes when you throw it down a deep well, and you hear it bounce off the side and it echoes, but you can’t see it?” Danny remains stony faced. “Not really, no.” 


Christina puts her head to one side, a gesture I know she makes when trying to explain something complicated to a young child. “I still remember it clearly now. That circle burnt into his back, it made me feel like someone had sucked the joy out of life. The old guy, the bum, I remember him so well, he had really blue eyes – he was talking nonsense but I swear I heard him say ‘Help me’ but the doctor told me to get on with it and get him sent to the tank. He did reek of alcohol to be fair, I felt drunk just being next to him.” 
“So there’s a chance he may have been processed? He could be in the system.”
Christina shrugs, Danny sticks out his bottom lip and nods. “This fucking case, man. Jack, the feds think they know who these guys are.” 
“Continue.”
“So they’re involved with some next level shit, but when you went missing, your Cap, Mason, well, he freaked. Called in a few favours. Word spread like wildfire and then all of a sudden Curly’s picking up a fax from the FBI. Barnham sent over the pictures and they just turned up at the crime scene. They’ve been investigating these guys all over, call themselves The Silent Circle.”
“The Silent Circle?” 
“Well clearly they like circles; and apparently they aren’t too fond of talking.” Danny reaches over to the file on my lap, flips and few pages and there, right at the back is a photo of a corpse with its mouth sewn shut. 
“Surely this is a gang thing. Sewing people’s mouths shut? That’s fucking ridiculous.”
“Not so. There’s been rumours and rumblings but nothing concrete, then you wander into hell and blow the whole thing open.”
“And the children?”
“Here’s the cool part. Sorry.” Danny notices my wife’s unamused face. “The town is where all this loony shit started. Your ‘old man’ leader, Frederick Engles was a schoolteacher, but before that he was he posted overseas and got involved in some bad fucking voodoo and got dishonourably discharged. He started this Silent Circle business in 1960, continues his small town teaching elementary kids and gathers an anti-Government, anti-establishment movement working out of the church. He literally infiltrated a town of God-fearing people and got them to reject rational thinking. It looks like he was trying to re-establish the town with its original bloodlines.”
“Danny this is fucking crazy, you sound like a conspiracy theorist.”

“Ah funny you should say that, Engles started scaring the living shit out of the locals by criticising CERN, saying they were building a doomsday machine in Switzerland to bring about the apocalypse. According to some of his diaries in the Engles house, he began using rational fear tactics, saying the atomic bomb was just the beginning. People were uneasy as it was, he whipped them into a frenzy. He went full book of Revelations on them.”

“Okay so I’m taking this with a pinch of salt, but carry on.”

“Jack, this was all during the space race – science was moving on but some of these people were still small-town thinkers. Birth control was approved in 1960, imagine the field day a religious nutcase could have with that, he genuinely made them believe doomsday was upon them. He had records of his speeches at the church since he returned in 1959 – in May 1960, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded took place in Chile. People were fucking terrified.” 

“So Engles used current events to scare the living shit out of people. Not so different to American media these days.”

“There were a lot of young men from that town that fought in ‘Nam. People were starting to see real horror invade their lives. The nuclear threat, the Cuban Missile Crisis, planes dropping out of the damn sky, Engles’ preaching wasn’t so far fetched. Engles then told them that the government was so interested in the space race because February ’62 heralded a grand conjuncture of the planets and would begin the end of the world.”

“A grand what?”

“Conjuncture. Look, Wikipedia it. The simple fact was, Engles got enough people on his side, got them to literally shut up and listen and creep the hell out of anyone sane enough not to buy into his bullshit. It took two years, but most of the sane families moved out by the end of ’62.”

“Okay Danny so I get it, lunatic coverts small town thinkers into forming cult, but what’s with all the Light Bringer stuff?”

The car slows and I realise we’re at the station.  “I’ll let Agent Lee handle that one.” Davis shows Christina to our break room and promises to make her coffee and wrestle some donuts from Sandy. 

Agent Lee reminds me of Ed Harris, bald, mildly skeletal and imposing, a man of rules and little time for small town mumbo-jumbo, but after some ‘my right arm is in a sling’ awkwardness breaks the tension, he gives a firm backwards handshake and cracks a smile. “Detective Harper, you have really blown this case open. Sit. Detective Katz has got you up to date on Engles?”
“Kind of, I was just enquiring about the ‘Light Bringer’ stuff.”
“Ah yes, well, interesting you may ask. Light Bringer is the direct translation for Lucifer.”
“So devil worshipping crazy cult?”
“Not exactly. Engles believed Lucifer was the bringer of knowledge, of light. He capitalised on the fear of the unknown and promised to raise Lucifer in what appears to be a weapon against God AND Satan in the apocalypse.”

“In all due respect, Agent Lee, this is all a bit Da Vinci Code for me.”

Agent Lee sips his coffee and nods slightly. “Let me level with you, Detective Harper, I’ve been working on these guys for twenty years. We suspected Engles was operating out of the town, but we searched that place top to bottom and we never found a trace. Its likely he only went back in to town the last year or so – before that we’ve found traces of The Silent Circle in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Kentucky… basically all the southern states. Its likely Cathy Robbins was travelling with them, the other two children you found were abducted from nearby towns but there’s no evidence they’ve been in the town all along. There are no traces of any other kids in that place, and no bodies. It looks like Engles has been setting up franchises, about ten years ago they start popping up in New York. Robert Madder was a member.”

I feel a cold, creeping shudder run over my skin as if a ghost has walked through me. Madder was a prolific serial killer, as macabre as he was clever. The press went mad for him and I nearly went mad from chasing him. “Is this really why you’re here?”

Agent Lee leans over the table, hundreds of photographs of the ghost town laid over it. “Jack, this isn’t just about stolen children. I wish it was. Currently my team have recovered remains from eight or nine separate adult victims. The children were just the beginning; Engles believed in pure blood. Every member of the cult we’ve recovered – and it’s only been a few- have been connected to that town in some way. It looks like he was planning some kind of ritual for the next planetary event in 2020, but you scuppered his plans. Nobody has ever been close to these people. Not one person has made it out of The Silent Circle alive.”

“Except Robert Madder.” I suddenly realise how tired I am. 

“Of course, now we have Cathy Robbins, Bobby Nightingale and Mary Bucklesby. None of which will – or can- talk. Jason Anderson didn’t seem to see much and Engles was running out of time. Based on one eyewitness account and some basic evidence, I don’t have much to go on.”

“My eyewitness account.” I watch my left hand crush my paper coffee cup.

“You and I both know eyewitness accounts, especially under duress are… unreliable at best. Especially as we have that business of the 10-53.”

“I heard that 10-53.”

“I have no doubt of it, Detective, but considering the state of your companions and that Officer Barnham was separated from the group, I only have one witness with a head injury and three dead bodies, one of which is made of  nine other people.” 

“But… wait, three?” 

“Engles, although he didn’t have long left anyway, judging by his autopsy – end stage pancreatic cancer. Officer Mike Jamison bled out and of course we have our sacrificial lambs to identify. The Circle were trying to raise Lucifer through an earthly conduit, it seems.” 

“What about the woman? The old woman with the white hair?”
“No trace of a woman. No records, nothing in Engle’s logs – and he was meticulous. No mention of this ‘Sacred Mother’ you’re talking about. In fact, the only hard evidence we have is a ceremonial knife with yours and Cathy Robbins’ prints and a large hole in Engles’ throat.” 

Agent Lee picks up my statement. “No ‘magic box’ no nothing. Of course, I don’t disbelieve you for a moment but you suffered a serious head trauma and given your recent personal troubles and your history back in NYC….”

“So what you’re saying is, go home Jack, you’ve had a nasty bump on the head and you have a history of being on the crazy side?”

Agent Lee puts down my statement and looks at me with piercing blue eyes. Like an icy sky. “What I’m saying is, Detective Harper, you’ve given us Engles, god knows nobody will miss him, and some valuable hard evidence as well as recovering four missing children, you’re a local hero. Now let us take the investigation back to Langley and you take a holiday with your pretty wife. We know where you are if we need you.” 

I am equally angry as I am tired. I am beyond exhausted, my whole body aches in defeat. I have nothing further to say to Agent Lee that I won’t regret; I know how unreliable eyewitness testimony is but what they’ve found versus what happened… it doesn’t add up. Silently fuming, I get up without another word and collect my wife from Davis, who is showing her his latest report on lost cat activity. I want to go home and I want to sleep, for the first time in months, I feel like I need to sleep. 

Christina and I walk home in silence, her hand in mine. I’m quietly furious but despite my conversation with Agent Lee going over and over in my head, it’s becoming foggy with exhaustion. I look at Christina for a moment, and she’s beautiful and somewhere in the back of my mind, I’m eternally grateful I found her, and I know we can recover from anything. 

I have to break our handhold to fish out the house keys from my pocket, but as we get to the mailbox in the front yard, Christina stops dead. “…Jack.” I look at her face and then follow her eye line to the house. The front door is slightly open. I stop and hand my wife my cell phone. “Call Danny, stay here.” I reach for my gun and thank the lord I’m left handed. “Jack…” 

“Shh, honey, call Danny, stay here.” 

Slowly I make my way up the path, checking for any lights or prints in the dirt. The sun has started to come up, the birds are singing and the air is crisp. I can hear Christina talking to Danny, but my mind tunes out background noise. 

I reach the door and slowly push it open. Covering my back, I check the hall, living room, kitchen and dining room. The house is small, just one level with one bedroom and a little bathroom. Nothing in the house seems to be disturbed and I slowly, slowly make my way to our bedroom, my heart hammering somewhere in my throat. I check the bedroom and bathroom, but there’s no-one there. My blood is electric, powered by the furious pumping engine that is my heart. My chest is hot, like chronic indigestion, whilst the back of my throat burns, and I can smell something chemical. I put it down to a combination of exhaustion and adrenaline. I exit the bathroom and turn on our bedroom light, and then I see it. 

On the white wall above our bed, the paint of the fresh, black circle drips thickly like blood onto the bed linen where my wife had been lying just a few hours before. Underneath, in thin, painted letters, is a message left behind by someone who has invaded my home in the dead of night, someone who knows where I live and where I sleep, next to a framed photo of my beautiful wife, her face now covered in fresh, black paint. On the wall is a message meant for me and me alone. 


The axe forgets. 


The tree remembers.

I currently work at Whole Foods (which equals a discount on groceries for all of us) and so I will transfer to one close by. 

Between school, work, and internships, I will be very busy and mostly unable to socialize. Although, I'm not necessarily one to stay isolated, I also like having some common areas, such as the kitchen or living room, so I can have some social interaction at home. 

I do have a cat, but she is very calm and usually keeps to herself. For this reason, I probably wouldn't do well with a shared room. I would definitely need my own room, but I'm not very picky on how many roommates I have.


I don't smoke cigarettes. I drink from time to time, though I never really go out drinking or have parties. I am neat but far from a clean freak, still I'm always willing to hold up my end of the dishes/chores/other responsibilities. I try to be as green as possible, bud, though it doesn't bother me much to live with people who don't.

I like to listen to listen to music, write, and watch Netflix when I'm not studying.


I currently live in North Carolina, moving up August 15. I will be making a visit August 6-9 and would be more than happy to skype with potential roommates at any time.


Please contact me if you know of anything that might fit my situations.



Thanks,

I'm currently on a internship in Canada and I have to write a report for my school.
This report includes calculating/checking the ration.
Normally not a problem but the thing is at home (the Netherlands) we use totally different terms.
I kinda understand what net energy lactation is but I have no clue how much a cow needs.

Does anyone have a nice site or something like that, that explains how to make a ration the Canadian way.

2bwk2k,18,2014-07-27,What do you look for in an entry-level job candidate for system admin or helpdesk? Looking to start a course for homeless teens.,ParadoxDC,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2bwk2k/what_do_you_look_for_in_an_entrylevel_job/,"Hello fellow system admins. Long time lurker of this sub. I work for a very small company, so I'm the only IT person and because of that, I've never had to hire another person before. That's why I am posing this question you those of you who have.

I am looking to start an IT training program at a full-service homeless shelter. I have some ideas about specific topics to teach, but I am hoping to get some more concrete ideas that could potentially help young homeless teens/adults find an internship or even a job in IT. At the end of the course, for those students that show they are ready, we would arrange for them to take a certification course (a basic one, such as A+). The goal is to give these kids an extra leg up beyond generic, basic computer lessons. Maybe, just maybe, we can put them on a path to a successful career and break the cycle of homelessness in their family.

For those of you who have hired or would consider hiring entry-level people with little/no experience:

* What are some useful technical skills you might look for?
* What would be a solid basic certification we could arrange for them to take? We would likely structure the course around this exam. Current suggestion (my idea) is CompTIA A+. I know that many companies think that cert is a joke but it's better than nothing and could actually be useful for someone who hasn't had much exposure to computers.

Other suggestions for topics to teach, skills, or certification ideas are welcome."
2bwopw,1,2014-07-27,Shouldn't I be happy?,ANiceSunset,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2bwopw/shouldnt_i_be_happy/,"Oh where to start... I don't know how much personal information i'm allowed to say.
Lately though, I'm just not feeling it. I have a tendency to panic, worry, be fearful... the others. The friends and classmates who know me well, they understand that when I panic, it's not really pretty but at least the work is done. heh.
Oh if this isn't the right place to say this stuff, I apologize and will remove my post immediately.
Now that's out of the way, INCOMING WALL OF TEXT!

During my 4th year in university, I was scared that I wouldn't be able to get a job. Grad school? I wanted to secure a job and make some money. But that's not the point. I was scared that I wasn't getting a job. I applied to so many places, and I never got a call back, no response... hell I've received responses after the job posting closed. Wat.
I studied in Computer Science and have this great passion in games and the gaming industry. I took a Computer Graphics course and I LOVED it, although it was ridiculously hard but my debugging skills were improved.
I've read many articles and that the salary wages/hours/benefits in the gaming industry, developers you know, were pretty bad which made me sad for a bit. I learned to appreciate developers as I know the work in creating something takes a LONG time. I always wanted to talk about games, make them, create them, discuss them, play them, critique them, review them. Anyways, it's near the last few weeks in my year, I wasn't able to receive any response from industry relating to games/entertainment/computer graphics. I visited Game Developers Conference this year and my god, I loved every single moment there. I really truly felt at home.

A friend of mine was an intern at a company  and told me that his manager knows other managers who were looking for college graduates. At this point I didn't care what job as long as it's a job. I gave him my resume and after weeks of waiting in agony, I got an in person interview and later a position.
Holy shit right? A job, right out of college. I think I was the first in the siblings (including my cousins) to actually get a full time job at a pretty big company. It's a huge company. (am i allowed to say this on the internet?) A friggin huge deal. Mind you I never really gotten an internship and usually companies want ""experienced"" people so I think i got hella lucky. Like wtf version of lucky. All other places didn't respond to me and here they said, yeah we want you.

It's been 2 months,  I've been living in an apartment with a couple of friends. The fact I have a pretty decent paying job compared to the other software engineers friends I know, I should be happy right? I have friends who worked with not so great companies and although joked around saying "" ROLLING IN TEH DOUGH ARE YOU? LOLOL"". it really bothers me. Aside from learning to budget my money the job itself, it's not really enjoyable. Long story short, I'm a factory automation Engineer,working on applications to make things automated. I'm doing it because it's my job and quite frankly, I'm just depressed. I remember starting out, it was during a local comicon. I never been to one and knew friends who went. Sigh... gotta be a big boy now right? Start working, make dat money, learn what insurances, health care stuff, taxes, benefits,  stuff grown ups need to learn. I think some weeks later, E3 was going on. Man I would've loved to be a part of a group that does something related. Driving to and from work, well I have many thoughts, some including, ""what the hell are you doing with your life""

I didn't really care what job application entailed. I remember in the job interview, I said I understand it's not related to games but I'm willing to learn new technologies and work on new things. I really did mean that part, but as of now... I dunno. Maybe it's too early to determine anything? I was scared of being jobless and being a fucking failure right after college. 

I remember during my college applications during high school, I knew what I wanted to do. Make games. Make fun and entertaining entertainment, #datwordchoice. Every time I had the opportunity, I always made my projects in my university into a game of some sort. Make a java tic tac toe, a side scrolling game, hell my Honor thesis we got to make a game combining OpenGL graphics with voice recognition tools, SAPI.

I learned to try new things, a friend of mine taught me some techniques of drawing so I picked up a sketch book and just started drawing away. I've also picked up a mic for commentary on game play and reviews. I thought it would be really fun to be a shoutcaster, reviewer or some commentary person. I watch streams of some games and have thought that it would be enjoyable. I've written reviews on certain games and technologies. They're for personal enjoyment. I've also gotten into watching anime a lot. I've missed out on a lot of great anime shows and something about it really puts my mind at ease. Well that sounded cliche but I enjoy it a lot. But something is missing. Motivation is hard to find for me, since I go to work in something that doesn't really interest me. Rather it's just hard for me in general. I'll be a damn hard worker, i'll do my best to impress the older folks but I'm just not happy. I get depressed.

I'm also really hesitant on pursuing it because of fear of loosing a stable job and a stable income. It's the fear. But I remember seeing a graduation speech from Jim Carry (sp), I don't remember from what college but he talked about his father not pursuing comedy and acting and took a desk job because it was safe. Turns out the company went down south or something like that and he lost his job, a job that was supposedly safe. Now I'm not saying that I'm going to be loosing my job, dear god I hope not, but my understanding is that never give up on what you really want to do.

I remember a person said to me that you'll never get the job you want first hand but dammit I'll aim for that soon. I just don't know what to do now.

Maybe I'm not ready to grow up.

EDIT: some words and spelling."
2bwps1,60,2014-07-27,New Grad @ Big Tech Company from no-name school and I'm a disappointed in my performance,chronic_poop_throw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bwps1/new_grad_big_tech_company_from_noname_school_and/,"Here's the deal.  I read threads on here on all the time about people in new jobs freaking out about not performing well or not contributing, and people attribute it to imposter's syndrome.  I usually agree with this.  I think, however, in my case, it might not be.

I graduated from a no-name school in CS and did two unimpressive internships before getting an FT offer from one of the big tech companies.  I don't know how I got the offer because honestly my interviews didn't go that well, but whatever.  At my previous internships I was always pretty confident in myself, because even if my co-workers knew more than me due to experience I knew that I at least had a higher potential or aspirations than some of them.  While I wasn't the smartest guy in the room I always had stuff to contribute, especially in regards to stuff I've learned in school regarding best practices, and received positive reviews at all my internships.

I started my first full-time position a couple months ago and I'm astounded at the intelligence of everyone on my team.  Everyone is so smart, knowledgeable, and good at decision making.  Some of these people have only been out of school for less than a year, although they went to far better schools than I did.  Not only are they more experienced than me but I feel like IQ wise or intelligence wise they far surpass me as well.  Some of my friends went to these top schools so I know their classes and assignments, and frankly my school assignments were embarrassingly basic compared to theirs.

I'm doing my very best and trying to not be discouraged.  My coworkers are really friendly and helpful to me, and pair on things or give me advice when I need it.  I've learned more in two months than I have at my other internships combined (which in turn is more than what I've learned in 4 years of school).  But still, I'm absolutely embarrassed to turn in anything into code review because it will always get ripped to shreds for things I didn't even realize.

I've been spending some time after work trying to improve myself.  I've improved my unix command line skills, vim skills, git skills, read through *The Art of Readable Code* and now working my way through *Clean Code*.  I'm trying to reach a point where I don't make the same mistakes that I used to, which is important, and I'm getting better, but I'm not perfect and sometimes make mistakes.  Furthermore, it always seems like when I check something into code review, even if I did everything perfectly to the best of my ability, I'm missing something else.  My coworkers rarely get things caught in code reviews like I do, even those that have been there &gt;1 year.

I realize this has turned into more of a rant than anything.  I guess I just need advice.  It's hard to spend extra time after work improving myself without getting burned out, and I tend to find the best way to learn is just to make a mistake and have the code rejected.  But, that makes me look bad.  I'm not sure what the best approach to being in an environment where everyone is way smarter than you is.  Some of my coworkers have made jokes like ""Soo... chronic_poop_throw, when are you finally going to get something through code review on your first try hahaha,"" and although it is said jokingly it does hurt and makes me feel nervous.  Sometimes I feel like I will be fired (still within my probationary period).  What advice can you give me to succeed in this environment?"
2bx205,5,2014-07-28,How would you react to my lifestyle?,[deleted],AskDad,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDad/comments/2bx205/how_would_you_react_to_my_lifestyle/,"I'll start out with that, I'm 17, and I am at least six months sober from every drug, and had no addictions to them. 

I'm the oldest, and have always been really responsible. Even growing up, I hung out with the older crowd. I came into High school knowing all the Seniors and Juniors and hung out with them instead of my own grade. I even had College age friends my whole life. I've never acted my age. I was born mature.

I always did as I asked, and did well in school. I had a little trouble in sixth and seventh grade and failed quite a few classes because of my mental health, but I'm doing well now. Not perfect, but respectable.

Anyway. At fifteen, I got a job as an intern at a clothing company doing film and photography for promotional work. Now I've done a lot of work for major companies and am quite successful. I have a lot of experience under my belt, and have connections to many celebrities. But as I said earlier, my mental health dropped quite rapidly around thirteen. I became quite depressed, which made me more calm compared to my peers, and I clicked with the older crowd well. Nobody is aware except myself and a few others, as I feel it makes me look weak. I don't mind tell people online because you don't know me, and I can't know your reaction to my health. 

Anyway, being the depressed teenager I was, with access to anyone, and ANYTHING, with a lot of money. I began experimenting. I know it's stupid, but I'm kinda stupid. I'm too impulsive. 

It started with weed (edibles to smoking), then Shrooms, then LSD, then Molly, then Coke. As well as quite a bit of alcohol. 

I stopped half way through my Junior year because.. well, I'm not sure. I guess I just lost interest, and I became scared of them after a few bad trips. 

My questions is, if you were my father, how would you react if you learned this information? Even though I'm not addicted to them, and I have no plans to do them again (Besides drink). I help pay bills with what I earn, and bought most of my items, and I am responsible. 

Should I not tell them and hope it doesn't come out? Or should I just not worry if this information comes to them?"

Currently have about a year of work experience (web programmer, more or less full stack), and things are going well. However I do plan on going to Australia in the next 6-12 months, and stay for at least a year. Preferably I would like to have a real job lined up (and a work visa), but may have to just use the work vacation visa.

Rough background: Have a CS Degree, have about a year (will be more like 1.5-2 years by the time I leave) of work experience in web development. Able to do lots of work on my own, but still in the learn something new everyday phase. Not against having to do an intern type deal, though would prefer full time work (and it does not have to be web based, though that is where my experience is).

So first, I was hoping to get an idea of what the chances of a non senior, non Aussie, landing a job is? I understand there is a skilled work visa. How hard are these to obtain? 

Second, if I have to take the work visa approach, are 6 month internships a thing in Australia (for non students in this case)? Part of the visa stipulates I would not be allowed to work at one place for more then 6 months, so I'm thinking this would be my best chance at work.

I'm still in the very early stages of figuring out what to do, so any input is welcome. I don't need any concrete details on these, but getting a few peoples opinions would be great. Thanks."

A good friend is mad at me and it is bugging me to the point of losing sleep. 

Yes, I've been crappy about staying in contact. I'll be the first to admit that, but I feels like it's more than that. First off, I'm well-known for going through occasional phases of being a borderline shut-in, and it is safe to say that I'm wrapping up one of those phases right now. I treasure these phases more than most things. It's when I can shut out all the noise and clutter and really figure things out and get things done. I get to unwind, reflect, meditate, and organize and I love it. The fact that she's choosing now to get upset about it, after all this time and how well she knows me, feels a little ridiculous. After all, all of this came up when I called her to hang out for the evening, which kind of should've fixed what she's been upset about, right?

""Oooo you get a girl and think you can just disappear.""

Yes, I've been seeing a girl for a few weeks now, but to be honest, we aren't together that often (Once a week, if even that). We like each other a lot, but I work two jobs and she works a job and an internship. We make the best of the time we spend together, but we are nowhere close to the point of being together frequently enough to be alienating anyone. Honestly, I hope we don't get to that point for a very long time. For one, I think I'd get sick of the relationship if I saw her too often (for the first good while, at least). I feel that way with all of my interpersonal relationships, but with intimate relationships specifically, I feel that occasional separation is extremely healthy. Secondly, IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS. Cool it.

But honestly, I think what irks me most is that she's the only one that's upset. I've done this before and literally ALL of my other friends haven't called me out. They haven't said anything about it, really. Sure, I get a ""Hey, haven't heard from you in a bit"" text, but I explain that I'm taking some me-time and they understand completely. So why is it that she's the only one with an issue?

I apologized as best as one can over the phone, but she didn't seem to be having any of it. Do I try to apologize again? Do I just let her be mad and have it run its course? 

It's things like this that make me value alone time in the first place. 

I don't know anymore. This has all just left me feeling defeated and tired.

On the other other hand, maybe I just need a vacation or something. Again, I'm tired and I really can't tell anymore."
2bxdh2,4,2014-07-28,My little success story with advice for all. Enjoy!,HerroPhish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bxdh2/my_little_success_story_with_advice_for_all_enjoy/,"Hey people,

*long read*

I am pretty wide awake right now and I decided to tell you guys about my recent success story First, I wanna say thank you. I have used tons of advice on this subreddit and it really helped me out. For all of you guys on the job hunt, use the advice here, it is most of the time REALLY helpful.

So here's where my journey begins. I graduate from a large state school, shitty GPA, not much relevant job experience (I was a caddy every summer because of the money, I had one unpaid internship). My GPA was low not because I wasn't smart- it was because I really partied too hard and just didn't put in the effort I should have.

I got very lucky and found my first job rather quickly. It was more of a job that came to me and it was a R.E. sales jobs. I quickly learned, i HATED working on commission and I felt like I wasn't using my mind as much as I wanted. The company was small, but my bosses really liked me and they pushed me to succeed. I learned valuable life lessons at this job that I will never forget. It was a crash course on how to be personable, how to put yourself together, and how to never take no for an answer, and how to fucking hustle. Seriously, without the lessons I learned from this job I don't believe I ever would've gotten the job I have today. It was an invaluable experience that gave me thick skin and it helped me achieve my final goal for a job. 

Fast forward a couple months. I am finally realizing what I want to do in life. Seriously, I had no idea before, I was so clueless. I wanted to be a Financial Analyst at an Investment Bank- Mainly a Bulge Bracket bank. The money seemed amazing, you were given tons of work to do, and you have to think and solve issues and problems. But, this is one of the HARDEST positions to land

I started reaching out to people in my network and received an interview. Botched the interview. I plain and simple wasn't ready yet for a job of that magnitude. It was a wake up call. But, that was only the first of MANY interviews I fucked up on. Each interview I took something out of it. I learned, and i kept my focus. I knew what I wanted and I didn't let ANYONE tell me otherwise.

For a full year, I was in and out of interviews. Feeling so good I got the interview and I finally might have the job I want, and than being crushed by not receiving the job. Looking at jobs in the Back Office at banks hoping I can move up to the front office one day and STILL I couldn't get a job. It's fucking hard out there in the finance industry and very easy to give up, but don't. Keep on trucking and don't worry about the no's. Like I said before, use each interview as a learning experience and come into the next interview better prepared. 

I applied to probably over 1000 positions. The current place I got the job I maybe applied to 150 positions at the bank. I think I had a total of 10-15 in person interviews over that year. That isn't including going back for a second round.

So here it was one day, I received a email about a new job posting at a BB bank (I don't want to name the bank because of privacy reasons). Anyway, I had a connection at the bank and immediately sent him an email. He kinda pushed it off, said ""Apply online, tell me when someone contacts you"". I said sure, knowing nobody will contact me, my resume isn't the greatest! I emailed him a week later asking if he's heard any updates on the position etc.- He responded no I haven't. Again I email a week later (I'm a persistent mother fucker who has no shame) saying can you connect me with the recruiter? I would like to move forward with the process. He finally caved and connected me to the recruiter.

Whew, step 1 complete. Having completed this step so many dam times I knew how far away I was from having the job. The recruiter who was a really nice guy set up a 30 minute phone interview, prepared my ass off. Studied for a full 3 days on all the technical terms and potential answer to any STAR interview question they had. I aced the first interview. Set me up for a second in person. I took in everything I learned from the past year and made sure I was prepared to the T. Aced the second and the third interview and ended up getting the job of my dreams. A Front Office position at a Bulge Bracket bank. I was truly ecstatic. I still am, It is kind of surreal.

The referral I reached out to also said he loved how persistent I was and how focused I was on what I wanted, he had to help me after he saw that.  

Sorry that story was so long, it's been a long year.

My advice to anyone looking to break into finance or get a job in general-

-Do NOT be afraid to connect with alumni, parents friends, anyone you know. They will be the way in the door, you just have to do the rest

-Know what you want. Know the career path you will have to take to get there. Never contact a referral without being SURE of what you want. I would never contact someone and just say ""Yeah i'm looking for a job, do you know of any openings?"" you have to say ""Hey, I am looking to do X and I see your firm has an opening in X""

-Bring 10 copies of your resume and a ton of questions to the interview

-Study and know STAR questions (look them up if you don't know them)

-Know your story. On top of knowing your story be able to articulate it in a way that relates to the job

-Prepare your ass of for the interview. I can't stress that enough. Know everything about the company, why you want to work there, why you want to do this position etc.

-Dress the dam part. Shave, gel your hair. Do what you have to do to look as best as you can.

-Most of all don't dwell on a failure. Learn from it. Go over the interview and write down what you think went wrong. Make sure that doesn't happen again.

- For your resume, if you don't think its that great I would suggest getting it done professionally. I used WallStreetOasis.com (a great tool for anyone looking into a finance career) and I can't say enough how much it helped. $200 is worth it when you get that new job.


I really can't say how much I learned about life this past year. Nobody is going to give you anything in life, you have to go out there and grab it. Shit's gonna happen and your not gonna get that dream job you interviewed for, but suck it up and keep trying. I thought about giving up and staying at the job I was working in so many times. Luckily I didn't give up and my hard work paid off. Keep your head up guys, It took me a full year after graduating college to finally get a job I am happy with. 75% of my friends are still struggling so don't fret if you haven't yet. 

Remember guys, stay focus and keep trying. It's the only way in this tough job market. Don't be afraid to reach out and keep your heads up guys!


If anyone has any questions about my interview process, the financial industry, applying to jobs, or any questions about the language i was using (Front office vs Back Office) etc. ask away.

One tool I really recommend for job seekers looking into any kind of finance career, read WallStreetOasis.com. It has a ton of invaluable information on it. I was reading the forum all the time while I was looking for a job.

2bxsi3,29,2014-07-28,Rory Tulane,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bxsi3/rory_tulane/,"Hey r/nosleep

I'm here because, well, I can't sleep. Which is incredible considering that I just got off my third 12-hour shift in as many days. I'm a nurse at a local hospital (yes, a male nurse. Haha. Yeah, I saw Meet the Parents. Great movie. Shut up, please). Every couple months the shit-stars align and I'm blessed with the triple-header from hell itself. Anyway, what was I writing about? Christ, I'm tired.

I can't sleep. I met this patient two nights ago and my head hasn't been right since. His name was Rory Tuller or Rory Tulane or something. I had just spent a miserable two hours prepping a crusty grandma for surgery because she had started shitting blood at midnight. I needed a minute to breathe without inhaling old-lady-diaper fumes and I didn't want to risk being seen by the on-duty intern, so I went and hid in another patient's room.

Mr. Tulane was a suicide whose body hadn't read the note. He was out of bullets for the shotgun and swallowed a bottle of Tylenol with some vodka instead, or at least that's the gist of what the EMT had deciphered from the scene. His 40 year-old son had found him naked in a pool vomit and urine. The EMT told me that he had woken up en route long enough to stutter ""Can't cum. Time to die,"" and throw up some more Tylenol and chicken/potato slurry. Charming guy. His liver was stew meat, so even though he was still alive, he was going to bite it soon. All that was left was the slow slide into multi-organ failure which, thanks to an irreversible coma, he would sleep through. A tremendous mercy.

This also made his room an ideal hiding place. I remember thinking that Mr. Tulane (or Rory, as I have come to think of him. Since he fucked my brain, I figure we're on a first-name basis) looked like Bill Clinton at 80 as I pulled the curtain between me and the bed. I flung myself into an armchair and listened to the still steady beeps of the heart monitor. This was as close to peace as I would get. Three hours left.

I must have nodded off, because the next thing I remember is a pain in my shoulder.

""Hey, HEY, kid!""

Not only was my patient out of his supposedly irreversible coma, but he seemed to be pissed off about the fact. He was wearing a sour expression on his already puckered old man face. He was also jabbing me in the shoulder with the walking cane that his son had inexplicably left him.

""Are you just going to sit there, or are you going to get me a fuckin' glass of water?""

I hadn't expected to deal with it first hand, but this is about what my conversation with his son would have me expect him to be like. He said his father (Rory, my patient) was a mean-ass drunk who loved his children with his fists. For proof, the son showed me what looked like an extra knuckle at the base of his right pinkie. He told me that Rory had snapped it after he had poured the last of the whiskey down the drain. He was 6.

I got the man his water because that's what I'm paid to do. Through my reemerging headache, I thought about snapping his pinkie.

""What are you smiling about, kid? I feel like shit. What are you going to do about that?""

In my annoyance, I did what no trained medical professional should do, I told the raw truth. No sugar coating. Just as well; Rory had swallowed enough of those pills.

""Well, that's to be expected, sir, you're dying.""

""I know, dipshit. I want to know why I'm fuckin' here feeling it.""

I knew that I should get the doctor, but after listening to the son's stories about him, I took a bit of sadistic pleasure in letting him feel the jabs of the torture rack he had put himself on.

""Hey c'mere, I wanna... I want to tell you something.""

I knew what was coming, the deathbed confessional. Working the night shift, I got this a lot. Way too many old folks decided to die at 4 a.m. Usually it was something about embezzlement or peacemaking by-proxy with an estranged relative. The best were the bizarre, medicated ramblings, delivered with the solemn sincerity of the dying: ""Tell Jessie the flowers are on the roof."" ""We never did bury that dog."" These were currency at the nurses' station.

Something told me that Rory wouldn't be making any peace. Dreadful curiosity told me that it was going to be something foul and rotten as the man himself.

""When I was 12, my father took me to the river.""

Or not. Maybe the delirium was already here, and he was just telling me whatever random fever-memory it had chosen to show him last.

""There was this spot where the water swirled around, like a little pond right inside the river. The ducks loved it. I used to go feed them bread like your typical fuckin' little kid.""

He even sounded like Clinton, except with a Crayola vocabulary and a smoking habit. I had no idea how the man was still going on. With the amount of damage he had done to himself, he should have been in agony. No, I mean he shouldn't have been there at all. And yet he looked serene. Fucked up and serene.

""My dad was a sumbitch. Choked my mom half to death three times that I can remember.""

This was apparently a hereditary condition. Rory's son had told me that he had beat his mom and she had taken him and his baby sister and ran. Only a sense of familial duty had him checking in on his dear old dad at all.

""He took me right to that spot because he knew that I liked to feed those ducks. Not that he had taken me there before. Shit, no. He used to spank me with his belt for wasting bread like that. I'd have blood in my britches. No, he was going to teach me something. And his lessons were a bad sort.""

I looked up from my hands which I had been staring at, and caught his eyes. They were yellow as dog snow, and his skin was parchment showing every broken capillary around his angry red nose. It couldn't be long now. Best to stay put and let this play out so I could get a jump on the clean-up afterward.

""He sat down on the overhang and had me sit next to him. I was nervous-like, because I never got this close to him without the red marks to show for it later. There was this group of ducks that were sunning on the bank. They were real tame 'cause of all the folks feeding them. My father, he held my shoulder and it felt wrong. Like, his fingers were on my shoulder but his thumb was kinda diggin' in to my neck. And there was like this, this pulse. I couldn't tell if it were mine or his. 'Son, you're old enough now that you need to know what life is. You'rn need to know this.'"" 

""Like I was sayin', I knew his lessons and I knew what was coming before it happened. He swept the grass next to us with his hand, and a couple ducks came waddling up like the fat fucks they were, looking for any food he might have dropped. Anyway, my dad, he reaches out and just grabs one. Before it can bite him, he grabs it by the bill and cinches it under his arm. The thing is going apeshit by now, quacking and squirming. 'You see this?"" He says, 'You see how he's fighting, how he wants to live?'""

Rory suddenly gave in to a fit of coughing. When he finished, I saw traces of red in the saliva at the corner of his mouth.

""I should really call the doctor, sir, you shouldn't be feeling this...""

He held up his hand to stop me. ""Naw, you've had me going this long, you're gonna to let me finish. I always finish.""

I shouldn't have let him stop me that easily, but I had to hear him out, in spite of the fact that I knew he wasn't going anywhere pretty. I just wished the pulsing in my temples would ease up.

""Where was I? Oh, the duck. Yeah, it wanted to live. I could hear the breath coming out of its nostrils, and I saw the way its feet were scratching at his arm. 'He wants to live, isn't that great? Look at it, son, the beauty of his fear. He knows it's over, but he can't stop fighting it. He won't stop. Until...' Then the sumbitch did it. He squeezed that fuckin' duck under his arm real tight. Its eyes got all wide and I, I'd swear they got blacker. Like, deep. He pulled up on its head and just twisted. That squawk, I'll never forget it. It wasn't loud, just... final. I threw up then, like the pussy I was, but he pretended not to notice. He just waved that dead thing in front of me. 'This is life, son.' 'Death?' I asked him, like a stupid kid. 'No, son, it's this!' Again, he waved that fuckin' duck at me. 'You're gonna be a man soon enough. You'll have power. That's what this is. You can hold another life in your goddamn hands and end it if you choose. That's power. That's how you know you're alive.'"" 

""He dropped the thing at my feet and left me there. I cried at first, looking at that dead duck in the dirt. The eyes were still open and its tongue was stuck out the middle of its beak all choked-like. I kept looking in the eyes, but the depth had gone. It was beautiful in a way. Horrible'n beautiful all at once.""

Rory started coughing again, but I didn't even kid myself about calling the doctor this time. I just mechanically refilled his water from the carafe on the bedside table. His eyes had taken on something of a thousand-yard stare. He had been talking, but it wasn't to me. Whatever was on the other end of that stare, he fucking hated. In any case, his story seemed to be over. His breathing had gotten heavy and choppy, and he was just glowering now.

""I killed a girl in Nawlins.""

I dropped the carafe I had been holding. It was empty, and it clattered on the floor. Not only should I call the doctor, I should call the police. I know I should have... something, Christ I know. But there was so little time, and there was something more coming. I didn't want to hear it, but I did at the same time.

His eyes had found me again, and they were yellow. Yellow and pale blue, and black. His pupils had retracted into needle points but they ran deep, so deep. The pulsing had overtaken the crown of my head and I heard a rhythmic washing. Make him stop. Let him finish.

""I met her at a restaurant where I stopped on my way back up north to Kansas City. She was a waitress. Paula. Black hair, black eyes, red red lips. She had tits like Lady Madonna. Je-sus. I've jacked it to Paula's tits almost every night for 30 years, tilln' I couldn't anymore. That's why I took them pills. Always said, 'When I can't cum, I'ma kill myself.' And I kept my word.""

He was slipping, I thought. I was actually relieved. And then he kept on.

""I had to fuck her, I knew it. I never looked like much, but I could talk up a bitch. Plus, there was money. I had the wife's check in cash plus my poker earnings. That ought to get me somewhere... lucky she was a slut. I fed her enough drinks on the sly that she ditched her tables for the night to follow me. I brought her back to the hotel and I stuck it in her before we hit the bed. No rubber or anything.""

Class act.

""Well, at some point she started to have second thoughts and tried to get up. You fuckin' kidding me? I punched her out and finished inside her. And I understood. I understood what power is.""

I felt the bile rising in the back of my throat. I'm a messed up guy I'll admit, but Rory was fucking evil. I hadn't seen that before, and I had seen some terrible things. This was a rape.

""I must have broken her nose, because there was blood everywhere. I didn't notice until after. My head was throbbing with this pulse, you know?""

I did know. My own head was churning with it. The pale blue of my scrubs was suddenly too bright. I closed my eyes. Then there was this pain in my neck, like something digging in.

It was Rory's hand. His fingers were clasped on my shoulder, but his thumb was stuck into my neck. And the pulsing. It was making me nauseous.

""She was beautiful, all broken. I just sat there looking at her until she woke up. And then, the sound. Maybe it was the nose, but I swear it sounded like that duck having its neck all twisted.""

Fuck. I knew it. I actually retched. Rory tightened his grip on my shoulder and his thumb found a new recess in my neck to probe.

""You know what life is, kid? I took that girl's head in my hands. I saw her fear and it was beautiful. Her eyes were deep and black. I held her head in my hands and I twisted with all I had. I felt everything, I heard the snapping. That's power. I was alive.""

He was going to keep talking, but he squawked instead. His grip loosened and his hand slipped off my shoulder at last. The heart monitor raised the alarm and I shook off the shock as best I could and punched the code.

The doctor said I had done alright, in that there was nothing to do. Mr. Tulane, Rory, was always going to die. I don't know why, but I didn't say anything about the story. It's not that I was worried about getting busted for slacking on the job, but it was more... secret. Like I knew something now that was mine. When she asked me about the redness on my neck, I told the doctor that I had been rubbing a spot with an ingrown hair that I needed to tweeze (good cover, I know). And that was that. Rory was dead and I was, I was... beyond the valley. I knew I wasn't alright, but I wasn't present enough to notice.

I slept that night, but it was a bad sleep. Like the sleep you get after drinking too much for too long. I was a zombie the next day, a bit like The Walking Dead but even less interesting. Today, well...

I woke up with the pulsing back in my head. I was sure that I was going to be sick, but after I chewed a couple Tylenol (a terrible habit, I know) and drank some water, it dissipated quickly. And I actually felt good. I still remembered Rory's fucked up story but it was like the volume had finally gone down on all the shit in my head. I started to think I was going to be OK.

There's a stream a bit of a way back behind the hospital. Weather permitting, I like to sneak back there on lunch break and listen to the water. It's better than listening to heart monitors. I went back there this afternoon to bask in convalescent joy. The trees blocked enough of the sun that it wasn't too hot, and what sun got through danced on the water in tantalizing, kaleidoscope fashion.

And then the quacking. It's not common, but there are ducks that turn up here from time to time. And it was wonderful, a mother and ducklings. I tore up the last bits of my sandwich bread and threw it to them. The kids went nuts, mom was just trying to keep a look out for them while they fought over the pieces.

I don't know why, but I patted the grass next to me. She looked hesitant at first, but apparently the mother duck was fairly tame because she jumped up the bank to where I had stirred up the ground, babies in tow. It was so perfect.

The little ones scattered when I grabbed their mother. There was pipping and chirping and the pulsing had returned to my head with renewed strength. The duck bit my hand so I grabbed her bill. It was beyond fucked, but I felt so strong, so powerful. I tucked her under my arm and pinned her there. I saw her eyes and they were big and black and deep. Then I took her head in my hand and twisted. I left the body there, floating in the water with the ducklings clamoring over and around it.

Before today, I hadn't so much as swatted the dog for getting in the trash. I want to stop the pulsing in my head but there's like this voice growing in me that tells me that it's power. I'm *alive*.

And that is why I can't sleep.

For 3 years, I've tried to keep a clean lab, help everyone, and have taken hours out of my week to do my assigned fabrication of metal on glass substrates needed for all 18 something grads in my group. Only recently have I started getting acknowledged in their papers. I seldom get help from them (e.g. I'm out of state and out of 18 people, no one will pick up a package for me). In the beginning, I was working 14 hours in post-processing for devices for the entire group. I didn't get to sleep because processes would end middle of the night. I was falling asleep in meetings and my advisor would tell the older students that I was stupid and lazy. Eventually his post-doc told him he was running me ragged and I got some relief. I always heard the bad comments through the grape vine. I have no publications and I see my advisor less than once a month. My second year I never saw him because of sabbatical. Every meeting he tells me how I'm too unfocused and then assigns new random experiments for me to do, ""to see what happens."" Now my advisor says that 90% of our group does bad experiments. Our recent grad said that my advisor thinks I work hard but I'm just doing random things. I've had good projects through collaborations with top nanoparticle researchers in the U.S., but my advisor was unhappy with the results so he called our collaborators idiots and cut ties immediately, even without meeting to discuss the results we were seeing. I'm now back on this project after a year and a half and it is my main focus. We no longer have the collaborators though to help so I'm doing all initial steps myself.


My main problem is I just presented (after 4 years) my preliminary exam. In it I discussed a new earth-abundant solar material I had shown to be photoconductive, I showed all my work in adapting our process for this new proprietary glass and how to bridge any gaps in performance, and I showed how to use solution processing to eliminate carbon from a nanoparticle absorber film and the change in film morphology in post-processing anneals. I also showed several of the ""random experiments"" that were inconclusive - my advisor drew a lot of conclusions from these experiments based on self-assured assumptions, and I made sure to explain why nothing was conclusive. My document was 60 pages long and only had 3/4 of the research I've done. There's a lot of failure that I left out because when things failed, we were not allowed to find out why. 


The two committee members gave me adequate marks with an overall poor - passing me but stating that some of my research assigned by my advisor is more suitable for an intern, not a PhD student, and I am doing way too many projects with no depth. I agree with this assessment but it wasn't in my control to fix it. They passed me under the condition I pick one project and approach it scientifically - no longer just trying random things. My advisor agreed and now we are to meet every week. The last committee out-of-department member met me alone on Skype. The screen-share didn't work, and she wasn't happy with the terminology I was using (which my advisor uses). She failed me, and my advisor told me she said it sounded like I don't know what I'm doing and should leave. My advisor got her to agree to a re-examination in September. I need to show that I know what I'm doing with this one project. She was in town last weekend and I emailed her requesting a meeting so we could discuss what I need to improve specifically. I received no response.

So here I am, focusing on one project with little to no guidance, my only advocate is my advisor who has been detrimental for my tenure here, and one person has fully stopped my progress. My advisor says I have one year left of funding before he cuts me out. I may have to leave with a master's after 4 years of work. I've seen people walk out of my school having done much less than I've done. Hell, developing a new material and getting it to work is a third of my successful work, and something similar is someone else's entire thesis.

I'm thinking of going to an impartial professor in our department to discuss my situation which has never happened. Usually if an advisor says it's good, it's good. I'm glad I'm getting put on a more narrow track, but I'm terrified it might end in a cliff. Has anyone been through something like this? I've been going to a therapist to deal with this, and I'm hoping that will help.

We need housing for the period of Sept to Dec. Our budget between us both is ~$3500.

A little bit about us: We're two computer science students with developer internships. We're chill, low-key dudes that enjoy anything geeky.

We are willing to take a place outside of SF with a quick commute to downtown. We're reasonable so if you have a place just contact me and we'll start talking. Thanks!

Was a freshman in college, did good enough to get credit from all my courses, nothing special (2.6 gpa). Parents aren't happy, wanted a 3.0, demand that I retake all courses I got lower than a B in, essentially means I have to retake the whole year. They tell me to take the fall semester off and get a job so I can have some time to think about what I actually want to do. Pissed at first, but eventually I agree. Get two jobs, so I can pay rent for an apartment I got stuck with and can't lease off, while paying for community college courses. Everything is going fine. Today get an email from my parents saying they refuse to send me back to school, and that if I want to go back, I have to pay for it myself. Biggest ""Fuck you"" I've ever gotten in my life. Obviously don't have funds to return to my university with two shitty minimum wage jobs. My best chances are to now go to community college to get my degree. Not sure if want. Friends have essentially alienated me for being a ""failure"". Tired from working all week, and then going to night school. Spend every hour of free time I have left alone and at the computer. Living the dream. Let the down votes cometh.  
    
EDIT: Ok thanks for all the replies! To answer a few questions, my town is filled with high schoolers who only know how to be angry at everything around them, hence the reason why making new friends will be difficult. I have an internship atm that is paying for newly imposed rent, and saving on the side to pay for a few community college courses. I want to get a degree in computer science and maybe a minor in graphic design. I figure that I will pay for a few courses at the community college to really see if this is what I want to do, and if so, I will then transfer all the credit I can to a local university and study there. As for the apartment, I have been looking around, but the only places to live that are available are either godly expensive, or a solid half hour drive from the university without traffic. I've also been looking at a few scholarships to help with paying for the university aspect. I've also secured another job part time for now and full time for when this internship ends. Thank you for all the support, it has been a real help. "

My school has a solid CS program (ranked top 20/25 according to graduate rankings). I started working in a CS professor's lab doing machine learning work starting fall of my sophomore year. I really enjoyed the experience, and am seriously considering graduate school at this point. However, I have some questions for you guys:

 - I have no interest in staying in academia. I would prefer not be a Professor. My goals after school would be to move to a major city (NYC, Boston, Seattle,etc.) and work in industry (research lab, startup, whatever). My main reasons for doing a PhD are that I can really dive deep into ML type stuff. I really don't have any interest in web dev or stuff like that, and it seems that being a PhD student allows for a lot of flexibility in choosing what things someone wants to work on. Asides from that, intellectual fulfillment is also motivator. Ultimately, I want to work on the cutting edge, and I think a PhD can help me build the skills to do so. Are these intentions/motivations sensible?

2. For current/past students, how was your experience? If you don't mind me asking- what areas are you working on, what university, how do you
feel about your decision so far, etc? What was your undergrad profile like? When did you
seriously start considering grad school?

3. How do grad admissions work? I'm assuming recommendations, research experience, and grades/GRE are the three main criteria. I have an alright GPA- 3.76, but I can get it upto a ~3.85 by application time (I had a bad semester frosh year- 3.0 flat). What about the statement of purpose? I might be able to coauthor a publication with my PI by the time I apply, how much does that help? I took a mock GRE and got a 800Q, 710Verbal, and 5 on the writing. How hard is it to get into CMU/Berkeley/MIT/Stanford?

4. Joining multiple groups: Right now, I'm in one ML group, but I am also considering joining another lab that works on database stuff. Is working for multiple groups as an undergrad advisable?

5. Summer REUs: I have an industry internship for this summer, but should I chose REUs over industry internships? I didn't really apply to any REUs, and I enjoy industry internships for the summer (9-5 can be pretty relaxing!).

6. Any advice, things you wished you did or didn't would be greatly appreciated.

I watched a lot of porn, and fapped several times a day, since I was 14 (now 27). I'm happy to say now, I don't waste my time fapping anymore and hopefully will continue to do this for the rest of my life. My relationships have improved a lot, I really appreciate my girlfriend and I get along with friends so much better than I used to. I also find myself not easily offended by others, like I used to be, and feel I'm becoming my genuine self. Basically in terms of relationships, handling people's bullshit I'm doing fantastic. 
    However, I still have trouble pushing myself to be productive, I have off this summer after completing my masters this last year before I start with some post graduate school credits. Even though I've been successful in my masters, finishing it 10 months with a 3.9+, I still feel that I'm no where close to my potential and I hate being in adult limbo (having no real source of income other than a small stipend and being home with my parents.) I have a lot of things I feel I should be doing, such as writing, maybe even looking for part time work, but I just feel really stuck, like I'm going to have to be a broke student for the next year, because I will be taking 15 credits a semester again, and have to complete GA work and internship related work. I just feel lazy, and I can't figure out how to push myself, I don't really read enough, and procrastinate a lot, and I was wondering if people combined other things with NoFap to help them reach their full potential. I'm also wondering if I'm just dealing with a serious flatline, due to the fact I watched a lot of porn, and even got a thrill ""sexting"" with girls, which is something I'm also working on stopping.

These will probably take a few days to play out (or longer!) so please be willing to stick around. No blow n' goes!

All of these ideas are open to modification and I'm willing to fit in a multitude of kinks!

---
**Bimbo Bonanza** - You could be a co-worker, neighbor, or just about anyone you like in this one. With one spray from a special chemical I’ve purchased your hair turns platinum blonde, your breasts grow ridiculously large, your clothes shrink, and you develop an insatiable craving for cock. You feel yourself becoming vapid, but the whole time, somewhere in the back of your mind, you are all there but unable to control yourself. 

**Public Fuckpuppet** - As the mayor of a wealthy town I’m celebrating the opening of a new public square with the purchase of a fuck slave. You are to be strapped down on your back, completely naked with your legs and arms spread apart, in the middle of the square. Anyone may use you as they please, and if you survive the initial crowd you will be fed and your positions changed daily. We can start this one with you in a line up of slaves, and me looking for one to pick out for this job.

**The Real Magician** - I’ve just hired you, my new assistant, to aid in my performance. Little do you know that I actually practice *real* magic! I can hypnotize you, make your breasts swell or shrink, and make you grow a giant cock between your legs among other things. We can do this on stage in front of a large audience, or, if you prefer, it can be a practice run before we do the show.   

**Alien Orgy** - Exactly what it sounds like. Pick a universe, a set of aliens you’d like to use, and let the huge cocks, tentacles, giant breasts, antennae and whatever else go crazy in a hot, steamy orgy. I’m quite partial to the Star Wars universe for this, I’ve always wanted to have fun with a Twi’lek or a Togruta. Something about those tail-heads… WoW universe is also something I’d like to try!

**Goo Girl Made of Cum** - Yup, you read right: A girl made entirely out of cum! Sticky, slimy, and able to change shapes, you must consume cum in order to stay alive. Fortunately for you, you find me, a young man who is able to keep up with your needs. My loads are particularly massive, enough to satiate your desires. And if you ever get too much cum, your belly swells and, well, you can guess what happens next.

**Futa Fantasy** - Ever wanted to pound a girl with your huge cock? Well then this one is for you! I, a mad scientist, have created a serum which causes you to grow an enormous dick. In order to complete the experiment I let you try your new cock out on my young, tight intern. Watching makes me so horny I might just have to join in too.

**GH Cafe** - We're on vacation in a foreign land and see a cafe that looks like a good place to grab a bite to eat. As we sit down  we notice something a bit different with this particular place, there are holes in the walls, tables, booths, everywhere. Almost all of the patrons are female, and they all seem to be... All these holes are glory holes! A cock emerges from the wall beside you, and one from the table we are sitting at. What will you do? I'd love to try an incest twist to this one! Especially a mom/son one. 

**New Gym Utility** - The gym I go to is somewhat upscale. Most members are like myself; very fit, young professionals. The mens locker room is quite nice, and have very spacious lockers. Large enough that you could fit in one nicely, if you were on your knees. I would want you in there sitting on/hanging slightly above a contraption. Your arms would need to be tied above your head and a rope going up to the top of the locker where it would be secured. The contraption underneath you would basically be a car jack with a dildo attatched to it. Each time the foot pedal is pumped it would push a massive dildo into and up your ass.
I think this contraption would serve to keep you in line as the members of the gym use your mouth, one after another, after their tough work outs.

**Accidental Nudism** - You and I go on vacation to a place by the beach which you booked online. When we get there we discover it's a nudist resort, and that the room is non-refundable. You, the shy, conservative type, are definitely not one to try nudism on your own but while we're there for the week, we may as well make the best of it. Or at least that's what I try to convince you. An incest twist on this would also be very fun!

**Too Horrible For This Post** - Something I have in mind that's too fucked up, too awful, too cruel to include in a post like this. You'll have to pm me to find out!

My limits are extreme ageplay (light is ok!), blood and gore, and scat. Everything else I'm open to. So send me a pm, be as dirty and perverted as you like, and we can get started!"

I work 20-35 hours perk week, it's very flexible. When I'm in school my boss recommended I do 20 hours, however they have hinted that they can still be flexible with hours. So my question is, should I work while I'm a full-time student? For university, I take 12-16-units(3-4 courses) per quarter.




**Details:** I'm not the best student and usually I fluctuate from a 2.2 GPA to 4.0 GPA (3.0 cumulative). I want to do grad school in the future if I can maintain the academics. I also want to be able to learn at my pace to absorb the material. However, at my internship I've learned a lot, and I'm actually putting my programming to use. Occasionally there even comes up instances where school material matches up with applications I need to work on, so the learning feels better. However, there is also the case where I do feel under qualified at work, and it would be nice to better invest time in learning there technologies.

2bz6ix,2,2014-07-28,Question: Not logging hours in payroll to ensure job security,youngperson,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bz6ix/question_not_logging_hours_in_payroll_to_ensure/,"Hey guys, thanks for reading. I'm currently a full-time intern engineer at an international manufacturing company. I love my job, my coworkers and managers are fantastic, and the pay is great. My hope is to convert this internship into permanent employment.

I usually work 40+/- hours per week, but consistently log exactly 40 hours into our payroll software, as I am required to work 40 hours minimum in my job description, and would like to get paid a full 40 hours.

Tonight I have to come into work for an hour or two after midnight (unusual, I work 8-5 typically).

I'm thinking it would be smart to not log my hours tonight, so as to not smack my employer with massive overtime. I get paid plenty as it is, and would like to ensure that there remains enough money in the project budget for me to actually have a job. I actually won't mind coming in later either.

What does everyone else think about this? Is this a good idea, or am I just cutting myself short. The end goal is just for me to have a job, I could give a shit about the money. 

Also, I should add, my supervisor hasn't asked me to come in, I just need to come in to pull a sample. The person approving my weekly hours is unaware that I'll be in late.

My girlfriend works about 50-60 hours a week, so it would mostly be my responsibility to take care of them. We have 2 newer leather couches that we are afraid they might scratch up, but I figure since I will be home, I can intervene and train them not to. We would like to avoid de-clawing if possible. 

We have been together for 3 years, and living together for about 2, and our relationship is about as stable as you can get. My financial situation is a little shaky since I don't work a lot and am still in school, my girlfriend's is much better, but we prefer to split everything. We plan on getting a house sometime in the future and probably getting a dog or two. 

I had a cat in my childhood to teen years, and my girlfriend had dogs growing up, so we have some experience raising pets. We want to adopt 2 kittens because the cat I had was very nice, but became bored easily and developed a weight problem. Any help would be appreciated.

Cue two weeks ago, get a phone interview. Completely bomb it. At the time, I knew nothing about HTML and couldn't answer even the basic questions like ""What is a doctype?""

A week later, I get called in for an in-person technical interview. Bomb it. Did some really silly things with my code (that, in defense, I caught soon after making them). Messed up my pointers completely. Didn't find the solution to the brain teaser puzzle type questions they give you. 

The job is for HTML5 Javascript development, which I have never done above the basics. I've spent this entire time cramming HTML knowledge and have learned a ton, but nothing I feel confident about or have put into practice.

One day after talking with a representative, my box shows up. Four business days later, it's back with a nice new keyboard and I'm pretty sure a new battery.

I recently posted in /r/engineering about struggling to find a job as a recent graduate with a biomedical engineering degree. Mostly because I lack any direct experience with medical devices or engineering in general. (I had an internship a couple years ago that wasn't related to engineering which doesn't really help me now). Anyway, during my junior year I discovered an interest in computer programming and took some computer science classes for electives during my senior year. I would officially label my degree as a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Biology/Computer Science.

Now that I've been out of college and jobless for a couple months, I've been trying to think about what I really want to do with my degree and what my goals are. I would really like to combine my interest in computer science with biology or healthcare applications. Whether that is writing software for a medical device or writing compute programs to analyze the human genome, I want to do something that contributes to society and helps people.

Seeing as it is difficult to find an entry-level position for a BME (especially in the part of the country that I live in), I've been thinking about trying to find an entry level computer science job that could help me improve upon my programming skills. The next step would then be possibly applying for graduate school where I could then go for my masters in either BME or Computer Science with an emphasis in bioinformatics or computational biology. Does this sound like the right course of action for someone in my position? Any advice from you redditors would be appreciated! Thanks!"
2bzjx6,2,2014-07-28,A little bit of a reversed question here. Has anyone ever left a promising career to join the military?,[deleted],Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/2bzjx6/a_little_bit_of_a_reversed_question_here_has/,"I am a 24 year old (soon to be 25) technical writer. I am at a very promising point in my career and would have no problem moving forward with technical writing. 

A little bit of my background: 

I grew up on a pig farm in small-town Minnesota. I have been working since I was 10 or 11 years old doing farm work and other odd jobs. I have held a steady job since I was 15 years old. From 18-20, I worked as an EMT - I and loved everything about it. 

I was always very interested in joining the military, but my family has always been firmly against it. I love my family to death but the level of control that I have allowed them to have over me my entire life (even to this point) is beyond frustrating. So I discarded the idea of the military and did what my parents wanted me to do and went to college. That entire first year I wanted nothing more than to drop out of college and go to school to be a paramedic. 

I graduated from a good state school with a BS in English writing and an abysmal 2.0 gpa. I did not push myself hard in school at all because it was not really want I wanted to do and was therefore uninspired. I focused my studies on technical and international communications, and even worked on a couple of very cool international projects with partners in Europe. I interned with a fortune 500 company and was their first ever technical writer intern.

I received my first job offer about a month after I graduated and have been with this company (another fortune 500 company) for just over a year now. I am at the beginnings of a very promising career, but I am abso-fucking-lutely miserable. 

I hate the 9-5 drag. I hate that I sit on my ass for 8-10 hours a day. I hate being inside all day and never being challenged. 

Why the heck would I think about leaving this to join the military? I don't really know. I suppose I have always painted the military in my mind as a big adventure where I finally leave the safety of Minnesota to travel across the world and to be a part of the world events that I always see. I want to be a part of something bigger than myself. I would love the opportunity to serve the country that I love, and to wear its uniform. 

I am not worried at all about making a lot of money. I have no family of my own yet and very little personal debt. I am therefore not tied down by anything other than my student loans. 

I am not afraid of hard work, and I actually relish it. One of the jobs that I had that I look on the most fondly was working in a lumber yard where I would go home every night sweaty and exhausted. 

I know before I would do anything I still have a lot of research to do. But what I want to know from you all is, am I an idiot for considering this? Is this just the last hopeful thoughts that I have before I submit myself to the sensible 9 to 5 drag for the next 40 years?"

I feel like I am just working to get what little money I get and getting out for the night. I also work an internship, which I love. But it is unpaid, and is over in a few weeks. 

I've had a few interviews, and I just had one that I thought went really well, and I could really see myself doing. I just got the call that I didn't get it, and I feel horrible. Of course I am sad I didn't get it, but I also am having financial hardships. My boyfriend makes more money than I do. He knows that and I do too. Of course, he is nice and is helping me, but I can't do this forever. I have my own bills, we are moving into a more expensive apartment (which he can afford to pay the majority of rent, bills etc. but I have to help out too, and I WANT to). I feel like a leech. I feel like I won't find anything as far as work goes for a long time, and I feel like if I stay in the restaurant I will just break down one day soon and lose my job anyways. My brain always goes to worst case scenario, but I can't snap out of it. 

I keep telling myself that every day is one day closer to finding something or for things to be different, but that also has led me to just sit around and really do nothing because I just want the day to be over. I like reading and doing other things, but I have no money to do things, and reading has been hard lately for no good reason. I also feel like I am wasting time when I am not looking for a job (which I have been doing a lot of the entire summer) and like I am wasting time when I sit at home. I even have a vacation with my family scheduled that I am nervous about because a) I will not be making any money and b) I won't be looking for a job. I feel like I can't enjoy anything. I feel as though I should be celebrating a good summer since I graduated, but then I feel guilty about that too, since I don't have a ""real"" job. I feel like I am behind. I'm 23, and if my car broke down, I wouldn't be able to fix it or get a new one. That sort of stuff. On top of it all, I told one worker at my internship about the job interview I had that I just got turned down for, and she told a lot of people, and so now I have to go in and tell them I didn't get it. Just feeling crappy lately. I am seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow, but I feel so lost, and I feel like the way my brain works is getting in the way of everything, and making it way worse than it actually is.

I don't know if this is the right place to post all this, but I feel like people here might be awesome because I am a lurker. Sorry. "
2bzmni,1,2014-07-28,Looking for some sage advice regarding compensation for an internship ...,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2bzmni/looking_for_some_sage_advice_regarding/,"Hi /r/webdev!

I will try to keep the details to a minimum. I am a fifth-year undergraduate student studying design and computer science. My school has a fantastic co-op program for which I've completed four out of five semester-long, full-time co-ops (or internships). For my third co-op, I was fortunate enough to land a summer internship with a top tech company in Silicon Valley. While I was initially brought on to the team as (essentially) a web designer, my skill at programming and problem solving earned me the freedom to focus almost entirely on development projects when I was invited back for the spring.

Although my team (from said tech company) would have greeted me with open arms for a third internship, I instead made the (foolish?) decision to find something entirely new that could serve as my fifth (and final) co-op. My reasoning for this was that it would allow me to maximize the variety of my professional experience(s) before graduation. My team was very understanding, and we are on excellent terms.

Here is where I could use your better judgement, Reddit ...

I go to school in the Midwest. Ohio, to be specific. I have been talking/interviewing with a few local companies that do design and development work. It has become pretty clear to me that, were I to accept a co-op position at one of these companies, I would be receiving considerably lower compensation that what I'm used to working for. This is, *of course*, no great surprise. The cost of living in the Midwest is *considerably* lower than in San Francisco. What I would like to know is whether or not you think I am being taken advantage of, or whether these opportunities may still be worth following. To put things in perspective:

* My most recent co-op (with Big Tech Company) had me earning $30/hour. My team was incredibly happy with the quality of my work, and I felt that I was contributing close to what was expected of the other members of my team. I was having a blast.
* Today I was offered a position at a local marketing/design shop to do ""a mix of UX and development"". They offered to pay $12/hour.
* Also today, I did a first interview with a local startup accelerator. While the work could be exciting, I learned upfront that they offer $1000/month stipends to interns as compensation. This equates to about $6.25/hour, and interns constitute over 60% of their dedicated staff.

It is not always easy to estimate what we ought to be worth to an employer. (This is especially true for someone like me who does not have 5+ years of industry experience under their belt). Were I to guess what would be ""fair"" compensation given my location and amount of experience/skills, somewhere between $18–22/hour *feels* right. But could this be totally unrealistic?

So my questions are:

* Could anyone share a realistic expectation for what a web development intern — with four semesters of professional experience including multiple internships with a top company in the Valley — should hope to expect from fair employers in the Midwest?
* Should I not buy in to the ""We pay our interns less because they get valuable real-life experience"" hype? The thought of eschewing pay as a priority seems silly to me when, in eight months or so, I will be looking for a real job where compensation will certainly be factored into my decision. Have I contradicted myself here?
* Should I simply write off my last co-op as ""experience"", and disregard pay? There are many around me (*cough* co-op advisor *cough*) who would tell me that compensation should never be a priority with internships, and *experience* is all that matters. But I am just not comfortable with the idea of being underpaid for honest, quality work (I believe that I bring real value to my employers, and can function with as much efficiency as most full-time hires)


If it helps, I am highly proficient in HTML, CSS, Sass, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. I have experience using frameworks like Angular and Smarty for work projects that were usually independent. I've written lots of Python and PHP to build web services/tools, and have significant academic experience with C++. The majority of my academic background is in design, so my UI/UX skills are very strong. I have a slick portfolio, which I wouldn't mind sharing to anyone who sends me a PM. I'd just like to avoid posting it here publicly if possible.

Yikes! Sorry for the wall of text. I'd REALLY appreciate any perspective on this ..."

This cert will be a 9 months study of one of the following languages c/c++, Java or C#. I have one year in the service left and they will pay up to 4500 for a certificate. I would like to take advantage of that... I have no other options besides self teaching and free online material, none of the schools around me offer CS courses... 

This is just a way for me to get some structured experience and have something to show for myself when I start my actual CS program, the knowledge will aid in creating a strong portfolio and being competitive for internships. 

 - Which language has the biggest market? The school I plan on attending after I get out teaches primarily in C/C++.

2bztvp,14,2014-07-28,"Like a bad soap opera break up, except it's my Masters thesis committee (Rant)",midnyghtchilde,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2bztvp/like_a_bad_soap_opera_break_up_except_its_my/,"Hi there, just joined, because I need to document this story and share my rant with the world as I really can't believe how this is happening.

WARNING: LONG 

Background: I'm pursuing a master's in essentially conservation policy. I have a BSci in Zoology, worked for 5 years pretending to be a chemist, and went to graduate school to return to my first love. I have finished 4 semesters of classes, and now just have to finish my thesis. I'm doing a survey of public opinions on some conservation management practices around a local nature preserve. I strove to set everything up so it would go out end of May/early June and I would not overlap with the busy season at my job (which is at a different Preserve and my dream job, which I got because I was an intern, and my boss said I couldn't leave, so I was a seasonal, and now permanent, working on conservation and education).

As a chemist, I was promoted every year, have a patent, and a few awards for my work. My bosses loved my independence and strong scientific ethics. So I have independent research experience - I ran my own projects, ran the lab instruments, and wrote 100+ page reports on a bimonthly basis for customers.

So I tell you this background, so that I can tell you my thesis horror/drama story.

Flashback: 1 month ago!
Committee Member X is from the Organization around which my survey centers. He's not the chair, my School Program Director Z is, but Z told me to just work with X because this isn't Z's expertise and since its about their organization, he should lead. So I have. X is habitually slow - at least 2 weeks and often 1-2 MONTHS to reply to things I've asked. In March I asked about switching from an in-person to a mailed survey, and if the Organization could help - he said no problem! Well after a few months, it turns out that it IS a HUGE problem, and he never asked anyone about it, he just said yes.

So after my mistakenly contacting another staffer at the organization, X emails me and says ""call me Monday or Tuesday""...well I am working in a rural area without cell service and super busy. I email, saying as much, but I'll try to call on Tuesday. I do, and no answer. Thus begins a week of leaving of voicemails and emails attempting to get ahold of X, getting more frustrated because my super busy season at work starts in a few days and I really can't deal with thesis drama now.

At the end of a week of radio silence, X finally emails and says he is quitting the committee as he doesn't have time. Queue stunned silence and an at-home meltdown by me. I recover, contact Z and the second in charge of my program, and ask for help. Z and I talk, I fill him in, as i have no idea why X is quitting. Z says he'll back my decisions, there is funding available to help, and we'll get it done. 

We start thinking of new committee members, and Z says he will call X's boss, who I know and have talked with recently, and ask him to step in. Boss says he can't, then apparently has a talk with X, who them emails me and says he'll stay on the committee because it doesn't make sense for another staff member at the organization to do it. we are now 2 weeks from the initial ""call me"" email, and a week after X's temper tantrum quitting.

I talked to Z and said I didn't think I want X back, I'm moving on, we're finding a new place to support the work, and he's been a problem from the get go. X has also, on two occasions, demeaned my work, implying it is not independent enough nor enough work to merit a masters, though no one else agrees with him, and insulted my abilities as a scientist. Z called X ""childish"" and said he has a reputation for being tough to work with. I waited a week to think it over before emailing X and telling him it was OK, since his organization can't help with the mailing anymore I'm moving on, and thanking him for his time. He replied good luck with my work.

Come today I have an email from Z, saying that X is going to call him to ""discuss"" my thesis and wanting to stay on the committee. Z still supports my decision either way, and offered only a token reason for X to remain on it. I told Z more bluntly that I'm tired of delays and my scientific ability being questioned and insulted, and that as X's peer (which I am in my job at my organization!) in conservation, I'm embarrassed by this entire debacle. I did say that if X wants to call me on MY time to talk, I'm open to it.

I'm now waiting to see what they discussed and if I get any contact from X. Unless I get an apology for the tantrum I'm not budging, and I don't expect one.

TL;DR: Thesis committee member has temper tantrum and quits, committee chair attempts to get members boss to step in on the committee, member obviously gets a talking to and offers to stay but I don't want him and his trouble back. Then like a bad break up, member goes to committee chair and tries to talk him letting him back after I told him. Chair supports me! 

Shorter TL;DR: thesis committee member breaks #1 rule: don't be a dick, turns committee into soap opera!

2bzzsu,1,2014-07-28,20 year old college student figuring out how much my tax refund will be next year,FreeRangeHumans,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2bzzsu/20_year_old_college_student_figuring_out_how_much/,"Basically I'm just trying to calculate in advance how much my tax refund is going to be for 2014, and am looking for advice on the best way to file.  

I'm 20, in college full-time, and have an internship that I will have a grossed $7,250 by the end of this summer, and that will be my only income for this year.  I'm obviously in the lowest tax bracket, so my federal will be 10% of that ($725), and I pay a 5% Illinois flat state income tax ($362).  I am making the assumption I will not get Medicare and SS back, so those are irrelevant.

I am aware that my standard deduction is $6,200, which I am planning on taking.  This means, I think, that I will pay 10% on the difference between my $7,250 and $6,200.  So at the end of the day my federal income tax paid will be $105 and my refund will be $620.

Here is where I need clarification: I qualify for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which, as I'll quote from the IRS website: ""is a tax credit of up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year. Also, 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable. This means you can get it even if you owe no tax.""

So what does this mean?  Am I able to claim this tax credit along with my standard deduction?  Surely the government won't refund me more money than I paid in taxes...  What would be the ideal route to take in my situation?  Much thanks in advance."

2c05hj,0,2014-07-28,Our university counselor insisted I keep a log of my feelings (Part Two),NoSleep4Malcom,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2c05hj/our_university_counselor_insisted_i_keep_a_log_of/,"Excuse any sloppiness with this post, I just got back from Nicole's and I'm still a little buzzed. I couldn't wait though; I've uncovered some shit that needs to be shared. Things are getting strange, guys. I'm pretty sure what happened to Anna wasn't an accident.

Firstly, if you missed yesterday's submission here's a link to get you caught up: [Day One](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bwep9/our_school_counselor_insisted_i_keep_a_log_of_my/)

Okay, let's start. After writing last night's post I finished up the rest of my homework, which took a good hour and a half mind you, and then tried to sleep. Last night was the first time I lay down with some degree of normalcy - if you'll remember I spent the better part of Saturday night cradling the toilet as a pillow - and thus it was the first time I tried to sleep while dealing with Anna's death. I don't know how many of you have witnessed death before, but it's a horrible sickness. It's like an insatiable hunger that eats at your very being, destroying even the thought of rest. Whenever I close my eyes I'd see her limp body falling torturously slowly but impossibly fast, hell, I don't think I'll ever erase that image from my mind. It'll be there forever. It took me hours to even get close to sleep. And even when I was *asleep*, I wasn't really. I hung between consciousness and darkness in an unsteady seesaw. Sleep was too permanent; it scared me. I wasn't confident enough to release myself. So after about a half-hour of doing my quasi-meditation monk-rest shit, I decided to go to the bathroom, not really to go, just to *do* something.

My feet slipped out of the cold coffin that I had been trying to sleep in. Our room was so cold nowadays. I swear whenever I breathe out my mouth smoke comes out. I didn't want to flick on the light - I'd wake up Benny - so I stumbled over backpacks and notebooks, propped open the heavy wooden door, and slipped through the crack I had created. 

The light was on in the hallway; a layer of grime and muck - casualties of the war insects waged with the bulb - covered it, painting the white stone walls a nasty greyish yellow. I hovered outside my door for a second, letting it close as gently as possible. A soft thump echoed through the hallway and then there was silence. A cleaner light was spilling in from my left. One of my dumb-ass suite-mates had left the door open. I hate the door being left open for three reasons: One, at night and in the winter, it gets fucking freezing in the hallway; leaving the shower from the bathroom becomes the equivalent of hiking through the Siberian wilderness completely nude; Two, it lets bugs in, huge nasty bugs, dangerous stinging bugs, creepy spidery bugs, annoying buzzing bugs; they're all terrible; and Three, if a dangerous axe-murderer ever so happened to get past our high-security (key cards) into our dorm, we're practically inviting him in. I decided I would shut it after I had my piss. My feet still sore from the collisions with school-supplies, I hobbled over to the bathroom door. In one swift, majestic movement I turned the doorknob and rammed about half of my weight into the door. It was like a cartoon, I completely rebounded and nearly fell over. I must have scared the living shit out of whoever was on the toilet.

""You scared the living shit out of me!"" It was Benny's faint voice that came from the toilet.

""Good. So you're finished?"" I retorted as I steadied myself and stood up, speaking in that kinda of scream whisper that you think is quiet but really isn't.

""I'll be out in a minute fuck-head."" 

*Fuck-head*, now that was a new one. I have to remember to give Benny shit for that next time I see him. Anyway, since the bathroom was now in use, I decided I might as well close the suite door.

My socks whispered as they slid across the wooden floor. I moved with a measured softness, attempting to return the suite back to a state of silence. The light projected my shadows against the yellowed walls, presenting a clumsy drama of darkness for an empty audience. God, I should have just slammed that door right then and been done with it, but something...indescribable drew me outside. I couldn't take my eyes away from the spot where she fell. The smoke still wrapped itself around the iron bars. It was such a terrible place. Every time I walk by I shiver. It's a tainted place, corrupted. I was hypnotized; my eyes were locked on that spot in space. I could feel death's pressing down on me with its awesome force. I felt it watching me. I was trapped. 

Then I heard that awful noise. The hairs on the back of my neck are pushed by the pumping air conditioning as I'm writing this. It was a booming, commanding tone; it insinuated itself into my body with the authority of a god. The noise was solid, I felt it press up against me, well up within me, push me and pull me, tear me apart. My mind became non-existent; I existed totally in the sound. I was complete. It eclipsed my seemingly minute existence. I was nothing. I was paralyzed in a blissful horror; my heart ached as the behemoth bellowed, as it cursed its captors, as it seduced its lovers. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. I wanted to turn my head to gaze upon my beauty, but I feared I would go blind. It resurrected the secret chord, embodied the perfect harmony. Captivation had taken its hold on me, wrapped its spiny fingers around my body, constricting my lungs-

And it was gone. I thought it was over. 

Then I heard the sirens. 

I don't know if it was a police car, or a fire truck or an ambulance, but that didn't really matter. I always thought sirens were creepy when you heard them under normal circumstances. They were tied so closely to death. But the sirens I heard were...warped. It was as if some had grabbed the waves of sound right out of the air, stretched them out, and held on as the inched their way towards me. The slowed down sound grew louder and louder, a cacophonous crescendo, the all-encompassing waves were closing in, I was petrified.

""...Mal?""

It was silent now. I turned around to see Benny's wide eyes focused on me. ""Thought I'd get some air."" I managed, though he didn't look convinced. ""Somebody left the door open again."" 

""Oh. Ha-ha. Bet it was Eric. I can totally beat him up if you want me to."" Benny knew something was up but he didn't push it. He went to sleep and a few minutes later, I followed him.

So now it was Monday morning - today. I woke up at 9:30 as per usual, and got ready in fifteen minutes flat; I'm the last one to leave in the morning so I have the bathroom all to myself. After throwing on a pair of dress shorts and a ""way too expensive to be a plain navy blue"" t-shirt I headed out the room. There was a new addition to our suite. A hastily scribbled upon piece of paper clung to our door, detailing every one to ""kindly fucking close the door"". Classic Benny.

My first class was Organic Chemistry, a total drag and a terrible way to start off the day. I have the absolute worst professor. He is unintelligible, stupid and plain terrible. At first I'd thought I just disliked him. But this dislike grew and grew I don't know if it was because I was missing sleep or because I had skipped breakfast, but I broke through to a whole new level of hatred today.

God he was disgusting, with his stupid fucking hook nose that was about a hundred times too large for his fucking body. And his beady little eyes that scanned the students, probably getting perverse pleasure out of our boredom (and checking out the cute girls that little skeev). He had terrible skin, acne breakouts all over his face. What was he a teenager? With his shitty, patchy beard. And don't forget his hair with grease and oil clinging to every strand. The fact that it was thinning all around brought me joy. I'm sure he smelled terrible, but I never got close enough to tell. He looked like he smelled terrible. Like a pile of rotten meat left out in the sun. The only purpose of his existence was to wrought misery. When he sat down in his chair - which he often did cause he was a fatass - his layers of bubbly cellulite would hang over the edge. God...I wanted nothing more than to smack his head into his desk. To slip the tip of a pencil through an eyeball, like slipping a knife into jelly.

Andrew is in my class and he actually likes him. I'm thinking about it now, and, he's not horrible. But today...today was different, I don't know. I'm going to say Anna's death fucked me up more than I realized. I'm sure Mrs. Keira will have an explanation.

Anyway after Organic, I have Violin lessons. Lessons are mandatory for students in Orchestra. They kinda suck but I don't mind too much when I practice with my quartet. There's this cute girl, Jess. She's a stunning blonde, always wearing those thick hipster glasses. And, she has amazing fashion sense, like top of the top best dressed. It's hard to believe, but she plays the bass! And she's damn good too. We've kinda been flirting back-and-forth, but in the 'I'm too much of a pussy to do anything' sort of way. And she's so nice. I'm not going to lie to you guys, wife material. Oh and as for why I'm in Orchestra. Chem/Music double major. It's a lot of work but, to me, it's worth it. I absolutely am in love with the violin - I couldn't give it up - and, as much as I complain about Chemistry, I actually do really find it fascinating.

After violin we have our suite lunch. Mondays are nice because somehow all the stars aligned to give everyone in my suite a free period around lunchtime. Eric and Benny both just come out of classes, and Andrew comes from his internship at our university hospital, so we can spend an entire hour acting weird, messing with each other and eating almost average cafeteria food. 

The rest of the day isn't really important, just a couple of classes and studying. Nothing really to note, until a couple of hours ago. 

I've known Nicole for a long time and I knew she was hurting. Anna was just a friend to me; I can't imagine how traumatic her death was for Nicole. I hadn't seen or texted her since our run-in at the counselors office and I felt bad about it. She needed a shoulder to lean on and I wasn't sure if she had one. Plus we were both grieving, it would be easier - if that's even possible - to talk to her about the death then anyone else. I shot her a text asking if she wanted to hang out and talk. I got a reply almost immediately saying she did. And so, I grabbed the fifth of rum I had been holding onto for a special occasion and headed over.

The first thing that struck me about their room was the duality of it. Carefully aligned pictures of friends and families, and perfectly grungy posters were the only thing on the wall of the right side. A bed adorned in extravagant pillows and a fanciful comforter was pushed against the wall facing a clearly organized desk. But the left side of the room...holy shit. Sheets of paper coated the wall so thickly that you couldn't even make out the color of the paint. And each of those pieces of paper was covered in the craziest sketches I had ever seen. There were portraits, with their features over-exaggerated, heads oblong and eyes scratched out. Wild patterns and shapes covered most of the remaining wall. The strangest drawings also happened to be the centerpiece of Anna's wall of madness. It was on a large scrap of construction paper; a detailed landscape stretched out into infinity, in the background there was a tree and you could just make out the figure of a person hanging. I tried not to look surprised when I stepped inside but that was pretty fucking hard. Anna had always drawn but never like this.

I managed a smile when I saw her; she was well dressed, so that was a good sign. ""Hey Nicole."" I pulled out the cheap plastic container I had stuffed in my backpack, ""I brought your favorite."" I sloshed the amber liquid around in its container, and coaxed a smile out of her.

""Good god, with all this talking planned we could use a throat loosener."" As soon as I set my bag down, she wrapped her arms around me in a tight embrace. She felt cold. The alcohol would help with that. ""But on a Monday night? We have class tomorrow. That's kinda sad.""

""Yeah but come on. It's the second week, we aren't really doing anything."" She didn't look sure. ""Come onnn Nicole. It'll be like high-school all over again."" I convinced her with that, after all, who turns down drinking with a old high-school friend? She pulled out two cups, I poured the liquid into them and we both sat down on her bed.

""So how are you doing?"" I sipped a meager portion of my drink, my eyes never leaving hers. So it began, the awkward tango around the subject of interest. How long would this last? Who would break the-

""I need to talk to you about Anna."" She must have seen the surprise in my face, because she quickly added, ""I need to talk to *someone* about Anna. Everyone else just dances around the subject, too scared to say anything. But you knew her, and we're close Mal, no matter how much we joke of how we aren't."" I simply nodded. ""You see this-"" she motioned to the wall, ""Anna did all of these in a week. They're beautiful, but how she drew them- I just don't know. Whenever she would draw she would like enter a trance. Nothing could disturb her; she remained just functional enough to dissuade any interest or conversation. I feel like that's *all* she did this first week. She was acting strange from the moment I saw her Mal. Every once and a while I'd catch glimpses of the outgoing girl we all loved, but they were rare. I'm trying to piece it together but nothing makes any sense.""

""I know, I know.""

""...And there's something else."" Nicole slipped off the bed. Reaching under Anna's old pillow, she pulled out a blue double-ring notebook. It looked fairly new, as if she had bought it for the current school year. ""I found it earlier today, it's just, I can't explain it. You need to see."" She handed it to me and, nervously, I flicked over the title page. Going through the notebook took a long time. As I went through the book, we were mostly quiet; taking sips of our drink every now and then.

There were no pictures in this notebook, only words. So many words, decorating every page in a sharp script. I don't remember everything in the journal, but a few excerpts stood out to me:

There was a bible verse, which struck me as strange because Anna was not religious *at all*.

**Revelation 1:7** *Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.*

It was repeated over and over again, in various different calligraphies and styles but that same fucking verse. But that's not all there was. No, what the whole journal was centered around was the lyrics of a song. You know ""I'll Be Seeing You"" by Billie Holiday? Nicole later told me that Anna would constantly play that song, though she couldn't find the version that she would play on youtube or anywhere.

*I'll be seeing you*

*In all the old familiar places*

*That this heart of mine embraces*

*All day and through*

*In that small cafe*

*The park across the way*

*The children's carousel*

*The chestnut trees, the wishing well*

*I'll be seeing you*

*In every lovely summer's day*

*In everything that's light and gay*

*I'll always think of you that way*

*I'll find you in the morning sun*

*And when the night is new*

*I'll be looking at the moon*

*But I'll be seeing you*

*I'll be seeing you*

*In every lovely summer's day*

*In everything that's light and gay*

*I'll always think of you that way*

*I'll find you in the morning sun*

*And when the night is new*

*I'll be looking at the moon*

*But I'll be seeing you*

The page that the song was written down on was covered in scratchy writing. It took me a little while to decipher but they read, ""They made me blind"" and ""I've lost myself in the woods, who am I"". It was terrible to see those words haphazardly scratched into the paper, bleeding the parchment in black ink.


*THEY TRAPPED ME*

*I'M DROWNING*

*THEY TRAPPED ME*

*HELP ME*


I shut the book. Nicole looked as scared as I felt. ""What the fuck?""

""She wasn't herself. Something or someone was controlling her. Mal I'm terrified."" Nicole took the book from me and slipped it back under Anna's pillowcase.

""Was Anna with anyone strange recently? Who is the *they* she keeps talking about?""

""I don't know. I don't understand any of this shit.""

I gave Nicole a quick squeeze - she looked like she needed it - then let her go. ""We're going to get to the bottom of this. I promise you. Now you said she had been spending a lot of time in the campus gardens right? We'll check it out tomorrow. I promise you we'll figure this shit out. Anna deserves us to.""

After a few minutes of reassurances I left and came right back here.

This is so fucked up. I'm not even sure what to do. I only mentioned the gardens because Nicole needed some direction; I doubt we'll find anything there. The most frustrating thing is, I don't even know what to do. And who the fuck is *they*. No, I've decided. Anna definitely didn't take her own life on purpose. Some sick fuck was behind this. Maybe they used drugs or hypnosis or whatever. But I'm going to find them."

2c06mh,2,2014-07-28,Unconventional Applicant for a CS MS Program; Advice Appreciated,Cambienta,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2c06mh/unconventional_applicant_for_a_cs_ms_program/,"I'm a student who's currently studying computer science post-bacc. My undergraduate degree is from CalArts in Character Animation (a well-respected school for that subject; don't know if anyone here would have heard of it). While at CalArts I became pretty interested in CS, and would like to go into tools/software development/research related to computer graphics (requiring a CS education). My fourth-year project at CalArts was done in CG. 

I'll be applying this fall, 2014.


To list my qualifications thus far:

-I graduated in May of 2013 and for the past year have been commuting between 5 different schools to grab all the classes I would need to apply to a master's program (more than 200 miles per week, which is kind of absurd). Right now my CS GPA is a 3.7, overall since graduating GPA is a 3.55 (CalArts is too artsy for GPAs, apparently, but I tried converting our fake grades into real ones and it was a 3.3/3.4-- I don't know how seriously anyone would take art school grades, though). I'm currently taking Design and Analysis of Algorithms at UCI. 

-I have lite work experience in the animation industry (mostly freelance jobs done while an undergrad, and internships at studios in Burbank). 

-I have had two CS professors offer to write me letters of recommendation thus far (so I need one more), and think they would write me ""good"" recommendations based off of what they have told me (one of these professors wrote me a recommendation for something already, and it was very positive; I got kind of teary-eyed about it, because I'm a sap). 

-I don't know if this is worth anything, but I placed second at a hackathon...?

(I haven't taken the GRE yet-- I'm planning to take it in September. I scored a 2160 on my SAT, mentioned in case it can give you any idea of how I might do on the GRE). 

I'm most interested in attending an MS program with a thesis track (which seems to be most of them), and am very interested in the development of simulation systems (fabric and fluids), and topology-related problems. 

That said, I have two questions:

1) I have no idea which schools I'm qualified to even dare apply to. Right now my top choice is UC Irvine, and I wasn't planning to apply to any schools ranked above that one (Irvine is 29, if I remember correctly). Should I apply to higher-ranked schools as well? Should I forego Irvine and only apply to schools ranked lower? Some of my friends are trying to convince me to apply to a few schools ranked between 10-20, but I'm nervous to consider it because I don't want to waste anyone's time (if that makes sense). 

2) I've heard really conflicting things on whether to send college-level coursework done while in high school. Does anyone know anything about this? I've had quite a few people tell me not to send any stuff from before graduating high school, which would be welcome news. I went to a ""middle college"" type program (I really wanted to ""broaden my horizons""--I was such a cliche--before going to art school), where we took a bunch of dual enrollment classes, and I think my performance falls into the category of ""mistakes you made when you were 16-years-old"".

Thank you for reading all this! "

So Kira is about four and a half months old now, and she has recently started barking and growling at strangers (people or dogs). Usually the strange dog is bigger than her to incite barking / growling, and the strange person is usually very tall or male. Other strangers she usually ignores. She has always been a very timid dog when it comes to new people / dogs, but never showed overt aggression. Before she would retreat and try to run away, but now this change in behavior is worrying me. Just for some background, she's never had any negative experiences with either dogs or humans (she's been in my care from 6 weeks old) aside from this shyness and running away. She's also been well socialized from day one, as I live in a town where she comes into contact with many humans and other dogs on a day to day basis. The new behavior started after she spent two weeks at my parents house where she was less exposed to people on a day to day basis. This itself is also worrying, as I'll be leaving her in their care for a few months while I complete an overseas internship this Fall. I've contacted a pet behavior specialist in my area to help me out with the behavior, but I guess I'm just looking for any help or suggestions you all may have. Perhaps any similar stories? She's such a sweet girl when you get to know her, and I certainly don't want this barking and growling turning into more aggressive behavior as she ages. 

Edit: Just an updated picture of her as well :) http://imgur.com/XjgpIg7 "

2c086a,1,2014-07-28,He Came Forward,TaylorWCain,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2c086a/he_came_forward/,"Before you read: I posted this back in the Fall of 2012. Both Cody and Claire are now in a different part of their life still fulfilling all that God has promised for them. Cody has been back in America for about a week now. Callie, and I drove up to Danville First Baptist to listen to him speak about his journey through Europe. He is back and because of answering the call to obedience to Christ he will be in Fayetteville taking his dream job. Claire is married, and living life to the fullest making disciples, and encouraging believers all over Northwest Arkansas. It truly is an honor to watch these two grow in and towards becoming like Jesus Christ. 

 

 

The title will change until I feel like it fits the body, but for now it will remain “He came forward”. You can find this in John 18:4 “Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to Him, came forward…”. This is one of the most radical statements recorded by any of the authors of the four Gospels. Jesus, the Son of God, knew what death would satisfy the wrath of God. He knew the sufferings, and the beatings that went along with it. The man didn’t even hesitate. He came forward. Why would He do this? Thankfully I have been around friends who have been called to the mission field or even to a foreign area. Now their calling probably wasn’t as terrifying as facing crucifixion, but to me it is a small glimpse through a periscope looking at the agony that Jesus would face. These friends left family members behind, and churches, and friends. In small town, U.S.A, that is a pretty big step of faith. One of my friends Denver Cody Dennis, pretty bold name if you ask me, just left for Western Europe on a two year business trip. He left his family who is struggling with illness, and friends who are growing up, and every person misses being apart of that. Trust me its a pretty big thing.   Then, I have this friend who I just made, she has decided to take on an internship at her church in Fayetteville. She is a sophomore here at Tech, and is one of the most audacious girls I have ever met. It is good getting to know her, and how God is calling her to obedience, and how she is being tested in that obedience. She will be ministering to the youth up in Northwest Arkansas, and Cody is sharing the Gospel in Western Europe.

God calls us to certain places, not because He couldn’t reach that area without us, but that he wants us to be a part of His glorious plan that He is doing in each and every nation on this planet. It is crazy that He would want to use us, but He does. Not only does He, He prepares us, He sets us apart after choosing us into His divine redemptive plan. We don’t deserve it. This is a big part of why Cody, and Claire went forward because they are doing, and will do great things in furthering the kingdom here on earth. Jesus had to go forward. If He didn’t many prophets would be found false, and the plan that God saw before the foundations of the world wouldn’t have been true. Paul would be a liar, along with the rest of the NT writers. The Holy Spirit wouldn’t have been given up, and we would have no hope. Jesus Christ is our hope. He is our mediator, and we can do nothing without Him. Because of this we too should go, and seek the areas He wants us to come forward. Whether it be at your local church, or your college. Going forward has many implications. We tend to look at Jesus’ life as a baby, and admire how adorable he was. We see Him as a young boy teaching leaders in the temple, and think of how simple his life must have been. Also we see Him as someone who lives in great love, with people surrounding Him. Sometimes we can picture Him as someone who was a popular figure of the day, who lived a good life, with friends, good health, and a loving family. Now John 18 back we see this. Jesus is the epic nature loving, earth saving dude of today from chapters 1-17. Why is it so hard to see Christ suffer? Is it because that is the lifestyle we don’t want inherit? Sadly, this is more true today than ever. “Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him”, should we go forward into the next parts to what He went forward to?

“Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s headquarters,[d] and they gathered the whole battalion[e] before him. 28 And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, 29 and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 30 And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. 31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.”-Luke 27:27-31

Along with becoming heirs of all that is Christs, His suffering is ours too! How great the news that one day, maybe even very soon we will see persecution face to face, and have the opportunity to be counted worthy as the suffering Christ. From a non-believer looking in the life of a Christian, this would look absolutely insane, but this is what Christ summons us to."

2c0fza,0,2014-07-28,A Tinder Success Story??? Anyone can offer some insight?,[deleted],Tinder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/2c0fza/a_tinder_success_story_anyone_can_offer_some/,"So a few weeks ago I met up with this girl (Got her number my second day of messaging her and had a meet up set by the third day). I opted for something casual so I took her to eat some pizza. Went to a place and headed to a park to eat and have some casual conversation. We ended up talking for about and hour and a half after which i offered to go get some ice cream. She said yes and said that she was having a nice time and wanted to keep talking.

We went to an ice cream joint and found seating at the back of the place where there were some empty couches. At that point I slowly began to escalate, I tried sitting closer to her and she responded by slowly digging her knee under mine (very subtle response, but you get the idea). We talked for another hour, making her laugh quite a bit and kept slowly escalating incorparating physical contact, again she reciprocated. Eventually I suggested to go to Central Park (Based on her telling me that she was meeting a friend around there later that evening). In the subway she continued the escalation holding my hand and putting her head on my shoulder, complimented her in a funny way and she gave me a kiss in the cheek. We got to the park  went to lay down hanged out there for another hour and a half.  The moment showed up and I gave her a kiss and another until we had to leave. Right before we parted ways she was saying how we should meet again next time i was in the city and show me around( I temporarly live 30 min away in Jersey) that I was wonderful to meet me. I followed up with what she said and kissed her before leaving. 

At this point I realized I hadnt been excited for a girl this much for a long long time. We shared strong common interests, had interesting discussions, made each other laugh alot, had a great connection. Her company was just wonderful.

Fast foward Later that night I get a message from her and we end up meeting again around 10 PM went to the park and left by 1 AM ( You get the idea, unfortunately we got interrupted by a group of guys trying to find a place to smoke). I get an Uber for her to get her home safe (she was staying with her parents for the summer as she is a native new yorker). She gives me a kiss and a hug before she leaves still insisting that we should meet again. Sincerely, I didn't expect this to happen. I was just  looking forward to taking her out for a second time and carrying on the conversation.

Annnnnnd I haven't seen her since.

It is important to note that I'm an intern in the area for the summer, and shes only home for the summer and we had discussed this.

I included all these details because this sort of seemingly smooth escalation has never happened to me before with my other tinder meetups or dates, and I was wondering if this is normal??

I have casually texted her three times in 3 weeks trying to arrange another meet up but she never responded. This is driving me crazy, given what i wrote above and her excitement to see me again, it's excruciating. 

I dont know if I should be more insistant, or if she flaked, but I would really want to see her again before I have to leave the area to go back to school in early august( I basically have one more weekend). After that I know I might not see her again but I still leave with a nice memory.

Any one can offer any insight on what might have happened with her? And how should I approach my last attempt to try to meet with her again?

Thank you in advance I know this is a long post.

I'm from Oklahoma, but I'm living in southern California for a summer internship. I've been wanting to quit fapping for years, but haven't quite been able to. So when I came out here, I set a goal that I'd be done before summer ended.

It's been a rough summer. Most of the time at work I feel like I don't know what to do. I haven't found anybody I'd really call a friend - mostly because I'm pretty picky in the friend department. I know some people I feel comfortable talking with, but nobody I hang out with regularly. I tried dating one girl, but she was always way flaky and I felt like she wasn't telling me the truth about why. So with all of this dragging me down, I was starting to lose my motivation to quit. I slipped from fapping about once a week to every 2-3 days.

And then, I stumbled across /r/nofap. I'm so happy that I did. Browsing the threads, you've all helped me to remember all the reasons I want to stop fapping. Better relationships, more energy, more time, and more positivity in general. Thank you so much. I'm a little anxious for the week mark since that's always been hard, and I've only made it past two weeks twice in the last 3 years. But I feel good that I'll be able to come here and hear what's gotten you all through the tough times.

Yes it's been a rough summer, but I still have 3 weeks left to start my life of nofap. So, here we go!

I am a recent college graduate with a BAS in philosophy and psychology. I held a customer service position during school that led to two eventual promotions, a lead and a supervisor position (both which I worked until I graduated). I've been reading around this subreddit and it seems like once you get up there in your career as a software developer, you program less and your main role is making sure projects get done, effectively and efficiently. 

I wouldn't take back my degree in philosophy, as it was pretty much a major for me. But if I could go back, I would have done computer science instead of psychology. Since graduating, I have taught myself Javascript, jQuery, php, python, c and c++ (well, at least the basics and syntax of each via codecademy and lynda.com). 

Long story short, I am a little lost trying to find my career path. My dream career now is to be a computer scientist, I want to play my part in whichever team would have me to finding solutions to complex problems. The problem is, I don't really have a guide to show me how to do it at this point. I've seen some suggestions about going  back to get a second bachelor's, but there are a limited number of schools that have such a program for cs. I also saw some posts about getting a masters but I don't know if that would benefit me, I don't know how strong my cs foundation is as it hasn't been tested in an 'institutional setting'. 

So any advice would help. I've been looking into finding junior developer internships. Even if I did have to go back to school,  I wouldn't mind. But I would probably do an internship and/or job that is in the career field this time around. Thoughts and suggestions much appreciated! Thanks!"

Anyway, bf and I had a great 1 year relationship where everything was perfect. I might have been a little rash but seriously on our first date I thought we would spend the rest of our lives together, and my feelings haven't changed. However, recently, as in the last month, we've moved to a new city for an internship, and met some new friends, and I feel as if he no longer talks to me as much anymore. In the past, we would talk every night until we were both so tired that we would fall asleep in each others' arms. Now he spends a lot of his time playing LoL and that's fine, but he seems to be less willing to talk to me in general. So I used to talk to him using an instant messaging platform and he's been rather unresponsive at work, which I attributed to him being busy at work. But recently I found out that all of his new friends switched to another instant messaging app and so he switched too and I never knew about it, and he would talk to them a lot on the new app and no longer checked the old one. Which is why he no longer responded as much. I mean, did he not like talking to me SO MUCH that he didn't bother to tell me he switched apps AND both apps give notifications on his phone so it's not like he couldn't have scrolled a little deeper in the notifications just so I wouldn't be ignored. 

And recently he's been hanging out with his friends a lot, and that's okay. Except he wouldn't openly tell me until I asked, so I would have to constantly ask ""Where as you?"" for him to give me an answer why he's not home yet and it's 12 AM. In fact, I've had numerous people/mutual friends tell me things like ""Where's (boyfriend)? Oh he's still eating dinner with (friend), right"" and I would have to pretend that I knew that or that I didn't really care where he was because he never told me. I feel like that's fucking embarrassing. And I would never dream of not telling my SO where I'm going if I'm staying out late or not caring if my SO sent me a message and making them wait hours before getting a response. 

I don't want to bring this up because I've been rather emotional lately and I've been nitpicking on small things, so I feel like I've already been acting VERY demanding. I don't want to act even more demanding. But this is not the way I want to live so if it doesn't change I'm reading to break up with him and find someone better. Every time I have these 'talks' with him I feel a little bad because I ALWAYS get emotional and cry so I feel a bit manipulative. He seems to feel really bad when I cry, too, so I just try not to get emotional anymore. We did have a talk the other night and he said that I've been angry lately and I put down everything he says, so he is afraid to talk to me. I can admit that I have been angry lately and when I am angry I lash out at the person closest to me, which is him, but I also think my anger is at least in part caused by how much he's changed. I've tried to control that and I do think I've stopped being so negative, at least on the outside, but I don't think not sending me a quick text telling me where he is at 12 AM is caused by me being too negative. Honestly I feel like I'm at my wit's end and instead of ""telling"" him he should do this or that, or he should have to check in with me every few hours, I should just break up with him. But of course, I don't want to do that because I love him and up until a few weeks ago everything was just as if we had started dating and we had NO problems. I don't know what's happened and I don't know how to fix it, if I even could.

Help, please?"

2c1l4y,2,2014-07-29,[22 M] Met a wonderful girl [20 F] through Tinder. Hoping to see her one last time.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2c1l4y/22_m_met_a_wonderful_girl_20_f_through_tinder/,"So about three weeks ago I met up with this girl from Tinder.I opted for something casual so I took her to eat some pizza. Went to a place and headed to a park to eat and have some casual conversation. We ended up talking for about and hour and a half after which i offered to go get some ice cream. She said yes and said that she was having a great time and wanted to keep talking.

We went to an ice cream joint and found seating at the back of the place where there were some empty couches. At that point It slowly began to escalate, I sat closer to her and she responded by slowly digging her knee under mine (very subtle response, but you get the idea). We talked for another hour, making her laugh quite a bit and it kept slowly escalating with more physical physical contact. Eventually I suggested to go to Central Park (Based on her telling me that she was meeting a friend around there later that evening). In the subway she continued the escalation holding my hand and putting her head on my shoulder, complimented her in a funny way and she gave me a kiss in the cheek. We got to the park went to lay down hanged out there for another hour and a half. The moment showed up and I gave her a kiss. We made out multiple times and chatted while we were at the park. Right before we parted ways she was saying how we should meet again next time i was in the city and show me around( I temporarly live 30 min away in Jersey) that I was wonderful to meet me. I followed up with what she said and kissed her before leaving. 

At this point I realized I hadnt been excited for a girl this much for a long long time, and that I have never had such an immediate great connection with someone. Her company was just wonderful. I couldn't wait to see her again. Her personality was just Amazing.

Fast foward Later that night I get a message from her and we end up meeting again around 10 PM went to the park and left by 1 AM ( You get the idea). I get an Uber for her to get her home safe (she was staying with her parents for the summer as she is a native new yorker). She gives me a kiss and a hug before she leaves still insisting that we should meet again. Sincerely, I didn't expect this to happen. I was just looking forward to taking her out for a second time and carrying on the conversation.


Annnnnnd I haven't seen her since.



It is important to note that I'm an intern in the area for the summer, and shes only home for the summer and we had discussed this.

I included all these details because this sort of seemingly smooth escalation has never happened to me before with my other tinder meetups or dates, and I was wondering if this is normal??

I have casually texted her three times in 3 weeks trying to arrange another meet up but she never responded. This is driving me crazy, given what i wrote above and her excitement to see me again, it's excruciating. 

I dont know if I should be more insistant, or if she flaked, but I would really want to see her again before I have to leave the area to go back to school in early august( I basically have one more weekend). After that I know I might not see her again but I still leave with a nice memory.

Any one can offer any insight on what might have happened with her? And how should I approach my last attempt to try to meet with her again?

She told me she works at a library and that I should definately swing by so she could show me. Given That she doesnt respond to my attempts to contact, I debating on wether or not to show up at that place.

---   
**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!
Amazing first date, We had an immediate connection, spent about 7 hours that day with her. She was excited to meet up again. Tried to set up a second date never heard back from her. I only have one last chance to see her again."

2c20lh,2,2014-07-29,My sister has schizophrenia,[deleted],schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/2c20lh/my_sister_has_schizophrenia/,"My twin sister started getting schizophrenia since she was 15. We're both 22 now. It was quite debilitating when it all started. She was afraid of taking a shower in our home for fear of being watched. My mom would have to take her to the change rooms of public swimming pools. She dropped out of public school to be home schooled because of social anxiety. She's seen a psychiatrist and has tried medication before she believed they would ultimately do more harm than good.

She had a good grasp of her illness when it all started. It took a couple months of convincing, but she started to realize it for what it is.  And things were more or less normal for a few years. She would still hear the voices day in day out but the topic would only come up on the odd occasion, partially due to her unwillingness to talk about it and us not wanting to make her uncomfortable. She would get bad temper swings and defensive whenever the topic was brought up. She did react better to me when I spoke to her of it, unlike my parents. Perhaps it's because we grew up together and experienced similar things...maybe she felt I could relate better.

Then things got rough again.  A year after we had both started University, she would exhibit really odd behavior.  Sometimes cursing under her breath at the dinner table. Other times kicking the back of my mom's driver seat as our mom would pick us up from Uni some days. She did all this with a extremely frustrated look on her face, as if she was battling something. You couldn't talk sense into her when these episodes happened. Other times my mom would tell me she would go into her master bedroom's change room, which happens to share the wall of my sister's room. My sister would make loud bangs on her desk, as if to let my mom know she's aware. My mom would cook in the kitchen downstairs, which also happens to be right below her room and at times she would stomp on the ground and lash her keyboard against the table. She's gone through a few keyboards/mouses because of this.

I managed to talk to her about this one day alone. She thinks my mom is somehow able to manipulate her feelings, thoughts, even facial expressions. I try my best to tell her this is a cause of her illness and to remember how real it all seemed when it started too. But shes gone this time, convinced that things are too coincidental.  That when my mom would go up to bring her a plate of food, she could feel the tension on the part of her wrist that you would use to hold a plate of food.

And then some days she would go down to have straight up arguments with my mom. Saying things like ""Don't give me that innocent look, you KNOW what you did"".  And obviously my mom is oblivious, helpless, and  shocked.  It's tough because on one hand I know her behavior is a symptom of her illness, but its so hard to forgive her or be calm about the situation in moments like this.
 
I'm not sure what to do anymore to help her.  She refuses anymore medical aid.  She graduated college last summer with a very high GPA, with a neuroscience major, hoping to be able to get into med school.  Academically she was set, but because of debilitating social issues, she couldn't get past the interview stage. She's been home over a year now, not doing much. But I think this bothers her. She knows being so dependent on my parents isn't right, and she wants to do something with her life. I've been away from home for over half a year now for an internship.  I just got a call from my mom a few weeks ago saying she wants to study Computer Science now (What I am doing), and that she wants to move half way across the country to go to another University. She's currently over 40k in debt, with another 60k if she does this. My parents are already helping her with the first, there's no way they could afford to help her with this. But shes stubborn and she wants to go, saying naive things like she can find a part time job when she hasn't worked a day her life, that she can take care of herself. But that's another story...

TLDR: Sister has paranoid schizophrenia, rejects medication and help. It's getting worse and she's getting more reckless. Not sure how to help her anymore."
2c21s8,2,2014-07-29,I need your perspective on internship compensation [x-post from /r/webdev],[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c21s8/i_need_your_perspective_on_internship/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions!

[I originally posted this on /r/webdev, but I'm looking for more feedback. Please let me know if you think this is a violation of reddiquette]

I will try to keep the details to a minimum. I am a fifth-year undergraduate student studying design and computer science. My school has a fantastic co-op program for which I've completed four out of five semester-long, full-time co-ops (or internships). For my third co-op, I was fortunate enough to land a summer internship with a top tech company in Silicon Valley. While I was initially brought on to the team as (essentially) a web designer, my skill at programming and problem solving earned me the freedom to focus almost entirely on development projects when I was invited back for the spring.

Although my team (from said tech company) would have greeted me with open arms for a third internship, I instead made the (foolish?) decision to find something entirely new that could serve as my fifth (and final) co-op. My reasoning for this was that it would allow me to maximize the variety of my professional experience(s) before graduation. My team was very understanding, and we are on excellent terms.

Here is where I could use your better judgement, Reddit ...

I go to school in the Midwest. Ohio, to be specific. I have been talking/interviewing with a few local companies that do design and development work. It has become pretty clear to me that, were I to accept a co-op position at one of these companies, I would be receiving considerably lower compensation that what I'm used to working for. This is, *of course*, no great surprise. The cost of living in the Midwest is *considerably* lower than in San Francisco. What I would like to know is whether or not you think I am being taken advantage of, or whether these opportunities may still be worth following. To put things in perspective:

* My most recent co-op (with Big Tech Company) had me earning $30/hour. My team was incredibly happy with the quality of my work, and I felt that I was contributing close to what was expected of the other members of my team. I was having a blast.

* Today I was offered a position at a local marketing/design shop to do ""a mix of UX and development"". They offered to pay $12/hour.

* Also today, I did a first interview with a local startup accelerator. While the work could be exciting, I learned upfront that they offer $1000/month stipends to interns as compensation. This equates to about $6.25/hour, and interns constitute over 60% of their dedicated staff.

It is not always easy to estimate what we ought to be worth to an employer. (This is especially true for someone like me who does not have 5+ years of industry experience under their belt). Were I to guess what would be ""fair"" compensation given my location and amount of experience/skills, somewhere between $18–22/hour *feels* right. But could this be totally unrealistic?

So my questions are:

* Could anyone share a realistic expectation for what a development intern — with four semesters of professional experience including multiple internships with a top company in the Valley — should hope to expect from fair employers in the Midwest?
* Should I not buy in to the ""We pay our interns less because they get valuable real-life experience"" hype? The thought of eschewing pay as a priority seems silly to me when, in eight months or so, I will be looking for a real job where compensation will certainly be factored into my decision. Have I contradicted myself here?
* Should I simply write off my last co-op as ""experience"", and disregard pay? There are many around me (*cough* co-op advisor *cough*) who would tell me that compensation should never be a priority with internships, and *experience* is all that matters. But I am just *not* comfortable with the idea of being underpaid for honest, quality work (I believe that I bring real value to my employers, and can function with as much efficiency as most full-time hires)

If it helps, I am highly proficient in HTML, CSS, Sass, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. I have experience using frameworks like Angular and Smarty for work projects that were usually independent. I've written lots of Python and PHP to build web services/tools, and have significant academic experience with C++. I am quite comfortable using Git/SVN, and I've picked up a bit of Bower/Grunt for my personal projects. The majority of my academic background is in design, so my UI/UX skills are very strong. I have a slick portfolio, which I wouldn't mind sharing to anyone who sends me a PM. I'd just like to avoid posting it here publicly if possible.

I'd REALLY appreciate your perspective(s) on this. Thanks!"
2c22qx,219,2014-07-29,I'm a lazy A-Type,DeathIsBeckoning,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2c22qx/im_a_lazy_atype/,"So dear readers I bring you another tale of my IT internship. 

This one is concerning a stereotypical type-A personality who knows nothing of the ""'puter"" and consistently a thorn in our side. A month or so into my internship, the warnings given during my nickel tour start to make sense. This particular warning was: ""She is a VP ($BVP), but an idiot; immediately escalates, bi*chy, mean, and complains when whatever takes longer than 30 seconds to complete. BE AWARE."" I think to myself, mmmkay... and go about my day(looking over my shoulder in her direction). 

Not today however. Today we get a ticket to resolve a printer issue on ""her"" laptop, and it needs to be fixed ""NOW! I have a (power point) presentation in 2 hours!"" 

O.K. fine, already off to a good start, lets just knock this out, and make her happy for once (maybe?). 

I head over to her office, and notice a sickly caramel smell of some perfumy candle burning that is emanating from her office (open flames not allowed, but she apparently has a special need to put all of us at risk). Her office is a visually moody, dimly lit, and the dark cherry decor was tastefully done; soft white noise is playing on the personal CD player to complete the feel. She had created a ""zen"" zone and it was actually pretty cool (I would have done the same thing had I had the chance to do so, sans the nasty candle). Given her demeanor and attitude towards anyone other than herself (and upper management), she really needed it. 

So back to the issue at hand. I walk in: 

&gt;$Death: Hi $BVP, I'm $Death from the desktop team, you submitted a ticket for a printer issue?

&gt;$BVP: Goddamnit it took you long enough!

I'll skip the rest of the back and forth, but within 5 minutes of the ticket being created I was there, you get the jist.

&gt;$Death: O.K. so lets test this out and see what it does &lt;-print-&gt;

Off in the distance I hear the networked printer kick off a job. I walk to the printer, grab the top stapled job from the stack, confirm it was what I just printed.

&gt;$Death: So $BVP, it seems to be printing fine, what was the specific issue that you getting? I'm a little confused.

&gt;$BVP: No one brought me the printout, I thought it wasn't printing.

What? Did... What?

&gt;$Death: O.K. let me go check something real quick, I'll be right back.

No way. She can't be this bad... can she?
I head back over to the printer and confirm my theory... there were approximately 10+ copies of the same .ppt in the stack; spaced in between other print jobs.

Ha, wow.

I collect the copies, and bring them back to her.

&gt;$BVR: Just put them over there.

&gt;$Death: Sure, are you all set?

20 seconds of awkward silence whilst she flips through the .ppt printout in her hand.

&gt;$BVR: Yes.

TL;DR: Keep printing copies until someone brings one to me. No one brought it? Create a ticket."

I realized 3 years ago I made a mistake graduating in this field, as I wasn't really that passionate about it, but went to grad school anyway....which turned out to be another mistake. I strongly dislike my grad work and am just going through the motions at this point. 

I've always liked computers, and I've always wanted to be able to program. I absolutely love the notion of of being able to...well, ""create"". I've spent a few hours learning just the basics of coding and I really want more. My passion has always been with computers, hardware, software....just everything about it. I still don't know why I didn't switch majors during my undergraduate years. 

Now, though, I'm hesitant. I'm 27 years old. If I go back for a CS degree, it would take about 2 - 2.5 years. And, even if I practice coding on a consistent basis during that time, I'm still going to be a new, inexperienced programmer by the time I get a degree. 

I'm passionate about this stuff, and feel very strongly that this is what I want to do, but I'm worried that I'm too old to ever be a successful software engineer...especially when I see these high school kids getting coding internships at places like Facebook and Google.

I don't quite have the job, but this is the closest I've been to having one and I'M SO HAPPY!",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2c2fau/im_shadowing_a_potential_job_tomorrow_on_my/,"I graduated college in May and since then, I've applied to 100+ jobs that ranged from positions in my desired field to fast food service positions. I was desperate for anything. I'm down to my last $40. I've only had two interviews since May and while my friends have been getting job offers, I've had no call backs which was making me super depressed. I have an issue with feeling worthless and not being to do anything right and the no call backs have been triggers. I've been crying myself to sleep 3x a week.

My mom found an internship placement event this morning for 18-24 year olds who did not finish high school. I knew I didn't qualify, but I gave it a shot. Maybe someone wants someone with a college degree. Plus, my mother kept pushing me to go and wouldn't stop until I step foot outside the door.

I spoke with the director of the program who immediately told me that I did not qualify for the program, HOWEVER there's a job position that they wanted to talk to me about with their organization. It deals with community outreach (which is WHAT I STUDIED IN COLLEGE) with at-risk youth and I am super excited to do this!

The director showed my around the center and we met some of the kids (they had a shell around them, but they were super awesome) and I can see myself working here. I'm going to shadow the position for the next three days and if it works out, I would start on Monday.

My mom is super excited and happy. She's usually reserved and quiet, so I'm happy to see her like this. She won't stop talking about this.

I'm doing something right. This is the best almost-birthday ever."

I'm currently attending the University of Washington in Seattle. I'm studying something unrelated to computer science, as I discovered my interest in programming kind of late into college. I am likely graduating in June 2015, and I don't have any intern experience yet. I've taken 4 comp sci/programming courses and am planning on at least taking 4-5 more (the important ones that are offered here, like data structures/algorithms, algorithms &amp; their complexity, intermediate programming concepts, etc) before I graduate while self-teaching. I also am looking into doing on-campus undergraduate research with the CSE department here.

I'd like to work as a SDE post-graduation, but I know that I'm kind of working on a time constraint, which is now until I graduate, or 1 year. I know that I have to learn as much as possible during that time-frame. So that is a gist of my situation, and realistically, I see myself interning after graduation because I don't think I will enough experience by graduation in order to get a full-time job.

So I wanted to ask you guys and see how common it is to be an intern after having completed a degree and wanted to hear people's experiences, or anything you guys think would be helpful for me to hear!

Thanks!"

I am working a lot during the summer, as an software developer intern, and would like to start a business, which is one dream I am having in my life, in my freetime. I can code and I also think, after reading several books about marketing, I am not that bad in basic marketing stuff. As through my limited time my requirements for a business are:

* should be fast to setup and easy to start -&gt; not coding 2 weeks and then seeing that nobody wants it ;(
* should be ""internet based""
* should have an easy and straight forward business model, which really generates some money
* should help me to get some business experience(most important part!!!)

I really want to start that because I want to gain practice in running a business. Therefore I really appreciate your ideas what I could possibly start!

Best regards! "

I'm afraid to apply for any more jobs, because I don't even know what I want to do after graduation, I only have a couple ideas of what I like doing. I'm afraid no one would hold a job open for me, or that I would get it, then move here, start working, and get so depressed or have it not turn out the way I thought it would, lose the job, and then be ""stuck here"" (I would rather be homeless than move back in with my Nparents). So far I've been rejected from multiple jobs anyway, so that doesn't encourage me to apply for any more. I'm afraid to work on my LinkedIn profile or my website, because I'm afraid they would both just end up looking like shit. 

My Nparents have filled my head with self-doubt, told me I wouldn't fit in in this new city, told relatives I only got the internship I have because I ""was so persistent the internship coordinator finally waved the white flag"". I'm financially dependent on them and I'm trying to get a job I could do remotely that's based in this city, so I'd have something to come back for &amp; a way to make my own money. I'm afraid to go to new cities around here because I'm afraid of getting lost on the train or getting lost in the new city. 

I'm afraid to ask my landlord if they can do a personal walkthrough with me of my apartment before I leave, so I can get my security deposit back right before I leave, instead of them mailing it to me. I'm afraid they'll say no. I'm afraid to ask them if their other apartments will be opening up later this year after I graduate, because I don't even have a job here lined up. I just want so badly to get away from my Nparents after graduating.

I HATE being afraid of them. I HATE that I'm afraid of trying new things because of all the shit they filled my head with. 

I have a therapist I talk to every few weeks, they help me but I hope the rest of you can too. "
2c3ewb,3,2014-07-29,Career Advice/Help,yankeesdevils123,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2c3ewb/career_advicehelp/,"Hey, so I'm just look for some career advice/help within Accounting/Finance world

Here's mY backstory: Graduated with an Accounting Degree (3.5 gpa) from a smaller school in December ( was unsure of what to major in so I didn't do any internships, a big mistake). In April I finally got a job  but it was just an accounts payable position with a temp agency. 

By June, I interviewed and got a new job as a Staff Accountant I for a midsize company that is owned by a large corporation. I was hired by them but as a temporary to perm employee paying 19.25/hr, which is supposed to be a 3 month period. Today I was told by my boss that they were going to hire me permanently on August 15th @ 40,000


Alittle about the job: I am assigned a bunch a clients that we do distribution for and am tasked with creating the P&amp;L's for each, along with any corresponding JE's. I also compute the Fee for every Client in the Company.


So I have a few questions regarding this:

Does this seem like a fair salary? I honestly was expecting more then a $1.64/hr raise. I live in the Tri-State area and on glassdoor it says the average salary for Staff Accountants are $50,0000.

I wasn't even able to negotiate a salary. Do you think when it comes time to become perm I will be able to do that? 

I'm already bored of the job. I have taken tasks that took a person who was there for 10 years and took them all day, that now takes me an hour using vlookups and excel. (This is just one example). It seems too easy for me. I'm looking for more of analyzing and using my brain to figure things out and think outside the box. Is there anything like this in accounting like it seemed in school or should I maybe look into finance?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
2c3jti,2,2014-07-29,Day 39: My Thoughts (First NoFap Streak),Yeah_Buddy_999,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2c3jti/day_39_my_thoughts_first_nofap_streak/,"First of all, I don't think I could have ever made it to this point without the NoFap community. And I thank you all for that. I started the the first day of summer and want to go the whole summer (as the first goal). I have a few different points that I want to make and will divide them up into sections. Sorry it's long but that would be cool if you guys read it and commented on it.  

Relationship status
 I'm still a 21 year old virgin who hasn't even held a girl's hand or been on a date. However, I fell like I have a chance now. I see woman as people rather than just sex objects. I also can appreciate their face and hair rather than the body.  I still have not gotten the courage to ask anyone out. There is this one girl but she has a boyfriend who she is not too serious with. I'm I unofficially in the ""Aquantance Zone"" with her (part of a study group for our major total group is 6 and she is the only girl and you're correct it is engineering currently in summer school). I'm trying to move on but am having a tough time with that. When I have my mind set on something I have a hard time changing which is a double edge sword. I know I have to move on but it hurts. I love her hair and that she is very mature. I have seen her exponentially mature over the last year. See look at me not dropping it.  

Telling someone I know about NoFap
I told my best friend last night about my commitment to NoFap. He was supportive and agrees that P is horrible but M is a natural part of life. We exchanged our first experiences with P and M. I was surprised to hear that I had M at a younger age than him 15 vs. 16 (both a lot older than most). He told me about him qutiting P for a month because of ED. I'm really glad to have told him and I know that I can be accountable to him if I need help from a person I can directly talk to. 

Social Settings
Again I have respect for woman and don't see them only sexually. I feel much less awkward is these settings. Even the group I hang out with at school told me that I'm not awkward. A few weeks back We were getting subs and as we were leaving someone said that girl cashier was awkward. I followed by saying no I'm the one who is awkward.  Two of them completely seriously told me that I am not and said that you use to be a little but not anymore. This made me really feel like I was getting somewhere.  I hadn't seen them for 5 months because I was on an internship far away. So they thought it was the work I had done which was part of improving Social skills but also NoFap helped a lot. 

How I feel (physically)
I have never had more energy and have been consistently working out about 4 times a week. I wake up every day around 6 am and am ready for the day. I use to be really tired no matter how many hours of sleep I got. One goal I have now is to run in the town festival 5k at the end of  August. I'm 6ft &amp; 270lb but can run over 2 miles on the elliptical with an average of 7:20 per mile. Still trying to get my knees strong enough to run on pavement. I may have to find one later but you never know. 

Random stuff
I no longer feel like a piece of shit. Fapping never interfered with school or work but I would waste about 3 or 4 hours a week on it and this doesn't even account for my planning when where and how I would do it next. I feel like days are much longer now that I got this time back. I will say I probably spend 2 hours a week here but this is actually productive time. 
I have increased confidence that I will be able to land an awesome full time job before I graduate in the spring.

 I think it would be so cool to go to the past and talk to myself about my addiction. I don't hate that person but I feel so bad for him. Because he tried to quit for the whole 2.5 years he was addicted to it. I have a journal that He wrote and talked about trying it quit before NoFap. He though he was alone in the world with no one else wanted to quit so why should he quit when everyone does it. Where I heard about NoFap was on a BuzzFeed video called facts about male masturbation. When I watched it I was hoping to get increased justification to it being ok. They mention NoFap being a subreddit where people try to quit. I decided to look and though it would make me laugh. started reading posts about people trying to quit and lots saying for the summer. I determined that I want to do this for the summer. Guess what the first day of summer was tomorrow and I said and did one more fap right before bed. I started out completely failing. I remember that night I though long and deep about doing it. The next day I went on it again and made an account then set my badge. Here I am. 51 more days til the end of summer. I think I'll make a new goal of going the entire fall semester without fapping. I'll make another post about that when appropriate. 

I obviously don't have any huge success stories to write now but I have a completely different mindset about life. Again thank you so much NoFap and especially anyone who got to here reading. "
2c3kxb,1,2014-07-29,Should I be optimistic?,[deleted],OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/2c3kxb/should_i_be_optimistic/,"I joined the site at the beginning of June and sent out a few messages to girls that I had a high match percentage with. Didn't have much luck with that until about a month after I sent a message to a girl she replies. She told me that she had not been online for a month so I started talking to her. We have a 93% match and from talking to her I wanted to meet her. We go to the same university and live in the same area so distance wouldn't be an issue.

Throughout talking to her through OkCupid she would respond at least an hour after I sent a message even if it said she was online. So then I got her phone number and the same problem. Most of the time replying hours later or even the next day to any texts I would send.

Eventually I get this: ""To be honest I've enjoyed talking to you but I don't know if I'm able to keep up a relationship (text or otherwise) right now. If you still wanna talk when the school year starts again though I'll be more free"" We talked a little more after that so she didn't just disappear. She is working at 2 internships during the summer so I can understand how she might me busy.  Our school starts in late September so it would just be a long time away from now.

I want to know if anyone has advice/opinions on my situation. Would I still have a chance in a couple months?"

Today I was extended an offer for a full time position doing the same thing I do now for 42k a year. I live in Southeast Michigan so the cost of living is a bit lower than a lot of other places but I still feel like I'm being really lowballed. My skill level is definitely that of a Junior level software developer and I have managed some small projects on my own.

I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do here, I really love the people and the company and the atmosphere but I really do think I deserve alot more than 42k, I've looked at salaries for programming/software development in my area and the low end is usually 55k-ish. Am I not on that chart because I haven't graduated yet or am I really being lowballed here?

 My current work at the company is split between working on django(python) and spring(java) web apps right now. I'm pretty proficient in both of these languages along with javascript/html/css. I'm not a designer but I know enough html/css to get by until the UI guys get ahold of my stuff."

I've done web development for internships in the past, but obviously future employers would place more emphasis on what I did as a full-timer. Is it necessary for me to do side projects in other areas if I don't want to be pigeonholed, or are iOS development skills transferable enough that other companies would willing to place me in a different position?"
2c3so8,1,2014-07-29,Could use some assistance on filing for a background check.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2c3so8/could_use_some_assistance_on_filing_for_a/,"I'm a recent graduate who just accepted her first job at a local organization in my state. The position starts later this month but requires a background check. I have all the information required except for some information about a ""police record.""

The question states: Have you ever been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you?

I'm unsure how to answer this question. Three years ago (I was 19 at the time) some ""friends"" and I snuck onto an abandoned farm in my area to check it out, we had become obsessed with seeing ""spooky"" and ""abandoned"" places after stumbling across some cool photos on reddit and similar sites. Unfortunately we were caught and each issued tickets, we had to appear in court the next day and pay the fine and that was that.

I've regretted the incident ever since and recognize how much of a jackass I was to sneak onto private property - I since have an irrational fear of police officers and have very low self worth (this was something I already had). I don't much talk to the ""friends"" that I was with that night.

What I'm looking for advice on is, how do I answer this question? Is this even a criminal conviction? There wasn't a jury or anything like you see on TV, I literally went to court, got told what I did wrong, paid my fine and left. I've asked people like my parents if its something I should report and they laughed at me saying they did wreckless stuff in their childhood/teenage years and that this wasn't worth reporting.

From what I understand about the incident, I am led to believe that this is a disorderly persons citation but I still am not sure. Previous job applications (internships) only ask for felonies (which I know this is not) so it is usually not applicable.

Should I call the court/legal office in that town to find out? Any advice would be appreciated."
2c3sto,6,2014-07-29,What was the worst experience you've had at the gynecologist?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2c3sto/what_was_the_worst_experience_youve_had_at_the/,"Mine was a few years ago.  I was in college at the time and went ""home"" to go to the gyno.

I was in for my annual pap and my doctor came in and said, ""I have an intern with me today!""  The intern who walked in with her was a girl that I had graduated high school with.  She did not ask me if it was OK to bring the intern with her.

I'm already feeling awkward but I chose not to say anything.  At the time, I thought it would have been rude to ask the girl to leave, but looking back, I wish I had spoken up.

Anyway, they begin the exam.  I normally have kind of a hard time with pap smears anyway; I'm an anxious person and I have just always had a lot of discomfort during the exam, just shy of pain.  That particular exam was extremely painful for me and I basically ended up being held down by the intern while my doctor performed the exam and I cried.  So all-in-all a pretty embarrassing situation.

After the exam, the doctor gives me my chart to take up to the front desk.  As I'm walking to the front desk I look down and the chart and see what she has written on there.  I don't remember the exact verbiage, but it basically says that because of my reaction during the exam and because of some bruising and swelling she saw, she thinks it's likely that I've been sexually assaulted.

I cannot believe that woman let me walk out of the office without saying anything to me!  If you think a patient has been sexually assaulted, how can you let them leave without talking to them about it?

I didn't say anything to anyone at the time; I was too embarrassed.  When I got home, I told my mom what had happened, and she called the doctor's office and ripped them a new one.  I never went back to that gynecologist.

(BTW, everything was healthy and results came back fine.  I had not been sexually assaulted; the only explanation I can think of for any bruising/swelling is that I was seeing a guy who was particularly rambunctious in the bedroom and we had had sex the night before.  So I'm pretty sure the state of my lady parts was just the regular wear and tear.)

TL;DR:  Very painful pap smear that resulted in me crying in front of girl I went to HS with.  Doctor wrote on my chart that she thought I had been sexually assaulted but didn't talk to me about it, just let me walk out."
2c3tk8,599,2014-07-29,"My first job: 75 employees, 55 printers?!",Bytewave,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2c3tk8/my_first_job_75_employees_55_printers/,"This is an old story, not from my current workplace where frontline could have to argue to get a free pad of paper and pen, but from my former job where I started out as part of a 3 man team in-house IT at the HQ of a newspaper company, back when that line of work still got the bills paid. Fresh out of college, I would have been the classic PFY if I hadn't Accutane'd the hell out of the pimples years before. Technically I started as an intern, but it was a well paid internship followed by a series of generous short contracts.

I knew they were into printing, but that did not prepare me for the printer to worker ratio that stunned me as I walked in there. There was a formal 'print room' with a couple of the most expensive super office printers I'd ever heard of at the time. These two had all the features necessary to print legal tender and were not commercially available. There were the regular kind of printer pretty much everywhere there was a corner to put one around the floor, and yet every secretary had their own in their offices, too, and half the staff were secretaries. This wasn't a place with cubicles. All offices and boardrooms. Even the maintenance closet doubled as a relatively nice office.

It didn't stop with the printers. Everyone had everything. The latest gadgets for everyone above janitor. Second day my boss gives me an Expenses account explaining that I'll have to regularly purchase new things as I get orders handed down. 

&gt; /u/bytewave: ""Okay, I need to understand better how things work here. Why so many printers? Why are we ordering so many laptops and licenses just for this floor?""

&gt; My First Boss: ""Like we talked about in the interview, this is HQ and it has a unique culture. Anything that gets paper approved by any of the 12 Veeps or the President's secretary does not get disputed, we order it, we set it up nicely, we sync it when they can't. Each of them will be making sure their secretari(es) have all the same toys as the others. You'll be mostly migrating boxes for now, but if you get a paper order or email for any equipment, you put it in right away. By the way, always knock before entering a room with a closed door and wait to enter.""  

Oh yeah, migrating boxes... that's why they needed me to help out initially. Who the hell migrates all corporate boxes to a new version of Windows before SP1 is out? These guys. I've cloned more installs of Windows 2000 than I care to remember. They averaged 3 computers per head given the mountain of laptops. 

&gt; /u/bytewave: ""Instructions received, but I'm still fuzzy on the why on earth would they need all this?""  

&gt; My First Boss: ""It's not about need. There are some turf wars you won't want to get involved in. You'll see justifications like 'confidential work, cannot be printed on general printers', sometimes none. They don't matter, just remember, immediately order anything if it's from a Veep or the President's secretary as long as you get a paper trail and log everything. Aside from that, anytime anyone here calls you, stop cloning and go sync their PDA, unjam their printer or whatever. Keep the pager on you, keep the server room locked tight, be on time, dress like this, and carefully ignore whatever isn't tech related going on around here and you'll do great. Any questions, come to me or call.""

I soon understood what he meant. I have no point of comparison, this being the only time I worked in a corporate headquarters, but it was all turf wars and appearances, which were greatly valued over effectiveness. They'd routinely order equipment they'd never use just because one VP had authorized it for her secretary and now they all wanted one and they all got one. That was what had caused the explosion in printers; having your 'private' printer locked in your office was a status symbol of sorts. There was a lady whose' job was to ensure the huge 'office supplies' room was stocked up with everything imaginable and the cafeteria always full of everything, anyone could take anything they wanted, nobody cared if you took supplies home, she'd restock. No time for breakfast before work? Fresh muffins, fruits and such all the time. There were open fridges and damn good coffee. There were a few other perks, I'll save the best for another story.

The dress code and the level of chic was out of this world. They had a professional designer who came in biweekly to make sure everything was up to snuff, and she had a thing for pricey art and random furniture upgrades. Almost everyone had an official title so inflated that made it difficult to quickly understand the formal and informal hierarchies. The secretaries almost all looked like models, and there was a reason I was told to always knock before entering rooms. Rooms had names. 'Guttenberg Room', 'MacKenzie Suite', stuff like that. The President had a condo that he never used that was built as an extension of the floor, 1400 square feet of top-value skyrise office space lost, in case he ever felt like spending the night. Access was tightly regulated, I only went in once in over two years, but I could tell millions were spent on it. There was champagne and truffles on the clock every time they brought something out, which was all the time, they had come into money for a series of acquisitions. Meanwhile I kept hearing that in factories and floors they owned everywhere the conditions were terrible and staff retention was a big issue. But from the 39th floor in that tower, everyone was a kid in an open-bar candy store. 

I came to understand I got the job largely because I looked sharper, sounded more educated and dressed better than the others for the interview. They assumed we could all do the technical work given the degrees, which was a dangerous assumption given I learned on the job half the things I had to do. At least, I did learn a ton there. I had a very colorful coworker who was admittedly a good teacher in retrospect. Having to support such a mishmash of constantly rolling luxury hardware with no standardization process whatsoever was.. interesting. And the only thing I could really say 'no' to was 'please open the server room's door'. ""I want admin on this laptop""? ... ""Yes, ma'am"". And then I'd be removing comet cursor the following week.

We all have to start somewhere. I could definitely have done a lot worse, at least I had a taste of corporate luxury.

Quick background: This summer, I got an internship at the county Superior Court, doing anything I was told to do within reason (opening mail, refilling printer paper, processing traffic tickets, running case files between courtrooms, etc). Despite my best efforts, I ended up as the computer guy after resolving an Excel issue, and got called whenever someone had a problem.


Most of the time, people called for simple things, like the keyboard number pad turned off, or the mainframe client crashing, or the default printer set to Microsoft XPS. Simple things that took less than a minute to fix. I joked occasionally with the actual IT person assigned to the courthouse (named RealIT for this story) that nobody knew how computers work here, but it was painfully accurate. The upside is that he never had any actual work during the summer except for Windows Update and hardware replacements. 


One day, I'm preparing the calendar in a courtroom, and the clerk calls me over, asking me to fix her printer. No problem. I walk around the desk and open the print que. Nothing. I remember they use some {large corporation} print software I can't access because I'm not IT. I tell her that she is going to have to let it print out, and just keep re-feeding the printer, thinking she printed it three or four times. 


One hour later, the printer is still printing. This isn't good. I go knock on RealIT's door. No answer. Someone walks by and mentions to me, ""RealIT is out until Thursday."" Great. I walk back and tell the clerk to call the help-desk, which she does. I tell her to tell them she needs them to clear her print queue, which they start doing. Then I hear the clerk gasp. She calls me back over, and whispers, ""7023. 7023 documents in the queue."" Apparently, there is a bug in the print software, where the document will be sent to the printer a couple of times a second until the software gets a response. I don't understand who thought this was a good idea, but some programmer thought it would prevent lost documents, I guess. Printers were almost never offline, so nobody had seen this before. It gets worse, though. This wasn't a one page document being printer thousands of times. It was the judge note sheets for the cases tomorrow. All 37 of them. Some quick math in my head gave me somewhere around a quarter of a million sheets of paper. No printer can continuously print 259,851 pages. This printer would have melted. This printer would have caught fire.

2c403j,0,2014-07-29,Am I in any position to negotiate my salary as an intern?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2c403j/am_i_in_any_position_to_negotiate_my_salary_as_an/,"I am interning at a financial company, and I have been for the past year or so. I am a college student studying business.

I have many reasons to believe that my salary is considerably less than interns earn on average in my industry. I have researched the average salary for an intern at similar companies, and the average salary of students from my university who intern in the same industry. I make less money, 

I am tasked with fairly high level work. When I first started, I was doing the work of a regular analyst for a few weeks before my boss caught wind of it. I was doing the job well, but she made the fair point that it didn't look good that an intern was doing the same work as analysts. Since then I have completed a lot of projects, in addition to picking up the slack when an analyst is out of the office. We have contract workers in our office who are helping us with some very important projects, and it is very common for my boss to receive a completed product from one of them, hate it, and ask me to completely redo it. She and my supervisor give me a lot of praise for my work.

I have been persistently asked to apply for FTE positions in our department (and take night courses), but I want to continue with school and remain an intern. People continually ask me when or if I'm leaving, and I think it's fair to say that our department will be shorthanded if I leave (assuming no other analysts are hired). 

I recently got a $1,xxx bonus. I was really happy to get it, but if spread over the course of my employment, it amounts to a $.50 wage increase. I would like a 30% increase on my current wage, but don't know whether it's at all appropriate for an intern to negotiate salary, and if so, how to do it.

Can someone tell me if I'm being unreasonable? I've been told that as an intern, it's arrogant to complain about my wage and that this should primarily be a learning opportunity. I get that, but at the same time, I'm adding value to my department, and I feel like I should be fairly compensated for that. Should I broach the subject with my boss, or should I suck it up?"
2c4371,3,2014-07-30,What kind of experience would I need to apply for an internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c4371/what_kind_of_experience_would_i_need_to_apply_for/,"Basically I am trying to get a part-time internship this fall.

Is this good enough to get an internship? If so, How would I approach to getting an internship in the field. Thanks."
2c4799,55,2014-07-30,"My first job: 75 employees, 55 printers?! [Xpost]",Bytewave,talesfromtheoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/2c4799/my_first_job_75_employees_55_printers_xpost/,"This is an old story, not from my current workplace where frontline could have to argue to get a free pad of paper and pen, but from my former job where I started out as part of a 3 man team in-house IT at the HQ of a newspaper company, back when that line of work still got the bills paid. Fresh out of college, I would have been the classic PFY if I hadn't Accutane'd the hell out of the pimples years before. Technically I started as an intern, but it was a well paid internship followed by a series of generous short contracts.

I knew they were into printing, but that did not prepare me for the printer to worker ratio that stunned me as I walked in there. There was a formal 'print room' with a couple of the most expensive super office printers I'd ever heard of at the time. These two had all the features necessary to print legal tender and were not commercially available. There were the regular kind of printer pretty much everywhere there was a corner to put one around the floor, and yet every secretary had their own in their offices, too, and half the staff were secretaries. This wasn't a place with cubicles. All offices and boardrooms. Even the maintenance closet doubled as a relatively nice office.

It didn't stop with the printers. Everyone had everything. The latest gadgets for everyone above janitor. Second day my boss gives me an Expenses account explaining that I'll have to regularly purchase new things as I get orders handed down. 

&gt; /u/bytewave: ""Okay, I need to understand better how things work here. Why so many printers? Why are we ordering so many laptops and licenses just for this floor?""

&gt; My First Boss: ""Like we talked about in the interview, this is HQ and it has a unique culture. Anything that gets paper approved by any of the 12 Veeps or the President's secretary does not get disputed, we order it, we set it up nicely, we sync it when they can't. Each of them will be making sure their secretari(es) have all the same toys as the others. You'll be mostly migrating boxes for now, but if you get a paper order or email for any equipment, you put it in right away. By the way, always knock before entering a room with a closed door and wait to enter.""  

Oh yeah, migrating boxes... that's why they needed me to help out initially. Who the hell migrates all corporate boxes to a new version of Windows before SP1 is out? These guys. I've cloned more installs of Windows 2000 than I care to remember. They averaged 3 computers per head given the mountain of laptops. 

&gt; /u/bytewave: ""Instructions received, but I'm still fuzzy on the why on earth would they need all this?""  

&gt; My First Boss: ""It's not about need. There are some turf wars you won't want to get involved in. You'll see justifications like 'confidential work, cannot be printed on general printers', sometimes none. They don't matter, just remember, immediately order anything if it's from a Veep or the President's secretary as long as you get a paper trail and log everything. Aside from that, anytime anyone here calls you, stop cloning and go sync their PDA, unjam their printer or whatever. Keep the pager on you, keep the server room locked tight, be on time, dress like this, and carefully ignore whatever isn't tech related going on around here and you'll do great. Any questions, come to me or call.""

I soon understood what he meant. I have no point of comparison, this being the only time I worked in a corporate headquarters, but it was all turf wars and appearances, which were greatly valued over effectiveness. They'd routinely order equipment they'd never use just because one VP had authorized it for her secretary and now they all wanted one and they all got one. That was what had caused the explosion in printers; having your 'private' printer locked in your office was a status symbol of sorts. There was a lady whose' job was to ensure the huge 'office supplies' room was stocked up with everything imaginable and the cafeteria always full of everything, anyone could take anything they wanted, nobody cared if you took supplies home, she'd restock. No time for breakfast before work? Fresh muffins, fruits and such all the time. There were open fridges and damn good coffee. There were a few other perks, I'll save the best for another story.

The dress code and the level of chic was out of this world. They had a professional designer who came in biweekly to make sure everything was up to snuff, and she had a thing for pricey art and random furniture upgrades. Almost everyone had an official title so inflated that made it difficult to quickly understand the formal and informal hierarchies. The secretaries almost all looked like models, and there was a reason I was told to always knock before entering rooms. Rooms had names. 'Guttenberg Room', 'MacKenzie Suite', stuff like that. The President had a condo that he never used that was built as an extension of the floor, 1400 square feet of top-value skyrise office space lost, in case he ever felt like spending the night. Access was tightly regulated, I only went in once in over two years, but I could tell millions were spent on it. There was champagne and truffles on the clock every time they brought something out, which was all the time, they had come into money for a series of acquisitions.

2c4hy8,3,2014-07-30,Depressed in Silicon Valley,aorqnrvmfh,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/2c4hy8/depressed_in_silicon_valley/,"Hi, new here. I mostly posted in depression board but today I learned this and thought I would love here more! 

I am working as an intern in Silicon valley this summer and having a really great experience so far - yet I am still struggling with chronic depression. I'm having an ultimate start-up experience this summer, living and working with co-founders of the company as an intern. Last three months have been great - I feel like I'm enrolled in a short-term MBA course, learning the fundamentals of starting business covering diverse topics from finance, hr and marketing. I work and live in the same space with co-founders and other startup people in the industry community. It's like a dream come true, as this is what I always wanted for career development.

However, I am still depressed and I know it. I may feel like depression is gone with all the good things happening but I also know that it is still lingering in myself, waiting for the time to break me down. And for the past few weeks, my anxiety level is rising so quickly that I have headaches all the time. My anxiety is intertwined with my desire to be 'worthwhile' and worries about being a failure after all these experiences. Although now people are approaching me and I am developing pretty decent connections in the industry, I have these weird thoughts that I don't deserve any reputation nor rewards and I am going to fail anyway.  I feel like I am just faking everything and someday people will find out about that. Then I have to run away from everything.

Also after academic failures experienced in the school, I kept avoiding learning. I used to love learning for itself but now it has become the measure of intelligence and success of myself. I feel like I am always being judged. I hate to feel like a dumb person so I just keep avoiding learning new things, which is straining me to gain the most out of my experience. I am refusing to accept the fact that 1) I don't know things 2) But I can change it by simply learning about them.

Busy and traveling lifestyle had made it hard for me to be on a healthy diet (although I've been taking multivitamins and omega 3 consistently every day), to work out and to have time to focus on myself. The worst is that I was not able to see a therapist as I was moving around. Fortunately I have a friend in a similar boat that I can talk to but I really need a damn therapist. 

I am doing the best I can in my capacity - try to meditate in the morning/lunch times, do yoga (I recently got into it), journal my thoughts, watch TED talks. Try to have veggies and fruits as much as I can but my diet can be much better. I really should reduce sugarload. Overall I try to observe myself (learned from CBT) rather than blaming/judging myself. I try to fill up my mind with mantra ""I love myself no matter what I do"" Although it's hard to see if I am improving or worsening as my mind is not that tangible enough to scope through. Also a lot of times I simply neglect all these activities as I am too 'busy.'

I have dreams and aspirations and all I want to do is to move forward, instead of going back to the memories of failure and pain that lead to self-hatred. Sick and tired of ongoing depression, but I guess the only option is to fight against it and win over it, to live a life of my own without depression."
2c4ie4,6,2014-07-30,I [22/M] am jealous whenever my [22/F] girlfriend does stuff with fellow interns because of unresolved feelings of betrayal and I don't know how to get over it,MeizMahr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2c4ie4/i_22m_am_jealous_whenever_my_22f_girlfriend_does/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. Two years ago she started an internship 3 hours away. During this first internship she met a fellow intern, lets call him Bill, during the last two weeks. They became quick friends and everything was fine. 

Throughout the next semester, I noticed that she texted him a lot and that she talked about him way too much. I expressed concern about her becoming too close to him and she assured me that nothing would/was happening. A month in, she started expressing doubts about our relationship and that she was concerned that I was the only person she dated in college. I had a feeling that these thoughts, while valid, had something to do with Bill. One night I saw a text on her phone that suggested a more than platonic relationship. I let curiosity get the best of me and I looked through her phone. They had been heavily flirting ever since the end of the internship. After confronting her, she told me that it was completely innocent and that she would let the friendship fade into obscurity.

Fast forward to earlier this year. My girlfriend receives an offer from the same company, but before she accepts the offer she comes to me and lets me know that Bill would be there this summer, and if I had a problem with it. Knowing that their relationship was close to nothing, I didn't have a problem with it.

Throughout the summer, their relationship picked up and my girlfriend started talking to me about him all the time. At first I was fine with it because they were already friends and she didn't know anybody yet. I was comfortable in our relationship and I thought that everything was going great.

Then two weeks into the relationship, she admits to me that some things went down that she felt bad about and wanted to admit to me. She told me that one night she went to a bar, got drunk, felt vulnerable, and on the car ride home held his hand. Then, two days later, they were watching GoT and during an intense scene, she grabbed his hand. If it was anyone else, I wouldnt have had a problem, but because they had history, I felt like she emotionally cheated.

So, I drove up to visit her for a weekend, and we talked about it. She told me that she would talk to him about creating boundaries and assured me that nothing would happen. And for a while, from what she told me, that's what happened. I didnt hear about him as much, she started opening up to me about work and the other activities she was doing and things were looking good. Then, as she got comfortable with the boundaries with him, she started to let them bend. She started telling me about late nights talking, letting him walk her home from a party, staying up together until he was sober enough to drive etc. On one night in particular, they went back to her place to share a bottle of wine and talk for 2 hours while waiting for her roommates to come home. 

Of course I was concerned, but I trusted her and simply told her that sharing a bottle of wine is inherently romantic and made me uncomfortable. So, a month after my first visit, I went to go visit again because I had a weekend off of work. During this visit, everything was great and we had a good time on the first night, but things went down hill on the second night. During dinner, she admits to me that during their late night talks she would sometimes stare into his eyes because you know...its late. She also told me that she sometimes had thoughts about how attractive he is or how startling his eyes are. Of course this makes me super uncomfortable, and after the feelings of betrayal earlier in the summer, I considered breaking up with her. But we talked it out and she promised she wouldn't hang out with him one on one again.

Then, on the last night I was there, I was feeling incredibly distrustful and uncertain about our relationship, and so I woke up in the middle of the night and took her phone (I know a horrible idea and it was a horrible thing to do). In looking through her phone, I found out that the boundaries they set up were bent way more than I thought. He would put his arm around her at every party. They would hug for 10+ minutes when they said goodbye. One the Thursday before I visited, they hugged in the moonlight for over an hour. And on the night when they stayed up sharing a bottle of wine, she fell asleep on his shoulder, had a dirty dream, and woke up straddling his leg and moaning. 

I confronted her about it and, after a lot of fighting and almost break ups, and her telling me over and over that she would choose me over him any day and begging me to trust her, we decided to work it out.

That was 3 weeks ago, and while during the week everything feels fine and our relationship seems great, every weekend when she does things with other interns, I become incredibly jealous of her having these great experiences and memories with other people, including Bill. Stuff like going to themes parks, going to the Beach, having a house party, watching Orange is the New Black...all of these things make me upset. 

I know that a good boyfriend should be trusting and shouldn't try to be controlling because its her life and I dont have the right to try and influence it. Yet even though I have told her these things make me uncomfortable, she doesnt seem to slow down all her activities. This weekend she is going to a concert, and I am once again sitting in my room feeling like shit because of it. 

How do I get over these feelings of jealousy?








---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend and Intern push platonic boundaries, causing a rift in our relationship. I found out, now I cant help feeling jealous when she hangs out with other interns. I feel like a horrible boyfriend, how do I get over jealousy?"
2c4k1o,2,2014-07-30,[AMA]Asus UX32LN,Neralo,laptopama,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptopama/comments/2c4k1o/amaasus_ux32ln/,"Key specs

* Intel Core i5-4200u CPU @ 1.6GHz, ~2.3GHz
* DDR3L 1600 MHz SDRAM, OnBoard Memory 4 GB , 1x DIMM socket, 4GB DDR3L 1600Mhz SDRAM
* nVidia Geforce GT840M 2GB 
* 13.3"" 16:9 IPS FHD (1920x1080)
* 500GB SSH
* Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit 
* Other specs found [here](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/UX32LN/specifications/) 

Length of time owned

* Owned it about 2 Months, college student, but currently on internship, so it gets daily use. 

Build quality

* This thing is built incredibly well. Single block of aluminium (apparently) for the body. The hinge is medium firmness, easy one handed opening when placed on a table. No gaps anywhere, built very solidly. 

Performance &amp; cooling

* Performance is pretty good. Able to run Photoshop with spotify and about 10 tabs of Chrome open, though it will stutter a little when rendering or processing. 
* Game a little with it. So far I've only played 3 games with it, TF2, Sleeping Dogs and Ace Combat. TF2 and Ace Combat run at around 40-50fps on medium settings, Sleeping Dogs runs at 30-40FPS on medium settings, at 1080p. 
* Cooling wise, this thing struggles to run hot. The vents and fans do their job incredibly well. In addition, the parts of the laptop that do turn hot are far away from your hands. Only goes hot along the vent, which is along the screen.

Keyboard and touchpad

* Keyboard is quite well-built. Chiclet style, and each key is spaced out enough that there won't be any trouble hitting the wrong key. Not a lot of travel (it's pretty thin this laptop), but enough to give the user that you've hit the key. Also, it's backlit, so thats always a nice addition. 
* Touchpad is good. Not Macbook good, but Windows Good. Responsive, smooth. Really large touch area, with clearly marked left and right click segments. Not a lot of experience with it though, as I mostly use a portable mouse with this. 

Battery life

* Intel have really hit the jackpot with their Haswell chips. I can get about 7 hours of use, running Chrome (10-15 tabs), spotify playing  through the speakers, and running word documents, photoshop, excel sheets etc. 

Screen quality

* Hmm the screen. It's a matte screen, so outdoor viewing is pretty good. Goes pretty bright too. Asus has a built in adaptive display software which works really well, though it can be a tad sensitive (My cubicle is next to the window, and the screen will go dim if i stand up, or if a cloud covers the sun for even a second.) Colour wise, It has a slightly bluish tinge to whites at default, though can correct the colour using the inbuilt software. 
 
Sound quality

* This laptop has speakers that are tuned/engineered by Bang &amp; Olufsen. Specifically, they're ""Bang &amp; Olufsen ICE Power"". We all know this is just marketing jargon. No bass, tinny when you go to high volumes, but at normal volumes, they work. Not stellar, but passable. 

Specific nuances such as odd button placement etc

* The power button placement is weird. It's placed right above the backspace button, and to the right of the delete button. For the first week, I kept shutting down my laptop when I wanted to delete or backspace something. Once you get used to it, its a non-issue, but, c'mon, there shouldn't be any need to get used to it in the first place. Its a silly place to put a power button 

* The Charging Pin is in a very sturdy L shape. However, if you plug it in with the stem pointing towards you, it covers a USB port. Actually no, it covers 2 charging ports, the stem is so long. So i plug it in with the stem facing away from me so I have access to the USB ports. 

This is basically last years Asus Zenbook, with this years specs. I paid SGD1200 for this laptop, thats almost USD1000, and for what I paid, I'm pretty pleased with what I got. 

Go ahead, AMA "

I'm working away from home for the summer. During a fit of boredom one day (and after reading, ironically enough, the Tinder horror stories AskReddit thread), I downloaded Tinder. Eventually I matched with a pretty chill girl who I've been hanging out with a lot over the past week. Nothing super crazy - we went out on a few dates and came back to my place to chill. I have a roommate who doesn't go out much so we never have too much time to be alone together.

Tonight, though, I was at my apartment watching some Vsauce. I passed out on the couch and woke up around 3:30 AM. When I picked up my phone, I had two missed calls from this girl. So I said, ""fuck it, why not"" and called her back. She had been out with some friends that night and tells me how she had missed me and that she was horny. My natural instincts kick in, and without much convincing, I go to her place to pick her up. At this point it's close to 4 in the morning. We can't go back to my place since I share a room with my roommate, so it's the back of the car for us. I should mention at this point I'm parked directly across the street from her house. It's a pretty dark street, though, and easy to hide. We have a little fun together, I do my thing for 15 seconds, and then she gets ready to go. At this point I have my pants back on, but not my shirt, which has been used to clean up some... fluids. She opens the door to my car and, without any reason or warning, my fucking car alarm goes off at full blast. We look at each other like one of us had just stepped on a landmine. At this point I'm groping my keys for any sort of mechanism to unfuck this situation. Now it doesn't matter if the street was dark. The car had all of its lights on. We were both in plain view in the back of the car. She runs out, I run around to the driver side door, and then I see it. Her dad, standing menacingly in the now-open doorway. He's the kind of guy who doesn't take any shit, and runs a tight ship at his Chinese restaurant. And then here I am. No shoes. No shirt. Standing in front of my car with horn blaring every second, furiously mashing buttons and hitting things, trying to get it to stop.

The driver-side door opens. I get in, start the car, kill the alarm, and get the fuck out of there. Only the windows are impossible to see out of from the steam. And when I got in my car, the door didn't close all the way. So I'm half-naked, driving my car down a street with windows that are fogged up to the point of not being able to see out, on top of having all the lights in the car turned on. I almost run into a parked car on the side of the road. I turned the corner, and after the adrenaline wore off, I realized how fucking awkward I just made this poor girl's life. She had to walk out of my car, across the street to the front door where her father was waiting.

I guess I didn't really meet her parents with my shirt off. I did see her dad while I wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes, though.

It's 6:04 right now. I have work in 3 hours, but I feel so terrible for her that I can't sleep. I sent her a text apologizing, but holy shit I just made her life so much harder. Hopefully her parents wouldn't be able to tell that she had weed earlier that night.

**EDIT (10AM)** FUCK. SHE LEFT HER PHONE IN THR CAR. That's the only way I have to contact her. So I can either

1. Stop by her house, where her mom is, to drop it off

2. Stop by the restaurant she works at when she goes to work, which her dad owns

3. Hope she responds to Facebook messenger

4. Give up on life and join my friends on riding the rails

**OP DELIVERS (6PM)** I'm still alive. Her Asian father hasn't found me... yet.

I tried to meet up with her over lunch, but when I went over to her place, neither her nor her mom (fortunately) was home. In a way, that made things worse. It was impossible to focus when I got back to work. Her phone was dead by this point. My code wouldn't compile. Things were bad.

Fortunately, she found a way to send me a message through Tinder without her phone. Turns out she went to the lake with some friends today. She agreed to meet up with me at 4 to get coffee. So I went out and got flowers (bitches love flowers), drove up to her place, and picked her up. She felt just as awful about the whole thing as I did (the flowers probably helped). We were both exhausted, so the coffee was a nice pick-me-up. We made some casual conversation, and apparently she's been in more embarrassing situations than that, just not in front of her parents. Speaking of which, they haven't blown up on her... yet. Her mom did sent a pretty scathing text saying (among other things) that she pulled a ""whore move"", though.

So right now, I'm just playing everything by ear. I've only got one week left in town before my internship is over. This girl has been super chill about everything. She's a fucking boss."

What should I know?,Peppittto,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/2c4rdb/help_with_seo_internship_interview_what_should_i/,"Hi everyone, am kindof at my wit's end here. I know I've posted this on another subreddit btw but I'm just trying to get more opinions and tips. 

I have an SEO position internship interview on Friday with a big agency and was wondering how can I beat the competition? My main objective at the moment is to not look dumb and at least reasonably sound smart.
To be honest, I've not done much SEO stuff before and I kind of really want this position because I think that digital marketing is the way to go + this position will give me exposure to the industry..

So any tips anyone?

Edit: Forgot to add that I've already done as much reading as I can about SEO (beginner's guide from MOZ, Google and etc.) so I don't exactly not know anything but I'm just afraid it won't be enough :'("

2c558s,13,2014-07-30,My boyfriend [20/m] and I [22/f] have been having trouble with his mother turning his family against me.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2c558s/my_boyfriend_20m_and_i_22f_have_been_having/,"We met freshmen year in college and are heading into our senior year together. Last semester we moved in together and decided to stay in our apartment over the summer because: 1. we both have jobs up here (MN), 2. he is taking summer classes, and 3. both of our families moved out of state.

My boyfriend works as an intern at a local tv news station during the day and he also works a paid position at the station at night, then he also has classes on top of that.  He has been incredibly busy this summer but his mom blames his lack of visiting on me and has been telling his entire family that I am controlling.

His mother used to love me, she would tell me so all the time. I always thought I had a good relationship with his whole family. I love his siblings to death and would never dream of stopping him from seeing any of them. Her problem is that his dad works for Delta so he has free flights so in her mind there is no reason he couldn't visit if he was ""allowed"" to. 

He visited all the time when they still lived in Minnesota but they moved to Atlanta a few months back and making that trip with his schedule has become incredibly difficult. 

She called him yesterday and went on a huge tirade about how I had him on a leash and how us living together was a horrible idea (she was so supportive when we moved in). I have nothing to do with him not going home. 

One thing we did find out was that his mothers brother recently broke up with his fiancee because she wouldn't allow him to visit the rest of his family while he was on leave. We think that maybe she is projecting that relationship onto us and assuming I am doing the same thing. 

My boyfriends little brother has autism and his mother has asked me before if I would be willing to let him live with us someday if anything happened to her and I told her I love him so much I would definitely take him in. I have always made my love and respect for them very clear and having her tell the rest of the family that I am keeping my boyfriend from them hurts me so much. I don't know how to handle this situation. 



UPDATE: I tried messaging her on facebook since she won't take my calls. I told her how much her family means to me and how I would never keep them apart. She responded furiously telling me he is her son and she knows what is best for him and then ended by saying I'm lucky she is such a good person or she would tear me to shreds. 

Also: his dad messaged me on his own telling me to ignore her because she is crazy, which made me feel a lot better since she has been telling me everyone else hates me too. "

2c592p,0,2014-07-30,Did I choose the right company? Will I stagnate too much?,Greece_Lightningg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c592p/did_i_choose_the_right_company_will_i_stagnate/,"I am going to graduate by the end of this week and had a few offers to choose from, all of which were contract to hire (CTH) positions except for the offer from the company I interned with. I chose my the direct offer with my current company since they matched up to the highest offer I got, even if it was a CTH offer. I was a bit too busy with part-time internship and full class load to do the real full-time job search that I wanted, so these were my options.

This company is also a government contractor, so I may not further my tech skills too much, but I still will be learning a lot about about physics concepts. Plus, I get to stay where I currently live and finish the last 9 months of my lease, which I can't get out of early. The benefits package was also pretty nice. I just feel that I won't keep up with software advances too much at this position. Note, I will still be doing a lot of development work, but mostly with more c++.

One of the CTH offers was going to be pretty cool with some new technologies I haven't really work with too much, but I didn't like this place because of one of the upper managers who ticked me off during the interview and smaller desk space than what I'm used to. Plus I would lose money if I left my current situation for this offer, so I made the decision to stay put for a few months.

Did I make the right career decision choosing my current employer?

I do plan on leaving after 5-6 months, for reasons mentioned above.
That plus my 6 months of internship experience will put at just almost a year, so I figure that's a good time to hop ship and hopefully find a more software-related engineering position. My worry is if the more software-related companies will still take a look at me. 

Thus, does it seem very feasible for me to end up doing more software work after my current experience?

PS - I do have heavy c/c++, ruby, and java experience compared to most youngsters (those are my top languages), plus I a lot more languages that I've at least touched a few times. Not too mention that I have a lot of work experience with Qt and OpenGL, and some personal project experience with Android. 


Anyways, thanks guys. Really look forward to reading your replies. 

Best of luck,
Greece .... LIGHTNING! "
2c5bbg,0,2014-07-30,TIFU by opening my computer,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2c5bbg/tifu_by_opening_my_computer/,"So a little background story as I share my first TIFU; typically before I go to bed I lay down and watch something on Netflix, Dexter, breaking bad, lie to me, and a few other shows depending on what I have finished or not. Well my computer has this easy function where I can press a button and it sets (I have it set this way) to put my computer to sleep in X time, so that when I fall asleep my laptop wont run all night. 

I take my laptop to work daily, 1) for personal use, 2) its a hell of a lot faster then my work computer. Well when I open my computer up after it goes to sleep while playing something, it usually plays 3-10 seconds of what ever I was watching that was already buffered onto my computer before timing out on Netflix, not a problem. Well today for some unknown and god smiting reason, my volume was absurdly high. Right as I opened up my computer today, my direct boss calls my name and says ""hey 8Bit, can you do this for me?""

Now do not get my wrong, my boss's love me and the job I have is pretty sweet. Its relaxed and I can do what ever I want typically as long as I have results. I often will screw around with my boss and joke with them, but it is always blatantly obvious no disrespect is meant and she understands it, ladedah we all have fun.

Well today, in that blaze of glory moment when I open my computer simultaneously after she asked me to do what ever project it was, my computer sound comes on, extremely loud, and in a voice sounding rather similar to mine (pre-buffered into my computer from the night before), in a completely serious sounding tone, decides to make my day interesting and says ""absolutely fucking not.""

Now, I work for a Christian company, I do not swear around or to my bosses. So there she is, as she comes around the corner of my cubical, completely flabbergasted as I appeared to have not only stepped my boundaries by swearing at her, but it sounded completely genuine and joke free as well. I just spend the last few minutes explaining to my boss the situation, of which she began to laugh hysterically at the nearly impeccable timing to which #1, she asked me to do something, #2, I opened my computer precisely on time, and #3, that my computer had to stop in that exact moment of the episode I was watching. I got off with a please be more careful after much explaining. TIFU at my internship :(

Also, TIL the digital universe is out for me and I need to put my headphones in prior to opening my computer.

TL:DR: My computer essentially told my boss fuck you with a combination of incredibly timed events."

**Story #1:**

**[WP - A wife kills her husband. Make me sympathize with both characters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1nzes2/wp_a_wife_kills_her_husband_make_me_sympathize/)**

He was drunker than usual. Ordinarily, she would feel relief when he collapsed onto the couch by the TV. That meant he was too drunk to yell and fight. Tonight, she felt no relief. All she could do was watch him from the doorway, hoping he would drink the poisoned whiskey she had just poured him.

A lump sat in her throat as she watched his fat belly rise and fall with his labored breath. In his hand, he held the last drink she would ever pour for him. He sat there for a few minutes in silence without even looking at the glass of whiskey he clutched in his fat fingers. Then, without warning, he downed the entire glass in one movement.

He let the glass hit the ground and sighed. He would go to sleep soon. It wouldn’t be painful. Nowhere near as painful as the last twenty-three years had been for her. She wanted him to leave the world peacefully. She still loved him, after all. Still, she felt he deserved an explanation. At the very least, he deserved a good-bye.

She walked around to the front of the couch. He rolled his half-opened eyes in her direction and the two stared at each other in silence.

“There was more than whiskey in your drink,” she said, her voice shaking. “I’m sorry.”

“Your black eye is healing,” he said quietly. “You know I’m sorry about hurting you. Don’t you?”

She nodded.

“You were very beautiful once. I can still see it sometimes. When you smile. You don’t smile much these days. But when you do, your eyes flash like they did when we were teenagers. It reminds me of how young and beautiful we were. Young, beautiful, and carefree.”

“Your drink,” she said with tears forming in her eyes. “You’re dying. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”

“I know,” he whispered and slowly nodded. “I saw you pour it.”

She put her hands over her mouth and tried not to cry.

“Do you remember that field trip we took during our second year of high school?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“We spent the whole day together,” he said as his voice became fainter. “It was the first time I really met you. There were fifty or sixty of us there but I only cared about you. On the bus ride home, we sat next to each other. Do you remember now?”

She nodded.

“Everybody on the bus slept. They were so tired. But not us. We couldn’t stop talking to each other. We had so much to say back then. When you started to drift off to sleep, I was sad. But then you said something to me. Do you remember what it was?”

“I-” she paused to steady her voice. “I’m going to lean on you, ok?”

“Yeah,” he said as a smile slowly spread across his face. “And you fell asleep on my shoulder. I couldn’t sleep the whole bus ride because I was so happy that we were having that moment. And I know you didn’t sleep either. The bus bounced too much. And back then my arms were muscular. You just wanted to be close to me. I’m sorry I was such a lousy pillow. And I’m sorry I was an even lousier husband.”

She wanted to say something but could not.

His voice slowed even further. He spoke as if he was in a dream. “I still love you as much as I did on that bus ride. I just got worse at showing it. I’m sorry.”

She did not reply. She just stood and tried to compose herself. After a moment, she walked over and sat next to him on the couch.

“I’m going to lean on you, ok?” she whispered.

“Ok,” he replied as she rested her head against his arm.

The two sat in silence until his breathing stopped at last.

**Story #2:**

**[WP - Write a story that ends with the luckiest character dying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1okqst/wp_write_a_story_that_ends_with_the_luckiest/)**

His seventeenth birthday was coming soon. That meant it was almost the tenth anniversary of his first day in the mine. He was seven the first time he plunged into the darkness. The company needed small bodies that could crawl into tiny compartments and plant dynamite. The boy would do this for six years. Malfunctioning dynamite and tunnel collapses had taken most of his friends. But not him. They told him he was lucky.

On his thirteenth birthday, the boy was old enough to dig and run machinery. He would do this until he died. Many of the other workers his age were maimed or malformed from their years in the tunnels. But not him. They told him he was lucky.

The darkness followed him outside of the mineshaft. The blackness of the coal mine was permanently sunken into his clothes and skin. At night he would cough blackness out of his lungs. Black lung killed dozens every year. But not him. They told him he was lucky.

It was by chance that the boy remembered his approaching birthday. Alone in the shaft, driving his pick into the wall, lost in monotony, he happened upon the thought. At that same moment, he saw a sparkle in the ground. His lamp had given out and he was relying on natural light coming from the shaft exit just overhead. The boy leaned over and looked at the mysterious object. He had never seen a diamond before. All the same, he was hypnotized by its beauty in the blackness of the mine. He felt blessed to see such a beautiful object. Perhaps he was lucky after all.

The boy wrapped his fingers around the object and pulled it from the dirt. Suddenly, the floor gave out below him. No one had discovered the cavern underneath the tunnel. He didn't remember screaming as he plunged deeper into the blackness. The boy landed on his back and felt the wind leave his lungs. He was so far from the light. He knew he would die. But he did not despair. As he lay on his back, staring at the small light above him, all he could do was laugh. He never had to return to the mine again. He was finally free. For the first time in his life, the boy felt lucky.

**Story #3:**

**[EU - Bruce Wayne discovers he was actually adopted and his biological parents are still alive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2afkkh/eu_bruce_wayne_discovers_he_was_actually_adopted/)**

""Are you ready, Sir?"" Alfred asked.

""Of course,"" Batman replied.

""You're awfully calm about this,"" Robin said. ""If I found out my parents were still alive that would change everything.""

""You think something so petty would stand in the way of this?"" Batman said, gesturing to the Batcave all around them. ""Do you think anything that happens to Bruce Wayne could stand in the way of the Batman's mission?""

""I do, actually,"" Robin said. ""You took up the cowl because your parents died. The fact that they're still alive....""

""I didn't create Batman so I could pursue revenge. I created Batman so I could pursue justice. Gotham is a cesspool where criminal scum can thrive and good people are drowned. If the mission of the Batman was revenge, I would have hung up the cowl after putting Thomas and Martha Wayne's murderer through a painful, excruciating death. Instead, I do not use guns. I do not murder. I show this city compassion, so that one day it can understand justice. Thomas and Martha Wayne were victims in a war that I will fight every day of my life. It doesn't matter whose parents they were. Or whose parents they weren't. Alfred. I'm ready to hear their names.""

""Your family's last name is Kerr,"" Alfred said after a pause.

Batman remained silent, unfazed by the information.

""Your father's name was Joseph and your mother's name was-""

Batman stormed away, his cape billowing as he walked towards the Batmobile.

""Where the hell are you doing?"" Robin yelled as Batman leapt into his vehicle and drove from the Batcave.

""Where's he going?"" Robin asked Alfred.

""Arkham Asylum, I'd wager,"" Alfred said in a distant voice.

""Why?""

""What do you suppose the odds are,"" Alfred asked, ""that Joseph Kerr goes by the name, 'Joe.'""

**Part 2**

""Doesn't it all make sense, bats? That's what they all say about us, isn't it? Two sides of the same coin. I remember the first time I heard somebody say that. It was that first bank robbery of mine that you stopped. I was just being put in a police van when I heard that darling Vicki Vale describe us that way. 'Two sides of the same coin,' I thought. What a novel idea!

""Then I started to realize just how much we have in common. So I did a teeny bit of investigating. You'd be surprised how much evidence leads back to Wayne manor. You see, bats, there was always something familiar about you. Something in your eyes.

""You might not believe this, but I had my suspicions from the moment we met. The first time you punched me in the face, in fact! HAHA! That fist felt so familiar. Just the type of punch your mother would throw at me when I came home drunk. Believe me, a right hook like that would scare any man off the sauce. Oh, how I miss her. She was the light of my life.

""But I know what you're thinking and the answer is no. Her death isn't what made me... well... me! HAHA! No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't the death of your older brother. It wasn't the fact that the wealthiest couple in Gotham ran over my wife with a car that cost more than my house. It was what happened to my youngest child. My last, surviving kin. My youngest pup. My baby boy! How? How could the state take him away? And what kind of world would allow my boy to be adopted by the very couple who ran over his biological mother?! It certainly is a loopy world we live in, bats. But that's enough to drive any man... insane. HAHAHAHA!!!

""So, come here, bats! Give daddy a hug!!!!""

**Story #4:**

**[EU - It's open mic night at the Laugh Factory in King's Landing. Which Game of Thrones characters perform the best before a rowdy crowd?](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/24ko0i/eu_its_open_mic_night_at_the_laugh_factory_in/)**

*(This story contains spoilers through season 3. I don't think this subreddit offers spoiler tags so proceed with caution!)*

The audience applauded wildly as Hodor left the stage. The open mic host, still laughing hysterically, wiped a tear from his eye and stepped up to the microphone.

“Alright, folks. Let’s keep it going for my boy, Hodor.”

Tyrion, seated in the audience, sighed and shook his head. “I do not envy the man who has to follow that performance,” he said as he looked through his notes.

“Up next, we got another performer from up North. Please give a warm, King’s Landing welcome to Jon Snow!”

Jon Snow took the stage and accepted the microphone.

“Good evening, King’s Landing,” the bastard said, nervously clearing his throat. “It’s good to be here. It’s funny, actually, since I’m from the North, this is... uh... this is the farthest south I’ve ever been. We Northerners hate going south. I mean, I don’t even go south on my girlfriend.”

Jon Snow awkwardly paced across the stage, waiting for laughter. 

When the crowd responded with silence, the bastard began to mutter, “But I have, of course. Not that I have been to King’s Landing before. I’ve just gone south on my... anyway.... it is nice to be here. King’s Landing is a great place to live.... if you’re a cockroach.”

“Sorry,” Snow nervously chuckled to himself before the silent audience. 

“I know that joke was a little old, but-”

“You know nuthin, Jon Snow!” a heckler yelled from the audience.

“Oh, god,” Snow whispered as he recognized the redheaded woman in the crowd. “How about those Wildlings eh? Maybe those of you in the South don’t know them that well, but-”

“Get off the stage!” the woman yelled again.

“Ok, I’ve got a joke just for you, Ygritte,” Snow said, angry that the audience was starting to laugh at her interruptions. “How many Wildlings does it take to screw in a lightbulb?”

“One Wildling to screw it in,” she replied without hesitation, “and one bastard from the Night’s Watch to put a wall around it and pretend the lightbulb was their's all along!”

The audience burst into laughter for the first time since Snow had taken the stage.

“Alright, s-s-so,” Jon Snow said, desperately trying to remember his material.

“Now, I’ve got a joke for you, Jon Snow!” the heckler yelled out. “Bran Stark walks into a bar!”

“OOOOHHHHHHH!!!!” the audience roared with laughter.

Jon Snow stormed off the stage with his eyes on the ground. The open mic host jumped up onto the stage.

“Wow!” he said as the audience died down. “Things are getting a little heated this evening. Speaking of heated, our next comedian is the Mother of Dragons. Put your hands together for Daenerys of house Targaryen!”

Tyrion left his seat and went to the bathroom. As he reached the men’s room, he heard Daenerys’ opening joke.

“Greetings, King’s Landing! I just flew in from across the Narrow Sea and boy, are my dragons’s arms tired!”

Tyrion cringed when he heard Ser Jorah Mormont laugh hysterically at the nonsensical joke. The Lannister entered the bathroom and was relieved to find that the shortest urinal was unoccupied. As he reached the urinal, he noticed his brother, Jaime, next to him, struggling to undo his fly with his golden hand.

“Hello, brother,” Jaime said. “Why so glum?”

“I’m starting to regret signing up for this comedy business,” Tyrion replied. “The audience is even less friendly than what I’m used to.”

“What are you worried about? This is a contest for amateurs. You heard how miserably things went for Jon Snow. It doesn’t sound like things are going much better for the Targaryen girl in there.”

Tyrion strained his ears and could just make out a heckler shouting, 

“Show us your tits, love!”

“Dracarys!” Daenerys ordered, and the two Lannister men heard a burst of flame come from the stage.

“Well,” Tyrion said, leaving the urinal. “I’m up next.”

“Good luck, Tyrion. And, before you go,” Jaime turned around to show that his zipper was stuck. “Do you think you could give me a hand with this?”

Tyrion shook his head. “I think you have another sibling who you’d prefer for that job.”

“You’d better not use that joke,” Jaime said as Tyrion left the bathroom.

“Well, that was unexpected!” the host said. Smoke rose from one of the chairs in the audience. A pair of waiters surrounded the pile of ash, spraying it with fire extinguishers.

“The next guy taking the stage is a native of King’s Landing. You’ve probably heard of him before, but this is his first time trying standup comedy. Tyrion Lannister, ladies and gentlemen! Show him some love!”

Tyrion hopped onto the stage and lowered the mic stand down to his level.

“Thank you,” he said once he could reach the microphone. “Thank you very much for the ‘love,’ as our gracious host described it. As a Lannister, it is a new concept to me. As a family, we don’t give each other much love. Unless, of course, you believe the rumors that Jaime and Cersei have been exchanging love for years.”

Tyrion grinned when he heard a few chuckles in the audience.

“I shouldn’t be too hard on my family, though. ""I remember when they sent their regards at the Red Wedding. My father probably thought he was doing me a great favor by killing off Catelyn Stark. Unfortunately for me, half of the material I had prepared for this show were mother-in-law jokes. I had to rewrite everything,” he said, speaking over laughter from the Lannister table.""

“But I’ll be careful about what I say around the Starks. We all know how they tend to lose their heads. Especially here in King’s Landing.""

“The North remembers!” Jon Snow yelled from the audience.

“See? I’ve offended a Stark already. Oh wait, it’s just Jon Snow.”

The audience erupted in laughter.

“Alright, alright,” Tyrion said, calming the audience. “We all saw his performance... that poor bastard has been through enough... I mean that poor soul, sorry.” Jon Snow pouted at his table as the crowd roared and Tyrion continued, “I swear, that was an accident.

“But that’s enough. Who else do we have in the audience today? Ah, I see we have the King in the North. The King of the Iron Islands is here. And, oh, Ser Jorah! I didn’t see that the King in the Friendzone was here.”

After a few seconds of laughter from the audience, a young man yelled from the front row, “Don’t forget about the King on the Iron Throne!”

“Oh, your grace,” Tyrion said to Joffrey, “Nobody could forget about you. Are you enjoying yourself this evening?”

“I am enjoying the company of my lovely bride-to-be,” Joffrey replied, holding Margaery Tyrell’s hand. “Are you enjoying the company of that Stark bitch you inherited from me?”

Joffrey looked around, curious why nobody was laughing at his joke.

“I am enjoying her company very much, your grace,” Tyrion replied without showing a shade of emotion. “I was actually wondering when you’d start to ‘enjoy the company’ of your own wife. Rumor has it that winter is the only thing that has been ‘coming’ in your bedroom, if you understand my meaning.”

“Ah, very good,” Joffrey sneered, angry at the reaction Tyrion got from the audience. “The black sheep of the family has found comedy as a way to hide his shame.”

“I certainly am the black sheep of the family. In fact, the more time I spend with you people, the more I begin to think that I’m the only one who wasn’t born from incest.”

“Pathetic!” Joffrey yelled over the laughing audience. “Just a pathetic fool born with an incurable disease!”

“Don’t worry, Joffrey,” Tyrion said with a grin. “Maybe some day they’ll invent a cure for being a cunt.”

The laughter of the audience was so deafening that nobody could hear Bronn yelling from the back of the room, “That little shit stole my joke!”

“Thank you ladies and gentlemen,” Tyrion said. “But I believe I’m out of time.”

“Tyrion Lannister, ladies and gentlemen!” the open mic host said, applauding as he retook the stage. “That was great. Up next, we have the comedy stylings of Stannis Barathean!""

**Story #5:**

**[WP - One angel is responsible for screening which prayers get to God. World Cup season is a nightmare because he has to filter out every sports-related prayer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2abwg1/wp_one_angel_is_responsible_for_screening_which/)**

“Just got a fresh shipment in from Houston!” St Leo called out from the assembly line.

“The Houston shipment is in, already?!” St Dymphna complained, pounding her cluttered desk with her fist.

St. Christopher walked into her office to see her frantically clearing her desk and muttering in her Irish accent. He carried a cardboard box full of golden paper. The word “DALLAS” was printed on the side in flowing, cursive letters.

“Ok, Chris,” Dymphna sighed. “Just bring it over, I’ll make a dent in that one now.”

“Hey, have you heard anything from the guy upstairs?” Christopher asked, stepping around the boxes labeled “BUDAPEST” and “TORONTO.” “He’s been promising to send us a patron saint of interns for almost half a century.”

“Look, Chris,” Dymphna said as she picked up a stack of golden paper. “If He says He’s gonna canonize an intern, He’ll do it. As you can imagine, He’s got a lot on his plate at the moment.”

“Yeah, you’re right,” Christopher said, running his hand through his long, golden hair. “It just feels like I haven’t been surfing in centuries.”
Dymphna rolled her eyes at the patron saint of travelers, surfers, athletes, drivers, and pilots as she lit a cigarette.

“Cry me a river, Chris. I haven’t had a break since the guy working the assembly line was Pope.”

“Leo was Pope?” Christopher asked in astonishment.

“Yeah, Leo met Atilla the Hun during his time on Earth.”

“Who?”

“Atilla might’ve been before your time. Satan just gave him a big promotion, actually. If you ever find yourself ferrying a batch of souls down there, you’ll probably meet him.”

Dymphna lit up a cigarette.

“You smoking again?”

“For crying out loud,” Dymphna sighed. “No shortage of judgment around here. Would you get back to work?”

Christopher left her office, and Dymphna picked up a stack of prayers. The patron saint of mental disorders caught a look at her reflection in the golden paper and cringed. There had been a time when she believed that angels couldn’t show signs of aging. The wrinkles around her eyes and thinning hair shattered that myth. She ran her hand through what had once been a beautiful set of curly, black hair and got back to work.
“Alright,” she muttered to herself as she stacked the golden paper into different piles on her desk. “Lymphoma, Heart Attack, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Lottery, General Good Luck, Heart Attack, Lung Cancer, Heart Attack.” She paused on one appeal to the Almighty that asked for a new job. “Amen, brother,” she said as she placed the prayer in the “High Priority” pile. “Ok... Heart Attack, Heart Attack, Testicular Cancer, Heart Attack.... what’s with all the heart attacks? Did they bring back the McRib? Whatever. Breast Cancer, Kidney Stones, Lottery, Heart Attack, Lottery... wait. What?”

She held up one prayer and studied it more closely.

“This idiot in Texas is praying for the Americans to win the World Cup. Does he not know that they were eliminated a week ago? Damn Americans. Heart Attack, Colon Cancer... wait. Dallas Cowboys?”

Dymphna sifted through the stack of papers from Dallas and noticed several prayers for a successful Cowboys season.

“Jesus Christ!” Dymphna yelled in exasperation.

“Yeah?” The Son of God asked, leaning his head into her office and taking out one of his headphones.

“Did you process out all of the sports-related prayers like I asked?”

“Oh,” Jesus said, tightening his neck and inhaling through his teeth. “I forgot about that. Sorry, boss. Do you want me to-”

“It’s fine!” she said, throwing her hands in the air. “Just get back to whatever you were doing. How’d we get stuck with the boss’s kid?” she muttered to herself after Jesus left. “Well, that explains the size of the Buenos Aires box,” she said, lighting up another cigarette.

“Bad news, Dymphna!” Leo called from the assembly line.

“Oh, good,” she sighed. “What now?”

“There was an earthquake!”

“Oh, no.” She leaned back in her chair and covered her face with her hands. “Please let it be in Japan. Or Bangladesh. Please, nowhere Catholic.”

“It was in Mexico.”

“Dammit! This on top of the famine in Haiti!”

“And the Big Guy is reporting a landslide in Peru.”

Dymphna moaned. “I’m never going to get out of this office!”

Suddenly, Dymphna became aware of a heavenly presence in her office.

“Hey, boss!” she said, forcing a smile onto her face. “Wasn’t expecting to see you here.”

“Just swinging by the office,” the Creator of Heaven and Earth said as He pushed aside a few papers on Dymphna’s couch. The omnipotent deity sat down on the couch and stretched His heavenly knees. “Pretty busy these days,” He observed.

“Hardly feels busy when you’re doing something you love,” Dymphna said, keeping eye contact with her boss while she deleted a couple tabs on her computer. She almost said a prayer that her boss wouldn’t notice the tabs labeled “Reddit” and “Monster.com” but realized the irony at the last second. “We are doing the Lord’s work, after all,” she chuckled.

“I wanted to ask how Jesus was getting along,” the being that transcended time and space asked. “I know he just got laid off at the Pearly Gates for smoking weed on the job and I just wanted to make sure that-”

“He’s doing great!” Dymphna lied. “We’re happy to have him.”

“Glad to hear it,” the omniscient creator said, rising to his feet. “I’ll let you get back to work. Oh, and before I forget, St Peter wanted you to prioritize the prayers for the dead in the earthquake. He’s got a fresh batch of souls at the Pearly Gates and if he doesn’t get those prayers processed soon, he’ll have to start turning the lesser souls away.”

“Wouldn’t want that!” Dymphna said with a forced grin.

“One more thing,” the Lord said. “If I catch you on Reddit during work hours again, you’ll be asking Satan for a job.”

“Uh... it won’t happen again. Sorry, boss.""

The Creator left the room. St Christopher walked into the room a second later with a box labeled, “FRANKFURT.”

“He can be a dick sometimes,” Christopher said.

“Yeah. I think he’s bipolar or something. Anyway, bring that box over here.”

“It’s funny,” Christopher said, dropping the box at Dymphna’s desk. “I thought we WERE allowed to process prayers for sports teams.”

“Yeah, but we can only process a few. I’m going to knock out a few Frankfurt prayers before I get to work on Mexico City for that prima donna, St Peter.”

Before he walked out of the room, Christopher noticed that Dymphna wore a jersey under her white robes.

“Hey,” he asked. “Are those Germany’s colors you’ve-”

“Don’t you have work to do?” she demanded.

St Christopher shrugged his shoulders and left her office.

2c5dbe,5,2014-07-30,I [20 M] met a girl [19 F] on the train this morning. What should be my next step?,wfco223,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2c5dbe/i_20_m_met_a_girl_19_f_on_the_train_this_morning/,"I'm an intern in Washington D.C. and go to school at the University of Kentucky. This morning on the metro a girl asked me about a notebook from my school. It turns out that she was from Kentucky as well. We talked for the 30 minute commute, and we seem to be interested in a lot of the same things.  

I will be leaving to go home next Friday and want to follow up with her to see if she is interested in meeting up before then. I'm looking for advice about how to best do that. Should I try to meet her on the metro again or add her on Facebook? Something else? If Facebook is the way, how soon should I try to get in touch.  

I don't have unrealistic expectations or anything just because she talked with me, but if there is mutual interest, I don't want to pass up the opportunity. I also don't want to seem creepy and turn her off because of an avoidable mistake.  

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to reading everyone's advice.

tl;dr: met a girl on a train, want to know how best to follow up.  

Edit Update: I messaged her but haven't gotten a response yet. Oh well.

:--|:--
[Thanks for AMA straight off buddy :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgewm?context=5)|Mostly for my family. My schedule is fantastic and if I took promotions I would lose that.  Another reason is because we aren't hurting for money. I have made way more money and been miserable. I make about 1/5 of what I used to make and I am sooo much happier.
[Are you less than full-time now or still putting in a less-stressful 40?  Edit:   *I work every weekend from 7-4 and I'm off during the week.*  So you went from a demanding 50 to 18 hours a week, no wonder you are digging it. Good on you for making it happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbmn8v?context=5)|Thanks! I didn't do much except pull the trigger and do it. I'm fortunate to have a very supportive fiancé that allows this to happen. The goal is to work on her career, and put hers first, and maybe in the future I'll reevaluate my options.
[Why???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgg95?context=5)|A few reasons actually...
 |I got tired of working in an office and freelancing from home just didn't seem to suit me.
 |I'm engaged to a wonderful woman with two great kids. My schedule is very flexible - to the point where I can almost come and go as I choose!
 |I did have a great paying job that was semi IT related for awhile but the company closed down. Being laid off was a shitty feeling. I enjoy my job security now.
[Thanks, guess if I could do the same I would however once u have responsibility and that income is the main source u can't change.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgzic?context=5)|Exactly. My income isn't our primary source. My fiancé is a night shift hospice nurse and is the real provider.
 |I honestly feel fortunate to have the luxury to do I enjoy doing and the family not suffer because of it.
[That's pretty cool. I could imagine it isn't terrible working there when it isn't a ""sentence"". I'm sure it also helps if you're a good employee and your managers know if they piss you off you can just take off and not have to deal with any bullshit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbmnnw?context=5)|That is a bonus, yes. I'm not cocky, and when I go in I bust my ass and feel good about what I accomplished when I clock out. But if something were to happen I do know I have other options. They need me more than I need them. It feels good.
[What is the cost of living in your neck of the woods? Happiness is most important; IMHO this doesn't seem viable long term , in terms of aiming for owning a house, college fund for kids, retirement. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbkuyk?context=5)|It's not bad. If you're single you can probably live off of $25-30k/year pretty comfortably. For a family maybe $50-60k, preferably $70k+.
 |We are renting currently. Nice 3 bedroom, 2 bath house. Medium sized yard, newish cars and we can't just up and go to the Caribbean on a whim, but we do ok.
 |This is not a permanent plan. Once the kids are older I will either go back to school (considering paramedic) or turn Walmart into a career since upper management can make $40k+ a year pretty easily.
[How are the hours?  Do they make you work crappy shifts?   Garden center seems like a cool gig.  Work with plants, talk about like flowers and stuff.  MILFs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbh16x?context=5)|My hours are great. I work every weekend from 7-4 and I'm off during the week. On the weeks we have the boys (they go to their dad's house every other week) I stay home mon-fri. On the weeks we don't have them I just go in whenever and leave whenever.
 |Garden center is cool. I love being outside and I'm a fan of manual labor. I really don't deal with plants much surprisingly aside from the rare occasion I water them. Usually someone else does.
[I've worked outside garden center for Home Depot and Lowe's. I loved it. Then got transferred to inside garden at Lowe's. I liked it even more. Garden Department is best department. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbjrl1?context=5)|It really is, man.
 |While I was in college I worked outside garden for Lowe's also. There is just something about it that makes it so un-like a typical retail job.
[No wonder you like it. You are only working 16 hours per week. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjc4fd9?context=5)|Every other.
[Does your spouse still provide a significant amount of income/work full time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbifw9?context=5)|Yes, she does. She is a hospice nurse and her job isn't just important for the income, but one of the most important jobs I can imagine.
[No offense but if you really wanted to help this girl and her kids, your best course of action would be to provide for them. Not play video games and work at Wal Mart on the weekends. You have to think that every bit of money she spends on you, she should be spending on her kids future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbpg8p?context=5)|Again, that's not the case. I don't expect you to know the conversations we have over it, because obviously you don't. There is a plan here and often I hint around at doing something more and it gets shot down.
 |Also we include them in this, especially the eldest. We value their opinion as well.
 |EDIT: I work nearly 40 hours every other week (when they aren't here).
[How would i go about getting into IT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbivdq?context=5)|Most colleges have a career services department. Also, I've found a lot of cities have an IT professionals group where people can network and get their name out there.
 |Aside from that, simply submitting applications or going through a staffing agency works just as well. It's a growing career that's flooded with new professionals, but there is always work to be found.
[Should I get a degree in IT? I'm about to go back to school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbkwj4?context=5)|Absolutely. Let me reiterate, the tech industry is not bad at all, though I do think if you can freelance by all means do. But it simply wasn't for me. I loved designing Web pages and learning how to program as a teenager and even throughout college, but once I hit the real world I didn't mesh well with the industry.
[As a college student looking into IT, is it always being a desk jockey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbibtb?context=5)|Not always. I had an internship while I was in college and I got to run cable, walk from one side of a campus to the other fixing professor's laptops and desktops. I really enjoyed that.
 |Networking probably would have been a better career choice than design and programming for me.
[What do your fiancee and your parents think of it? Mostly i just thought you'd enjoy this cartoon :\) Link to zenpencils.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbjfok?context=5)|Love the cartoon. I consider instilling some kind of morality, respect and good decision making into my future step kids a real job. My generation and those older than I are in a bad spot. It's up to today's youth to fix our wrongs.
 |My fiancé is supportive. The day she asks me to do something more is the day I do just that.
[In college thinking about an iT job. Should I reconsider?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgri1?context=5)|Ha! No, it's not that bad. It's really about finding what works for you. My change of careers wasn't because I disliked IT, but because I didn't enjoy it anymore.
[What do you miss the most about working in IT? What overshadows your regrets from IT while working at your current job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbnv7r?context=5)|Seeing a finished product through from beginning to end. It's nice to visit some old sites I worked on 5 years ago and see they are still using my design and features.
[Are you happier now?  Why did you change jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbggbl?context=5)|I am much happier. I don't mind going to work each day, and my management team give me a lot of space and freedom.
[Why not just make apps? Be an android dev from home. Make is big and live high off the hog.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbp7e2?context=5)|My programming knowledge is limited to C#, some java and VB. I would have to learn a new skill set. That's not entirely out of the question however.
[I am in IT right now.  Does it get that bad that i'll end up working at Walmart too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgfln?context=5)|Lol nah. It was bad for ME because I felt restless and what I enjoyed doing as a hobby wasn't quite as enjoyable working for someone else.
[I was the same way, started my own IT company and never looked back. Of course your always working for someone else, but now I can pick who I work for instead of the other way around...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgqxa?context=5)|I honestly considered that and even did some small projects for a friend remotely,  but I simply no longer enjoyed it.
[If work makes you happy, you will never work a day in your life...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbipnh?context=5)|Precisely.
[Do you remember the moment you were still in IT and thought ""fuck this""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbhvdl?context=5)|Yep. The day I arrived at work and couldn't sign into my computer (forgotten password). Then a wave of anxiety hit me. I was done.
[How do you compare the managers you had at IT to the ones you have now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbksx5?context=5)|I will go with IT for this one. The company I worked for was a small family owned business and the owner was a great guy.
[Are you going to be laid off in the winter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbowyg?context=5)|I'm not a temp. I've been there a couple of years now, and Christmas is our busiest season anyway!
[How did you manage to convince them to pay you above minimum wage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbha4j?context=5)|I didn't. I started off at minimum wage like everyone else. I've just had a couple of yearly increases since.
[Why is it that so many foreigners work in IT? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbhm37?context=5)|Cheaper. And they do the call - center type jobs a lot of Americans don't want to do.
[Have you posted or ever considered posting in r/Talesfromretail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbkddi?context=5)|I have not. I will check it out. I do spend a lot of time browsing the r/walmart sub.
[Chuck?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbhdg1?context=5)|E Cheese?
[Do you have a garden at your home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbkzs5?context=5)|Lol, I do not - yet.
[Does Walmart consider gardening supplies to be groceries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbn43l?context=5)|No.
[How long have you been at Walmart?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbh42r?context=5)|Two years.

Now I've found out I need to get my tonsils removed ASAP and the only time I can get them out before school starts (can't do I during school I need to preform well in class) is at the start of the last week of my internship (there are 2 weeks left) since the doctor is going on vacation meaning I'd have to miss the last week most likely due to recovery. 

How do I bring this up with my boss? Is it even ok to ask for the last week off? (Hopefully won't need the whole week but I've heard tonsillectomies can be brutal).

Will every company have their own booth/area and you just walk up to them, ask questions and apply?  
How would you approach to them?  
Do the interviews only consist of behavioral and technical?  If offered, will I have to negotiate pay and benefits at the spot?

I wake up this morning with 4 hours of sleep; I'm a little cranky, but I'm a grown man so I can just suck it up and get on with my day. Or, like the fuckstick I am, I could fall back asleep for 20 minutes by accident.

Now in a frenzy, I flop my lifeless body down the stairs and get a bowl of cereal, only to be greeted with rotten milk. Tired, hungry, and late, I leave for work.

I get on the train and once I finally get off, my bus has already left. 1.5 mile walk in dress clothes / 85 degree weather. Woohoo! 

I make it to work a bit early by some miracle. So, I stop at Dunkin Donuts and order a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. Once I left and opened the bag, I discovered that they had actually given me two sandwiches. I said to myself ""Wow, today's going to be a good day!"" It was this exact moment when I set my expectations too high. I happily ate both, but my stomach decided to initiate a gastrointestinal World War III on them instead. First half hour of work spent in the bathroom.

Now, I work as an intern programmer. Sometimes, I might not be precise enough, or I ask stupid questions, or I seem like I'm not ""trying"" when really I am, and am just trying to learn. I posted a question to StackOverflow and was torn to pieces because the community is 98% pretentious assholes (probably not actually, but that's how I feel now -_-). They basically say I'm dumb, not putting in any effort, and don't follow proper StackOverflow etiquette. 

Frustrated I message my friend and describe this situation. I don't even care if I'm wrong. I probably am. But all I wanted was to hear someone sympathize and call them assholes with me. Instead he says I'm dumb, not putting in any effort, and don't follow proper StackOverflow etiquette.

Also a hot girl unmatched me on Tinder and I forgot to put mustard on my sandwich. Fuck.

I can't wait to channel this frustration into a good pump at the gym later.

Thanks for listening :P"

So I have just been offered a job to redesign and build a website. The only problem is I have never done any sort of Web development before. I am a computer science student and have some decent experience programming in Java, I have also been learning some HTML and CSS in my free time though codeacademy. 

I would have a one month time frame to build the site for a band, and the requirements are:

* Wordpress CMS
* Secure
* Responsive, mobile friendly
* Outstanding calendar/schedule feature
* LOTs of pictures
* integrated, visually appealing audio player
* Integration with social media
* FB feed on website
* Contact form
* Shopping cart
* Google analytics
* SEO optimization

The reason I want to do this is for some money and to have something to put on my resumé for when I apply to internships this fall. 

So do you guys think something like this is feasible in one month for someone who has never done any sort of Web development before, but does have some programming experience and is welcome to a challenge?

Thanks for any input you have.

Edit: the website does already exist, I didn't make that clear in the original post."
2c5rbb,1,2014-07-30,Employee Surveys: Benefits Beyond the Books,lee_m,SmallBusinessAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessAdvice/comments/2c5rbb/employee_surveys_benefits_beyond_the_books/,"Imagine yourself: a hardworking, diligent employee who commits half your waking hours to your career. What you do at work says a great deal about you: are you punctual? Passionate?  A perfectionist? Perhaps you work best under pressure or prefer unstructured time. Maybe you are a morning person or someone who doesn’t leave the office until sunset. What, is it dinnertime already? As American management author Peter Drucker once said, “the most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said.” Unfortunately, the boss isn’t watching you from his corner office all day; after all, he has important business to attend to, such as that upcoming golf tournament or his two-hour lunch break. In this case, the most important thing in employee-employer communication is not to hear what isn’t said but rather to read it—from an employee survey.


The success of any organization begins with its members, the individuals who act as the gears of the machine. Each person plays an important role that, if well coordinated, can create a productive and positive work environment. Employees each come with their own sets of goals and desires. They are, after all, real people and not simply gears or robots. Consequently, the needs of the company do not always align with the needs of its workers. This is where employee surveys come in; as fast, economical measures of employee satisfaction, they offer an effective measure of the work environment. If carefully considered, they can be used to produce positive employee relations, find areas of inefficiency, and evaluate hiring processes.


The benefits of employee surveys stem from their removal of communication barriers between employees and employers. Where there is a power differential, such as between a worker and the management, communication can be stunted by the employee’s reluctance to offend his or her manager or supervisor. The distribution of employee surveys acts as an invitation to speak up; it tells employees that their opinions are worth hearing and that, by extension, they are valued as members of the organization. This bilateral communication builds employee-employer relations, whereas traditional top-down management can be stifling and make employees feel unappreciated or dispensable. In essence, employee surveys open a new line of communication, thus strengthening the relationships between employers and employees and between different levels and operations and management.


Since each employee has a unique experience within the organization, their input is valuable in the sense that it collectively covers every aspect of the company’s functioning. Even the most competent management will have some degree of oversight; it is simply impossible to monitor all processes closely, particularly when a long chain of command is involved. Thus, the many perspectives of the employees can be leveraged to find areas of inefficiency or shortfall. This is especially easy with the use of survey applications that provide analytical tools, such as those offered at www.GrapeVineSurveys.com. These tools allow for the effective collection and analyses of employee responses, meaning employers can keep track of employee opinions—without having to hire another intern to do it. Paying attention to employee input is especially useful when working with an interdisciplinary team; problems that may be obvious to people in one field of expertise may not be immediately apparent to others, including the employers. In this sense, employee surveys can help facilitate the improvement of a company’s operations by gathering the thoughts and opinions of a varied group of people into a simple, easy-to-use platform.


Besides improving employee relations and identifying areas of inefficiency, employee surveys can be used to assess the effectiveness of a company’s hiring practices. Incoming employees can be surveyed on their goals and intentions; do they line up with the objectives of the organization? Can they be leveraged into higher productivity? When a company and an employee share the same goals and desires, the employee is motivated by more than just a paycheck; his or her work becomes a passion from which the willingness to take initiative and to be proactive stem. Both employee and employer benefit in this scenario; the employee gains meaningful work and the organization gains a vested, productive member. Outgoing employees can be surveyed on their satisfaction; did they feel challenged and motivated? Did they feel appreciated and successful? The answers to these questions are metrics of his or her suitability to his to her former position and can be used to adjust talent acquisition accordingly.


The variability of individuals is what allows for the creation of exciting and dynamic teams, projects, and organizations. The use of employee surveys allows for these differences to be leveraged to improve employee relations, find areas of inefficiency, and assess employee satisfaction. Each employee provides something different to the company, whether it is a unique perspective or terrible potato salad at the office potluck. Why not use these differences to your advantage?

2c5u01,86,2014-07-30,Petty revenge for a petty act,qwicksilfer,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/2c5u01/petty_revenge_for_a_petty_act/,"I'm not sure if this is petty or just cringe-worthy, but I have to share this with someone. My boyfriend is so sick of hearing about this I can't subject him to any more of this...but man, I feel like I'm in some kind of awkward version of Candid Camera.

I'm a (30 year old :/) graduate student interning for the summer and am renting a room from someone for 10 weeks. The woman - we'll call her Sally - I'm renting from is divorced and lives alone. I chose to live with her because as I'm...older than most of my fellow interns, I wanted someone more ""mature"" to live with. Boy how that backfired. We started out getting along great. She's got similar interests as I do (hiking, gardening, dogs, wine) so we hang out quite a bit and do lots of events together. I'm having a blast, loving my internship and Sally is making me feel less lonely as I'm halfway across the country from home.

Well last Thursday, we were supposed to go to a festival but the day before I started to come down with a bug and felt crappy, missing a day of work. I told Sally I didn't feel up for the festival. She said that was fine and she ended up going anyway. It's a three day event and there was one more night of activities on Friday. I told her I would let her know how I felt (she really wanted me to go) but Friday at lunch I called her and told her I still wasn't quite feeling ok.

She said ""fine"" and hung up on me. 

Now, I know, women - yes I am one, yes I do this - use the word ""fine"" and they mean anything but fine...without telling you why they are mad. I come home that night and she's slamming doors and yelling at her dog. She refuses to talk to me. Honestly. I came home and said hi, she turns around and leaves the room. I should probably mention...Sally is in her early 50s. She's not some crazy 20-something or intense 30-something. She's supposed to be, I don't know, mature.

I don't think much of it though, assuming she's PMSing or had a bad day at work. I just go out to get dinner and eventually return home. Sally is upstairs in her room (my room is downstairs). She comes by around 7:30 pm, tells me she is heading back to the festival and that she's leaving the dog (meaning I get to dog sit). I smile and wish her a good time. Her face is twisted like someone just suggested she have a glass of Franzia. She just leaves. Again, still thinking she's just gotta blow off some steam after a bad day.

The next day - Saturday - is when I realize she's pissed...at me. But I have no idea why. And instead of being an adult and telling me what's bothering her...she's going to put me in the deep freeze. Sally does chores for most of the day and won't even look at me.  I got up and said good morning, and mumbled something, went outside and slammed the door behind her. That's the last she said to me all day, until the evening, when she announces she's having dinner with a friend and again leaves me with her dog.

I was kinda hurt because we kind of had plans on Saturday night, but I figured maybe it was just close quarters/roommate funk. I decided to blow it off. Sunday was my 30th birthday. I'll admit I was kind of sad I didn't get to spend it with my boyfriend and my dog and my family. But Sally had organized for some of her friends who I knew to come over and celebrate with me. I get up and see her washing windows and wish her a good morning. Nothing. *Nothing*. She just keeps washing windows. I say it louder. Still nothing. She certainly heard me. Sally said nothing to me until the first person showed up at the door and all of a sudden she's chipper and happy. As soon as the last person leaves after dinner, she basically stops talking to me again. I still have no clue why she's pissed at me. I can't even fathom what I've done other than not go to the festival with her. All of the normal roommate issues don't really apply here. I brought most of my own stuff (even pots and pans), clean up after myself, keep all my stuff in the room, don't make a lot of noise. I don't park in her spot. I help out with chores as I can. I am on time with the rent payments. I have no idea what I've done to offend her and cause the next ice age. But the whole situation is uncomfortable and awkward for me...

Monday morning she's returning from her walk in the morning as I'm heading to the car and *pretends she doesn't see me even as her dog is pulling her over in my direction*. Again, did I mention she's fucking 50-something?! Uncomfortable and awkward is turning into anger now, because for fuck's sake, just tell me what the fuck I did and we can work it out. No wonder she's divorced (her version is that he never listened to anything she said...I have a feeling she used the deep freeze on him and was mad that he couldn't read her mind).

Monday evening I worked late to make up for my missed day and when I get home around 7 pm, Sally immediately gets up when she sees my car pull into the driveway, turns off all the lights and heads upstairs. By the time I unlock the front door - also not the norm, it's usually unlocked she's holed herself up in her room again.

Sooooooo I'm telling myself I'm totally done with this middle school drama. But now I wanna have some fun with this. Last night I get home early before Sally, who thinks I am working late to make up my hours again. I make myself comfortable on the couch directly by the front door. Once she came in the door, I am all smiles, chattering away. Sally is clearly perturbed with my new line of attack and heads to the kitchen trying to avoid me. So I follow her and just keep chattering along about what I did that day and the cute things her dog did and some neat articles I saw at lunch and random shit that pops into my head. She nods and tries to get away but I block the entryway between the kitchen and the foyer so she has *nowhere* to go (the kitchen only leads to the basement or the back yard). Full chatter attack mode engaged.

Sally chooses the backyard after a few monosyllabic words - still in her business clothes - and claims she's going to water the plants. Fat chance. And. I. Follow. Her. Outside. And I continue to chatter along, telling her about all the intern drama and work politics and what the cute guy in the shop was wearing today. She's cringing the whole time she's watering. Clearly she wants to blow up at me but I don't think she does well with confrontation. I don't really give a shit anymore at this point.

Eventually I got bored and left her to her own devices. When she finally did get inside, I had set myself up again on the couch near the kitchen/foyer area and as she walks by - more like darts by - she mumbles some stuff and I shout as she walks up the stairs ""GREAT TALK SALLY!""

I have no idea how tonight is going to go. I have another week and a half to go. Let's hope I don't get home tonight and find she's changed the locks ;)

edit: I came home late tonight since I was still making up hours but she's acting like everything is normal and nothing happened. Chatted with me for a few minutes before I headed off to my room to write up a report due tomorrow. I'm just going to go with the flow (but be a bit weary!). Thanks for hearing me out everyone! "

2c5x5t,2,2014-07-30,"I [20F] maybe should break up with partner [21M] of 10 months, but he's living in my room while I'm away for the summer.",throwaway_myroom,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2c5x5t/i_20f_maybe_should_break_up_with_partner_21m_of/,"So. It was April 2014, exam season, and my subletter for the summer (I'm back home to work) had just backed out. My boyfriend's roommates had gone... unexpectedly crazy, and as he had just graduated with no concrete plans past a summer internship, he needed somewhere to stay for the summer. We agreed he would sublet my room (I really need a subletter cause $$), but this was definitely only for the short term - I did not want to move in with him. At least, I had thought I said that very definitively and clearly and that's what he agreed to.


I asked him the other day how the apartment hunt was going. He, as I feared, asked to live with me. He loves me, wants to create a closer bond. I said, very clearly, ""no. no way, I'm not ready for that kind of commitment."" Furthermore, my roommates don't want it (he keeps trying to make friends with them, which is the wrong technique for my very introverted roommates), and our apartment is TINY.


I thought that was it, not a huge deal, we've not been together aaalllll that long so I'm being reasonable, he can just get another apt, it's an easy city to get apartments in. But now he tells me that I'm leaving him to be all alone (I've called him out on his manipulation), and that I'm his main reason for staying in the city, rather than going back to his parent's. He also just really really wants to live with me, create a deeper relationship. He's also appealing to my inner sense of adventure by saying how it's a 'new thing for both of us'. He doesn't have a job for next year, and his plans are to live on $5000 and write a book on philosophy of mind (which is actually feasible if you know him; he's very passionate about the subject). His roommates did just do some terrible things, leaving him without his main friend group of the past four years. What I can tell from my roommates is that he's mostly been staying in his (my) room, missing me, and not much else. Across the country, I have two jobs (one very involved), and a family eager to see me, so I've been having quite the opposite experience. 


Since the start of the summer, with a fresh perspective, I've gradually come to realize that as fascinating as I find him, we're not all that compatible, sexually or socially. I find that he's too intellectual and focused, even for me - which is quite surprising. I enjoy being in his physical presence, but I don't enjoy emailing or skyping with him so much. I find him fun to be around, I love him, but I have no long term plans and no desire for commitment beyond seeing each other a couple times a week. Sexually - there's a big problem that I know about and he doesn't. 


I had told myself that I would give him a couple weeks in September and see how I felt then, as we don't talk too much now (our skype connection SUCKS). 


However, as I've recently become relatively sure that I see an end to our relationship (although there are still many things that I would like to explore with him that I probably couldn't with most others), and he did just say that I'm a main reason for him staying in the city..... my best friend and roommate says this means I need to break up with him now, to avoid leaving him stranded in a few months. I can't lead him down a path. But... I don't reaaally want to, yet (selfish), and he's in my room for at least the next month, and a little emotionally fragile. Also, breaking up 'virtually' is quite mean. 



Other background (not strictly necessary)

- This is my first relationship, ever, due to being thoroughly creeped out by stalker guys in junior high and high school. I think this is around his 6th or 7th, his longest being a year and a half (right before me); they were very serious but she cheated with a mutual friend. So we've always had a bit of a difference in 'seriousness', I'm realizing now.

- We're both very logical, intellectual types (although he far more than I), and we're in the same program (he just graduated) at a prestigious university. Most of our interactions are intellectual debates, 'meta' discussions about our relationship, etc. Usually we agree, (except about futurism and qualifiers but whatever). He has a much larger background in our degree program, so I'm usually feeling a bit behind, but we both know it and make it work. 

- We're both into pushing boundaries, and a little bit into the 'alternate' crowd - actively trying to avoid gender stereotypes, cross dressing for the lols, etc. We're in an open relationship over the summer and have both had...liasons with 1 other person. 



---   
**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

Unsure about relationship with boyfriend who is currently living in my room while I'm across the country for the summer. Says he wants to move in with me and I'm a main reason for his staying in the city. I don't want to lead him on. However, I think breaking up with him now is a bit risky for his emotional health, plus I don't actually want to. :s Advice?

This fall I'm taking: Advanced Linear Algebra, Partial Differential Equations, Mathematical Statistics, and Topology. Next fall I will be taking Mathematical Statistics II, Optimization, Numerical Analysis, and Real Analysis, with the possibility of substituting one of those for Stochastic Differential Equations.

But I am overwhelmed by the possibilities of what I should study in my free time when I'm not doing coursework.

Based on the master reading list, I could try to learn more mathematical tools such as time series analysis or stochastic processes.

I know very little about actual finance, so I could read a book on that, such as Hull's book.

I am already strong in programming with C++, Java, and Python, but there is always more to learn.

So to clarify, I am uncertain whether I should try to learn more math, more about finance, or do more programming, on top of a heavy school workload.

I am thinking that perhaps I could focus on teaching myself stochastic processes, so that in the event I take stochastic differential equations in the spring, I will be prepared. "
2c64hx,3,2014-07-30,I had an IUD inserted last week. Here's my experience so far.,brandnewIUD,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2c64hx/i_had_an_iud_inserted_last_week_heres_my/,"Hi r/2xc! I'm a longtime user but wanted to use a throwaway to post information that might get a little too personal for my comfort, so forgive me here on the anonymity.

I had the Mirena IUD inserted a week ago and thought I'd post my (overall) positive experience so far. From all the reading I did before mine was inserted, every uterus is different and everyone will experience this differently, so I thought providing information about what I didn't know may help someone make a decision.

Of course, everyone is entitled to their own choice with birth control and their bodies, so this isn't intended to pressure anyone or make anyone uncomfortable. I tried to stay informative and just explain my decision making throughout the process.

I am not a doctor so please do not take any of this as medical advice.

**Why the Mirena?**

I decided to get an IUD for a few reasons. First, I am 25 years old and I have about 3 more years of education and internship work ahead of me before I can be licensed in my field. My partner and I are serious and live together but do not plan on having children at least until I have my license, but perhaps not even until we are in our lower 30s.

I chose the Mirena (hormonal IUD) for two reasons. First, my doctor told me that the Paragard (copper IUD) may make my periods worse. This was absolutely not an option for me. I have extremely painful periods that can be very heavy from time to time. The cramps make me nauseated to the point where I have left work or school for the day to avoid them. I knew that something that may make my periods worse was not an option for me.  The second reason is that I have been taking hormonal birth control for 8 years and haven't had any issues with it. I have several friends who have issues with hormonal birth control but it makes my skin clearer and I feel no physical or mental difference when I am taking it.

**What was the procedure like?**

About 3 weeks ago I went in for a routine pap smear and told my new doctor (I had just moved to the area) that I was interested in the IUD. Side note, I am from a very rural area (United States) and have been turned down for the Plan B pill at pharmacies before so I was very nervous about receiving some backlash or having to prove a case to my doctor. I had prepared a background speech about being in a committed relationship, my education goals, etc. However, my doctor was awesome. When I asked about the IUD, she basically replied, ""Okay, which one do you want?"" She then walked me through the different types.

The doctor told me to call in when I'm on my period (because your cervix is more dilated and therefore easier to get in, especially if you are like me and haven't given birth) and they'd schedule me in. She also told me to take 600 mg of Ibuprofen before I came in, and I'm glad I did it!

When I went in, I was very, very nervous as I had no idea what to compare the feeling of having something inside my uterus to. My pap smear had come up normal, but they still had me pee in a cup to test me for anything that may have popped up in the two weeks between my exam and the procedure.

The doctor had me sign a few papers saying they had explained the risks of the procedure, which are mainly infection or perforation of the uterus. I then sat back with my feet in the stirrups and they opened me up with the duck lips. The nurse cleaned my vagina with a betadine soap (not before asking if I'd have any adverse reaction to the soap), then they inserted the Mirena applicator, which is like a long wand. When it went in, the nurse held my hand, but it essentially felt what I'd describe as an intense period cramp. Since I normally have intense cramping, take that with a grain of salt, but it wasn't unbearable. She inserted the IUD and they clipped the strings, and they were out! From the insertion of the applicator to them being completely out of my vagina, it was about 30 seconds. The cleaning probably took longer. While they were in, I had maybe one or two more cramps, but it ultimately wasn't terrible.

**What happened after?**

I was told I wasn't to put anything (tampons or penises) inside my vagina for a week, and they allowed me to stay in the room until my cramping went down enough to drive. Granted, I was a little sea-legged going to my car (which is normal), but I guess because I was so nervous before, I was almost surprised I felt so normal. I went home and watched movies and crafted, and my SO bought me ice cream.

I cramped for 5 days after the insertion, but they weren't terrible cramps. It was more of a ""this is my body getting used to having a foreign object inside it"" kind of cramp. I read online that some people will cramp up to a month after insertion. The pain was completely manageable with ibuprofen. I also spotted lightly, but I was finishing my period when I went in for the procedure so this was to be expected.

The day after the procedure, the doctor had told me to check for the strings to ensure it hadn't been expelled. When I tried to find them, I couldn't reach them very well (small hands?), so I had my SO look for them. They're pretty far up there! The strings feel like a monofilament or a very thin fishing line, but I can't feel them inside me. I can feel the very tips of them with my fingers when I check.

Since, I have had light cramping occasionally but nothing is constant. My body is getting used to the foreign object just fine, and it's not even painful enough to warrant painkillers.

**What about sex?**

I had sex for the first time on my IUD last night, and my SO could not feel the strings! I was very nervous as I had read some partners will get poked by the strings. Apparently you can either tuck them up or have the doctor trim them (but they may become more pokey). He reported no poking, and I won't have to worry about birth control until 2019, except for my routine exams and checking for my strings on a monthly basis.

**Money**

The entire procedure was completely covered by my insurance, thankfully. I know I am very lucky to have this! One of the lesser reasons I chose the IUD is because I am going to have some shaky insurance coverage over the next few years while my education finishes up. When I moved to my area for grad school, I lost coverage for a few months, and my BCPs cost 35 dollars per month! I have one year of grad school left, then will not be covered until I find my job. So, this is a great option for me to take advantage of because I won't need continued insurance coverage to stay affordable and non-prego.

**What else?**

I of course don't know yet if I won't get my period during this time, but I'll update when I figure that out. I've read that it can be 3-6 months before the hormones work themselves to a predictable state. I just have some pantyliners and tampons on hand for if/when that happens.

Feel free to ask me anything else!"
2c69a2,0,2014-07-30,"Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [23 F] of 1 year, got into a fight on our anniversary, she hit me then broke up with me. Why do I want her back?",Abe_Froman33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2c69a2/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_1_year_got/,"So my ex-girlfriend and I recently broke up. While in the relationship we would sometimes fights usually about always hanging out with her friends or w/e but things escalated on our anniversary. To make a long story short, she told me I wouldn't do anything I say I want to. Then later that night we had both been drinking and got into an argument when she “defensively” hit me in the face three times. The next day she told me not get upset, but when I got upset she decided she needed a break. We went on a break for three week until I went up to visit her to “figure things out” and set things back to normal. We had a great night, and then for some reason she broke up with me while wearing the anniversary gift I got her no less.

She said the relationship is too serious for her and she feels overwhelmed by my expectations. She also said she feels I have nothing going for me other than her. Granted sometimes I can be a bit too idealistic and I haven’t been hanging with my buddies, but I would literally move heaven and earth for her. She is beautiful, smart, we share all the same interests and I love her and her family. But she rarely ever does things with me in mind. She’ll beg me to come up for a week and then we’ll hang with her friends the whole time. While breaking up, I told her about how much I sacrifice, (time, friends) to which she replied “I didn’t ask you to do any of that” and that she feels I’m more of a friend than anything.

It is very frustrating; three week ago she loved me and wanted to be with me, now she doens't want this anymore... WTF. I don’t know what to do. I literally felt like I was in a one sided relationship sometimes, but wouldn’t confront her about it for fear she’d get mad. She is very independent and will be starting law school soon, so I feel like she just didn’t want to deal with it anymore or she is dating an attorney at the law firm she interns at.

Advice and personal anecdotes are appreciated.

Thanks for reading

**tl;dr**: I love my ex right now I don’t know if I want to go through all the trouble to get her back; when I know she isn't going to be making any effort. 

What should I do, should I get her back or should I move on? If I were to get her back, how do I go about doing it?

2c6jsn,2,2014-07-30,SO [22/F] abroad for past month and I [23/M] am feeling resentful over it. Not sure if I'm justified or should bring it up when she returns.,rlathrowaway1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2c6jsn/so_22f_abroad_for_past_month_and_i_23m_am_feeling/,"Some backstory: we've been dating for a year and a half. We're semi long distance, I'm in university two hours away from her university. We see each other nearly every weekend and then all summer (same hometown, but didn't meet til college). We're very compatible, she's very fun, intelligent, we have many similar interests, and have had a great relationship. She started looking into study abroad programs last fall and found one to travel abroad and do volunteering teaching English in Asia. I was fine with it, although not thrilled. She tried to get me to go along but I just don't have that kind of money and didn't have much interest in going. She's been there a month now and coming back soon, it started out good, we talked a lot and used international calling apps. But some stuff started to rub me the wrong way. 

The first thing that chipped away at my support for the trip was on April Fools day she called me and said she was going for three months instead of one. I felt crushed but then she said she was joking. Still didn't feel good. 

I moved back to our hometown for the summer so we could spend time together before she left. But now that she's gone and I'm here alone working I'm feeling resentful. I did a road trip for two weeks to occupy myself which was nice but being home alone isn't. I came back here to see her for the summer when I could have stayed at school where my friends are and gotten a job to occupy myself. Moving back to school for one month doesn't work, the positions I was looking for are all summer or nothing. I also stopped searching for summer internships in other states because she got upset that I'd be far away.

The final thing that pushed me over the edge was while on my road trip I started feeling down one day (tired from driving, laptop broke, missing girlfriend) so we started talking on the phone and she told me ""I need a strong support base from home, I don't need anyone bringing me down"". I stayed up late at night to talk to her when she got sick in her first week, I waited for hours at the visa office to keep her company, and that's what I get for one day of feeling shitty? That was maybe two weeks ago. 

That's sort of where everything stands. Every day I'm feeling more bitter over this. I guess I feel like she's being selfish and that phone call was what put me in this mood. I gave up being around my friends or potentially having an internship in another state to be here, and she's gone and got upset when I felt bad on one day. She's coming back in a little over a week then she'll go back to school two weeks later.

Am I just resentful that she's out seeing stuff and I'm stuck at home? Should I bring any of this up? I don't want to be bitter and resentful of her forever.

Tl;dr girlfriend is abroad, I'm at home and feeling resentful. Don't know if I should bring it up or if I'm just being whiny or petty."
2c6n7x,6,2014-07-30,"My job makes me absolutely miserable, what's the best course of action?",pyrocompulsive,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2c6n7x/my_job_makes_me_absolutely_miserable_whats_the/,"So obviously I'm sure everybody's first thought is, ""find a new one,"" but unfortunately that's a lot easier said than done.
I have a job that I absolutely can't stand. Now, some background, I just turned 27, I've got a bachelor's degree and a master's degree..and I'm in a job that makes $30k a year. I'm paying off student loans because I made the huge mistake of going to grad school (a mistake that I regret every damn day) and I don't see them being complete anytime soon. I just bought a new car, but I had a lot of money saved up since I've been saving since I was 17, so I was able to put a good amount down and only take a small loan for 10k, which is extremely reasonable for a monthly payment.

I've been searching for serious jobs ever since grad school obviously, and I've been rejected by the federal government about 73 times and counting since 2011 via USAjobs.gov, and that's extremely disheartening (especially since I have contacts within the government, and nobody seems to be able to help at all. it's not even about who you know anymore!)

I interned for a State Government position back in 2010 while in grad school, but they told me on day one that the unpaid internship would not turn into a job opportunity. I said ok whatever, and took it because I figured it was good resume material..but here we are 4 years later, and it hasn't helped a damn bit.

My current position is pretty much a glorified cashier. It makes me feel like crap. I've spent all this money on education, and I make 30 grand a year doing collecting and whatnot. I hate it. I don't like the people I work with, and it frustrates me to no end how some people there are babied and get away with not doing as much of work as I do, yet it just doesn't seem to matter to anybody. My boss claims to love my work ethic, which I'm sure is true because I'm a damn hard worker, but it's not like I'll ever see a dime more for being a hard worker. It's a municipal job, so they can't just go handing out raises and promotions.

I absolutely loathe this job. I wake up in the morning, and the first thought on my mind is how much I hate that job, and how going there makes me want to jump off a bridge. Every night, I come home from work, go online, search for new jobs, then goto bed. That's all I do, because my hatred of this job has broken into my personal life and completely changed my mood. I'm just completely full of anger because of this job.

The problem is that it's affecting me physically as well too. I've had intestinal issues for years, but they've gotten much worse in the past 1.5 years that I've been at this job, and even my gastro claims that these symptoms are due to the mind-gut relation, and that my feelings towards work are most likely why I'm having such issues throughout the day. My hair has become more gray over this past year, and I'm even getting pure white/gray hairs in my beard, which I've never had up until now. I get headaches often, and I just feel like utter garbage. I've gained about 15 pounds the past year working here as well. All in all, my health is pretty crappy, and a lot of the reason why can be attributed to this job.

I apply and apply and apply, but it seems that my wasted degrees (bachelors in political science; masters in criminal justice w/ a focus in homeland security and defense) won't get me anywhere. Still living at home because there's no way I can afford to move out, and it just seems like my life is on complete hold because of this job.
I'd love to quit, but financially it's just not an option, and it's not the responsible thing to do. I need a new job, but nobody wants to hire me, and I've got no idea what to do. Any advice, Reddit?

TL;DR: hate my job a lot, it's affecting my health, and pretty much makes my daily life suck.

thanks guys!"

I was in Appleton last summer for an internship, staying with my girlfriend's family, and I loved it. Everyone's so polite and friendly, in stark contrast to Miami, where it seems there are so many people that they all hate each other and assume an every-man-for-himself mentality. Simply driving here is a terrifying experience.

My girlfriend (a native to the Midwest) and I just graduated from college in south Florida, and she just moved back up with her family because she hasn't been able to find a decent job and she's going back to a previous job while she continues her search.

I'm into IT and I applied for a few entry-level positions up there just to see what might turn up, and to my surprise, a head-hunter contacted me saying he's pretty sure he could place me within three weeks for a full-time $12-15 per hour position. I did the math and that's roughly $2000-2600 per month, before taxes.

I told this to my parents, who are extremely clingy and don't want me to leave, and my Dad told me that apart from his personal feelings, he thinks it wouldn't be financially doable because I would have to deal with Wisconsin's winter conditions (heating bills) and additional state income taxes.

Considering this is a more permanent situation, it would be very tacky to ask to move in with my girlfriend's family again, so I'm looking at a single apartment or maybe a roommate situation. My question to you guys is: Do you guys think this move would be a possibility for me?

tl;dr Would I be able to live (preferably) by myself or with a roommate in Appleton with an income of $2000-2600 per month before taxes?"

I often see posts on here written by recent or about-to-be graduates that question their abilities as a developer because of a lack of practical or professional experience. This has got me confused and I would like to know where these people come from, what their program are and any other related detail.


**My background**

I'm a 19yo french canadian that suddenly decided to get into computer science starting CEGEP (*I'd like to say that CEGEP is the equivalent to other's colleges, but I find it hard to believe and this is a little the purpose of this post*). 


So, just to explain shortly how it is here, 6 years in primary school, 5 years of highschool, 2 years of CEGEP or 3 if it's a 'technique' (*In the case of computer science, it is 3 years*). Normally, the 3 year programs are meant to bring you to the job market, but there's also the possibility to continue University afterwards which works the same as yours' I believe.


Personally, I've had plenty of practical projects in and outside of school as well as two internships in big and small companies. Therefor, I cannot understand where those people come from when they say that they can't ""code themselves out of a paper bag"", for example. Please explain your background, what happened at school and if you went out of your way Not to get any practice.


PS: This also applies to those posts where people mention that degrees are useless because bachelor graduates have no professional experience and that it's very different than being in class; or bootcamp-related posts.


I hope this is clear, thank you for your responses."

It has about 30 employees, 5 of which are full-time programmers, and I am the only software intern. But I really don't like this internship for a lot of reasons: 

1. This company is really disorganized and mismanaged. It has been 10 weeks and I have already been re-assigned to a new project 5 times. I never get to work on a project for more than 2 weeks before being moved to something new.

2. I have no mentor or any direct training. The only ""training"" I'm given involves a coworker sending me a link to a site where I self-learn the material. I basically have to figure everything out myself. 

3. A lot of the previously written code is *really* bad and written by former programmers who were laid off. It's terribly organized and has little to no documentation, which makes it a pain to work with.

--

At this point there's only a few weeks left so of course I'm going to tough it out till the end. But does this sound like a normal internship to you? Cause I think a ""real"" internship should involve a lot more mentoring and training, and a single well-thought out project that you do for the entire summer. Thoughts?"
2c76zg,1,2014-07-30,Overwhelmed by option for what I should self-study in addition to graduate coursework to prepare for a quantitative career [Cross-post from quantnet and /r/quant],CD_Johanna,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2c76zg/overwhelmed_by_option_for_what_i_should_selfstudy/,"I am in a MS in math, with the hopes of gaining a sufficient foundation in math for a top MFE. I also would like to find an internship in financial math for next summer.

This fall I'm taking: Advanced Linear Algebra, Partial Differential Equations, Mathematical Statistics, and Topology. Next fall I will be taking Mathematical Statistics II, Optimization, Numerical Analysis, and Real Analysis, with the possibility of substituting one of those for Stochastic Differential Equations.

But I am overwhelmed by the possibilities of what I should study in my free time when I'm not doing coursework.

Based on the master reading list, I could try to learn more mathematical tools such as time series analysis or stochastic processes.

I know very little about actual finance, so I could read a book on that, such as Hull's book.

I could also work on getting some tangible certification to show for myself, such as CFA level 1.

I am already strong in programming with C++, Java, and Python, but there is always more to learn.

**TLDR: I could either:**

1. Self-teach myself math beyond my current curriculum, with options being stochastic processes, stochastic integrals, stochastic differential equations, diffusions, markov processes, time series...among other

2. Learn actual finance, particularly Hull's book on options

3. Try to get a tangible certification for my resume, such as pass CFA level 1. Or even the actuarial exams, which I have most of the knowledge to pass P/1 and FM/2.

4. Take my already proficient C++/Java/Python programming and try to get to the advanced level

Again the aim is to prepare for a summer internship and then future enrollment in a MFE."
2c78dy,2,2014-07-30,My [17F] boyfriend [18M] is my entire life,nuyvah,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2c78dy/my_17f_boyfriend_18m_is_my_entire_life/,"My boyfriend and I started going out when I was sixteen. His family is somewhere between upper-middle class and actually upper class. I grew up with my vaguely abusive/POS dad and we were like food stamps poor. 

I spent a lot of time over at their house from the beginning, and became pretty close to his family, especially his mom. After we had been dating for about six months, my aforementioned POS dad kicked me out in the middle of the night. Long story. 

So I went to his house and just never left. I moved into their house, I switched schools, and was in a whole different environment/neighborhood/social scene. I’m not some poor idiot who was dazzled by their money, but it was very different. 

I was an A student at my old school, which was equivalent of a C- at my new private school. And my old friends just kind of vaporized when I moved away.

My boyfriend has a twin brother and a brother that’s one year below us. His circle of friends basically includes them and other dudes at our school. I always end up hanging out with the guys’ respective girlfriends. His younger brother dated this girl and she was around all the time. We became good friends, and then his younger brother broke up with her, basically because he just lost interest. 

I tried to keep the friendship going, but my boyfriend was really against it because it meant that I was siding with her. And then I got bitchy and told him that it wasn’t his business who I hung out with, which I really feel bad about because he was pretty upset. 

And my boyfriend said that obviously she wasn’t a good influence on me since I was acting crazy. Plus didn’t I trust that this brother had made the right choice when he broke up with her? And I shouldn’t have escalated the situation but I started arguing but he just got more pissed and said he felt like he couldn’t trust me to hang out with this girl. 

And he’s under a ton of stress right now, because he’s trying to juggle a lot of extracurriculars and summer stuff while also figuring out the college apps thing. But still it’s frustrating especially because I feel like I don’t really get that much time to myself. During the school year we're together all the time and he drives me to and from school. Like I said he’s very strict so he knows that I couldn’t see this girl without him knowing. So I don’t understand why he feels like he can’t trust me. 

I have tracking on my phone and I know he checks it. I told him that I knew, and he was like, well yeah I care about you I’m just checking to make sure you’re okay or if you’re on your way. Which I guess is true and honestly it doesn’t really bother me but still.  He’s never accused me of cheating and I don’t think he would unless it was really serious but he’s kind of overprotective when it comes to other people. Like getting physical with someone for saying something rude about me or worrying about me when we’re not together.

I have acquaintances that aren’t exclusively his friends but first of all he’s a bit more popular/outgoing/friendly so he has more people that like him and consider him a casual friend. I am ___’s girlfriend to a lot of people. My best friend has always been him, and I was somewhere between good and best friend with his brother’s ex. Now I just have his twin brother’s girlfriend, who drives me crazy but who I literally have to spend so much fucking time with because she comes over all the time and we’re always double dating and sitting together at lunch. When my boyfriend wants to spend time with a guy friend, I always either get dragged into hanging out separately with that guy’s girlfriend or I end up hanging out with his mom. 

I’m just feeling like I don’t have that many options right now. I can’t drive, I have no money, and no one that’s just mine. I could get a job, but first of all I’m pretty busy with school, this volunteer thing I do with his mom, extra tutoring, and going on dates. And because my boyfriend is way way more busy (All AP/Honors classes, practice everyday, like five different extracurricular things) he gets really annoyed when I’m busy and he’s free because he doesn’t have much free time. I mean, if I have tutoring or something that’s fine but he will get grumpy if I say that I have homework to finish or something.

Right now it’s summer so I’m a bit more free but I’m working for this charity thing with his mom, taking a summer class, and I have practice twice a week. He’s got an unpaid internship so when he gets home at like 6:30, he wants to spend time with me. Part of me wishes I had looked for jobs back in June, but I don’t even think that would have worked out because he would have been like WTF why do you want to work at Burger King? And his parents would have been like, “Oh honey we will give you more money.”

But I just feel like I need a life outside of my boyfriend and his mom and his twin brother’s girlfriend, who actually annoys the fuck out of me but I constantly have to spend time with. If something happened, I would literally have no house, no ability to go to (or pay for) my current school, no friends, no family support, and not even enough actual money to buy a metro card.

+++

TL;DR: I feel like my boyfriend is unintentionally controlling every aspect of my life. What can I do?"

This build was on a $450 dollar budget. My girlfriend is working a summer internship and her boss mentioned that it was his son's birthday and that he needed a gift for him. When he also said that he has been asking for a computer lately my girlfriend swiftly volunteered my services haha. So since this is for my girlfriends boss, i really wanted to make sure it is a good build and his son would like it. The son is 15yo plays mostly League of legends and World of Warcraft, but mostly doesnt play other games bc the family computer cant handle it.
The $450 dollar budget is always tough, it started out at 400 but when he said he wanted a color theme and nice case, i said that it would cost a little extra. The color the,me he wanted was a blue and white since it is his school's colors. I had trouble making anything cheaper than this that would perform well with the games at hand. I originally wanted a i3-4130 for the CPU since WoW is a CPU sided game and i know he will be playing that, but microcenter didn't have a cpu/mobo bundle for any cheaper i3's, thus the fx-6300, which is still a fine CPU.
For the GPU i went with a r7 265 over a 750ti because the performance is much higher and i had the wattage to spare. The 750ti is a great card nice and cool and quiet, but i think that he would benefit more from the gpu speed performance than heat and noise.
I wanted to go with a phantom 240 case but i had trouble finding one in stock that i could get on short notice. But this case turned out nice and fits the color theme well.

was built about a month ago.

We were sitting across from each other in the froyo place and I didn't feel as though I had an opening  to go in for a kiss. When we left to drop her off at the train station, I just gave her a hug goodbye. The location was very busy around lunch time so I didn't know how going in for a kiss would fair and it certainly didn't help my bitch butterflies. 

Then today we barely talked and she had to go to her internship annd yeah I wonder if i fucked up by not escalating, I bitched out... am I right? Or is there still hope to recover from this (even though we both agreed that the date was fun).  

If so, what's my next move? I'm guessing I should get her on another date, be more cocky, and make shit happen. 

Thanks for the advice."

This summer we have been long distance because I have an internship across the country. It's been very rough on us, mostly because I've been feeling distant because of the lack of physical connection. Most of the time we're fine, but we'll hit rough patches where i withdraw because I get separation anxiety and that's how I cope with it. It's worth noting that I have been diagnosed with general anxiety, and while it effects our relationship, we have a very open communication whenever I'm worrying about something. It is a problem, but I'm optimistic that I will tackle it.

Compounding the issues coming from being apart, is that my home life is very stressful (I am living at home this summer). My mother had a stroke 2 weeks ago and I'm beside myself worrying about her every night. She is not making the proper lifestyle choices, and she is in a depressive episode where leaving the house is an ordeal. Additionally, my dad is relying heavily on alcohol which is very scary for me to watch.

My poor boyfriend and I have been trying so hard to keep it together. We know this is a temporary situation and things will be back to normal once I'm home, but I'm afraid it's gotten to be too much. Tonight may have been a tipping point for him. We were chatting earlier, and I told him pretty much verbatim ""I'm in a bad anxious mood about our relationship tonight. You're going out with your friends and I want you to have fun and not worry about me and we can talk tomorrow"". When he asked me what was wrong, I told him that I had been worrying about out lack of a sex life while I was apart (we had a long discussion about this the other night). He mentioned that he was going to send me some cute naked pics and my response basically amounted to ""I'm not really in the mood, I'm not sure if I would appreciate them"". If he had said that to me, I would be very hurt. He is crushed. I honestly did not mean what I said I was just in an angry mood and being stubborn and bratty when we were talking. He's out drinking with his friends right now so we're not talking, but I'm so afraid he's just going to decide to break up with me.

Please help me Reddit, what can I do or say? I love this guy so much and I can't believe I said something that hurt his feelings so much, especially about such a sensitive topic. I'm afraid this hurtful comment was the tipping point of a stressful summer. 

I will probably delete this post in a day or so because he knows my reddit name and I don't want him to see this. I am in absolute distress right now at the thought of losing him.

Current SLPs of reddit, or students in this field, I would love to hear what you have to say about what I am going through right now. I am currently a second year speech path graduate student, and have been feeling very down lately. I want to start by saying that I feel very fortunate to have been accepted into the program that I am in, and am thankful for this opportunity, however lately it has becoming very hard for me to stay positive. 

I am not sure I am cut out to be in this field. I am always receiving criticism from supervisors about how I am not ""animated"" enough (with both children and adults), and was recently told that I need to be much more creative in coming up with activities to play with children. I am trying my best to be as animated as possible, but lately it is starting to feel as if there is something wrong with my personality and that I am just not the right type of personality for this job, because I honestly don't know how much more animated I can be, without feeling completely out of my own mind and body, and even very fake. I am trying my best to come up with activities to play with the kids in my child focused clinic, but it feels like the supervisors expect you to spend so so so much time making arts and crafts and new games, etc before every single 50 min long session, that it is almost taking away from me being able to focus on the clinical side of treatment. I am just feeling completely lost. I don't know if this is all my fault and I'm just not creative and bubbly enough to be doing this, or if that comes with some practice. I feel like I have been broken down by my supervisors, not only on an academic level but on a personal one as well. The first year of school was hard but I did very well in all of my classes and tried to take the supervisors constructive criticism positively and tried to better myself, and still am but it doesn't feel like it is getting me anywhere. 

I am hoping that starting my internship placements this year will make this experience a more positive one, but at this point I am hanging by a very thin thread and am very close to giving up. Even though I don't want to give up on this. But I just feel so broken. 

Any words of advice are greatly appreciated. Thank you :( "
2c7gzi,118,2014-07-30,How my regular Resume Rewrite turned into a Lol-themed Website Resume and how Rewarding it was to finally finish a project in my spare time,cable729,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2c7gzi/how_my_regular_resume_rewrite_turned_into_a/,"[LINK: riotgames-hire.me](http://riotgames-hire.me)

---------

For the past three years, I've wanted to apply to Riot. I obviously wanted the job, just like so many of you, but I **didn't think I was good enough.**

This deterred me every year when I wanted to apply for an internship. I submitted my resume to plenty of other companies with great results, but I always felt that **just doing the minimum**, or a cover letter and resume, would not set me apart, and I just kept waiting.

I always told myself that I would finish programming a game one day. I would create a great LoL-themed project in my free time, and then I'll be able to apply to Riot. **That day never came.**

Finally, it was the summer before my senior year of college, and for a software engineer, that is time to submit your resumes. I was in despair. I hadn't completed a game, or made a clever LoL bot, or anything cool enough for Riot. All this time I had been **putting off applying**, I hadn't actually done anything awesome.

I knew I wasn't going to do any of these things if I kept waiting. So finally, I sat down and rewrote my resume, thinking I'd create something snazzy that I could send to Google, GitHub, Riot, and other awesome companies.

Pretty soon I ditched Word, moved to LaTeX, ditched that, and thought ""Why don't I make a website?"" I started making a generic resume, and the more time I spent, the more I began to realize:

**I really only want to work for Riot**

I ditched the genericness and focused entirely on Riot. I worked for weeks, coming home after work and staying up past midnight, loving every minute of it. Finally, I had created something awesome, **something I was incredibly proud of**, and that felt awesome.

I can't stress how great it feels to **finish something**. When you're working on a project in your spare time, it often ends up on the back burner, despite how much we want to complete it. I urge you: put an hour a day to work on something you've been wanting to do for a long time. It may take you months to finish it, but it is entirely worth it.

It feels terrific to submit an application and know that I did the absolute best I could. If I don't get a call back, I can feel comfortable knowing that I'm not currently ready for the position I applied to at Riot.

2c7nh4,4,2014-07-31,"[Help] New here, anxiety is taking over my life",anxiety_toss_away,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2c7nh4/help_new_here_anxiety_is_taking_over_my_life/,"**Long text up ahead**

I'm using a throwaway because friends know my account and so on.

I'm 23 years old, male, live with my parents and just started having some pretty hardcore anxiety attacks last September. Before then, I had a pretty traumatic year. I had several family deaths leading up to March 2013, full time engineering student and so on. I had to tend to the dying family and what not as well, plenty of running around and no time to decompress. In addition to that, I had feelings for a girl and things didn't pan out, dragged out and wound up in a crappy situation. I have a hard time forgetting things and letting go so situations will stick in my head and replay endlessly. I ultimately wind up beating myself up mentally for things I've done in the past.


**Driving**

I love to drive, I always did and found it relaxing. I loved cars as a kid, interests went elsewhere then turned back to cars when I got my license. My mom does not drive and is petrified of cars. Driving with her is rather stressful because she's scared shitless of anything with wheels and a motor. So, as you guys could imagine, driving in rain even with her not in the car can be stressful when you get things like ""I wish you wouldn't go, the weather is so bad. You're making me so nervous..."" Come September, I was driving to a friend's and the weather wasn't the best, but it cleared out. So I headed out on my way and things started to churn in my head. Ultimately, I had a hardcore anxiety attack and the first for me while driving. I felt lightheaded, nauseous, wound up hyperventilating and cramped. I thought it was food poisoning as I have some dietary issues and spent the night at my friends' house, tripping out badly. Drove back home early while still in an anxiety attack. Went to a clinic the day after, they said it was an anxiety attack. Was given a referral for a psychologist and sleeping pills. Went to my university, was shooed away and so I just said to take it as it comes. Plenty of attacks have happened since.

Since then, the joy of driving has been taken away from me. Short distance drives are okay but I still find my heart rate going up with a bit of nerves. I find my mind becomes very premeditative with thoughts of worrying of what if I have an attack and then it feeds itself. Longer distance drives become an issue because of this and has sucked away the joy of driving along, despite the fact that I'm a decent driver with no accidents and no tickets (7 years of holding a license). Hell, just thinking about going somewhere or seeing people will make me anxious because my mind feeds into these thoughts that something may/is going to happen and I'll be incapacitated from an anxiety attack. An example is I'm driving on the highway, about 15 miles away from home and if I have an attack, what's going to happen? The situation plays out in my mind in a tragic way mostly. 

**The girl**

I'm a virgin, I have never had a steady relationship. And any ""action"" I've had, unfortunately was through girls in relationships coming onto me. The vast majority of attempts I made crashed, burned and dragged out long enough to render me volatile. I don't know how to fare well with dating and all that but am socially capable. This girl popped into my life around when things were picking up with family illnesses so my mind was elsewhere. She was single at the time, recently broken up from her on/off boyfriend. When I went for it, it was too late and was pretty bummed out about it. Eventually, we still talked. Their relationship was back to the usual stagnant self and she eventually came onto me and I went along with it, feeling crappy. I refused to have sex with her because I knew I couldn't handle the guilt. Now, I've put a lot of pressure on myself for losing my virginity and the thought of it makes me anxious. I told her to eventually decide, me or the other dude. She chooses the other dude but keeps me on the side for hook ups. I keep up with it because something is better than nothing, right but still feel terrible about it.

At this point in time, in my mind, a lot of thoughts are firing. I'm not a confident person at all and tend to question myself quite a bit. So, in my mind, a lot thoughts are going off like ""You're 23, a virgin. Things clearly aren't working for you. Maybe you're gay."" I know myself well enough that I'm pretty sure I'm not yet my mind is firing off these thoughts and they get more and more absurd as time goes on. A peer of mine is homosexual and pretty vocal/flamboyant about it and would taunt/berate  me (things like, ""you're so gay"", ""doing x or y is gay"", ""you're such a virgin"") which I think definitely contributed. Additionally, I find myself in liked a conditioned state where I find my self-talk goes along the lines of ""I'm not gay"" when it comes up. (It's gotten better but I have bad bouts at times) At this point in time, I can't sleep, my mind is filled with uncomfortable thoughts and I'm not considered functional. Fortunately, this was during spring break. I go and I call a mental health institute that was recommended to me by my friend's girlfriend (the people I went to see when my first anxiety attack happened while driving). Get issued a therapist, not a psychologist. Had 6 sessions then she left the place (was an intern with a supervisor), eventually get moved to somebody else, have 5 or so sessions then said person left to start a family therapy private practice with little to no progress as when things seemed to gain traction, I get dropped.  

I'm still friendly with the girl but have been avoiding her because the situation stresses me out. A new girl has come into my life and while I'm trying to go for it, my mind fires off thoughts along the lines of, ""if you're questioning yourself, how can you have any intimate connection?"" and other thoughts about sex, fidelity (given how harsh I am to myself), pressure from parents about having kids. All of it makes me anxious beyond belief, yet I'm sure I'm straight. I constantly think about this girl and there are strong feelings, both romantically and sexually. Never had anything like that for men.

**The Rest**

Throughout high school, I had test anxiety. I would lock up/freeze on tests because I was so nervous and concerned about my performance then would be harsh on myself when I did poor. Combine that with ADD tendencies and you have a recipe for low self esteem. I was tested for ADD when I was younger, results came back inconclusive but with signs. Both therapists I've had from the mental health institution say I should get tested but it's costly. 

I get a lot of stress from family, school and a lot of other stimuli and as I'm sure you can imagine, never had a chance to decompress really.

*I stress/get anxious about getting anxious in situations like if I were to go work, see friends, drive, be intimate...anything that I significantly value.* How do you guys deal with this? I honestly feel as if my life is being controlled and crippled. I was a pretty social person, enjoyed driving and would do 150 mile trips in one sitting within a heartbeat. Now I get anxious if I have to get into a car in 20 mins or I'm on a bus to go meet up with friends to see a movie.

I got transferred to a new therapist through the institute, not a psychologist most likely. I have yet to call them back but do have an annual checkup with my GP in a week. I was thinking about asking for a referral for a psychiatrist or psychologist, instead of returning back to the mental health institute. Should I just jump the gun and go for a psychologist now and not return the call for the therapist?

Any support or advice is appreciated.

Does the language used by a company matter?,MentalMinotaur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c7tpt/first_job_does_the_language_used_by_a_company/,"Quick background: Soon to be graduating Computer Engineer Tech with two internships that specialized in C++ embedded type programming. Other than that the only other language experience is from learning on my own.

I currently have 2 job offers at 2 different companies that focus on 2 different languages. 

Job A: The same place I interned at. They develop solely in c++ for their standalone products. 

Job B: Their main focus is c# but they have some code in c++ although it is unclear how much c++ development I'd be doing. They are also looking to delegate configuration management tasks to me so basically using scripting languages to automate  pre-build processes(I believe). They develop desktop applications so much bigger code base.

So my questions are:

Does it matter which language I get experience in for my first job? 

Does picking one or the other really impact me from finding a job that requires another the use of a different language?

Lastly which job would offer more experience? Developing desktop applications or smaller application that will run on embedded type devices?

2c7ub3,5,2014-07-31,I'm having trouble deciding what I'd like to do with my life.,AutisticBadger,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2c7ub3/im_having_trouble_deciding_what_id_like_to_do/,"As my title says I am seriously confused about what I want to do with my life. I am a 21 year old college student. Though this will be my fourth year since I entered college (senior year), technically I only have credits to be considered a junior. I have technically had two different majors since I started college. I entered college with my declared major being Management Information Systems and then right around the end of my freshman year I changed to Computer Science. 

By the end of my sophomore year I began to realize that I was just not cut out for computer science because I was just not able to keep up with the math classes. I tried to give it one last shot the first semester of my junior year but I just could not get a good enough grade in the math classes.

So over that winter break I was talking to some of my family during a Christmas party, and a lot of them are educators. They got me all excited about education and I told myself that I wanted to become a teacher. I took some classes the next semester to head in that direction and quickly realized I just was not passionate about it. I dreaded studying and going to class more than anything. I am the average college student who doesn't usually get all excited about class and studying but it was different this time. 

I was taking summer classes, this summer, to try and make up some credit hours cause I've fallen so far behind with the major changes, and not getting good enough grades in classes. My GPA is literally in the shitter. I had a break down/realization moment the other day that I am 21 years old and have no idea what the hell I want to do with my life and in the mean time I'm just wasting money and time. My parents are trying to be understanding, but I know they are disappointed in me. They are both have very professional jobs and made their career decisions and made it through school with no problems. 

So, now that you've read all that and probably want me to get to the point. The two summers around when my majors were M.I.S. and Computer Science, I had actually managed to get internships. After the second summer I decided I could not sit at a desk all day every day for my entire life. I like to be up and moving around. I love the outdoors and I like being athletic and working out. My parents are understanding of this and have been trying to give me some career options. My mom has said firefighter and dad has said anywhere from police officer to park ranger, because he knows I like the parks. I still want to get a degree, so the advice I am seeking is some college majors and the careers you can get with them that kinda fit my personality of not wanting to sit at a desk all day and such. Thanks in advanced and sorry for the long story.

TL;DR : I am a 21 year old who keeps switching majors only to determine either I can't handle the difficulty of some of the classes or I am just not passionate at all about it. I don't want a career where I would have to sit at a desk every day all day and also love the outdoors and parks and being active in general. Would appreciate any input on college majors and the career they pertain to that meet these qualifications."

I'm not an angry person at all, I'm really not, but lately I just feel consumed by internal frustration.

The biggest problem is that people bounce their political opinions off of me constantly, and I don't know why. Like the other day my sister said to me, ""I'd prefer my husband to make more money than me, what about you?"" I replied, ""at this point in my life I think it's inevitable that I'll make more money, and I'm fine with that."" All of the sudden our friend who had been quiet in the backseat just ERUPTS and goes off about how ""that is just WRONG!""

Or a male friend of mine who is a fellow engineer, I found out recently that he said behind my back that he thinks it's ""not appropriate"" for me to be in this field because of my gender. This threw me off because he would never say this to my face, I never thought he had any shred of misogyny in him and he always spoke to me with respect.

And oh my god the sexual harassment! ""You should wear shorter dresses, we like those."" It never fucking ends. I found myself feeling guilty at my last job because when I started and realized I would be working closely with an older man I thought, ""oh god, here it goes again!"" I thought to myself, ""you're being judgmental, you don't even know this guy!"" Then 4 months later, sure enough...It happens again.

Being called ""cutie."" ""Sweetheart.""

My worst moment was when I finally got the internship I'd been dreaming of for months, and my best friend said to me that I probably got it because I'm a woman. 50 applicants, 3 were female, I was the only woman hired out of 12 people who made the cut. When I got upset, her dad piped up in the living room, ""she didn't get the job because she's a girl, she got it because she's a cute girl!"" thinking he was being helpful.

Then there's my dad. When I struggled early on he said to me in private, ""men are just better at some things, and women are better at others."" Ouch.

(for the record, I ended up earning an A in the class in the end anyways)

Even just the little things, like being the only woman in classes over and over again. I feel physically threatened. Like I've got a big red target painted on me constantly.

Every single article headline that says women are naturally less gifted at this or that technical skill feels like a personal insult.

And my all-time worst favorite ever:

""Do you need any help?""

I cannot count on both hands how many times at university I heard this exact line. Over and over again, from random guys in my class who would come up to me out of the blue.

Sometimes I get so frustrated I want to leave the field. I feel so crappy about myself, walking around with this chip on my shoulder. I don't want to be angry anymore. How do you make it stop?

Today I found myself in a very uncomfortable situation. I just finished high school and I'm not into college life so I'll be on ""my own"" from now on. That said, here's my question.

I've been into web development for about 2 years now, I know the basics and I've been doing some research on the most difficult parts of coding, so you could say I already know a bit about this world. Recently I've been looking at web marketing and I'm starting to love it because a part of me always loved to adverstise things and make people ""fall"" for it, can't really explain what I want to say but I think you got it. Now I want to follow a path, this is, I want to get a job from what I've learned and I was thinking of taking a course on one of this two loves of mine, so I could get a certificate, an internship and to get all clarified for me.

The real question is, what should I take a course of, Web Development or Web Marketing? Should I do web marketing and still use my code knowledge or should I just follow dev and in the future learn some marketing?

(Sorry for my English. And please, don't throw any hate, if you think this is a bad idea or that I should just follow anything else, please write your opinion down calmly and in order so I can understand. And remember, this isn't just an answer I'm looking for, many might look up for this and will aswell be helped with this type of question just like I might will. Thanks.)"

For my department there were no longer any dedicated IT staff due to budget cuts, but the hospital had turned to hiring students to fix bugs and applications, and make sure that everything went smoothly. Most users could rely on the main IT helpdesk, which helped users with all their more common problems. What I did mostly was small bits of development on some of the laboratory tools. Think VBScript/VBA and MS Office. 

About a month after my contract ended I get an urgent voice mail from my ex-boss. 

&gt;""Captain_Flashheart, if you're able to come please help. We have a very urgent bug that is stopping the stream of data from one of the analyst machines to the central hospital information system.""  

About half an hour later I get another call:

&gt;B: Captain_Flashheart, did you get my earlier message? We tried calling every intern who has ever worked here.  
&gt;M: Yes, I just haven't been able to reply yet. What is the problem, exactly?  
&gt;B: Remember the string of information that the system uploads from a text file? Something corrupted the string and randomly placed eighteen [tab]s at the end of the file, so the file could not be read properly.  

At that moment I think back. One of the files that is imported is essentially a group of comma separated values that correspond to blood serum values and patient IDs. It's just a basic text file that does not need to be opened by anyone who is not a machine, but if anything screws with the formatting there would be a big fat error from the server. 

&gt;M: Yes, how could that have happened?  
&gt;B: Well, I looked at it and went down to the lab. Apparently someone opened the file and just as they did a very attractive female walked past. They lost their focus for a second and managed to add the 18 tabs to the file by pressing the keyboard, and carelessly saved the file as they closed it.  
&gt;M: I see.  
&gt;B: I'm calling you to tell you that it's fixed.   

At this point I had to suppress my laughter. I can only imagine how much of a panic people had when they discovered this ""bug"" and how ashamed they must have felt when they got to the cause of the problem. "

So as the title states, I need some advice for saving up in the future.

Some background on me:
-I am a 21 year old male currently in college seeking an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering as a rising junior.
-I hope to go to graduate school right out of college unless I get a fantastic job offer when I graduate.
- currently, my parents are completely covering my tuition and housing in college but said I am on my own for graduate school. 
- I currently have a checking and savings account and have about 4000$ to my name currently. 
- I am working an internship currently and hope to make at least another 1000$ before I go back to school.
- during the school year, I work a part time job where I make about 130$/week. 60$ of that goes to groceries for the week. The other 70$ usually gets saved.
-I hope to work another (different) internship next summer where I hope to get at least 5000$ during the summer. 


So here are some questions:
- what more can I do?
-I currently have a credit card under my name that my dad pays off for when I am home and maybe need to run errands or something for the family. I am looking into getting a student credit card with a low cap. Any suggestions?
- what else can I do right now to start saving for my future? I have been very serious with a woman and I want to be financially ready just in case we decide to take the leap of faith later in life.

Any other tips are greatly appreciated!"

Let's start with a little bit of background, though I'll try to keep it brief altogether (though it's sort of a long story - it picks up more and more until the end), so lemme know if you need some extra detail anywhere, I guess.


Remained a lonely, kissless virgin until senior year of highschool. Had a short, awkward relationship with a short, awkward girl. We were friends until we started dating, then all we really did was makeout and explore the glories of second base. Got oral once. Fingered her once. We broke up. Neither of us really cared.


I dated my now-girlfriend for a couple of years before she broke it off. It was kinda my fault, but also kinda hers. We were young - I was a couple of years into college, she was almost ready to graduate high school. It took me by surprise, though in retrospect there were a couple of warning signs (though not really a lot of them, but that's a different story). Got dumped. Got sad. Neither of us did anything until we hooked up half a year later and subsequently got back together. It was great. I had never really gotten over her. We took each other's virginity and remained the only people we had ever had sex with.


I became a bit of a social butterfly at this point, partially as a result of being single (she was my social crutch before the breakup, much less so afterwards - I didn't want to repeat my mistakes). I was in a class with this girl. We had to split into groups for a nighttime session of the class. We grouped up because we both already knew the other was in the top of the class. She invited me to this event later. I declined but offered to walk her to her car. We talked a while, a spent a while talking outside her car. I didn't flirt with her on purpose, not that I remember. I did tell her some pickup lines, but it was like ""I heard this really funny pickup line, it goes like this"". There was another one of those nighttime sessions, same thing happened, except she offered to give me a ride to my car (parked about a half mile away). I said sure, and I mentioned I had a girlfriend as part of the conversation. She seemed upset. Turns out she had developed a little crush on me and was embarrassed to think about kissing me and stuff. I told her she should go for it anyway. After a little while, she did. We made out a bit. We soon progressed to making out regularly for a few days before going to second and third base (she was waiting until marriage for sex, but anything besides sex was OK). I tried to cut if off. She was VERY upset. I (stupidly) agreed to keep it going until the end of the semester, about 5 weeks later. At first it was exciting, but it got tedious because she was kinda crazy. I didn't really feel bad, but I didn't really think about it. 


Fast forward about 8 months (a few months ago). My relationship is stronger than ever. In a short few months, I end up making out with a girl I work with, kissing a new friends' roommate (let's call the new friend Beatrice), meeting up with a girl who was sorta friends with me for the exclusive purpose of hooking up (we made out for a bit before she felt weird and wanted to go on a date). All of these women knew I had a girlfriend. They all thought it was OK with her (it wasn't. It's not. She'd be absolutely torn up if she ever found out, even about kissing). I told myself ""well,  I didn't have sex with any of them..."". A couple of months ago, I met a girl who was about to graduate and then go straight to graduate school in London. I liked her, quite a lot, and was upset that I had never talked to her before despite being in a couple of classes with her (let's call her Janet). We hit it off. She had a boyfriend who she still kinda loved despite the relationship falling apart. I still had my girlfriend. We made out. I spent the night at her place - a first. We were gonna fuck - I couldn't keep it up. Hung out two nights later. We fucked. It was great. I didn't feel bad at all. She thought my girlfriend was OK with it (I've since clarified that to her). We fucked a few more times, and she developed a little crush on me before she left.


I was surprised that the sex was so great. I've always believed that sex with someone you love is the best. It's hard to compare the two, but the fact that they're comparable kinda challenges that belief. Then again, Janet was a really special girl. I might have had a tiny little crush on her, too. I've never met a girl I would even consider dating since I met my girlfriend, not even my friends, except for Janet. So maybe that was it. Conveniently, an answer dropped into my lap. I was hanging out with a friend I ran into from high school. He was about to pick up a different friend from work. Let's call her Denise. Denise was somewhat attractive, with an interesting personality. Best of all, she was more than a little obvious in her advances and clearly into me. Please recall my above statement about being a kissless virgin. The attention was a little new to me, but I made a decision that wasn't rash at all. A few days later, I was at her place. She had a couple of drinks, I had none - I don't usually drink. Like at all. Never appealed to me (relevant later). 


We fucked. It was pretty great. She was really kinky, at least compared to what I was used to. Wanted to be hit - not just slapped in the face, but hit - choked, anal with no warning or lube, etc. I went along with it. No regret yet, except I was still wondering about my belief - is love important in sex? So far, I had great sex with my girlfriend, great sex with Janet, who's really one of a kind, and pretty great sex with Denise - but that could have just been the fact that she was an accurately self-described kinky slut. Ended up calling my ex while with my best friend, who comes down from Canada every six months or so. We were up late, around 5am, the night before he flew back. We decided to call her up. He ended up knocking out, we went and caught up. Ended up making and fucking. It was pretty awful for me. She enjoyed herself. It was better back when I liked her and we just made out.


We're coming to the end here, folks. Remember Beatrice? Over time, I had become really close friends with her. We're both engineering majors, and we intern for the same company run by a professor at our school. We were both on campus for the summer, as the internship was year-round and neither of us particularly cared to go home. Since she broke up with boyfriend earlier that year, she's had a LOT of male attention. Before she broke up with him, really. She flirted with some, went on a date or two with others, and some of them she kissed. She only had sex with one of her closer friends - the second guy she's ever had sex with - whom she subsequently started feeling some feelings for and broke off the arrangement. So. Somewhere in the back of my head, I knew I wanted to kiss this girl. Not have sex with her (or so I thought, but kiss her). So the end of the internship is approaching, and there's a grace period between the end of the internship and the start of school. I say ""we should invite some friends over and have a few drinks before we all start getting ready to go home."" She comments that I just wanna see them all get drunk and laugh at them - I hadn't even sipped a glass of wine in over a year - and I tell her that nah, we'll all get drunk. She's excited to have a drink with me. We get the drinks, have some friends over, it gets late, yadda yadda. I don't get drunk, but I get pretty close to it. We walk her friend back to her apartment, a couple of blocks away, and we're walking back and she's making sure I don't stumble and fall because I already stubbed my toe on the uneven sidewalk twice. We're less than a minute away when I asked her what she'd do if I kissed her. She said it was a bad idea, we probably shouldn't do it, we should - I cut her off and kissed her. It was amazing. Long story short, we eventually ended up at my place and had sex, and she spent the night. She knew my girlfriend was not OK with it. 


That brings me to today. There's a lot of detail that I left out (though I probably still included way too much). A cheater, with no regrets. My girlfriend doesn't know, and I never want her to find out. I love her. There's a big chance she'll be Mrs. Throwaway. But I still don't feel bad. I know I should. I don't condone cheating. I would have never, ever considered myself the cheating type, until I did it."

(Is that an entirely new area of fat logic? Am I a pioneer?) The first one was actually unintentional and climate induced, but there have been several others and the lesson remains unlearned. (Until now, I'd say if not for the fact that I've previously said until now.) I've won exactly zero of said competitions.


I grew up in Oklahoma. We have winter there, but it sticks to its appropriate months. I interned for a summer in Poughkeepsie NY. Great GREAT summer. Fantastic weather and I played in volleyball doubles tournaments every single weekend day that I was there. When I graduated I accepted a job there, super easy decision. Sign me up for 30 more years of that summer!

Then I moved there for real. It turns out winter in Poughkeepsie starts in September. Another fun fact: Winter in Poughkeepsie ends in April. There are four months that are not winter. Four months where there might be some daylight after you leave work. Four months in which to trick interns into thinking Poughkeepsie is habitable.

As winter wore on I would hold my hand near the warmth of my desk lamp, close my eyes and imagine I was somewhere else. Anywhere else. When I got home I would bundle up in the covers and shiver for an hour. It turns out that shivering burns fewer calories than going to the gym. I gained 10 pounds every winter. The summers were so short that I didn't lose those pounds. I was there 4 years and I gained 40 pounds.
 
I had always been thin/muscular, so pounds gained had always been the good I've-been-working-out pounds. I failed to realize that these pounds were different. When I hit 220 I was thinking I was Brian Urlacher.  
 
It's funny the way gradual fatties miss all the signs. I'd gone from buying 31 waist jeans to buying 36s, but I missed that damned obvious sign because each increase I'd think that this new brand is sized differently or that my tastes were trending toward a more relaxed fit. (You only get to use that excuse for one size increase, but I just kept cashing it in anyway.) I was able to delay the 34 to 35 move because I'd found some pants that had this sweet expandable waist. I bought three of those because I knew I was a 34, but only that brand seemed to fit well in 34.
 
That's right, I bought three pairs of what are essentially male maternity pants and did not realize I was being fat.
 
I can't remember the moment that I figured out I was fat, but I'm certain it was a ""Holy Shitballs!!"" moment. But where most people would see a doughy mass of what-happened, I saw a doughy mass of opportunity!  
 
TrimSpa had an upcoming competition. Supposedly everybody would spend 8 weeks dieseling up taking TrimSpa and TrimSpa would select a winner based on before and after pictures. I knew I had an ace in the hole because my fatness was both recent and Poughkeepsie-induced. I would just have to bundle up a little, toughen up and work out despite Poughkeepsie. I'd be able to drop all that mess with a quickness. I had every intention of winning that competition and zero intention of taking any TrimSpa. I'd just work out like crazy but say it was the TrimSpa that did it for the cash prize. Win win!
 
It turns out it was still cold in Poughkeepsie throughout the eight weeks. When it was time to send in my after pictures, I was three pounds fatter than my before picture. Apparently the not working out and not taking TrimSpa plan was extra ineffective.  
 
Still I was undaunted. There would be at least four weeks between my submitting after pictures and the time that they would actually meet me. And these four weeks would be warmish, so actually being thin when they met me in person was a possibility. (In my overly optimistic mind, ""possibilities"" and ""imminent outcomes"" are indistinguishable.) I just had to get to the point of them meeting the thin me. Three pounds fatter after pictures weren't going to make that happen.
 
I bought some packing tape and I asked my then girlfriend to come over. The plan was to tape all of my fat behind me. Packing tape, it turns out, adheres to fat people just as well as it does to shipping boxes. She stuck the first strip dead center in my love handle, tugged it behind me and stuck the other end of the strip to my back. She looked me over and was skeptical.
 
""Now you just have a dent.""

""We have more tape.  Just keep targeting the peaks.""
 
Each new strip of tape would create two new peaks, but the two new peaks were smaller than the single monster peak they'd replaced. Several strips later I had a handle-less side and a well handled other side. Amy was now a believer.
 
""Man.  Everybody should wear tape ALL THE TIME!""
 
We got to work on the other side, taking care that the tape enhancement was symmetrical. Amy took the front picture. While she did this, I wondered if I'd feel guilty peddling TrimSpa when it was really the next four weeks of running that would have been my secret. (Naaaaah!)
 
We now had to prepare for the back picture. This time I was able to see the tape-pressed mass collecting in front of me as Amy pulled my love handles forward and taped them in place. Seeing one's own fat folded and refolded and taped on top of itself is every bit as unflattering as you'd think. It sounds depressing, but I was of the ""see you later, sucker"" frame of mind.
 
We sent in the pics.  
 
I never heard from TrimSpa.  
 
I can't decide which of the following scenarios is the most likely:

A)  ""This guy has obviously lost a lot of his love handles, but why is everything else still fat? Like his face!""

B)  ""We have another submission involving tape."" ""Chuck it.""

C)  I just lost to people who had some quality results.  
 
In the end it's a good thing I never heard from them. I was still fat four weeks later. 

I stayed miserable and increasingly fat the whole time I was in Poughkeepsie. Why did I stay so long in a place I obviously hated? Honestly, I forgot what it was like to not live somewhere shitty. I accidentally corrected that when another girl and I visited a mutual friend in Richmond. When I got to Richmond my thought was, ""People get to live this life!? ALL THE TIME??"". If you've ever been to Richmond, you know that my having *that* reaction to Richmond is Reason 10,000 that Poughkeepsie sucks.

When I moved to Raleigh I didn't decide to lose weight or consciously change anything. I just lived my life in a less shitty place, a place where going outside was feasible, and boom there was 30 pounds less of me. 

If you're careful with the math, you'll note I was still lugging around 10 pounds of I've-lived-in-Poughkeepsie. Losing those last 10 back took legit focused effort. Once I had abs again, I said to myself, ""never again!"". And I really meant it! If you've never been fat, you probably *think* you're grateful for being thin. But once you've encased yourself in 40 pounds of inability and then come out the other side you have a whole new magnitude of appreciation. 

Enter Winter 2014. It was probably in actuality light by Poughkeepsie standards, but my suck-meter has returned to a normal setting so this winter off the charts sucked in my view. The difference versus that first time is this time I actually saw myself expanding. Here's the twisted part. I said to myself, ""I'm back at 220 for free. If I just get a little fatter I can win my gym's before/after competition that they'll start with the new year.""  

I didn't eat more or move less on purpose. I just didn't freak out and react early (say, 210 early) like I should've.

I got up to 236 before I realized this winter wasn't playing around. 

&gt;DO NOT BE ME!!!!!

I got to where I could only wear a single pair of pants. A tremendously oversized pair that somebody had years earlier given me as a gift without knowing my size.

Fun fact: MY GYM DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A BEFORE/AFTER COMPETITION THIS YEAR!

Winter eventually subsided but it turns out being 7 years older makes it hard to lose the el bees. I'm at 220 now and summer is rapidly coming to a close. But I'm running now. And I'm actually experiencing hunger at times throughout the day.

Guys, I'm gonna make it."

Mechanically the owner says the bike idles but won't run which he states is a carburetor issue. I haven't worked on a bike before but I'm great with tools and machines so I shouldn't have much trouble cleaning out the carb and maybe refurbishing it if necessary.

The look isn't great; the owner did not achieve the street fighter look, but I do like the street fighter look and the cafe styles so I can work with the missing fairings. Fairings for the tail, a new headlight, new gauges, and maybe a handlebar would solve all the issues i have with its looks. Estimate cost: 400?

**Background**: He’s Vietnamese/Chinese, and I’m Filipino/White. We started out as online gaming friends (2006), became best friends, and started dating towards the end of our college career (2011-present). In order to close the distance, I decided to move and do my internship in his state. Because I had absolutely no money at the time, I asked his mom a year in advance if I could stay at their house for a couple months, then move out afterward. We’d remind her every 2-3 months, her reply always being that she’d think about it. When we finally asked her for an answer a month before I was supposed to move, she acted like she never knew about us planning something this big. Long story short, living in his parents’ house brought along a lot of drama/misunderstanding because of the language barrier and culture difference. My boyfriend was caught in the middle of all this while trying to finish up his last semester of college, and became increasingly depressed over being the “middle man”. He was basically the translator/interpreter between his mom and me. He’d try to explain to his mom the reasoning behind my thought processes and actions (not that I’m trying to start shit – it’s usually from his mom’s end), and his mom would just continue to be stubborn and unreasonable. Her excuses were basically defaulting to Vietnamese culture/traditional Catholic values. Eventually, after both of us got super angry at her for indirectly lashing out at me (she was arguing with my boyfriend, but it was directed towards me), she changed for the better. (I also moved out after living there for 6 months when I got my first job after my internship. So by the time this argument happened, I was already moved out and just visiting their house like I usually do.)


**Issue**: Ever since I moved out of Aaron’s house, I’ve basically been living from paycheck to paycheck in bad housing for almost two years.  (Where I live is notorious for having overpriced rooming/housing.) I had a good job starting out, but my workplace lost a lot of money on the project I was assigned to, so they laid off a lot of people. I had to take the first thing I could get, so I went to reliving my days as a barista. After about nine months, I was able to get a job as a receptionist with somewhat better pay, but my hours there have been steadily declining ever since I got the job. (There are two receptionists who have been getting the bulk of them out of the four of us.) 


The place I’m currently living in is the epitome of a malfunctioning house with subhuman conditions. It’s Aaron’s friend’s house (he’s more or less the landlord), but doesn’t do anything and is always making messes that the rest of the roommates have to clean up. My other roommate (Jake) and I are fed up with having to maintain the somewhat livable conditions of the house when our “landlord” is prioritizing buying a remote-controlled car over fixing the fridge/buying a new one (in addition to a plethora of other malfunctioning things).  Jake’s girlfriend (Roxy) just got her first job in our area, so she proposed that the three of us move out and find a place for us to live together. She also asked if Aaron wanted to move out with us, too. I was so ecstatic upon hearing this because it meant that Aaron’s and my relationship would finally make some progress. When I asked Aaron if he’d like to move in with us, he hesitantly agreed. But the more we talked about moving in together, the happier and more excited we both were.


About a week into this decision, Roxy and I started looking for potential places to move into and visit them. It was about this time that Aaron told me one night when I came over to his place that he did a lot of thinking, and decided that he wouldn’t move in with us and save up for a down payment on a house instead. He said he did all the calculations, told his parents about his potential investment and they decided to also financially back him up on this. His reasoning for not moving out of his parents’ place is because he’s fortunate enough to have his job near where he lives. And because the three of us are still going to relatively be in the same area, he doesn’t see a point in moving out to pay rent in the same area. Logistically, I totally understand this, and said that it was okay. I asked him when he thinks that he’ll be ready to buy a house, and he said in about five years.


Here’s my problem with this situation: in five years, we’re going to be 30 years old. We’ll have been living apart this whole time with no progress in our relationship. I voiced my emotional concerns to him about this investment, and I felt downplayed when he responded about my concerns (i.e. “Aw, you’re so cute.”). We’ve been dating for 3.5 years, and I’m supposed to wait another 5 years in order for anything to happen to us?  I told him how I felt like he’s only been focusing on how he’s going to progress through **his** own life instead of focusing on **us** progressing together. I also asked him when we’re going to get married if he decides to solely focus on saving up for a house. His reply was that he doesn’t see himself getting married right now. (Of course you’re not ready RIGHT NOW, neither am I!) He then changed his answer later on to ~27-28 years old, but I think it was only to pacify me. When we had a second discussion about marriage, he told me that he felt that it was weird to have a party dedicated solely to us about something that isn’t even a big deal. I told him that marriage isn’t just about the fanfare – it’s about starting a new life together as husband and wife, and celebrating the joining of two families. For us both being Catholic, I find it surprising that his views on marriage are so uninformed. So much can happen in five years, and I feel like he thinks I’m just supposed to “wait this out” with not much of a promise of us becoming closer in our relationship. I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much for this person (moving and living in poverty in order to maintain our relationship), but he just doesn’t see it. He has a comfortable home, a way higher paying job compared to me right now, and minimal bills to pay. I plan on discussing this issue with him again when we have more time to ourselves on our upcoming vacation. But I don’t know how to approach this anymore. Is there something that I haven’t communicated clearly, am I wrong to even continue this discussion?


---   
**TL;DR**: I moved to my boyfriend’s state to close our LDR and start a new life with him there. I haven’t been faring well financially. My roommates and I decided to move out of the current place we’re living in to somewhere better and invited my boyfriend to move with us. He initially agreed, but declined soon after to save up for a house instead and continue living at his parents’ house. As far as I can tell, there is no prospect of marriage in sight on his end in addition to saving up for this house. I’ve told him my emotional concerns on his investment and got downplayed. How do I proceed from here?

Decision due by EOD today.,ActLikeAnAdult,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2c9m6c/need_some_advice_about_choosing_between_job/,"Hey r/jobs, just curious what you think about these two job offers.

Background on me: one year marketing/PR experience, one year intern experience at a PR and Ad agency. I've always wanted to go into advertising and agency work has always been my goal. 

**JOB 1:**

* Account Coordinator position at an Advertising/Marketing/PR agency
* Salary 1,000 below what I was requesting
* High profile clients
* 100% health/vision
* 401K matching
* Opportunity to be promoted quickly
* Free parking
* Longer hours
* Larger company (60 or so)

**JOB 2**

* PR and Social Media at a growing tech company
* Salary $3,000 higher than Job 1
* 100% Health/Dental/Vision
* Flexible Hours
* 4-6 weeks PTO
* 401K Matching
* Free parking or subway (I live walkable to a subway station in my city)
* 5 week sabbatical after 5 years
* 5 person marketing team, each person has a different function

I guess I love the benefits and salary at job 2, but I feel like I would be operating in a vacuum and have no one to learn from. I'm wary of the longer hours/harder work/driving requirement and salary of job 1, but as I'm just starting out in my career, I feel like working at an agency and being able to learn from those around me doing the same thing would really help me grow and develop.

Thoughts?"

After dropping out a year ago and doing nothing with my life since then, I finally got serious about job hunting. I had 1 interview left with my dream company but for some reason accepted the very first offer I received, from my boss when I was an intern at uni.

It sounded really cool when he described it to me. I would be learning embedded development, maintaining a cloud-based ASP.NET software service, and some misc. tasks. Unlimited vacation and the ability to telecommute sounded incredible, but now I realize that as a small company there is no way to take a long vacation since we're always busy, and I feel really awkward working from home since no one else seems to really do it.

Our embedded software uses Rabbit microcontrollers, and while I'm trying to keep an open mind, I am pretty sure that Dynamic C is a huge piece of shit and we're dealing with obscure hardware that has a dying community for support. I have no clue what i am doing, no hardware resources to help debug programs, and the only other embedded developer is on another continent so it's really hard to get help.

I don't really get to write much of the ASP.NET application. I am basically patching it up into a semi-passable state after it gets written by some outsourced programmers in India. They have to either be fucking with us or trying to rip us off; they write absolute garbage. I discovered our software saves passwords in plain text and is vulnerable to SQL injection, and no one seemed greatly concerned (we sell this stuff to government agencies). There isn't enough time to rewrite it, I just get to spend all day wrangling with half-assed code.

I feel no motivation whatsoever. Everything is so frustrating to deal with that I don't care to do my best work. My girlfriend thinks that I will get better assignments as I prove myself, but I don't know if I can take it. I can't even get my employer to buy me Visual Studio, I have to download the Express edition.

Since my boss also was my supervisor at my internship, if I walk away from this job I will have no references. I didn't finish my degree and do not have a portfolio, so I feel like I would totally burn myself if I walk off this job.My contract specifies I need to give a month's notice before leaving, but I already feel like I'm losing my mind. Sometimes when my alarm goes off in the morning I just start crying.

I don't really have any money to survive being without a job if I quit and try to find a better job. But what can I do? Should I just tough it out? Or is it worth the hardship to find a new job? Maybe I'm just a whiny bitch and have too high of expectations for my employers?

I don't really know what I am asking for or expecting to hear, guess I just needed to get that off my chest. Sorry if I wasted your time."

My backup was the CSE department for the same school but in a different location (much less competitive), because that's what my advisors suggested. But I was rejected from there too. 


My second backup was the informatics program, which I haven't heard from yet. But now I'm a little worried about that one too. 


So far what I'm thinking is that l should just major in math because it's an open major. 


The reason why I'm being rejected I assume is my calculus grades from freshman year ~2.5 avg. My CSE grades are very good though, with an average of 3.8. 


What I'm wondering is if continuing with the math route is a good idea (especially considering I'm apparently really bad at math). And how should I approach recruiters, especially at job fairs, about not being in the cse department but wanting an internship in software development? My biggest concern is being ignored by these recruiters and not learning enough cse in college. 


Any advice would be great. Thank you! 


EDIT: I got accepted in the Informatics program at my school! I think I will end up following that path for the next 2 years and try my hardest to network and get good interviews, hoping that I am not turned away just because of my major. I guess my biggest question at this point is how to approach recruiters about not being in cse when I am actively pursing a job in software development. Thank you all for the advice! "
2c9v8j,1,2014-07-31,I'm in love with a close friend,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2c9v8j/im_in_love_with_a_close_friend/,"I have a close friend, we'll call her Sarah. I met Sarah one summer between semesters in college. She was in the city I was living in for an internship. We became very close that summer, her and I, and her and all of my friends as well. I had always found her attractive, and I was pretty sure she found me attractive as well, but I was semi-seeing someone else, and she had just gotten out of a serious relationship, so I didn't want to compromise our friendship which I so very much enjoyed.

There was one night where she was opening up to me about her ex. She was crying, and after I had comforted her she asked me if we could, ""just make out once, off the record."" I said no because I didn't want to take advantage of her, but I have been thinking about that night for nearly 5 years now.

After that summer she left and went back to her state on the other side of the country. We stayed in touch, and have spoken nearly every day for the past 5 years. We've been there for one another through crises, and relationships, happiness, etc. Even though I haven't actually seen her in so long, I consider one of my closest friends.

She's been in a relationship with a guy for a year now, and they live together, but things have been very rocky. So two weeks ago she tells me she's going to fly to my city to take her mind off things. The prospect of this excited and terrified me, just because it had been so long since I'd actually seen her.

So a week ago she arrives, and she has been staying with me. We've shared my bed but have not hooked up. Everything we've ever had is still there, the same affection, the same closeness. I can't look at her without feeling the deepest kind of warmth and happiness, and she always smiles she catches me just kind of looking at her and it's all I can do not to just grab her and kiss her and tell her I love her, and I have done that a couple of times sans the kissing. 

Two days ago her boyfriend broke up with her remotely and moved his stuff out of their house. She's been a mess and I have been there for her in every way I can. Tonight is her last night with me, and I don't ever want her to leave. I wish she would just move in with me now honestly. 

My problem is that I don't want to tell her how I feel when she's in such an emotionally vulnerable position. I don't think it's fair. On top of that she's got a job on the other side of the country that she's going back to tomorrow, and if I spill the beans and she reciprocates, there won't be any going back for me. I won't be able to talk to her and not see her and want to be with her.

I don't know if I should just spend my last night with her platonically and enjoy her company or if I should tell her how I feel. She's been crying periodically, and I just think it would be selfish of me to put that on her right now. But I also don't know when I'll get another opportunity.

Thanks if you read. Just needed to type that out SOMEWHERE. Fucking hell."

A couple weeks into freshman year after doing homework together and hanging out with our group of friends for a little, I decided to ask her to go to the movies via text message (Yes I know now that was a horrible idea, never have dated anyone), but she declined/ didn't answer and we didn't talk or hang out for a week. But we were lab partners in a class so of course we had to see eachother every week, so the awkwardness faded and by the end of the semester we were really good friends, going to sporting events with a few other friends, eating lunch with her on a weekly basis after lab etc. 

Second semester was the same, still just really good friends, I always heard her say to people she didn't want a relationship now so I never bothered bringing it up again. By the end of freshman year and heading into the summer I liked another girl (19/f) and she started dating another guy (20/m). Despite liking/being with different people we skyped a few times that summer due a one of us being from MA and the other VA. 

In the first semester of sophomore year I was still going after the other girl and she was still dating that guy, but we continued to hang out, go to sporting games, watch movies, and go to lunch together among other things. During the second semester I stopped talking with the other girl and she had broken up with her boyfriend. Going into this summer I had gotten an internship very close to where she was from and I took it because it was the only one I had gotten. So this summer we've hung often, I've been to her house for dinner with her family, went to a baseball game with her and her family and went bowling with her, to name a few.  And now I really like her again, I would tell but there's some things holding me back. She more into guys who play sports and are kind of dumb, I don't play sports in school and I'm not dumb being an engineering major. The other thing is that we are both really good friends with this other girl (20/f). She has been best friends with this girl since high school and i met this other girl through her and we have become very good friends. So I'm worried that if I tell her that I like her and she doesn't feel the same way/ give me a chance I will not only lose a best friend, but also another really good friend.

What do you guys think I should do?

There is so much stress in my life right now and I feel like my head is about to explode from holding this all in. 

* My husband just had testicle surgery to fix a hydrocele and is now incapacitated, in tons of pain. He has missed 4 days of work so far which he isn't getting paid for, and our hospital bill is several thousand dollars despite us having insurance. 

* We are also in the process of moving, which comes with its own set of stressors. Because of the surgery, husband can't lift anything over 10lbs for a month. This leaves me with the few nice friends I have here who can help, in addition to maybe a moving company if we can afford one.

* I am starting an internship in a few weeks, as part of finishing my Master's degree. For this internship, I go out to different sites in the community, one of which is 2 hours away. This is not as stressful as the other things, but is still something new and different, which adds to the stress. 

* My own health is crappy. I have chronic vertigo which flares up when I get stressed, tired, or do too much physical exertion. Due to the circumstances of my life lately, I've been dealing with all three triggers on a daily basis. I couldn't even watch Arrested Development last night because when they talked about Lucille II's vertigo I had a panic attack. I wish my situation were as comical as hers.

* My very elderly dog, whom I've had since she was 6 weeks old, is losing weight, shedding too much, and is not eating. I suspect she is also stressed out, which is making me feel guilty as well as stressed. 

* My cat (who died last July) is buried in our backyard, but needs to be exhumed and cremated before we move. There is a company who provides a service where they will come pick up your animal and cremate them, but I still have to dig her up, which is very emotional. Thankfully, a friend has offered to help with this (my husband wants no part of it), so I won't be doing it alone.

That's about it. I already feel better just typing it all out. Thanks for reading. If you'd like to share your favorite de-stress tips with me I would greatly appreciate it!

2c9z13,1,2014-07-31,Starting a temporary LDR in my LTR -- tips/advice?,tyranus89,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/2c9z13/starting_a_temporary_ldr_in_my_ltr_tipsadvice/,"BACKGROUND

Dating for 3 years, I've been TRP for about a year. Attraction is no issue. 

She's attractive -- trying to be as unbiased as possible, she's an 8. There have been several situations where random guys have told me my girlfriend was the hottest girl in the room. She's never acted in a way that has led me to suspect foul play (again, she's very attracted to me); there are plenty examples of her spurning other men's advances when I'm not there, confirmed from other parties as well as her bragging to me that she loves turning down guys and that her boyfriend is awesome.

SCENARIO

She has accepted an internship at a university about 6 hours away, the duration of which is 4 months. The internship is within the home events (athletics) department -- basically she makes sure all of the varsity games for all of the sports run smoothly. This is something she did in university here at home, greatly enjoyed it and sees it as a career option. This position is higher up compared to what she did and would be fantastic experience, and so I urged her to go for it. She said ""the only thing I'll miss is you.""

PREPARATION

My preparation strategy has been amused mastery, dread and an overall lack of care. 

When we're out with friends, and someone asks ""omg r u gunna miss her???"" while we're together, I always respond with a shrug and say, ""I mean, a bit, but it's not for a long time and we're well within visiting distance."" Not outright saying ""no"", which isn't good at this stage in the relationship, but also not fawning and saying ""omg of course I'll think about and text her all the time every day until she's back"".

Even the fact that I first suggested she apply for and take this internship I believe is benefiting my situation: that I don't care if she goes, I don't NEED her to stay. 

Amused mastery comes into play when it's just us. When we're out on a date and she says ""I'm really gunna miss times like these"", I laugh and say ""stop it. It's not even long enough to warrant that"". Or agree and amplify, ""yeah, wow I'll have to get really good at talking to myself all day for four WHOLE months, right?""

Standard dread game: not hovering beside her while we're out at bars, talking to new and different people (girls), not inviting her to my band's shows (where she knows I get a lot of female attention), etc. 

EXECUTION

Just to be clear before we move on, I'm not worried about anything, she's never given reason to worry in the past and has even given plenty of reason to believe nothing will happen. But, she's an attractive girl moving to a new city, exciting new job, lots of new people in a young and male-dominated environment. TRP has taught me to never be unprepared and to trust but take precautions/verify etc. 

So, my plans thus far are as follows. 

1) **Continue the dread.** Post pictures on Instagram (which I don't use too often but she checks constantly) of me with other girls having good times, but maintaining plausible deniability (ie., not pics of me in a girls basement alone, but in a public place such as a bar). Talking about the girls at work and what we're up to, casually.

2) **Hard self-improvement.** Developing my business, hustling at work, seeing even bigger physical gains and achieving more with the band. Showing that although I accomplish a lot aready, I'm twice as productive when she's not around -- I don't spend my time sulking and wishing she was there to act as my blanky. This is also soft dread -- showing that I can increase my attraction at a whim, and that I'd be more than ok without her, not just surviving but thriving. 

3) **Following the Golden Ratio.** Not being the first to initiate contact, giving 2/3 of the responses she gives, giving 2/3s of the love, intensity and excitement, etc. 

YOUR TURN -- ADVICE? TIPS? ANALYSIS?

Let me know if you need more background/info in any area. Again, I'm not worried about anything, it's just preventative maintenance, if you will. I plan on doing a whole field report come December, when she's been back for a while, as well as updates along the way. "

I got a summer job at a camp in the mountains washing dishes. Long story short, I hated it so much that I continued to break down crying to my supportive (but possibly *too* supportive) parents consecutive nights in a row on the payphone until I finally threw in the towel after 3 weeks. None of my co-workers had any clues that I was leaving, I left cold turkey.

Fast forward to the present, I finally graduated college and after 2 months of searching and applying, I finally settled on a less than ideal but still potentially enjoyable job at an IT consulting company in my 2nd best choice for a location. I will be moving there in less than 2 weeks.

However, I am afraid this will be a repeat of that camp job. I will be on a paid trial period for 2 weeks as a sort of interactive interview to see if they like me or not. Not only am I afraid they won't like me, but I'm also afraid I will hate the job because I've had an internship in an IT position before. However, if I hate the job, I don't have a backup plan at this point, so I'm pretty much forced to take the job assuming they like me.

All this on top of moving to a new location and being generally unconfident in my skills and wondering if computer science was even the right field for me (I used to be focused on music/art and I'm feeling very deprived from creative outlets).

Any reassuring words would help."

I love the culture, I love the office, I love the people I work with- even the ones that I have only met through IRC. Full-time employees have given me positive feedback about my work here, and I have enjoyed most of my time in the office. I even enjoy working out of the office- on weekends, evenings, it's just a place that has kept me really excited about what I'm working on.

My company doesn't traditionally offer remote, school-year internships, but there have been exceptions. I know most of the other interns I've talked to aren't interested in having a school-year internship, but I have spent the last two years doing internships alongside school, and I know it helps me learn and apply my skills immensely. Also, I'm a rising Senior and I have no CS classes anymore, I will have plenty of time to dedicate to work.

I would do any role they would ask of me, maintenance, testing, debugging, honestly, anything. I would work whatever hours they want, document all of my code thoroughly, participate in all of the meetings.

I don't know how to approach the topic. Every other internship I've had has approached me about continuing on. With two weeks left to go, I'm worried that this might just not happen. In which case, I need to resume interviewing for positions for the Fall.

Should I move on?

P.S. Please don't leave me comments telling me to enjoy or focus on my education. I am an intelligent, hard worker but I have several learning disabilities that have made school difficult and miserable, and the industry is my preferred way of learning.

&gt; Me, vioLynn_94; 5' 9"", 170 lbs (working on it) screenwriting/French student at a West Coast university. Working my ass off this summer to save money for a car (hopefully) this fall.


&gt;Alliecat; 5' 6"", 140 lbs of sunshine and happiness. She's in DC for an internship this summer (I miss her dearly), and she is the one who is letting Hambelina sublease this summer---she was unaware of her hamplanet status at the time as it was all done over phone and email.


&gt; For the love of the sweet tangy lawd, never be Hambelina. 40-something, 5' 9"", close 300 lbs of flab, obnoxiously ill-fitted ballerina garb, and croissant-annihilating ability.


This happened a few weeks ago on a Monday. I had been spending the weekend at my boyfriend's place because his roommate was gone &amp; I didn't really like staying in such a spacious apartment alone---Hambelina only leaves her beetus cave for more beetus, or to go see her ""boyfriend"" ^gag , and that weekend she apparently went to ""stay with him,"" though I'm realizing later that was most likely a lie. I was at work minding my business, when I get a text from Alliecat.

&gt; A: hey, is the power working?

&gt; Me: I'm at work, but it's fine as far as I know...why?

&gt; A: Hambelina texted me that she can't get the TV to turn on, and that the AC isn't working either.

Weird...I know everyone's been paying their bills like they should ^^for^once , otherwise I would've been receiving notices.

&gt; Me: Well, as far as I know everything's in order...have you tried calling Shitty Apartment Management?

&gt; A: Yeah, they're gonna call me back. Also, Hambelina has been saying there's a bug problem? She saw some roaches....idk I'll get back to you.

So I went back to work...kinda confused about and dreading the whole situation.

Later, I got a text from Alliecat. This doesn't have much to do with the story, but what happened is that all 6 of us (my normal roommates and I) were under the impression that electricity was a covered amenity in our rent, as we were all told this upon moving in. Basically, we had a bill going back to August 2013 because of this misunderstanding---never had received a bill (not even in the prior tenant's name, because we would occasionally get them for other utilities) or a notice, and they just shut off the power. Fan-fucking-tastic.

I got off work at 6:30 and knew I'd have to throw away everything in the fridge---didn't want flies or ants getting in there for a whole other problem to deal with. Because like most problems with my roommates/the apartment, unless Alliecat is there too, I'm the only one who deals with them.

Dear fucking lord. Guys. I don't...I can't....I just....the horror that laid before my eyes. I'm going to use this same sound I used in my last story [because it's exactly what played through my head](http://www.freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/119954/) --- I personally cannot stand a mess, because growing up my mom's house always looked like a shithole and no matter how much or how often I cleaned, it'd be the back to the way it had been within a few days. My mom would blame me for losing my things when she would take them and just throw them in a pile or just throw them away, so I can't stand much of a mess. So when I come back and see my kitchen [like this, only with more random food scraps all over the counter, trash spilled on the floor, and flies/ants/roaches EVERYWHERE](http://blog.cityparckeller.com/files/2011/01/22.jpg)---oh, also in the pitch black darkness since we had no power----I almost threw up. I have worked at McDonald's where I had to clean shit off the walls (no exaggeration), volunteered in nursing homes, and volunteered to help a physical therapist with special needs children that would often have ""accidents"" on our watch---not much fazes me anymore. But Jesus Christ I'd be lying if said I didn't almost start crying when I walked in.

How did it get this bad?! I was gone for a WEEKEND, and when I left the kitchen was SPOTLESS----no trash, no dishes in the sink, there sure as HELL weren't fucking scraps of chinese takeout/fried chicken/etc on the counter. The ONLY person staying here at the moment besides me was Hambelina----c'mon, it had been 3 days, it couldn't have gotten THAT bad....could it?

I didn't have time for that, I needed to get rid of the food that was clearly supplying the flies/ants/roaches with ammo. I decided to start with the fridge----grabbed my cleaner, and since apparently Hambelina used all 3 of my paper towel rolls for something other than cleaning, I used Kleenex and toilet paper (I just wanted that mess gone, didn't want to walk to the CVS for more paper towels until I had gotten the bulk of the mess taken care of). With flies and ants going everywhere, and the occasional roach on the floor, I used my iPhone as my only source of light to clean the fridge. Most of it wasn't too bad---but I noticed there was stuff in the back of the fridge I hadn't seen before. Gallons of milk that were 2 months expired, tons of takeout with mold grown all over it, some random red-orange shit that had coagulated all over the bottom of the fridge (I think it was sweet &amp; sour sauce or something)...none of this was mine. Absolutely none. I grabbed a trash bag, held my breath, and threw it all out before I could think about it...and then I met the first true bane of my evening.

A drawer. In our fridge. Mind you, when Hambelina moved in, we labeled whose shelves/drawers were whose so that there would be no food confusion (that was mostly my initiative to be honest)----I remember Hambelina saying how she was going ""raw"" and going to make ""really healthy smoothies! I'll be looking *soooooooooo* sexy, better not bring your boyfriend around here^tee^mother^fucking^hee !"" 

Well, as you can guess, that got about as far as a trip to the grocery store...further than I anticipated, to be honest. But she still bought the makings for raw smoothies... *I wonder what happened to all those fruits and vegetables* ... well, they ended up in this fucking drawer. **For 2 1/2 months.** I....dear god. I normally have a pretty good way with words, but I don't even know how to describe this. If you're brave enough, it was a drawer filled with shit like [this](http://www.colourbox.com/preview/2088616-1639-close-up-of-mouldy-strawberries.jpg), [this](http://blogs.haverford.edu/amongfriends/files/2009/03/moldy_nectarines7.jpg?file=2009/03/moldy_nectarines7.jpg), a much less photogenic version of [this](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/mold-tomatoes-8734076.jpg)...it was a nightmare. To make it worse, there was this brown-black liquidy sludge at least 3 cm high on the bottom---didn't know what made it, didn't know how long it had been there, I just needed to clean it before I threw up.

Sweating, flies and ants going everywhere, my sad little iPhone providing a narrow stream of light so as to not overwhelm my senses with horror, and already 3 trash bags into cleaning this travesty, I was in no mood to put up with anyone's shit. From stage right, enter Hambelina.

&gt; H: What are you doing?!

&gt; Me: Cleaning up **your** fucking mess!

&gt; H: Oh, sure. Blame it on me. You're just another one of those valley girl princesses who can't do anything on their own---just because I'm older than you doesn't make me your fucking mother!

&gt; Me: **THIS IS THE DRAWER WITH YOUR NAME ON IT! THESE ARE YOUR FUCKING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES YOU LET SIT THERE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T USE THEM FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS!!**

&gt; H: I'm not going to tolerate this kind of verbal abuse. You clearly aren't even responsible enough to pay your own bills, I had to sit here all day without AC and only watch TV on my laptop! The screen is *so* small---you don't even get it.

*Mind you: whenever I see this cow at our apartment, all she does is eat takeout or watch TV. I have never seen her leave for any kind of work or read any kind of books to suggest she's taking summer/online courses...I have no idea what the fuck this bitch does all day, or how she pays her rent. In case you didn't read my last story, my apartment complex is mostly if not completely housed by college students since we're right across the street from the university, so I also don't know why she chose to live here with us ""irresponsible, immature 20-somethings.""*

After Hambelina had her ""outburst,"" she went into her room, grabbed her backpack, and just left me there with her mess. It took me 4 hours, 6 full trash bags, and almost 2 bottles of cleaner to get it into a remotely acceptable state. The only things of mine I threw away were some soymilk, peanut butter, jelly, and eggs. The rest of the fridge (which was full when I got home, mind you) was Hambelina's...along with the sink filled to the brim with dishes, some still with food scraps on/in them. 

Boyfriend picked me up that night around 11 when I finished so we could play Skyrim, eat some apples and peanut butter, and forget about the horrors I witnessed.

Edit: An update--I haven't even seen Hambelina since this Thursday, so I've had to postpone my revenge until she's back. Should be this week, and I will post a story on what happens once I'm able to get my Claire Underwood on."

I studied a bit of python this summer and I haven't found something this enjoyable and challenging since starting to play the guitar in high school. I am a semester away from entering the business school but I'm just in it for the money, it doesn't interest me very much. 


A few questions to current and former computer science majors:


-What classes do I need to complete in order to get an internship?

-What do technology companies look for in interns/employees?

-What clubs, organizations, or fraternities exist that are focused on computer science majors?

-What is your opinion on the quality of the program here at MSU?

-Any advice, recommendations, or comments?
