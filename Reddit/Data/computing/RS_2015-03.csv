Let me start by saying this is a throwaway account, because I have some people whom I'd rather not knowing about this post.

I need your help and your advice! I'll try to be brief while giving you the biggest picture possible:

Last year I ""re-met"" a guy I dated almost a decade ago, we did some small talk on facebook and decided it would be fun to hang out after all these years... well it was a bad case of love at first sign, not intended by any of us, especially because he lived with his girlfriend of a few years and friends. We had a rough path after that, everyone involved did, but now we're happily together and we love each other beyond words. You probably are now thinking he is a scumbag.. but hey, remember this is a short version of the facts, I don't want to bore you with all the details. He actually is the most caring, loving, sweet guy I ever met.. we always talk about stuff and try to solve our problems as soon as they appear, communication is key for us, and that's amazing to have. That guy is the man I want to marry some day and have by my side until we're old and grumpy (and I'm almost crying just writing that).

Anyway, the hardest part is happening right now, I'm desperate for him and I don't know what to do. He is trying his best to get his life together.. he was previously working in a tattoo parlour where he spent all day, no regular pay as a shop manager, only commissions from the jobs he got. So he had to left to get a ""real"" job with a regular paycheck, in order to be able to pay his rent and bills. He got a job at a call center, which he hates but does well; they won't pay him until the end of March and will barely cover the February rent+bills - and that was the best offer we got so far.

To get things worse, he had to invest money in basic appliances that his ex got to keep and his computer died two months ago. His job hunting is mostly through his smartphone and in person, so a lot of times I help him with that part.

At the moment he is completely depressed, I try my best to help him and keep him motivated everyday and we have amazing moments together, even with this crappy scenario.. I guess you could say we find a lot of happiness in eachother to get us through. It's hard to see the man you love almost starving so he can get the bus tomorrow to work.. it hurts me so bad that he lost about 10kg and it's so skinny right now because he just don't have the money to eat healthy and is so stressed. At the moment I run everyday to meet him, be sure he has something to eat, share my meals when I can meet him at our lunch breaks; but I can't help him all the way, I don't have that much money (I'm only getting my first real paycheck, as a full time intern, in March) - and he would never let me do so, money-wise. He is a strong guy, going through some of the worst times of his life, but I know he is getting tired of life, and I can't blame him.

So, dear redditors, I desperately thought about doing a fundraising and thought about Reddit. BUT WAIT, hear me out: 
FIRST: I do think it sounds selfish as fuck, to raise money to help my boyfriend pay his rent and get through the next month, I admit it; 
SECOND: On the other hand, the amount needed would be between 400€/500€, It's not a super huge number.. but I wouldn't feel good about just asking for the money too. 
So I'm thinking, if there would be anyone interested to help in exchange for something I have or could make - like a portrait (I used to make charcoal ones when I was at art school); or a photo restoration (I make those at work sometimes); or even a painted shirt.. what do you think? And any ideas about raising the money ASAP? 

Case you're wondering: help from family is not an option, the ones who want to help, can't; the ones who can, don't care. (it's a fucked up family situation)

Every word of advice or help is gold to me right now. 
If you read this so far, thank you so much for taking the time.. I know it's really long!



Oh! And finally, sorry about my english, it's not my native language and I likely made some mistakes.
Also, in which subreddits do you think I should post this? (it doesn't fill the /r/AskReddit rules)

Not to mention [other jobs seem low here](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/toronto-intern-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM976_KO8,14.htm). From my research it seams as though outside of Toronto &amp; general area the pay is significantly higher usually starting at ~5K/month. Yes cost of living is higher too but the netincome for my own disposable purposes is higher as well. Is something wrong with Toronto &amp; area?

2xiuxy,34,2015-02-28,My Thoughts... A 2 Month Report (A day early),Yeah_Buddy_999,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2xiuxy/my_thoughts_a_2_month_report_a_day_early/,"I'm posting this now because I have free time right now and won't have much of a chance the next few days. I have a lot to reflect on and will attempt to do every aspect as best as I can possibly do.

**Background**

I just turned 22. I am a virgin who has never had a girlfriend before. I have only asked out one girl in my entire life and went out with her once (just a few days ago). The first time I masturbated was when I was 15. I didn't regularly masturbate until 18. I had always masturbated to imagination or photos of women wearing very little or nothing. I didn't get into internet porn until I was 21. This had to do with living with my parents and sharing a bedroom with my brother. Getting into porn happened while on an internship living alone in an apartment. I do plan on waiting until I am married before having sex.

**My Challenge**

I decided that I want to go the entire year without masturbation or pornography. I am also doing this challenge with my best friend. I am so proud of him. We are still both going strong. He and I have had many deep conversions during this time.

**Porn/Edging/Masturbation/Wet Dreams During This Time**

I have not viewed porn a single time during this streak. One time around day 15 during the middle of the night realized that I had my dick in my hand. I stopped as soon as I had full realization of what was going on. I have had 3 wet dreams during this time. Day 50, 56, &amp; 57. I have no idea how I had two in a row or three in a week. It just happened.

**Big Confession:**

I was doing NoFap for the wrong reason. The reason I was doing NoFap was to become the best possible me for a girl. Now I am doing NoFap to become the best possible me for me. You cannot focus all of your energy into a girl like I did. It tore me apart when I went out with her and it didn't go that well (This happened 4 days ago). I see her often and we have talked since then but at this point she is either not into me or playing hard to get. We'll see what happens. My compass has been realigned and whatever happens happens and I'm going to be OK either way.

**Exercising &amp; Diet**

Exercising is an absolute MUST. I have lost 25 pounds since starting. 30 more to go. I have regularly exercised during this journey. The last few weeks I have strayed away from exercising becasue I have been putting 40+hours/week into my senior design project in addition to taking classes full-time which will finally end on Friday. I don't feel that well when I don't exercise. I have been on and off with eating healthy. I think the key to a diet is if you are going to eat bad do it in moderation. I was also going to stay away from alcohol during this year. It lasted 3 weeks then I drank about everyday for about 3 weeks in a row. I got hammered a few times. It's been 10 days since I have drank and I plan on continuing that. You have to find good ways to get your release.

**Journal/Meditation/Prayer**

These three things I have not used regularly but help so much when I do. Another thing that people may disagree on but I think is completely Ok. Crying. I have become very emotional during this adventure. I think being in touch with yourself is very important. **For example** I had a really bad day and it was 12:40 at night. I needed some kind of release. **I'm not recommending anyone doing this but it helped me.** I just started driving down the interstate away from town. After a few miles I exited and turned around. I pulled off to the side of the road on the top of a hill. This is one of my favorite views. You can see all the lights of the town of 90,000 that I live in. It is so beautiful and I think I'll do this again. I just sat in my car listening to music and just started crying. I did this for maybe 15 minutes before driving back to my apartment. Once I got to my apartment I wrote in my journal for 15 minutes then prayed for 10 minutes. After this I was ok. I went to bed quicker than I normally do. I woke up refreshed and went on with my life.

**Socializing**

I have gotten to know almost everyone in my major who are seniors and a lot of juniors. I spend so much time at school that my school friends are my real friends and we hang out outside of school as well. I have gotten to know more this semester than any before. One of them is the girl that I mentioned that I went out with. We'll see how that goes. I know people say there are plenty fish in the sea but I really do need to pursue this girl. I will be OK if it doesn't work out. I liked her as a person before I realized how beautiful she is. That says something.

**Telling People About NoFap**

I have told 7 people about my Porn and Masturbation addiction.

-Of course my best friend who I am doing the challenge with. When I first started NoFap he though I should still masturbate but respected my decision. It's awesome that I have a convert.

-My older brother. I have told him. He struggles with porn and masturbation as well. I am trying to help him but he doesn't think he can do it. I told him that I am here to support him in anyway I can.

-My mother: I told her about it and she was hurt but very strong about it. I had to tell her because she is very religious and I have made the firm commitment to be religious again. She said she is here to support me in anyway she can. I also asked her if I could talk to my little 17 year old brother about porn and masturbation and she said I can. I haven't gotten to do this yet but I am really excited to do so. He seems to be a saint but I want to help him if he is struggling with it like I was around his age.

-(This actually happened 6 months ago) I was having a conversation with 4 of my friends about porn and masturbation and I just told them that I refrain from masturbating or viewing porn. 3 of them though I was crazy the other person though that was awesome and we had a conversation alone and I told him about my low point when I was on an internship in the middle of nowhere and would just masturbate all the time in my apartment when I got back from work for 5 months in a row. The end of this internship I found NoFap.

**Miscellaneous**

Listening to music with meaning helps me a lot. Also listening to intelligent people talk makes you smarter.


Thanks for reading!


TL;DR

-Keep yourself busy

-Make friends in the environments that you are in. I also recommend putting yourself in new situations as well.

-Tell close people about what you are doing. It's not easy but it is amazing how good it will make you feel.

-Don't put all your energy into getting a girl. I did that for part of it and it came crashing in my face and I had to reevaluate.

-You must diet and exercise. The exercise is the best release that you can possibly get

-Journal/meditation/prayer are important for getting perspective.

2xivq8,1,2015-02-28,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xivq8/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Let me start by saying this is a throwaway account, because I have some people whom I'd rather not knowing about this post.


I need your help and your advice! I'll try to be brief while giving you the biggest picture possible:


Last year I ""re-met"" a guy I dated almost a decade ago, we did some small talk on facebook and decided it would be fun to hang out after all these years... well it was a bad case of love at first sign, not intended by any of us, especially because he lived with his girlfriend of a few years and friends. We had a rough path after that, everyone involved did, but now we're happily together and we love each other beyond words. You probably are now thinking he is a scumbag.. but hey, remember this is a short version of the facts, I don't want to bore you with all the details. He actually is the most caring, loving, sweet guy I ever met.. we always talk about stuff and try to solve our problems as soon as they appear, communication is key for us, and that's amazing to have. That guy is the man I want to marry some day and have by my side until we're old and grumpy (and I'm almost crying just writing that).


Anyway, the hardest part is happening right now, I'm desperate for him and I don't know what to do. He is trying his best to get his life together.. he was previously working in a tattoo parlour where he spent all day, no regular pay as a shop manager, only commissions from the jobs he got. So he had to left to get a ""real"" job with a regular paycheck, in order to be able to pay his rent and bills. He got a job at a call center, which he hates but does well; they won't pay him until the end of March and will barely cover the February rent+bills - and that was the best offer we got so far.

To get things worse, he had to invest money in basic appliances that his ex got to keep and his computer died two months ago. His job hunting is mostly through his smartphone and in person, so a lot of times I help him with that part.


At the moment he is completely depressed, I try my best to help him and keep him motivated everyday and we have amazing moments together, even with this crappy scenario.. I guess you could say we find a lot of happiness in eachother to get us through. It's hard to see the man you love almost starving so he can get the bus tomorrow to work.. it hurts me so bad that he lost about 10kg and it's so skinny right now because he just don't have the money to eat healthy and is so stressed. At the moment I run everyday to meet him, be sure he has something to eat, share my meals when I can meet him at our lunch breaks; but I can't help him all the way, I don't have that much money (I'm only getting my first real paycheck, as a full time intern, in March) - and he would never let me do so, money-wise. He is a strong guy, going through some of the worst times of his life, but I know he is getting tired of life, and I can't blame him.


So, dear redditors, I desperately thought about doing a fundraising and thought about Reddit. BUT WAIT, hear me out: 

FIRST: I do think it sounds selfish as fuck, to raise money to help my boyfriend pay his rent and get through the next month, I admit it; 

SECOND: On the other hand, the amount needed would be between 400€/500€, It's not a super huge number.. but I wouldn't feel good about just asking for the money too. 

So I'm thinking, if there would be anyone interested to help in exchange for something I have or could make - like a portrait (I used to make charcoal ones when I was at art school); or a photo restoration (I make those at work sometimes); or even a painted shirt.. what do you think? And any ideas about raising the money ASAP? 


Case you're wondering: help from family is not an option, the ones who want to help, can't; the ones who can, don't care. (it's a fucked up family situation)


Every word of advice or help is gold to me right now. 
If you read this so far, thank you so much for taking the time.



Oh! And finally, sorry about my english, it's not my native language (I'm portuguese) and I likely made some mistakes.
Also, in which subreddits do you think I should post this? (it doesn't fill the /r/AskReddit rules)

tl;dr: I'm trying to find a way to help my boyfriend in urgent need of money, while keep our relationship healthy and happy - advice is much needed!"

2xjg6t,2,2015-03-01,I (25/f) am having serious issues with procrastinating my schoolwork,procastinator5000,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2xjg6t/i_25f_am_having_serious_issues_with/,"I've always been a procrastinator to some extent.  If I were to make a grand generalization, I could say that the reason I'm still working on my bachelor's degree at 25 is because I am a huge procrastinator.  I've been putting off my future for years.  Now I'm one year away from graduating and it seems like the closer I get to finishing, the harder it becomes to do anything.

But really, I don't know why I'm doing this to myself.  I didn't care about school when I was in high school, I never did any of my assignments.  I only started caring in college and for awhile, I was doing really good.  I was on top of everything and basically did a 180, from not caring at all to caring way too much.

But I was going to the community college part-time and, at first, I didn't know what I wanted as a major.  Then I picked something, pursued that for awhile, then changed my mind.  Basically, six years later, I was still in community college and back at square one.  I finally settled on being an English major, which is really what I should have chosen from the start.

I finally switched to a four-year college and now I'm going full-time and I'm one year away from graduating.  I have no idea what I'm going to do when I graduate and I need to go to the career center with a resume so they can help me set up an internship for over the summer.  I can't seem to get myself to do it.  I can't get any of my homework done until the night before it's due and I've been pulling a *lot* of all-nighters.  I have a bunch of homework for Tuesday and I haven't started any of it, including two essays.

I can't handle the stress that I'm putting on myself right now.  I don't know if it's because I'm depressed about my future and my situation or if it's because I can't handle taking classes full-time.  I always work part-time, three days a week, 8-hour shifts.  This is over the weekend, which is when I have the most homework.  I would hate to chalk this up to me being unable to balance working 24-hours a week and a full course load.  I'd almost rather this be depression or something.  It has to be, because when I have an entire day free for homework, I waste it doing anything else (especially redditing).

So I'm asking how people who have serious problems with procrastination ever managed to get over that.  How do you break such a bad habit?  I've tried organizing and making schedules and lists, but none of that worked.  I've also tried that add-on that lets you block certain websites to keep you from procrastinating by browsing.  I just go on them incognito instead or with a different browser.  It's pointless.

Does anyone have any solid advice for this, or personal anecdotes, or suggested reading?  Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I have many questions...but any help is great! 

Background info: Currently attending a community college for my last semester. I was able to complete almost all of the prerequisites needed for most schools I applied to. I have a 4.0 GPA, having taken the honors version of every required math course. A member of two honors societies, hold a leadership position in one. I was the captain of varsity football in high school. I had one small internship at a local engineering firm last summer and just recently accepted to a big one overseas for this summer. My faults are not having completed all prerequisite courses and my HS SAT was very low (1500) I just recently applied to UCLA, Berkeley (specifically states ""not completing all prerequisite courses will not be considered for admission"" &lt;- bluff?), UC San Diego, Cal Poly SLO, USC, and Stanford (applied as PetE. requires SAT).

If in my position, what major and school would you choose? 
What do you think my chances are at Stanford (with a horrible SAT) and Berkeley?
Is it a better decision to go to a more hands on school like SLO?

2xk4vi,4,2015-03-01,Need transfer advice...,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2xk4vi/need_transfer_advice/,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place but I just am feeling lost in the transfer process and wanted to get some advice.
I am a second-year student at a small private college in Vermont. My college boasts ""exceptional"" career preparation and a very high (good) job placement rate in all majors. I came in as a writing major not really knowing what to do with myself, so that was reassuring for me. However, I ended up taking a risk and switching into computer science for my second semester so that I could do something with my life, and (luckily) it turned out okay, I'm pretty good at programming, and I love it. However, I'm just realizing I need to transfer--the CS program here is small and doesn't have a lot of theory/electrical engineering stuff. There are 50 CS students and I'm the only girl. Most of the people I meet here are interested in just doing the minimum amount of schoolwork and aren't very passionate--and those who aren't that way are only here because they got screwed over in their admissions process somehow. I don't feel it's an environment where I can meet my potential, and in CS I can get a great job placement rate anywhere I go. I have set my sights on UC Berkeley--however, they don't allow spring semester applications, so I won't be able to go for another year and a half (aside from summer classes). I really think I can get in--I have a 3.9, 2200 on my SATs, was student body president in high school and president of many clubs, I am an officer for our ACM chapter here, I am a pretty good writer... I think my application is decent, anyways. But I don't know what to do in the interim year. I don't think it's worth it to stay here because none of the credits I would take will transfer anywhere else, period. Is it worth it to apply and go to another school (such as CMU, USC, or some other top computer engineering school) for just one year while I try to get into Cal? Should I take the year to get an internship and go to a CA community college and then transfer from there? Will any of these options set me back in any way--aside from an extra year of school, which I am fine with? Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble--I'm just feeling confused and unsure about how to proceed."

This may be especially relevant for interns or new grads who have no prior work experience. 

I'm developing a program to help managers/employers equip employees/interns with the skills they need to do an excellent job without requiring an overwhelming amount of time and energy from the manager.

I need your help managers or employers: 

1. Do you feel there is a need for a program like this for interns/new grads with little to no work experience?

2. If this program existed, what types of skills would you like to see included? Some examples to provoke your thoughts: email etiquette, powerful powerpoints, excel data visualization, public speaking, taking minutes, relationship building, etc.

2xkpr1,3,2015-03-01,"Stuck between a rock and a hard place, seeking some advice, got none in /r/advice",integralvoid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xkpr1/stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place_seeking/,"X-Post from /r/advice, Original [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2x9ik3/stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place/)     
Flair: Work, Personal, School     
.     
I’m between a rock and a hard place with my education. After this semester I’ll only need 4 classes to graduate, which I had scheduled for Summer I and Summer II, however the one class that was irreplaceable was cancelled. Normally I could get a waiver and take something else, but I’m already taking two other courses that are outside of my intended field. I feel if I add a third it might dilute my degree too much. Also, I have virtually no industry experience since my one and only internship was very light on technical duties, since they were a startup and had all of their tech needs are addressed by another company in exchange for a profit sharing scenario. I possibly have the following options…     
.     
**Some pertinent information:** I’m a single dad, my 2 kids live with me full time. I’m a vet so my education is paid for and while I am actively enrolled in a session I receive a decent stipend. It’s enough for basic living expenses, and a small amount of the occasional babysitter (which I use for going to my classes). If I’m not enrolled I can’t afford my expenses and I currently don’t work because the daycare cost incurred would be too much for me to afford financially.     
.     
**Option 1:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, get a full time job in July, finish masters by taking one course a semester for Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.     
This is the kind of middle of the road approach, overall it seems like a horrible idea unless I can confirm that I have a solid offer by that time, with a reasonable salary. This would be a decent scenario, especially if it allowed me to move out of NY.     
 .     
**Option 2:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, Take more classes outside of discipline during Summer 2, get a full time job in Sept.     
This is the brute force, head on approach. I’ll have my masters, but I won’t have that focus in my degree and it may trigger some controversy if someone asks me why I would take courses that wouldn’t benefit me. However, if I got a solid offer to start somewhere in Sept. I could definitely leave NY and live somewhere with a reasonable cost of living. Also, I’m not even sure I can convince my department chair to sign off on any more waivers, especially since she’s already signed off on so many.     
 .     
With these first two options this could possibly cost me in terms of my initial salary of wherever I start. This will also probably limit my options. What concerns me the most is how it will affect my career in the long run because it might stifle opportunities to advance in my field.     
.     
**Option 3:** Take out a 10K unsubsidized loan to cover living expenses, do a relevant full time summer internship, take a full load Fall 2015 and maybe continue my internship part time, then get a full time job in Jan. somewhere else, hopefully with a significantly better salary. This option will probably be best for me long term, it just costs the greatest in the short term. Also, I'm worried that the debit incurred will potentially offset whatever I may gain from taking this route.     
.     
What would you do?     
.     
**EDIT #1:** My lease is up April 1st, my landlord has verbally agreed to extend my lease 2 months up until June, but that I might have to sign another 1 year lease at minimum if I want to stay past June 1st. Time is critical.     
.     
**EDIT #2:** My advisor is grossly incompetent. She couldn't even be bothered to send my department chair an updated course sheet for me earlier this month, something that would have literally taken less than 5 minutes. I know because that’s how long it took me to bring it up to date. Also, anytime I ask her for a waiver she says it's impossible. I've been avoiding her since last fall because she almost screwed me out of my BS due to some missing waivers in my file. Waivers that were supposed to be there, and I had an email paper trail with proof. After two months of driving me crazy, she magically figured it out. There's more to the story, but it's irrelevant for the purposes of this post. I have been taking care of my business and going directly to my department chair. I just contact her via forwarded emails letting her know that she needs to get waivers together, and I make sure to CC the chair so she actually does it. Paper trail FTW!     
.     
My current degree is Master of Science in Information Systems with a concentration on Security and Information Assurance. I've already finished my prerequisites (2 waived due to prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability before Fall 15) and I'll be done with my concentration this semester (taking all 3 required classes concurrently, it’s tough). I've already exceeded my limit for courses in other fields, I'm taking one each from Public Administration, Business Management, and Computer Science. I used some obscure excuse, but in the end it won't benefit me other than getting me my degree sooner. It would be different if I was getting a Master's in Business, but it's too late to switch now. The only classes that could fill the gap are either Public Administration or Business Management courses, a total of 7 options that could be used as a filler. These are even less relevant than the ones I've already chosen to take.
.     
Let me recount my waivers so far for a degree that requires 10 courses: 2 waivers for prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability, 2 waivers to allow me to take 2 classes concurrently with their prerequisite, 1 waiver for the Public Administration class, 1 waiver for the business management class, and 1 waiver for the Computer Science course because I won’t even be taking the prerequisite.

I am a 20 year old student who attends a University here in North Carolina(Junior) and I recently got a ticket for (title) and I am EXTREMELY terrified...
If you ever saw me in real life, you would never expect me to be a stoner.. Just a college kid, with decent grades(3.0 GPA) and lots of possible internships and jobs related to the major I am studying.


Yesterday four officers came up to my apartment door and questioned me if I had been smoking weed in my apartment(which I had) because apparently we had gotten 3 complaints in the last month about weed smell(probably fuckboys) and I said 'no' because they couldn't come into my apartment without a warrant or whatever(I am not that knowledgeable of police tactics in this scenario...) and they somehow got inside and then asked before they search if I had anything here and I said yes because it was in plain sight. They ended up finding my roommate and I's little weed stash(around 3 grams) the grinder and a scale I never use from my room and then charging both of us with that. 
No one knows except for my roommates and I definitely don't plan on telling my parents because in the South there is no forgiveness for this type of thing and this can brand you for the rest of your life... 
I'm not really sure why I am telling you guys this it's just that I need someone to talk to and tell me I will live a normal life because if this doesn't get removed from my record I'm going to explode because my life will be fucking over 

I have never gotten a ticket for anything in my life, I'm just a dumb college kid trying to work to get a career and smoke weed to deal with stress along the way because school is bull shit and alcohol is more dangerous in my opinion in college settings if you're not 21.


Someone tell me everything will be o.k because I can't talk to anyone else about this and I feel like I'm slipping into depression because of this bull shit incident.

TL;DR 20 yrs. old, weed possession charge, scared as fuck, idk what to do"
2xky5p,24,2015-03-01,Any developers or Software Engineers here?,ergonomickeyboard,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/2xky5p/any_developers_or_software_engineers_here/,"I'm asking here because I like the community a lot but I'm a current student who's trying to change career paths and become a developer/software engineer. I was hoping to ask someone some questions about things. My dream is mobile dev so if anyone is in that field i'd really appreciate being able to ask some questions. Thank you!

Edit: Wow! Did not expect the amount of responses so I'm just going to put my questions here for everyone. 

Bit of Bio: I'm a computer engineering student trying to transition to this field, I have experience in Java, PHP, Python, JS, Angular.JS, D3.js, CSS and HTML and some android experience but not much. I am more experienced in Web Dev technologies but my passion I guess lies more on the backend and Java and especially Android side of things. I lack the data structures and efficiency knowledge which is what I'm working on.

2. What are some things that could really set me a part from other people? I've been working on projects and getting things on my github account.

3. If you had to choose 3 things you'd value the most out of a candidate especially at an intern/new grad level, whether they be skills or traits, what are they?

4. I have a QA style internship already lined up with a rather large company, but am searching for a different one in a more coding and development type role. I know it's not the best ethically but it's my last summer and i'm changing areas and I feel I need to get the best possible internship on my resume. Do you feel this is a good decision or am I wrong in thinking it makes much of a difference?

5. If you do mobile dev, would you take an intern/new grad who has experience programming in the language but not a huge experience in actual mobile dev?

Again thank you all! I'm pretty nervous as this is my last summer to intern, and I'm scared of not being able to ""cut it"" by the time I graduate
and will have an issue getting a job. Thank you again!"
2xliqt,1,2015-03-01,"Feeling lost, could use some advice.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2xliqt/feeling_lost_could_use_some_advice/,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I could use some help, I really have nowhere else to go. Warning! Lengthy read. 

I am a 21 year old female. I am in my last year in school for my Bachelor's in Communication and minor in Business. I am working a job that is fairly easy and only weekends so I can focus. In January, I got back to Arizona from an 8 month long internship at Disney World and it was Hell, but that is a different story. The point is that I left AZ confident, with a car, a job making good money, and returned scared, no car, and no money. It was like being 17 all over again. 

I am finding it very hard to be social. I am scared to death of people.  I blame some of this of working 3 years in customer service in the worst places (Wal-Mart, a bank and a hotel). I do not approach people whatsoever. It is not horrible in that I can't order food or ask a store associate a question; it is more that ""I want to go out, but have no one to go out with” deal. I’ve lost connection with most of my friends from high school. Most of my friends are busy with their own lives and it is hard to find time to see them.  I have not made any friends in college except for 2, who I dated and now are not on speaking terms. There have been some people I talk to in class casually, but I never hung out with, even when I wanted to. I never had time to do any clubs or activities because of work or lack of transportation. I used to have a lot of friends in high school and participated in theatre, and to go to having none of that really hurts. 


The thing is that I am freaking weird. I have always been awkward. I’ve been getting weird looks from other people since kindergarten. I have had many people tell me I’m beautiful and have the sexy librarian look, but I know I’m not like everyone else. I have big glasses, I wear mostly black out of habit, I talk funny and with a stammer, I am an avid World of Warcraft player and a huge movie buff. I don’t even know how I got a job in the first place, and I’m not sure what to do after I graduate. My dream is to be a screenwriter or a film critic, my realistic expectation is having an office job that doesn’t involve working with people. 

I should also mention I just got out of a relationship. This leads me to my next problem with my sexuality. I lost my virginity with my last boyfriend at 21, which is late compared to some people. I know it doesn’t matter, but it took a lot for me. Even after having long term relationships (longest was 2 years), it was really hard for me to do so. It wasn’t for religious purposes or anything it was more so I was never at the right place or the right time.  When it was right, I still couldn’t do it, it hurts like hell. Even when I finally did have sex, it still hurt like hell and was not enjoyable at all. I wanted it to be over with. My boyfriend thought I have Vaginismus, and by looking at the symptoms it is probably true. I cannot insert things inside myself whatsoever, not even tampons. It has really set me back from a lot of experiences and I thought finally doing it would help me from being a timid virgin, but it only sort of did.

It’s not that I’m a sex vixen now; it’s that I want to explore. I masturbate a few times a week, and often times I get help from porn. My choice in porn can be unconventional. I mostly go for girl on girl or group. I know that this choice is totally normal, my need for want to act it out, and that porn is completely fake. What I’m trying to say that I want to expand my horizons. I don’t know if I am sexually attracted to girls, I just think they’re pretty; I really don’t see myself in a relationship with one. I wouldn’t mind trying, but I don’t want anyone to get hurt. One minute I want to be a hermit, the next I want to be in a threesome, the next I just want a boyfriend, I don’t know what I want. I’ve never had a problem getting a boyfriend, I have the problem of not getting a complete asshole for one. 

I met my ex through Tinder, and I don’t really have the patience to do it again. I also tried POF and OkCupid and talked to some people, but it felt weird. I was tempted to do craigslist, but we all know the horror stories that can come with it. Phoenix can be boring, especially when you don’t have a car (except my mom’s I borrow), not a whole lot of money and fucking lazy. I’m tired of spending my Saturday nights browsing Reddit and playing World of Warcraft. I’ve already cut my hair, got a tattoo and put in gauges to prove that I’m ready to get things going. 

TL;DR:
•	What are some safe ways I can make friends?
•	How can I explore my sexuality?
•	What should I do after I graduate?
•	Should I accept I’m a freak and just stay home forever?
•	Thanks for reading my long story, I want to get better, I want to be the person I want to be.

He's very unemotional and logical, something that I've always known. I'm not particularly known by other people for being irrational or overly emotional, but that's because I find it hard to get upset around most people, to the point where I only really cry around my boyfriend or my mother. 

Now, we've both come back off respective internships abroad and are back at the same university. This has taken a bit of adjustment and life is pretty stressful for us both outside of each other. We were originally living together for about a month but decided that he would move back to his parent's home nearby and that I would move elsewhere because the house is constantly filthy, tiny, loud, generally horrible. There's also the fact that we are coming up to our final year in university so loads of work, he has a job, I'm trying to find one, I in particular am missing life abroad and the friends I made there, so general stress. 

But recently, his reaction to me getting upset over things has just been wearing me down. It's not really that he's changed, I don't think, because he's never been good at sympathy, but with life being a little harder recently, it's been getting to me. For example, this entire week I have been hunting for a new house and getting no where - I nearly had one that I loved sorted but the landlord sold it completely from under my feet and all of the others I've found have either been rented already or worse than the one I'm currently in. It's been pretty stressful because I hate living in this house, particularly now that he's moved out and I'm stuck in what was once 'our room' in a crappy house with no room, filth everywhere, and no sign of escape etc. So last night, after a day of rejections, I ended up bursting into tears. I want to point out that he has been helping me with looking for house, going to see them with me, etc. He isn't being a completely asshole or anything. But he just said it was ridiculous to be getting upset over something like that, it's just a house, I'm being stupid. Bear in mind this is a house so terrible that he couldn't wait to move out and leave me behind. This just got me more upset because I was completely at the end of my tether, and miserable, and I wanted some comforting, and now I just felt stupid and childish.

Tonight he told me that his father had been complaining about me for something he misinterpreted (not saying thank you for a dinner he made, it's a seperate issue, I had completely been saying thank you but I'm kind of shy around his dad still and it must have been too quiet) and I ended up getting upset again, because it was horrible to think that his dad thinks I'm a cow when in reality I want him to like me so much that I end up making myself stupidly shy around him. The boyfriend got pissed at me for getting upset again, told me it was completely stupid and ridiculous and that the fact that I felt shy around his father pissed him off because it's no excuse. Now, I felt horrible for his dad getting the wrong idea and I know it's my fault, but it was the same story again where I couldn't get upset over something without him telling me I was wrong to be upset, instead of giving me a hug or something. 

There have been other examples. I was sick for a few days and he was away for the weekend, so I was looking forward to seeing him, and when he turned up he just got annoyed at me because I hadn't gone to the doctor's and said ''he didn't do sick people''. He also says he ''doesn't do'' crying people or sympathy. It happens to an extent if we argue, where he'll go cold if I start crying, but that's an argument, so I can see why he wouldn't be all over me there.

I ended up bringing this up with him tonight (not for the first time), that I wished I could confide in him and come to him for comfort without worrying about if he thought it was a legitimate reason and if he'd just call me ridiculous. He says he doesn't do sympathy, he fixes problems. Which I completely appreciate and told him so, and I know that it's common for guys to take a problem solving approach over sympathy anyway. Hell, it's not like I'm crying to him the whole time over things that I'm not trying to fix myself. And I truly do appreciate his input like that. It's just horrible to get upset in front of someone I trust and have them be so cold and throw it back in my face. He can get angry over small things sometimes (never at me though, never violent, just stresses in his life) and I'm always there to talk things through, make him feel better, regardless of whether I think it's something small he's angry over. I just can't understand how you can care about someone and see them upset over something and not want to make them feel better. Sometimes I just want some nice words and a hug instead of feeling like I'm annoying him and need to pull myself together. Note that it's his own words that I annoy him when I get upset over ''stupid things''.

This is an otherwise great relationship and I love him and know he loves me. I know this is probably just a case of being different people, but it breaks my heart a little to come to someone I love if I'm stressed or upset and have them react like that. How do we resolve this? Does anyone have any input?

Now, I have been reading up on interview questions from CTCI for some days and I realize that my limited knowledge in algorithms and datastructures might be a disadvantage to me as I am a first year CS student.

That being said, I wanted to know what kind of questions should I be expecting in the interview. My phone interview is tomorrow evening and I would like to do some last day prep.

Apart from coding questions, does amazon asks any behavioral questions in their intern interviews - Question like side projects, most challenging bug, where did you learned the most and so on. How should I approach those questions as I havnt had much experience in the CS apart from the courses in school.

Thanks for help."

On a scale from 1 to 10, how hard is it to find an internship in the major tech cities? (i.e. places that everyone and their mom's dog wants to live like The Bay area, etc.)


I'm thinking that all companies who advertise probably get thousands of applicants per day, so I'm wondering if it's even worth applying.


Especially since I'm not one of those people who has a bunch of impressive projects or my own website, GitHub, etc... i.e. I'm really just a student, y'know?


And I don't know any of the *""tricks""* for finding open positions, so chances are if I've found the posting, 100,000 other people have seen it as well.


So this leads back to my question - on a scale of 1-10 how hard is it to land an internship offer at those highly-contested locations?

This is my first time doing such a thing, but I'm having a ton of trouble getting back into the bandwagon of fitness, so this might just push me over the complacency hill.

I'm a 22 year old university athlete on a 1 year hiatus of high level activity due to an internship. I never knew how much I relied on my team and coach to do my workouts until I had to wake up early in the morning to work out by myself in the corporate 

Weeks became months, and in the span of 10 months, I have gained close to 10 pounds and lost most of my cardio ability.

My plan is to hopefully drop to around 155-160lb, which would put me below my weight category for the university fall season (rowing), while following a high intensity-low volume triathlon training plan. (Injured my finger during climbing, so I decided to start tri training now).

I wish everybody else luck in this 12 week ordeal, and may the most dedicated win.

The only problem was she had been accepted to study abroad in Spain the next semester and also was hired for an internship in New York for over the summer. Our only fight occurred when she asked me what would happen when she left, and I told her that 8 months would be a long time to wait. She was very upset and we broke up for a couple of days, but after having a talk decided we would stay together until she left. We told each other we wouldn't make any promises but that if we still felt the same way about each other that we could potentially get back together down the road. I have continued to keep in touch with her on a daily basis and even sent her flowers for Valentines to let her know I still think about her. Today we were skyping and I made the mistake of telling her I had been jealous from a snapchat she had sent me of her downing a large drink. I made her feel very guilty and I regret even mentioning it as I have no right to be jealous. She then told me that after our initial break that she never felt the same way about me although I don't believe her. She said that when she comes back that she doesn't see us getting back together. I've told her how strongly I still feel about her and that I only ended our relationship to preserve, but it seems to have had the opposite effect. We had even been making plans for me to visit her in New York when she is closer and easier to visit, but I'm not sure that will happen now. Do you think there is any chance of me winning her back? Would appreciate any advice Reddit

2xmbyq,1,2015-03-01,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xmbyq/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I was wondering what the job market is like in SF and what schools compete for those jobs. 

I would like to get positions in SF over San Diego because it seems that the tech/financial services industries there are much better then San Diego. 

Would it be considerably better for career advancement to be in SF or the Silicon Valley?

Are there lots of job openings in the Bay Area and would that make it actually easier to get a job in the bay area? 

Is it more competitive? I don't want to miss out on my chance with a firm just because I told them I want to be in SF. 

Do local graduates get a better chance there? Is it mostly just SF St, San Jose St, Santa Clara, UCB, and Fresno St, and Cal Poly students trying to get jobs in SF?"

2xmxyu,1,2015-03-01,Just want to share some things.,rcalbrecht,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2xmxyu/just_want_to_share_some_things/,"I was terribly lonely and had deep bouts of melancholy in high school. These were remedied by optimistic thoughts of ""someday it's bound to get better""--and it did.  I started my studies at a prestigious university studying my beloved political science, I made tons of friends through my dorm and a student org I had joined and I started to feel, and it seems strange to say it, fully human.  I felt like I was hopping on to the first stepping stone of the American dream: getting the education to provide the foundation for the rest of my career and subsequent happiness (why I thought a degree in political science would help me achieve this is a mystery haha)  In the past, I had felt like a shell of a person, playing my role in the family as the quiet, brilliant son.  I finally had discovered a happiness to fill that shell.  

The main contributing factor: community.  I was truly a part of something, so much so that I was able to forget about myself. We are, after all, social animals.  When we spend too much time alone with our thoughts, almost nothing good can come from it.  I was adequately distracted.

I was selected to do an internship with a Japanese company and proceeded to study abroad in Tokyo my senior year of college following it.  I felt bouts of sadness there as well, but they were most likely attributed to homesickness and the intensity of stimuli from the foreign culture.  In this time, I made the best friend I've ever had.  He was a student from Russia, and we spent almost everyday together doing whatever the hell we wanted.  I picked up new hobbies like urban exploration, birdwatching and petanque (it's a French game like bocce ball, but that's not important now).  I even met my first girlfriend there at the bright, young age of 21 as much as it pains me to admit it (I'm actually not bad looking, I just tended to shy away from women romantically because I literally had no idea what I was doing).  Things seemed like they were going great; my future was bright and the world was my oyster! Or so I thought.  I held strong to the illusion that my return home with this great experience under my belt would lead me to the promised land.  No such thing.

I came back to the States last year and begun the job hunt. I spent everyday all day looking for a job that paid at least $30,000 a year that didn't require me to relocate too far, all the while missing my friend terribly.  Nothing.  After 3 months of searching I settled for a job as a bank teller making around 25k/year despite my dislike for sales.  I have been desperately searching for a job that at least requires applicants to have a 4 year degree.  Unfortunately, I'm also not qualified for any of them.  I'm treading water financially and I have discovered that none of my passions correspond to lucrative careers.  All of my friends from growing up and college have moved to the West and East Coasts from our quiet Midwestern town and are all making tons of money doing what they love.  I'm stuck here by myself saving around $200/month with a job I feel neutral about.  I have no friends, and all of my attempts to make any have led me to the disheartening realization that making friends is fucking hard as an adult.  It always seems like everyone has something better to do.

I spend everyday at work trying to come up with career paths and practical plans of action, but due to my crippling loneliness, I always end up discouraged and giving up.  The time I could be spending productively ends up being spent inside my own head, contemplating the oppressive structure of our society and how we value literally the least important things like possessions and status over all else, which lead me even further into my own catastrophism.  I just want some friends and a better job, but neither are making themselves easy to find.

I miss my friend the most.  We talk maybe three times a week, but the 15 hour time difference makes any consistent correspondence impossible.  I miss how carefree I was when we would go hiking and exploring around Japan.  My intense longing to get those feelings back are making me concerned that life will only get worse from here on out. 

I think I may be depressed.  I realize I'm actually in fairly fortunate circumstances, but perhaps due to chemical imbalance, I am finding it nearly impossible to be optimistic.  Maybe I just need to find a woman who understands me or something, haha, I honestly don't know.  But I'm just so emotionally fatigued all of the time, I doubt I will be able to get myself to a presentable level for a date.  Plus, you know, the whole 25k/year doesn't get many ladies excited.

I don't expect anyone to be able to give me any advice other than ""keep at it!"", and I know for a fact that is the smart thing to do, but I really just wanted to talk to someone.  That's what's going on in my life lately.  

How about you?"

I don’t have a waterproof case, obviously, but I wanted to see what you guys think.

I think it was Michaela.

Let me start off kind of far away from the point: A big part of this show is about the [mask]( http://tvline.com/2014/11/15/how-to-get-away-with-murder-spoilers-is-liza-weil-bonnie-leaving-htgawm/). The difference between how you present yourself to the world and how you actually are. It’s clearly a huge part of Annalise’s character, but I think there is some serious masking going on with each of the interns as well, and this finale offered commentary on each of their masks.  Wes’ lighthearted innocence became a mask to a hinted-at darker past, and that mask broke in the finale under the stress of more dark and dark to cover.  Laurel’s “nice, girl-next-door” demeanor was shown to be a mask to a more calculating and perhaps less sweet person, especially in the finale when we heard how she manipulated Michaela and casually assumed Frank would murder Rebecca.  Connor worries all season that any genuine relationship with Oliver will only be a mask to the selfish bad person he thinks he is. He’s so worried about this he doesn’t notice what’s even going on with Oliver until Oliver tells him.

Then we have Michaela. It’s already been hinted at before the finale that her uptight “senior-class-president” routine just masks a far less privileged upbringing. And along the way, a few characters have insinuated that she can’t keep up the routine and will just break under the pressure. The following Michaela quote, which got me onto this whole theory in the first place, should demonstrate where she’s at the beginning of this episode:

&gt;No! Do not look at him. You ruined our lives, don’t you get that? I was supposed to be getting married and I’m not anymore. Aiden called off the wedding because of you. You dragged us into the horror show that is your life and now we’re all screwed forever. So you’re going to tell us the truth. Every horrible secret about that night that you haven’t told anyone. Or I swear to God, I will personally destroy you. Tell us the damn truth, Rebecca. Did you or did you not kill Lyla?

Michaela’s life, the one she built the mask for, is falling apart, as is her mask itself. And she holds Rebecca responsible. Surely Rebecca taking Michaela’s phone to text Eggs 911 doesn’t help, and when Michaela goes to talk to Aiden’s mother, she simply abandons the mask, and accepts that it has done her no good. Like Connor and Laurel, she presents evidence to Annalise that Rebecca committed the murder. She does at one point, express doubt and seem interested into getting to the actual truth without bias.  But after Annalise makes Wes talk to Rebecca and he comes back sure of her innocence, Michaela is incredulous. And she’s even more incredulous that Annalise doesn’t believe the case against Rebecca. All the same Annalise declares for Rebecca’s innocence and then leaves to go talk to Nate. By the time Annalise gets back, Rebecca is dead (we can probably assume).

I doubt that the talk with Aiden’s mother fixed all of Michaela’s issues. Months of increasing emotionally instability weren’t fixed by reverting back to her original accent for a few minutes. Especially since the Michaela we see later in the episode is just as anxious as before. No, it seems to me that closing the door on her life with Aiden probably, in the short run, just made her more emotional, less stable. She leaves that restaurant less happy then she walked in, and at least part of her still blames Rebecca.

If it was Michaela, it was probably a crime of passion. Upset and scared, she goes downstairs with no one’s permission to beg one more time for Rebecca to tell her the truth and help her resolve things. And Rebecca, who has had no patience for what any of her captors want out of her all episode, is just snarky back. And Michaela snaps. And Michaela strikes her with something and kills her. And then Michaela panics. She goes upstairs, and tells everyone that they should pin Sam’s murder on Rebecca. This means that later, no one can say that Michaela killed Rebecca to get rid of her. Because Michaela already had a plan to get rid of her. 

And of course, killing Rebecca doesn’t fix any of Michaela’s problems. So she goes out to try to have a night on the town to help her deal. But then she find out that her ring was never truly lost, that she hasn’t spent the past few weeks in as horrible a situation as she believed. And now she’s faced with the same dilemma Wes has had all episode- Was the murder I committed justified? Was it actually worth it?

Like I said, it’s all supposition, and similar cases can probably be made against most of the cast. But what do you guys think? Is Michaela a good guess?"

2xn6ox,61,2015-03-02,Kate (still ongoing),globelamp,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2xn6ox/kate_still_ongoing/,"So this is long, but this girl has been fucking with my life and harassing me for almost two years and it keeps escalating.

About a year and a half ago I moved from (small city) to (major midwest city), after I started dating my boyfriend, Dean. I had grown up in the surrounding area, and was super excited about finally getting to live in the city proper. I was still leasing an apartment in the old city, and couldn't break the lease, so Dean let me crash at his place for most of the week while I tried to make freelance connections. 

One of the first places I visited was an art gallery Dean's best friend was in the process of building. I cut my leg open on some old auto parts in the lot they were cleaning out and developed a bad infection, so while I was waiting for Dean and Emerson (the gallery owner) to pack up and drive me home, I started talking to lots of random artists who were passing through the worksite.

Somewhere during this, I must have met Kate. I don't actually remember meeting her, but she tracked all my social media accounts down, and followed or friended me on all of them.

Kate was a comic artist, she said, and was very opinionated about the direction the city was going, and super confident about her work. I didn't know anyone else, most of my college friends in the area hadn't returned home from internships, so I was really excited to have a female friend who was also an illustrator/comic artist.

In fall, when Dean left for a month, I housesat for him for a few days a week, since  I had two jobs, one in new city and one in old city and I split my week between the two areas. To keep myself from getting stressed out, I started learning photography as a hobby and as a reason to get out of the house. Kate immediately commented on my status about it and requested to go along with me on one of my evening trips. The only issue is that I would have to pick her up in a fairly deserted part of town, by the old fairgrounds.

""Ooookay,"" I think. ""Weird. But I do really want to be friends with her, and I don't like walking around alone.""

I drove to the fairgrounds, and waited for about 45 minutes. No signs of Kate. I call and text her-- nothing. I get lost on the way back and I'm fuming mad, and complain to Dean's housemate, Lily. Lily takes me out for beers to vent about it, and we end up becoming very close friends immediately.

A couple weeks after this, right before Dean comes back to town, Lily and I get invited to Kate's art show. She makes a big deal about it, calls local newspapers, claims she's got a band and a sponsor deal. It's not too crazy- since Emerson's gallery was hosting it, I figured she could have met friends to collab with, like Lily and I had. So we get dressed up and pregame a bit, and then head over.

The space is DESERTED. There's hardly any art up, and a couple people are uncomfortably walking around. Lily and I are getting a weird vibe, but Kate had provided tons of liquor and free comic books, and her ""sponsor"" gave us free tshirts. Score. We drink enough to mostly forget about Kate's weird attitude, and that she really only had one friend there, despite posts about ""a huge crowd"". 

Later on, Kate likes all of my photos of the shirt and Lily wearing her shirt, and comments that we're ""super close friends"" and that she was ""so glad we came"". I hadn't actually remembered meeting Kate in person prior to this, and I KNOW Lily hadn't, so that made us kind of uncomfortable.

When Dean comes back, he comments on how ""close"" Kate and I seemed on Facebook. I laugh a little uncomfortably, and say we've never really hung out. He brushes it off, and I do as well.

In November, Kate frantically calls me, Dean, and Emerson, asking for a place to sleep. She tells us that her roommate is being abusive, that the cops won't come, and that she needs a place to crash, as she fears for her life. I'm super freaked out, and offer to pick her up. She doesn't answer, so Emerson and I assume the worst and jump in my car. Right as we start driving, she calls us, and announces that she's fine. A-okay. ""It's no big deal, also Emerson I'm at your art space, can I crash for a bit?"" She immediately gets a pizza on Emerson's tab and starts laughing and decides to host an impromptu party at the gallery, all the while claiming it was ""fine"" but she had to go.

In retrospect, this should have been the first red flag, but I wasn't about to claim someone's abuse story wasn't true. It did make me really suspicious, though, that it became ""okay"" with no repercussions. No issues with picking up her stuff, that turned out totally fine. The whole thing was solved by a pizza. 

Over the next couple months, Kate starts going on ""crusades"" against random organizations she's been involved with. Most of her criticism involves that they were somehow ""abusing"" or ""bullying"" her. I get fed up with it pretty quickly, especially when one of her prime complaints is ""(incubator) tried to advertise my services and get me freelance clients."" Like, last time I checked, that was kind of a good thing.

Over the winter I had a bit of a mental breakdown, and didn't see Kate around town as often. It was a struggle not to be snappy with her, as I was feeling pretty negatively towards most people, and I couldn't deal with her conspiracy theories and false drama. Plus, she would always bring me pieces of art, and seek out my approval, and then scream at me every time I said something even vaguely critical. I just could not deal with that.

In March, Dean took me out to see a show during a local bar and restaurant week,and several of our friends were rapping on stage during it. Emerson, a friend from out of town, Dean, and I were hanging out with the bartender, another friend of ours, and we saw Kate arrive. All of us were wearing cocktail or club attire, but Kate was wearing a ratty sweatshirt and sweatpants, and hadn't combed her hair. She's usually a casual dresser, but this came across pretty strongly as ""something is off"", since she always made an effort to do her hair and put on jewelry with hoodies. She dragged my friend from out of town and the girl he was flirting with over to the other side of the bar, and announced that I may have a sketchbook with me, but she is the REAL artist, and he ought to hear about her comic.

Now, not to be petty, but if we're going to compare work, her comic was really, really bad. My depression was affecting my ability to do good work, and even in comparison, her comic was really bad. Like mediocre deviantart, no backgrounds, no plot, half the main people are vampires and hot guys, all drawn with her boyftiend's face. Yeaaaaah. I should note also that at the time of this, I was 23, and assumed she was as well.

I was annoyed, but wanted to enjoy my night, so I shut up for a bit and listened. Then Emerson leaned over, and as we watched her down shots like a college freshman, he said, ""Can you BELIEVE Kate is 33? She acts like a kid.""

What.

So now my alarm bells were going off slightly, like, why is Kate seeking out only people who are 10 years younger than her? 

And I looked closely and realized she physically looks her age, but being slightly heavier, she was intentionally playing up a slight baby face with hoodies, a ponytail, and minimal makeup. 

Kate then came over and spent most of the night rambling conspiracy theories at me, and insisted she could SENSE that the guys on stage were going to be involved in some kind of shoot out. She was sure of it, and kept whispering into my face way too closely. 

Dean and I went to a diner afterwards and found that Kate had convinced the rappers and Emerson to follow us, but eat at a separate table. She came over to my area and stage whispered,

""it's okay. I think that because I'm with them, I've managed to save them from what FATE wanted.""

Yeah, wow. We noped out of there really fast.

It was really hard to avoid Kate entirely after that, even though I wanted to. She managed to show up the day Dean asked me to move in with him, but offered to help us paint our workspace, so we had to drive her home and listen to her theories about fate and horror movies and plots for her vampire comic the whole way back. We didn't end up celebrating because the mood was pretty well killed.

On Facebook, she got increasingly unhinged-- she'd latch on to any comment I or someone else made that she could decide was ""negative"" and ""triggering"" for her. This would include anything from not liking her status, to saying we didn't agree with a countdown of top coffee shops in the city. She'd then rant passive aggressively on twitter about whoever said it for hours. It started extending to her business, too-- she accused one guy of blackmailing her and stealing her rent, when he'd actually paid her the full amount for art in advance and was simply asking when it'd be delivered by. She had an art show at a coffee house, but didn't even stay for 30 minutes of it and stormed out in a screaming tantrum, because they decided to provide her with musicians for her show and serve coffee during it. She then called one of the local newspapers claiming that they had severely wronged her and ""ruined"" her show. You get the picture.

So I've been pretty much trying to ignore her for the last year, but she keeps escalating her behavior. She's lately taken to telling Dean that I'm ""evil"", and isn't subtle about it-- in October she crashed a housewarming party that our coworkers were holding and started drunkenly yelling about how Dean should dump me for one of our colleagues. She also regularly stalks me on twitter and Instagram and tweets about my ""evil activities"" without using names, but then as soon as I tell her to stop she tells everyone openly that I'm an ""asshole"" and ""ruining her life"" by bullying her, somehow. Annoying but boring, to be totally honest.

Most recently, though, she started targeting my boss at an activist blog I work part time for. I do a lot of design work with mental health advocacy and queer issues, so I'm pretty visible to anyone trying to find me online. And one of my side duties for the blog is to find trans and queer media for my boss, Aiden, to check out, in case they make a good article.

I noticed that Kate had published a comic that looked really good, that was about trans characters and afrofuturist themes. I was a little nervous about sending it over, because Kate, but I figured it was unlikely that Kate would be angry about a positive review.

Aiden was a bit concerned, as a queer trans writer, that this was being written by a cisgender author, so he asked her some friendly questions about plot summary and her sources for information about the community. Pretty standard book review stuff.

Kate blew up, ranted at him via twitter and called him racist (?!?) for asking her about the comic, and it got to a harassment level where Aiden had to block her and shut down most of his non-work social media accounts for awhile. She then signed into her professional account and pretended to be a spokesperson for her comic group, and called him racist again, and said that he was harassing and bullying her, despite him not being actually online for most of a day. 

It's been about three days, and so far she's called his primary employer to try to get him fired for being a ""racist bully"", which, is not true at all, hunted down all of his reddit, tumblr, and even amazon accounts, and has been arbitrarily messaging redditors and random activists she finds online to tell them how ""horrible""  Aiden is. 

At the moment he's not interested in calling the cops, but she escalated it today for me where I might be-- she found mine and Dean's address via a Facebook event, and has been telling random users on twitter that I ""masterminded Aiden's campaign of harassment"", and giving them my email and other info for doxxing purposes. Luckily, so far nobody's really taken the bait, but I did get a lot of new followers on my art accounts who are all ""friends"" of hers. For all I know, they're also her. Aiden and I have also gotten a lot of emails sent to our blog's address saying how much the art and banner ""suck"", and that I don't ""deserve"" to be working for it.

I don't know that she's done anything with the address, but it scares me that she knows it. She likes Dean and my dog still, for some reason, but I'm scared that she'll try and like, steal my dog, or break into our house, now that she knows where I live. She has the mentality that I don't ""deserve"" nice things like the dog or my career accomplishments as much as she does, which really creeps me the hell out.

So yeah, advice is welcome, but mostly I just had to get this off my chest."

When I went and met up with him to talk we started off just discussing education, and as we talked he started talking about an idea for a a platform he is working on but doesn't quite have the time to commit to it. He said that he could just get any developer to work on it, but he believes we share a similar passion and that because of that he would like to get me working on it with them. I wasn't looking for a job by talking to him, and was actually more anticipating that he'd be pitching the program to me.

He actually asked me what my schedule was like, and how available I was to work with them, and I told him the truth that I'm likely going to be working on an internship for the rest of the semester, but over the summer I'd be free. He also happened to ask where I was living because he knew I didn't live in the city that the bootcamp is located in, and I said that I was living up at the school I attend, and off handidly mentioned I actually need to be looking for an apartment for the summer but wasn't sure I could get one being 17, and he said that he could actually work with me to give me a place to live as part of my compensation.

Being 17 and getting offered a job without even applying is a bit weird to me, and I'm not sure how to proceed. I know I would beyond ecstatic to be working with them because I would be working in the field that I care extensively about and would be able to work with people who do share my passions. But I'm not sure like how exactly does one proceed in a situation like this? I'm kind of lost on this one, and any suggestions is really great, thanks.

Edit: Also, I feel like this offer is exacerbating a bit of imposter syndrome. I've previously worked with educational advocacy groups, and I've been paid to program before but never working with either topic quite to this scope, and I fear what would happen if I were to fail and not be able to live up to their expectations. I mean I've taken jobs before where I didn't know how to do anything needed and I managed, but never something this big. Apologies for the wall of text."

https://archive.today/7kmvQ

One of the Affidavits

&gt; believe that most of the internship consisted of training. We taught interns how to **moderate comments on the Lifehacker website**, how to **review and find relevant blogs, and how to research online to find interesting ideas from which the editors could possibly craft a posts. They would discuss with editors and send them links**, and we would let them know if an article idea was viable, and most importantly, why. The teaching process was always ongoing throughout the duration of the internship.

Wow so they had them censoring comments on life hacker and looking through forums and blogs to make into stories (most likely uncredited in terms of the original source)

From the Jezebel Social Justice division 

&gt;The interns performed a wide variety of tasks in order to give them an understanding of how the site works as a while. They would crunch numbers for fashion week, which consisted of **counting the number of models of color who appeared in the fashion shows**… Simply observing what it is like to work at a place like Gawker is valuable, and internships at Gawker sites are good for a person’s resume… It is an invaluable experience to work with any editor directly, and several Jezebel interns had the opportunity to work with editors one-on-one.

2xn9ck,5,2015-03-02,Etiquette Q: Build Bridges at Low Paying Short Term Job or Get More $ and Burn Bridges?,jobquestionthrowawwy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2xn9ck/etiquette_q_build_bridges_at_low_paying_short/,"TL;DR: Fellowship starting in the fall. Got offered one short-term position that doesn't pay much or play to my skills but is in an interesting field. Am interviewing for a long-term position that pays much more ($ that would be REALLY helpful) but I'd burn bridges when I leave in the fall. 

Hi all,

Thanks for reading my post. New to reddit, so apologies for any mistakes in post. I'm a recent college grad: from fall 2013 to fall 2014 I was working at a fellowship position. When that ended, I did some freelance work, a part-time thing and a couple of unpaid internships- I also used my unemployed time to to start learning another language/apply to some fellowships. I basically haven't had a ""real"" job for six months, and my having money/savings situation is not good. 

Recently, I've been working on my LinkedIn profile, my resume, on cover letters, etc. I had an on-site interview for a good position, but didn't get it. I got 'let go' from my part-time job. Over the last two months, I had heard back from all of the fellowships I applied to- I got nothing. I heard from the last one maybe three weeks ago- they told me that I had been really, really close, but that ultimately I hadn't gotten it. It sucked.

Last week, I applied to two jobs. One was for a short-term position with not awesome pay. The work I'd be doing wouldn't be too technical: other people applying for the position are usually undergrads who are interested in getting a foot in the door in the field, and I'm overqualified for the work. The upside to this position is that it's in a field that I'm really interested in, and I'd make great connections. I have to get back to them early this week. I'm also interviewing for a position where I'd get to use my skills while developing new skills, at a very interesting company, for significantly more pay.  

Here's the good news: earlier this week, the fellowship that I had applied for and got really, really close to getting actually got back to me. They had miraculously found some extra funding, and would be able to fund me for two years. I'm completely overjoyed! 

However, now I'm left with a question. I wasn't sure about taking this short-term position because of the low pay, but I see that I could complete the job and (hopefully) build strong connections before starting my fellowship in the fall. If I got the other long-term position, I could make a lot more money, which would be really helpful during my fellowship term. (I'd also have the flexibility to take some time off to hang out with a friend on a trip we had planned, though I understand that this probably shouldn't factor into my job decision). But, I'd have to quit after being there for 4 to 6 months. Especially if they invest training in me, I feel like the people at the long-term job will resent that I quit, and I wouldn't be able to ask anyone there for a recommendation. One friend told me I may not be able to put it on my resume. If I didn't get this job, I think (perhaps wrongly) that I can get interviews for long-term positions that would pay a similar amount, but still, the problem of burning bridges in the fall when I leave would be the same with any longer-term position.

What do you think? I don't have a lot of experience with the job market, and I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice.

(Sorry if its a bit of a ramble)

**TL;DR**  : about to lose girlfriend, dont want to. Feeling lost and alone about it, need advice on how to not lose her or prepare for a breakup (worst case scenario)

Backstory (kinda):My girlfriend and I have been together for just short of a year now. We both attend the same university and thats where we met. The first couple months were as to be expected and very much so in the inflatuated state and being excited about the relationship. As time went we drifted from that and in my opinion rather quickly.

More recently: 2 months ago she got a internship on the other side of town. It ended up that we only saw eachother once a week on saturadays. Me, being the more emotional one always wanted to spend more time and asked for more constantly(even before the internship), on the other hand, often she didnt want to or didnt have the time for it.  We talked 2 weeks ago about our current feelings to eachother after a small incident. I found out then (although I was already feeling it already) that she has lost the passion in our relationship and although she loves me, she doesnt feel the want or need to see me  that much anymore. After the talk we both agreed we wanted to continue to try in this relationship and we tried to see ot talk to eachother a little bit more during the week, in one occasion we had a dinner during the week(a big difference in the normal week).

This weekend we had to cancel our plans last minute and I was a bit upset at her over it. I did not talk to her much for 2 days following that and today we agreed we needed to talk in person tomorrow. I talked to her over the phone just now and she says shes not happy anymore with how everything is and has not felt any difference for the last time we talked. I would do anything to try to save the relationship and avoid breaking up what would you guys suggest?"

I have a situation and I am not sure how to approach it. I will be graduating this August and am hoping to return to my previous employer where I have done my co-op placements (or internship).

I worked at ""Company W"" for 1 year for co-op placements. I started working there for a 4 month term, returned back to school, then worked there again for an 8 month term. I really enjoyed working there and I would love to return back as a FT employee after I graduate. During the last few months when I was working there, my assistant director (aka my manager's boss) hinted more than a few times how she would love to have me working here again and hope that an opportunity will come up at the department by the time I graduate. During the last week of my co-op placement, my manager gave me the highest rating on my co-op evaluation and said that I have done extremely well. He also said that when it is close to my graduation date, give him a shout and he will help me find a job. I also told him and the assistant director that I would love to work at Company W again. I know I left a good impression with them and everyone in the office liked me. After I left, I visited them twice since August 2014 just to say hi to everyone again. 

Earlier this year, I went to a job fair to see what kind of jobs are out there because I am worried that Company W would not hire me again. I met many recruiters there and they advised me to keep my Linkedin profile up to date. I thought it would be a good idea to ask my manager to write me a recommendation on Linkedin. I explained to him how I went to the job fair and recruiters might be looking at my profile, and it would give me more credibility if I had a recommendation from him.  He happily wrote me a pretty awesome recommendation. 

After this happened, I began to ask myself if I did anything wrong. I really would love to work for Company W again and yet, I went to a job fair and asked my manager to write me a recommendation so my Linkedin Profile looks more credible in case other recruiters are looking. Does it seem like I don't want to work for my manager anymore? Or am I thinking too much? 

I really want to ask my manager if there will be any opportunities available but I have no idea how to ask him. I am really scared to know his answer because my fate is literally in his hands. I don't really know how to word my outreach message to him. Is it too early to ask right now since I am graduating in August? I was planning to e-mail him this week but I want to ask Reddit first!"

Thanks for reading- apologies if this is an obvious question. I graduated a couple of years ago and ended a job fall of last year. I have basically been un- or under-employed for around 6 months (I did freelance work, a part time thing, an unpaid internship, applied to more fellowships, did a job where I got paid in non-cash goods, worked for commission, visited my family- good stuff, but it barely paid the bills). 


I LOVE my best friend Alice (23F) from college. She is the bomb. We haven't been able to really see each other or hang out in person for almost two years now- we were planning a trip to see each other in late March that was in both of our budget ranges. I also have been really wanting to go on this trip because Alice might not be in the States for too long for Visa reasons, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to see her again.


However, I recently started really applying to jobs (under the thought that I could negotiate something where they'd give me some unpaid time off in March and I could work extra hours or do something else to make up). For the first two jobs I applied to, I got interviews. I'm still interviewing for one of the positions, but got the other one. It doesn't pay well, but it's in a field that I want experience in. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the job, I wouldn't be able to get a single day of leave in March (not even for weddings or funerals, the HR guy said). The position told me I could downgrade my title and work for significantly less, and then I could see Alice. The other job I'm interviewing for pays better, and I could probably take a bit of time off and still see Alice.


People I've talked to have told me that it's stupid to put my future career at risk by turning down a pretty good offer to see a friend, especially when I don't have something else totally in the bag. However, this trip is really important to me. We both already booked un-refundable tickets (around $200 each). Alice will be able to visit our other friends in the cities we were going to, but we really wanted to do this trip together. I am honestly torn as to whether I should take this job (good experience, bad pay) and lose this trip, potentially really hurting my friends' feelings, or whether I should plan on doing the trip and look for other jobs. I feel reasonably confident that I could find something good and/or get the other job I'm interviewing for, but it may take some time. Another complicating factor: taking this job that I've been offered would be good for me because it ends after a few months, which would let me go off to grad school (I got funding- enough for basic expenses but it'd help to get some extra $) in the fall without quitting and burning bridges at a long-term position.


I really want to do right by my friend. Alice told me that she understood if I had to take the job and skip the trip, but I feel awful. Should I offer to pay for her plane tickets? She bought them under the thought that we'd do the trip together. Should I risk the job stuff and just go travel with her? Is that incredibly naive? I can afford travel financially at the moment, but I'm worried about setting myself up badly for the future by not taking this position.  What would you do? Am I being an asshole? Thanks.



**tl;dr**: Unemployed. Friend and I bought tickets to do a trip together, with the thought that if I got a job, I'd negotiate something to be able to do the trip. Got offered a position where I can't do the trip. I'm not sure I can turn the position down because it'd set me up well for the future/it's really convenient. Should I turn it down and travel? Offer to pay for her tickets? How to do right by my friend?"

2xnqk4,26,2015-03-02,[HELP] Still haven't received my security deposit after 5 months from the real estate agency in Paris.,Nanazgo,france,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/2xnqk4/help_still_havent_received_my_security_deposit/,"I am writing in English to make it a little easier for me to formulate my problem. I can write in French but it takes longer and will have a lot of mistakes. Feel free to comment in French though.

I am from the Netherlands, Amsterdam, doing a bachelors degree. I did an internship in Paris from February 2014 to August 2014. I had a fantastic time! I am completely in love with France and will move back permanently after finishing my studies.

From February 20, I moved into a small studio in the 18th arrondissement and paid 850 Euros per month. Quite a lot but it didn't matter. Up front I had to pay a deposit of 1390 Euros, which I would get back after I returned the key and the apartment was still in a good state. The agency is called IMOVA Gestion S.A.R.L.

In August, a man of the agency, M Olivier BEHAR, came by to check everything. He was very kind and said that, to give the deposit back, he could send a cheque or transfer the money if I would email my RIB to him immediately. I preferred the transfer because I went back to the Netherlands that day.

After that, the time-line went like this:
 
* I waited out the two months time they had to give back the deposit, which was in the contract. I did send them reminders of the approaching deadline by mail.
* After two months, I started phoning them. The secretary told me they only send cheques and asked for my new address in the Netherlands. She told me she would send it ASAP.
* The week after, still no cheque. I called again and she started apologizing that she did not do it and would send it today.
* Having researched the rules and regulations at service-public.fr on ""Délai de restitutions"" I sent a 'Lettre recommandée' with a pre-made letter, demanding the return of my deposit.
* January, still nothing. When I called them they had a new secretary. I thought maybe the last one got fired? I don't know. The new woman spoke fluent English and I explained what had happened up to this point. She said they did do bank transfers and told me to email my RIB again and she would talk with her superior.
* The week after, I phoned to check with her if everything was fine. She said yes, don't worry we will make the transfer in three parts over the coming weeks.
* Around February 16, 2015 I began calling again but have since only reached their voice mail. The phone rings once or twice but then voice mail. It looks like they are not answering any number with the Dutch +31 extension. (I tried with multiple numbers)

Is there any way I can get my deposit back, other than me having to go to Paris and deal with the local Tribunal d'instance (TI)?

Thank you so much for taking your time to read this!

I'm faced with a dilemma that I really need help with from someone that is more experienced or knows the software job market (and the way it works) better.

10 months ago I got an internship that basically consisted of developing Android applications for a small company, in which I went from knowing nothing about android dev to actually being able to make apps, although I'm still far from an expert.

Now that that internship is over and I have about half a year before finishing college, I figured I want to keep learning mobile dev for securing a career at that since I have 10 months experience already and I actually love it (although I need to make a living so what I like doesnt really matter). 

I'm trying to find another internship that can help me learn more before finishing college, and my problem is: if I cant find anything mobile related, what do I do? take something else (probably web dev) and learn something new from scratch, or make apps at home instead to further learn android despite no working experience for putting on my resume? Which one would look better on the resume or give me a better chance?"

I am very excited because I will soon join you as I have gotten an internship in web development =)

So far, it goes :

* rent : 800 (is the average I got from asking around among my friends who used to share flats in London and tried to stay centered)
* take away lunch : 5/day so around 100/month
* groceries : 160 / month, maybe less ?
* transports : around 100/month ? I know that depends on the kind of transports, but I'm evaluating on the worst case scenario where I take the underground everyday (otherwise I'd really rather buy me a bike, but don't know if the weather will allow me to take it out that often =P)


&amp;nbsp;


What I'm missing :
 
* mobile subscription
* internet subscription
* going out : what's a good monthly budget for going out ? I try to go to the movies as much as possible, I love restaurants and enjoy a good cocktail in a good bar =)

&amp;nbsp;

Have I gotten something wrong ? Anything to add ?

Bonus question : I couldn't really find an average salary for web development internships, any insight ? It could help me negociate if it ever comes to that.

Thanks reddit =)"

I've scraped by with C's in most of my classes since my freshman year and I'm still not a very strong coder.  As of right now I'm pretty sure I'm failing almost all of my classes and that's not because of lack of effort.  I work almost 25 hours a week on top of trying to get homework done that I don't understand is too much.  I have a 2.7 GPA, no internship experience  (went to every career fair and haven't ever gotten an offer), and my GPA is only going to get worse.  I've looked into declaring academic bankruptcy because I do really love coding, I was just immature when I came to college and made some bad choices.  Would academic bankruptcy be a bad idea for me?  Any advice?

Edit: for this of you that wanted an update, 3 of my 5 classes I'm doing decent in.  The 2 I'm doing poorly in I'm going to speak with the professors and see if I can make up some work.  If not, I'm going to drop them and stay some extra time.  If I get this degree loans won't be a big deal.  Thank you for all the support guys, this has helped me more than you know and if I had the money to guild you all I would.  You guys will probably see me again when I have another mental break down, until next time guys.  "
2xoavq,1,2015-03-02,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xoavq/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I'm currently a junior in college that needs some internship advice. A financial services technology company gave me an offer for a software internship. It pays decently for the location (about $20/hr). I assume there will be a lot of coding and if I am doing Qa I will be using the Selenium software. 

My other choice is Capital One. As Capital One is not exactly a tech company, I would think that it is not as much coding so it might look as good on my resume? Capital One pays more and I feel like it will be a more relaxing internship experience. "
2xol50,2,2015-03-02,3D Printing Services for Small Business?,Intern11,3Dprinting,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/2xol50/3d_printing_services_for_small_business/,"Hello I am a 23 year old computer programmer.Currently in my free time I am taking some classes in Auto-Desk inventor and Sketch-Up. I have purchased an Davinci 1.0 which I have flashed and are printing with every few days. My brother is a year younger then me and is a talented engineer with experience in autocad. He is graduating in July and is trying to get an internship at a 3d printing company as a designer in the meantime.If I start this business he said he would work with me.

Now here comes the part were all waiting for. How can I make money 3D printing? Would a small business that has a scanner, some entry level printers (ultimakers) and a few guys(2) that know autocad be successful? When I first thought of this idea, I kept thinking just having a location where you could rent 3D printers would be enough to make $, however this seems rather difficult since bigger companies like staples and fed ex kinkos now have 3d printing departments. Also there are hubs(makexyz etc) that are local and websites(shapeways) where people that KNOW about 3d printing can get stuff done in their area or shipped. Thes hubs will always be cheaper then a store even with the 15% fee because they have 0 overhead and shapeways has a million dollar print farm.

I was hoping that my business would bring 3D printing to people that didn't know about it. Or help people bring their designs to 3D. Use the scanner tool to create custom action figures or gifts, use autocad to create model houses for real estate agents to display in their windows. But that gets me thinking would somebody pay $30-40 for a custom figure? I know most small business can afford a 3d printer but can they afford a designer? And would that stream of business be enough for me to continue to be successful?

I was even thinking of the lessons model. Where you could come into a location and take classes on 3d printing. These would range from serious classes to people that want to get into printing to ""fun classes"" where you could take your kid print a toy and paint it together at our store!

There is also the question of how much this would all cost. I live in NYC its my native town so I know real estate is very expensive but the foot traffic would be extremely high. Would someplace that has classes and things need to be much bigger...?  I have around 80k to invest in the business... which comes from my fathers savings... I am really nervous about using...

If anybody has any experience in this business please feel free to comment! "

I'm feeling pretty low these days. I had a job interview last week and had to buy a new suit because the 3 suits I bought 6 months ago no longer fit...at ALL. (As a side note, I did get the job! Woot wooooot.) I used to be so proud of myself that through my first year of grad school and a breakup of a 4.5 year relationship--the hardest year of my life--I managed to keep all the weight off. I had planned to lose the last 20 lbs over the summer. Instead, I found myself in a new, incredible relationship (where I continue to be over-the-moon happy every single day) and a stressful summer internship, and began to pack on the pounds. I've gained 30 lbs in 6 months and can hardly believe it. I stopped holding myself accountable for what I was shoving into my mouth, and I'm paying for it now.

That stops today. Movie nights with my boyfriend don't need to involve copious amounts of candy and ice cream. After a long day of work and school, I don't need to reward myself with half a pizza. I'm committing to logging my calories every day, and getting back to where I was 1.5 years ago. And I'm looking to you all for daily inspiration :)"

It was my first job in a ""CS"" setting. I started off doing some scripting, which was ok since I still had to learn how the company worked, then moved on to some custom software using Java, but the work load has been stagnant for the last 2 months and I am being forced to do work along the lines of working on excel macros, ""installing"" excel sheets, access dbs. 

I am really unhappy with the direction its all going and feel like I am stuck. Since I am the only developer in this company I have no experience working in a team setting, the technology they mostly use is irrelevant(excel macros, lotusscript, SAP ABAP). The company culture is awful and they refuse to change the way they do things, and they think all their problems can be solved using excel sheets. The compensation is awful compared to the average, but I have to stay to cover living expenses.
I am having a hard time starting projects on my own because after going through a whole day of working here I don't have the time to give my full focus on something, and this job makes me try to stay away from a computer.
I started learning mobile so I hope to be able to refresh my resume with some new projects, but in the mean this job is killing my interest in anything. I want to devote %100 of my time learning new things and working on worthwhile projects with current technology but I am not sure if its a good idea to leave the current job.

The text was thankfully [saved by a redditor](http://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x296e/update_part_2_my_24f_boyfriend_m26_is_letting_his/coweu7s)

&gt;This is a really embarrassing problem, so please be kind. I'm here for advice.

&gt;I've been with my SO (let's call him Jake) for about three and a half years. We met in the middle of our undergrad and have been dating ever since, despite being in different cities twice in our relationship. We first moved in together my senior year of college (his first year post-grad) in an off-campus apartment. This really solidified our relationship and made me realize that he was the boy I wanted to marry.

&gt;Over winter break, I received a job offer that would start as an internship during my last semester and begin right after graduation in a different city. It was designed as a fellowship, so it would only be for a year. When I told Jake, he was beyond thrilled for me but was clearly sad about being alone in the city we fell in love in. I suggested that he finally take up him mom's offer to give him a puppy. His family has run a breeding business for a old german shepherds (basically a long-haired version of the breed) for a few decades and nearly all of his siblings had one or two dogs from the center, but he felt like it would have been too much while he was at school. When we reunited after winter break, he brought Dog back up north with him.

&gt;Dog was (and still is) the sweetest puppy you've ever met. My last semester of school wouldn't have been the same if I wasn't coming home to my awesome boyfriend and our beautiful puppy every night. After a great spring with Jake and Dog, I headed out west and started my job.

&gt;Fast forward. Jake and I rocked our long distance relationship (which ended up lasting almost four months longer than we planned). Since I graduated, Jake accepted a position at his dream job and moved to a different city. I applied for grad school in the same city and was set to start classes almost immediately following the end of my fellowship. Because Jake and Dog have been living alone and Dog's a deadbeat who can't pay rent, they've been living in an open-concept loft apartment. We decided to live apart for my first year of school and move in together when his lease expires in March. I'm currently living on campus about twenty minutes away from Jake and Dog.

&gt;As you can imagine, I spend a lot of my nights sleeping at Jake's apartment. However, Dog is two years old now, not neutered, and there's no door to keep him from the bedroom when we're being intimate. Whenever he gets the opportunity, Dog jumps on the bed and tries to mount me. For some reason, Jake thinks this is hilarious and has even gone so far as to jokingly hold me in doggystyle as Dog tried to engage with me. It's humiliating and violating. Without getting too NSFW, the dog is clearly trying to engage in sexual intercourse and has even ejaculated while doing so. Jake refuses to lock him in his crate or the bathroom (the only other room in the apartment) and accuses me of being cruel by wanting to do so. I can't even approach the subject of getting Dog neutered (even though I believe he would be happier/healthier if he was) without Jake getting upset. He thinks I'm jealous of Dog and keeps saying that I need to accept that we spent a year apart and enjoy that we're together now.

&gt;This has completely ruined our sex life and is beginning to ruin our relationship. While I know it won't be an issue when we get an apartment with rooms, I can't imagine wanting to move in with Jake unless this problem gets resolved. Also, I'm incredibly uncomfortable around Dog. I know it's not his fault that he's getting positive reinforcement for something that makes me uncomfortable, but I hate being around him now. Is my relationship doomed over this?

&gt;tl;dr: Boyfriend's dog keeps trying to mount me when we have sex. I'm humiliated and uncomfortable, but my boyfriend doesn't see a problem. 

[Her first update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2urzqy/update_my_f24_boyfriend_m26_is_letting_his_dog/), which was also deleted by her SO but also saved:

&gt;Edit: It's been a long fucking night. Turns out my boyfriend is a redditor. I'm currently staying at my apartment with no intention of seeing him for a while. Update sometime tomorrow, going to bed now.

&gt;Edit: An update. Jake is a redditor, breaks up with me, Dog still with him.

&gt;Edit: My update post was removed. Here's what I wrote. Thank you all for your support.

&gt;Turns out Jake is a redditor. A few hours after my post, Jake surprised me at my apartment demanding an explanation. A summary of what was a long rant:

&gt;He was clearly joking and that ""holding [me] down"" was an extreme description of what happened. (I disagree) That if anyone we knew read it, chances are they would assume it was him and think he's a dog fucker.

&gt;That r/relationships will always ""lose their shit if they think a woman is abused"" and that jumping to beastiality was insane.

&gt;That I'm a ""sick fuck"" for even thinking about neutering Dog.

&gt;That he believed I was a danger to Dog and that he was worried about leaving us alone together because he believed I would take him to the vet and ""mutilate him""

&gt;And, finally, that I need to tell my ""army"" to back down or we were through.

&gt;At this point, I told him to leave and that I thought it would be best if we spent a few days apart. He left and I didn't hear from him until he started calling me an hour later. I ignored the calls. Finally, he texts me this:

&gt;""I can't date someone who would put my reputation at stake like this. You've betrayed my trust so you could get attention from strangers. Everything you described was an innocent joke and something [Dog] couldn't help. Stay the fuck away from us [he and Dog]. If I see you around, I'm calling the police.""

&gt;So there you go. I wish I broke up with him and not the other way around, but I guess it doesn't really matter. I know I'm going to get a lot of comments telling me to tell Jake's parents about this, but like I said before, I'm just not comfortable. I don't even know how I'm going to explain this to my friends and family, so I don't know if I could tell Jake's parents. Honestly, I don't think anyone will know the truth beside Jake and I (and the thousands of strangers who upvoted this, but whatever).

&gt;Now I just need to deal with tying up all of the loose ends (a shared savings account, what I'm doing when my lease is up, telling friends and family, etc.). Also, I feel some sort of responsibility to Dog, so I need to really think about what I'm going to do to make sure he's safe.

&gt;I know there's a certain sense of justice that's felt here when an issue ends with separation, but please remember that I'm grieving a 3.5 year relationship. Even if it ended on a disgusting note, it was still three years of my life and our breaking up is not something I want to celebrate.

&gt;tl;dr: SO is a redditor, ended up breaking up with me.

[Her second update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x296e/update_part_2_my_24f_boyfriend_m26_is_letting_his/), which turned out to be her ex-SO ""Jake"" posting from her account.  Also deleted but luckily google cache [saves us here](https://archive.today/Yez5m) (text copied below to be safe):

&gt;It has been 20 days since my post but I would like to admit something. Much of what I previously stated was a lie. Moving back near Jake was stressful because it made me jealous. I wanted to punish him somewhat anonymously. I knew he was a redditor and wanted him to see my post.

&gt;Jake is a wonderful boyfriend and a caring dog owner. He isn't acting out a fantasy as many of you suspected. I exaggerated the problem with dog in the bedroom. It is no longer an issue and we would like to move on with our relationship peacefully. I'm considering coming clean a new start and am so happy Jake could forgive me.

&gt;tl;dr: I would like to apologize for lying in a previous post. 

And finally, her [real update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xot21/final_update_my_f24_boyfriend_m26_is_letting_his/) in which she warns people in his area of him.

2xp3sk,7,2015-03-02,Question About Internship Issue,canisliz,ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/2xp3sk/question_about_internship_issue/,"  I'm currently doing my college internship at my local PD, and today I was called into my Sergeant's office to discuss some ""issues"". I would love advice on what to do in this situation.
   I take my internship seriously, and I really value everything that I have been taught so far. I am always very friendly towards everyone, and mind my P's and Q's when riding with officers. There are a few officer's that I have ridden with that use profanity, and I really don't mind since I do as well, but I NEVER use foul language in front of others that don't know me. Even when I do cuss, it's usually just like ""damn"", ""hell"", or ""shit"". I hardly ever drop the ""F"" bomb.
   Also, I just recently started working out again because I had been out of commission due to a breast reduction a few months ago. One night when I went into the PD, one of the officers asked why I was walking funny and I told him ""Well I just started working out again because I had to take it easy due to having surgery a few months ago."" He curiously asked ""Oh what did you have surgery for?"" All I said was ""I had a breast reduction in November so I've been recovering from that."" 
   Long story short, my Sergeant told me today that the officer who openly asked about my surgery said it made him feel extremely uncomfortable, and that he's also heard that I use profanity and that it is a big ""no no"" at their department (I had NO IDEA of this, or I would have never even said ""hell"") . I immediately apologized and told him that I really don't mean to cuss, and that I feel really embarrassed. I have no idea how to handle the whole breast reduction situation though. I also noticed that he completely took me off of the patrol schedule and leaving me doing strictly office work. I feel extremely embarrassed and the LAST thing that I want is any bad blood between me and the officers. Any advice on how to deal with this would be very much appreciated. "

2xp4op,0,2015-03-02,Engineering and Barrett?,[deleted],ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/2xp4op/engineering_and_barrett/,"Hey guys I've been accepted to Barrett but I have a few questions before deciding to attend. My plan is to get into a good grad school or law school. I know Barrett helps but how much does it help? Do grad schools prefer students from honors colleges? Or it helps because of the thesis and honors classes? Will not senior attending Barrett hurt my chance of getting accepted to a good post-grad? I want to maybe get a minor or take some extra classes. I'm not sure if that is doable when I have engineering and Barrett. Also, does attending Barrett mean more resources to internship and research? Will I still have time for a job?"
2xp6bf,5,2015-03-02,22 [F4M] Celebrity Roleplay!,kikchick555,dirtykikpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/2xp6bf/22_f4m_celebrity_roleplay/,"Hey guys, I'd love to roleplay as a celebrity model for you! These are some of the models/celebrities that I would like to play:

Kate Upton: http://imgur.com/a/aL4Db#1

Emily Ratajkowski: http://imgur.com/a/3T9m3

Kelly Brook: http://i.imgur.com/FIm0uYH.jpg

Jessica Davies: http://i.imgur.com/Wrgmrr5.jpg

India Reynolds: http://i.imgur.com/8VrfVoJ.jpg

I have five main ideas, but I want to hear yours as well! I like it to be as realistic as possible:

1. You are a journalist, and the questions and topic gets a little naughty.

2. You are a fan who happens to meet me. Maybe on a beach / staying in rooms next to each other in a hotel / At a bar or club / At a fan meet up etc...

3. You are a teenager living with his parents. They decide to hire someone to help around the house, little did they know that she is a glamour model. You are a fan, and have jerked off to her countless times. (This scene would only work with Jessica or India)

4.You work in the photography industry, but you aren't a photographer, e.g. Light guy, set up crew, intern, agent etc...

5. You are my lawyer (I'd love to hear your ideas for this scene, as I have never tried it out so I don't really have many ideas. Nothing to do with leaked nudes though!)

Any of these scenes can be fully-con, semi-con, or even non-con if you are interested, but it doesn't matter if you don't like that aspect.

I'd also like to create a threesome scene, so If you are interested in that pick two girls from the list!

Some kinks that I am interested in: Facial, blowjob, titfuck, public, clothed, groping, threesome. I also only roleplay in third person.

I'm always looking to roleplay so don't think that you can't message me a few hours after I posted this :)"
2xp6zr,45,2015-03-02,[JOB OFFER] Part-Time Receptionist/General Office Assistant Position at University of Maryland Baltimore County's Career Center. 20 hours a week and 15/hr. No benefits unfortunately.,Airriona91,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2xp6zr/job_offer_parttime_receptionistgeneral_office/,"Hi guys. I put in my 2 weeks notice at my job at UMBC. It's a great place to work. I took the job in September after my full-time and awesome pay internship was up. It was just so I could have money and do theater on the side without many conflicts. But, I just accepted a full-time job with awesome pay, awesome benefits paid for by the company, and more. Anyway, UMBC's Career Center is looking for my replacement. 

It gets kind of crazy since it's a big school and although the office has its downtime, it does get busy. 

**Location: Baltimore, MD 21250**

**Hours:** 1pm-5pm, M-F, 20 hours/week (although some days I came in early if I knew I was going to miss a day. **They are flexible in letting you make up hours. Just don't abuse it**). 

**Pay:** 15.00/hr


**Job Outline:** 

* Receptionist (answer phone, make appointments, greet guests etc)
Keeping events calendar up-to-date. 
* General administrative work and various small projects (like creating binders for workshops, make signs for events etc). 


**Qualifications:** 

* HS Diploma or GED (I have my Bachelor's Degree, but they hired me anyway)
* Professional attitude
* No age discrimination, but please know you'll be working with college kids at a honors university. I'm 23 if that helps. 
* Great computer skills (you'll be working with a scheduling program, Google Docs, Microsoft Office and Google Drive)
* Excellent communication skills (ability to screen phone calls accurately etc)
* Ability to learn quickly is nearly a must

The department is small and the job is generally stress free. **Parking is 2.00/a day.** A bus goes directly to the campus, but they might have preference over people with reliable transportation (although I think one person used to work here who took the MTA). 

***Note**: The position will be a year long contract (you can leave at anytime you'd like though). Renewal is based on performance. My boss told me that my contract would have been renewed for another year if I had chose to stay. 

**INBOX ME FOR MORE INFORMATION! PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO CONTACT THEM DIRECTLY** I say this because I want to make sure I'm recommending great people since they were so good to me. "
2xpajg,1,2015-03-02,How much money can I roughly expect after a 1.5 year £30k p/a graduate scheme in London?,r-00,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xpajg/how_much_money_can_i_roughly_expect_after_a_15/,"I'm currently 6 months into a grad scheme at a company in London. It ends in a year and I'm curious as to how much salary I can expect afterwards.

The scheme involves agile software engineering using Java (Spring mostly), iOS (Objective-C) ,Node (with React.js) and front end web dev. 

I'm currently on £30k, and wondering what sort of salary I can expect afterwards.

I got a first in Software Engineering from a London University and worked for a year as a software developer intern previously.

As a bonus question, which of these languages would be good to specialize in?

Many thanks for your time."
2xpk3v,2,2015-03-02,Few questions regarding internship applications,silentempest,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2xpk3v/few_questions_regarding_internship_applications/,"Over the last months I applied to over 15 places and haven't heard of replies yet which is fine. However, I did get a a few responses but I am in awkward position for all of them.

One company responded within 3 days of submitting my application and the Sr. recruiting manager was impressed by my resume and wanted to talk over it. I emailed him back and never got a confirmation email for a set phone call. Last Tuesday, I realized he sent the email through their job system which was a noreply address. I am not sure if he ever got my message so I quickly searched for his company email address and resent with new times for next week. They also opened more positions and I am hesitant if I should reapply for those positions. They are identical to the position I applied for except it states Mechanical Engineering near the top.

Does that look bad on my part and would that ruin my chances?

The second company sent me a rejection letter for a design engineering internship position. They said we have reviewed your background and qualifications and find that we do not have an appropriate match at this time. It might be a generic bs response but does that take a count for their other positions? They have a manufacturing position as well and I was curious if I should apply to that as well?

Does it look bad if you apply to a different position within the company before/after getting a rejection response?

**TL;DR**: Im in a awkward position for some companies and need advice on how to proceed without killing my chances for an internship. Should I reapply to a position I already applied? Is it ok to apply for a different position from a company that already rejected you with vague wording(Not a good fit for the company or this position???)."

I'm currently majoring in Electrical Engineering and so far I'm not doing so well. I just got my test score back from my EE 233 circuit class and I got way below average. I'm not feeling well about this because it could affect my future. I'm also trying to get an internship and I've applied to many of them but haven't gotten call back. Any tips on how to recover from a bad quarter and getting an internship? My GPA is at about 3.1 overall right now."
2xpmig,1,2015-03-02,So i have a degree in engineering....,SupaZT,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/2xpmig/so_i_have_a_degree_in_engineering/,"But I was never really good at it. And networking wasn't my strong suit. I literally have no one that could vouch for me at an engineering firm/company. Because of that I landed no internships (they were hard to get) and now with my 2.87 GPA no one will hire me. 

I've thought about going into IT but I'm not sure if people are able to cut corners and just get higher level Certs or if you really do need to start out at the bottom with help desk / customer support stuff and get a compTIA A+.  

I just feel I would be better at IT work considering the struggles I had in school. I mean I've always been the go to computer guy in my family. I've built a NAS and have done networking, VM work, etc. I have programming skills. It's just gotten to that point where I've considered a change and was curious what you guys thought.

The system for job searching in engineering right now just really sucks if you have a mediocre GPA + no internships. I worked for a year for an aerospace company but all it did was put a better job on my resume. I didn't learn that much related to engineering.  

Thoughts? 

Anyone know someone who went from engineering (electrical) to IT?

2xpmuw,3,2015-03-02,"Me [21 M] with my best friend [23 F] ~1.5 yrs, Unrequited feelings, loneliness, and fear.",gottahaveathing,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xpmuw/me_21_m_with_my_best_friend_23_f_15_yrs/,"Note: In this post I will refer to myself in the first person, the girl will always be the female pronoun, and her boyfriend will be the male pronoun.

I met this girl while working a summer job in 2013. We hit it off as friends immediately, we would hang out after work for hours and just talk. A month or two into the summer I started to feel romantic feelings for her, but just before I asked her out I found out she had a recently had a rough breakup and so I felt the need to hold off.

By mid october I could barely hold my feelings back, and one night I confessed. She said I was a great friend but that was all. She wasn't interested in dating anyone, and also wasn't attracted to me. This put me into some mild depression and had some serious repercussions on my schoolwork for the next two semesters.

By the end of the school year I am barely holding it together. On the surface we are still great friends, but the fact that is all we'll ever be is eating me away. My feelings haven't diminished at all, and she, as far as I can tell, is just trying to ignore the whole issue. At the very end of the semester I start going to the school counselor.

Last summer we go to separate cities for our internships. We remain friends, but don't talk as much as I wish we would. I still think about her nearly every day, and wish our lives had gone a different way. The bomb drops in July, when she tells me she has started dating a guy in the city she is interning in. 

I break. 

I call my boss and take a week off work to go home and be with my family, but even then I spend most of my time crying. At one point I ask her why she was willing to date, having thought she was still just not interested in dating anyone, and she says she really wasn't, but she just gave him a chance.

That phrase ""gave him a chance"" burns my soul, I feel as if she gave him a chance that I should have gotten. We are wonderful friends, and she probably trusts me more than anyone outside her immediate family, but for some reason she can't even imagine a world where she would date me. 

I have been alone (romantically) for a very long time, and she had given me hope, and I can't bring myself to give up that hope. I finally found a person I unquestionably want to spend time with, who, when I'm with her makes me happy. However, when we're not together, and I think about her, I feel sad, lonely, and afraid that she doesn't really care. When I go to sleep, I long for her to be in my arms, but I know that she is longing to be in his arms, and that almost always makes me cry.

A part of me screams that I should do something, anything, to try to win her over. Another part says I should never speak to her or see her ever again. But most of me wants to be her friend, to be there to help her when she gets hurt, and to celebrate when she's doing well. This series of events is having a huge effect on my life, and its becoming more negative and less positive.

**tl;dr**: I love her, as a friend and more, but she doesn't feel at all the same. As time goes on, that difference is causing me more and more pain. Please help."
2xpp6k,1,2015-03-02,[F4M] Boss/Secretary Long-Term Roleplay!,OfficeWhoreDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xpp6k/f4m_bosssecretary_longterm_roleplay/,"Every workplace of any substantial size has at least one official office slut. She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

**Detailed/literate/long-term responses take priority. You can also include a picture of what you'd like my character to look like/be wearing for extra points**

**I received a ton of responses to this in the past and please note that only DETAILED, LONG-TERM RESPONSES WITH BUILD-UP will be responded to. Thanks!**

I could do that in spring, but also in in the fall (proceeding the spring).

If I started in spring, I wouldn't waste any time, and immediately start taking courses (2nd year CS). How my schedule would be.. wouldn't that be weird? If I only take technically the first semester of second year, I'm probably not going to be ready for any internships in the summer right?

The other issue I thought of is just fitting in. It would seem like everyone would be in their right place and I'd just be starting in a random spot. If I waited until Fall, I'd just be like a regular second year person, with the same schedules and stuff !

Although, I would have the spring and summer off..what could I possibly do? Would that be a good time to try to get ahead in some of the courses, or somehow try to make my understanding of CS and programming higher? I wouldn't know anything about this though..would that mean just coding by myself and trying to make some stuff for the resume? 

What would you guys or girls do in my position? Start in spring or wait until fall (next year)?  "

2xq5tz,12,2015-03-02,Depressed looking back on college,catdog25,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2xq5tz/depressed_looking_back_on_college/,"
As I sit here looking for jobs several months out of college, I see no prospects with the social science degree I earned, and on top of all that, I have no fond memories of college. Few memories that really stick out with me, you know, the ones you want to hold on to forever. Right now, college is just some haze that I don't like to think about too much. I have been meaning to write this post for awhile now, but was conflicted on how to format and direct it. Take it as you will though, advice or not, but here it goes.

You know those cliché portrayals you see of college life in the movies and on TV and all? You know, the ones where you have the time of your life, hook up with all the girls (this is from a male's perspective btw sorry!), and become the main man on campus? Yeah. Get rid of that. All of it. I found that the worst thing to do in college was to hold too tight to expectations. I wanted that college experience, the nights out that you remember forever, lasting friendships, the best 4 years of your life. Well, in the process of attaining that, it is easy to spend most of your time stressing out and worrying about how you haven't reached that yet. The truth is, that while some nights are fantastic, most nights are just average, and all those wild raging parties? Well, sometimes they aren't all that fun anyway, it depends on the type of person you are. Which leads me to my next point, 

You don’t need to try to be anyone you aren’t. Really! You will see plenty of guys, PLENTY, who appear to be the life of the party, and while you might be asking yourself why that can’t be you, you are not realizing how unique and special you already are. Find your own niche in college. Sure, try out the party scene for a bit when you first start out, but realize there is more to college than just that! If you have fun with it, awesome, but if you do not, and don’t enjoy drinking, don’t feel like every Friday night has to be a drunken ragefest. There are so many other things you can focus on in college. Yes I understand, it is almost impossible to avoid alcohol and partying in college, but my point is that doesn’t have to be you if you don’t want it to be. Which leads me to my next advice…

GET INVOLVED. Seriously. Do it. I know how hokey it can sound to join school clubs, because I felt the same way. Freshman year I felt I had to make my OWN social life, so I negated all the offers I came across to join clubs, and I totally regret it now. And not just clubs, just campus events in general, guest lectures, something volunteer related, a writing group, a science club, anything! I made most of my friends this way. And all the students I met at a freshmen wandering the town with looking for parties? Half of them dropped out freshman year, and the rest I never spoke to again. Don’t let anybody tell you who should and shouldn’t be your friends. Only you can decide this.

And now onto one of the most difficult dilemmas of college life, balancing academics and a social life. Well, to be honest, there is no one answer to this, because everyone is difference. Some people can ace exams with only a night's worth of studying, others need weeks of studying just to barely pass (that’s me right there). The big question of which is more important, a social life, or your career can be a huge stress inducer in college. Of course school work is the most important we will all think at first. Grades grades grades! That’s why we went to college right?? Wait… but what about the “college experience”? And making friends? And creating memories? Aren’t these supposed to be the best four years of my LIFE?? What if I am not actually enjoying myself? What if I really am spending too much time studying and not enough time enjoying life? I mean you only get four years and you will never relive them again! 

And so you see, this can be quite the issue. And here is my best advice. Combine them. Yup. Plenty of disciplines and major fields in college have clubs and activities attached to them. Go to lectures with people from your classes. Go to career mixers related to your field. Try making friends with people in your classes, etc. A social life doesn’t have to revolve around just going out and randomly finding parties. You can hang out with people who share your academic interests and in the process encourage one another to succeed. Trust me, my science major friends always party together. They have crazy fun and also do crazy good research.

As far as choosing a major? Oh boy this is a hard one. Mainly because there is no real answer to the conflict of what you love to study vs. what you should study. My best advice here is to think about what kind of degree you would love to say you have. Try this. Think of yourself maybe 5 or 10 years out of college at a party with other professionals, and someone asks you. “Oh what did you study in college?” What would you like to answer to them? What would you feel proud of having earned a degree in? Think about it for a bit, and realize you can start working towards that right now. As far as what is a good degree to pursue, well that doesn’t really matter. I am a firm believer that NO major is superior to any other major. You can excel at ANY major. Don’t let anyone tell you that you chose a “party major” or your major isn’t actually a “real” major. If you are passionate about it, stick to it, take every opportunity that comes with it, take any internship you can that comes with it, learn everything you can about it, and then see who comes out on top. As for what to DO with that degree? Well as someone who is having trouble trying to find out what to do with their degree, and is having great difficulty with it is well… I wasn’t prepared. I chose my major on a whim because I didn’t know what else to do. Please don’t do this. This is not a good way to choose a major. This is why I believe it is CRUCIAL to explore all you can freshman year. Talk to other students. Look at those bulletin boards you see around campus. See any cool study abroad opportunities? Any cool fellowships or internships? What fields are they in? What field makes you say wow that’s pretty cool! What field makes you think wow those people seem so smart! What field makes you say to yourself, wow I would love to be in that field! That is a good starting place. As for jobs after college, research what you can actually do with such a degree, and if the names of possible positions sound good to you, then awesome! You might have figured out a potential path!

So that’s all I have time to jot down for now. I hope it wasn’t too long. I just wanted to share this with people here. I apologize if my writing seems a bit sloppy and doesn’t reflect that I have a college degree, but honestly I am so tired of writing professional sounding cover letters that I just wanted to write this as it came into my head. I hope this helps new students with adjusting to your college life. I realize my words will not apply to everyone, but I hope people gain at least a little something from them. Don’t feel pressured to live college any one way. It’s your four years to make of it what you wish. Oh and also take some risks. Sit next to that group at the dining hall, raise your hand in that GE class, and talk to that cute girl who sits in the front of the lecture hall. Just do it. Take note of something she said during lecture and then ask her about it after class. Trust me. Take the risk. Don’t be me and sit at home 4 years later wondering why you never took the chance and what could have come. 

And so I wish you well in college and hope you have a successful experience whether you haven’t started yet, or already have. You will be bombarded with new influences and perspectives, and this is all great. But remember to always be true to yourself. I made so many mistakes in college that I wish I could do over. What I would give to start those four years all over again. I chose a major on a whim, largely just followed my dorm mates in whatever they thought was cool and followed them to whatever parties they knew of, and was always too shy to talk to that cute girl in my class.
To me the most important lesson is to just be yourself. No really. I know you probably hear it all the time and it sounds corny, but it’s true. Even if you are shy and introverted like me, people might just like you for it :)

2xqal3,0,2015-03-02,Being a role model while becoming agnostic,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xqal3/being_a_role_model_while_becoming_agnostic/,"I used to be Catholic.  I was pretty lukewarm most of my life, then I dated a girl and she got me into it, then I went to another state on an internship and decided to get involved in the local youth group as a mentor of sorts.  The kids loved me to death and they were great kids.  It made for a great summer and some great memories.  I've since left the church.  I'm not really here to discuss that but it's probably relevant.  I asked myself why I believed in God and I realized that the best answer I had was because my parents told me to.  In retrospect, it was a long time coming.  Anyway, I've got this group of kids that I'm a role model for and now I'm not sure that I can responsibly continue doing that.  It's not that I've seen them at all since this happened, but I've got a few of them on facebook and another sent me a friend request the other day.  They're all ""restricted"" so they can't see anything and I'm basically maintaining radio silence because I don't know what to do.  Interacting with these kids in the first place, I signed an agreement to exemplify catholicism etc. but they're 18 now so that doesn't really count.  Even so, I feel like not doing anything alienates them while reaching out feels like denying their faith (not something I'm really looking to do).  What do you think about it?"

2xqc30,8,2015-03-02,"Second ""del gatto"" threat in the mail within the year. Nboyfriend wants to end it, but doesn't want to be the 'bad guy'. Hell ensues",MommyDearestHoldout,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2xqc30/second_del_gatto_threat_in_the_mail_within_the/,"This is the first threat card that came in a no-return addressed envelope last may: http://imgur.com/gla6OMW

This is from last week: http://imgur.com/MGnliNZ

What urks me is this ""del gatto"" used a phone number that is an unlisted cell phone number, Nmom doesn't know his home phone nor his home address.  So its pointless to write out the Nboyfriend's cell phone number, if this was a credible threat it would list a contact information in which could connect 'del gatto' with someone who has some leverage over the Nboyfriend.  Its just another less than retarded ruse only the Nboyfriend would assume sounds sly or clever.  Its not.

After this last letter in the mail I did some research.  Last March the Nboyfriend used my Nmom's credit card to purchase 3 vacuum cleaners totaling over $5,000 to demonstrate so he can sell them door to door.  Personally I think he's using these high end and not exactly high quality vacuum cleaners to introduce himself to another sugar mama so he can leave my Nmom for greener pastures.  Which is why the ""del gatto"" letter showed up 2 months later.  

Now its shown up again, and he claims to also have skin cancer, a small yet malignant spot.  He's also a smoker, so he has convinced my Nmom he's really sick more likely more than just skin cancer.  He uses this as an excuse to not call her and talk for 30 minutes or more everyday and to not have to spend 2-3 evenings with her a week.  

So I googled keywords.  Like the brand name of the vacuum, in the Secretary of State registry of corporations.  The Nboyfriend was kinda dumb to register the incorporation, he as the executive.  Worse he used a business address that has been owned by a guitar shop for over a decade, so its not really his business address.  Better yet he used a home address, I checked the county tax information website; its his address with his wife.  Which I googled again (the street address), which quickly showed its a hud housing lease residence.  I don't know what to make of it, when I have looked up houses before which I know are HUD leased homes, HUD isn't listed as the owner.  It could be they eventually lost their lease or it was foreclosed upon and HUD hasn't been able to sell it yet.  I don't understand these things enough to fathom.

The Nboyfriend is also claiming to be working, double shifts.  At a job which my Nmom had paid his tuition to earn a 9 month certificate, it took the Nboyfriend 3 years.  Nmom paid his tuition, books, rent, expenses during these 3 years then got him a job through a medical vendor at work. If the Nboyfriend and his wife had this HUD house, then the Nboyfriend would get $$ for tuition as part of their program. So that's another possible hustle on his part.  The Nboyfriend promptly lost the job after 2 months classroom training he was paid for, and 2 actual months work then another 2 months short term disability.  When he got off of short term disability they fired him for being an ass and telling surgeons he know more about medicine than they did.  Now after cranking on me since I moved in with my Nmom to get a minimum wage food service job despite having a bachelors degree and 7 years of corporate experience.  When I sit down and think about how a hypocrite who doesn't work, lives with his wife who is on SSI &amp; Section 8; demands my mother throw me on the streets, I think about how everything the Nboyfriend tells her is a lie.  The Nboyfriend wants me to suffer his existence, he also wants to blame me for his break up with Nmom.

I can tell the Nboyfriend is sending the ""del gatto"" messages, because he cranks on my Nmom to sit down and lecture me for hours a few times a week and he makes weak excuses to avoid calling Nmom.

At least I have an address to start with, its possible the Nboyfriend's wife still lives with his wife at this address.  Yet I don't think so. 

I am exhausted from all the Nboyfriend's lying, how my Nmom sucks up to the lying and never ever asks for proof.  Nmom claims that the Nboyfriend has not lived with his wife in 17 years and they are only married in name.  Yet this incorporation, the HUD house address shows he still lives with his wife and had a HUD mortgage within the last decade.

The business address for the incorporation is actually a guitar store, which the owner of the guitar store also owns the building.  So I don't understand why the Secretary of State didn't bother to check the business address.  Nor why Nmom didn't verify the business rent checks she gave him went to an actual lease of a business space, because it didn't the Nboyfriend pocketed that money too.

I am so sick and tired of this hypocrite and my Nmom lying for him.

How could any adulterous affair be so twisted?

Edit: Update 3-5-15 

""Del gatto"" might not be the Nboyfriend, but his lousy younger brother who was a army psychologist.  Since retiring and since he's not willing to do the extra university course work or the internship to be a psychologist in private practice he can't be a licensed psychologist.  This younger brother spends his time on the internet chatting politics (at one time I posted on one of the same chat forums and we discussed his brother's affair withy Nmom tongue &amp; cheek, that was icky to explain to the moderator).  His other hobby (the younger brother) is to be his brother's keeper).  Well it could be a note from the younger brother.  

How do I know, its embarrassing to say.  It was a bad decision on my part. Yet after being interrogated, lying about it (I so rarely have a reason to lie and obviously when I do I am damn good at lieing without me recognizing that I lie pretty well.  I just finished listening to the recording from my smartphone. I put the spare smartphone hidden away, and record usually Nmom's &amp; NBoyfriend's convos. Actually look at my username profile and you can find uploaded snippets of these recordings.  Nmom and Nboyfriend thinks its either the Nboyfriend's younger nutjob brother who is also unemployed, or a former ""business associate"" who is currently incarcerated. Or this former business associate is a figment of the Nboyfriend's imagination, or a imaginary person who takes the blame for a failed illegitimate business (there were/are plenty).

Either way these index card threats &amp; one phone call opened up a can of worms. Which the Nboyfriend &amp; Nmom discussed in vague detail, yet affirmed many of my suspicions.

Fuck this is so weird, and stupid."

Back in my Spring semester of my Junior year of college (2011) I did a Low-carb diet with my roommate and lost 40 lbs or so from beginning to end of the semester.

I went to the Gym 6 days a week, Chest and Tri's, Back and Bi's, and Shoulders 2 days a week each. I also ran 3 miles a day on the treadmill after each lift, and played Intramural Soccer on the 7th day of the week.

I didn't do any calorie counting with the Diet, just maintained a steady level of Carb intake.  My meals we're mostly grilled chicken, salad, ground beef, certain deli meats and cheese.

Long story short that Summer being back home with my friends and working Full time at an internship combined with no Gym access ruined it all. 

So I'm trying to get back into that same way again.  I'm all set on the Exercise part since I know what worked last time, but I need some help on the Diet aspect since I want to take a more scientific approach this time. Using a couple Calorie intake sites from the FAQ put my daily ideal intake at somewhere between 1750 and 2100 calories/day. 

What are some good ways to start this process and what about some apps to help?

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

&gt; FitnessCurls, flatmate who doesn't share a room with me. Hopefully has not seen my dick

&gt; ShySlut, current romantic interest of yours truly. Slowly but surely living up to her name

And making a special guest appearance for this installment,
&gt;BetaBoy, ShySlut's ex. Apparently alcoholic, co-dependent condom-poker

Episode III leaves off with me in the apartment. ShySlut has since left to go back to her place for a shower and a change, and after my roommates have gotten ready and left, I hop in the shower to wash off the shame of the night before.

Ever treat yourself to one of those double showers? Like you wash regularly and then crank up the heat and do it again? I recommend it. After I am done, I'm feeling much more clear headed and ready to bitch out ShySlut in the calmest manner possible. I shoot her a text.

""Hey, are you going to the dining hall""

""Yeah, heading there right now actually""

""Okay cool, I'll meet you there""

I get to the dining hall first, which is weird because I have to wait for a shuttle to get to my apartment and take me to the main campus, whereas ShySlut just has to walk a few hundred feet to the dining hall. I figure whatevs, I drop off my bag at a table and start toasting myself an english muffin. I relished the days the dining hall was slow, because if you were nice to them, the grill cooks on the morning would hook you up with the most legit sausage egg and cheese on an english muffin you've ever had. Plus I needed my comfort food to deal with the stress of chewing out ShySlut (fatpeoplestories incoming)

I scoot back to the table where I had put down my bag and drop off my plate, because the next endeavor was coffee, which takes every ounce of my being not to spill everywhere. I grab a mug off the rack and make my way over to the coffee dispensers, get me summadat breakfast brew. On the way I see ShySlut out of the corner of my eye. I wave her down and gesture over to where I had put my food, and immediately revert my eyes back to the subtle science that is adding cream to coffee so that it's at that optimal tan/brown color.

I then proceed to waddle back to my table, holding the mug with both hands, because over-filling a coffee mug is worth getting that perfect cream to coffee ratio. I manage to successfully deliver the beverage to my table with minimal spillage, and I'm mentally prepared to berate ShySlut with various vulgarities, but something has managed to avoid my hawk-like gaze. Sitting across the table from me, is not just ShySlut, but BetaBoy.

What. The actual. Fuck?

Now I've seen BetaBoy in passing once or twice, so I definitely knew who he was, but there is no fathomable reason I can imagine him being anywhere near me or ShySlut, much less at the same table. I wasn't in the mood to begin with, but now I'm pissed on multiple levels. Clearly something's going on that I'm not privy to. ShySlut apparently just had to get emergency contraception to circumvent an attempted forced pregnancy from this fuck

She shoots me a look of the most defeated glance one can imagine, and after a few minutes of listening to BetaBoy attempt to discuss the day's plans with ShySlut, the situation is starting to become all too apparent. They're still together, and I'm the other guy.

I'm the other guy, eating breakfast, with the guy.

I am so fucking mad at this point, I had half a mind to reach across the table and sock her in the face. On top of that I feel terrible, because this poor guy is sitting across from the guy who just screwed his girlfriend.

She gets up to get dry cereal and chocolate milk (i don't know why, but that's what she always ate) and I about lose my shit. She smells like my body wash. She used my shower before she left, and used my body wash

She sits back down and I literally can't bring myself to look at either of them. 

""So are you liking the music program so far?""

I look up to see BetaBoy's feeble attempt to socialize with me. He literally has no idea. Two people sitting at the table smell exactly the same and you have no idea. You poor bastard. At this point, I can't think of anything to say, so I do the only reasonable thing that came to mind. I stood up and walked away.

I don't even bother putting my dishes away, I just got up and walked out. Luckily a shuttle was ready to take me back to my apartment when I got to the bus stop, so after some internal deliberation, I decided to get in it rather than underneath. I throw my bag on the aisle seat and sink in against the window, when
&gt;BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzz

I open up my  phone to see a text from ShySlut
""Are you okay?""

""Not really. You two are clearly still together, we just had sex, you smell like me, and you forced a very awkward discussion with SkinnyDreds. We need to talk""

""Oh, okay. Don't get the wrong idea please, it's not what you think! He made me promise that we would try a break instead of a full-on breakup. I have no intention of getting back with him though""

""We just need to talk in person. You put me in two extremely uncomfortable situations in a row and that's not okay""

""Lol. Betaboy just told me to be careful around you. He says you're not a good guy because you were very short with him and wouldn't look him in the eye""

I turned my phone off for about three days at this point

TL;DR: Ex boyfriend turned out to not be an ex. ShySlut smells like an obvious night at my place and her boyfriend is hopelessly naive to the entire situation. Also ShySlut proves herself to be kind of a selfish bitch"
2xr438,2,2015-03-02,I love sex too much.,Throwaway_8262829,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2xr438/i_love_sex_too_much/,"I (F20) have been in a long term relationship with my boyfriend (M 21) for a year and a half. We love each other and we get along really well for the most part.  I have been there for him without hesitation when it came to him having to move out of his apartment with a day's notice. I let him move into my room and I have shared my car with him since, picking him up from work at 2am on some nights. 
M (my boyfriend) dropped out (took a break?) from school starting this spring semester. He is/was going for a computer science degree. 
I am however still very much in school. I am a full time mechanical engineering student with a part time aerospace internship that happens to pay very well. 
I try to be really involved on campus and in my community. I am the secretary of an engineering club on campus and a Big Brothers Big Sisters volunteer. I believe in improving myself and the lives of other people as much as I can (while I also of course have lazy tendencies like spending most of the weekend watching Netflix/playing minecraft). 
I love M because he's more down to earth than me. He is realistic in his expectations and knows when to laugh something off. I can honestly say that he brings out the best in me, emotionally. I can get depressed a lot of the time and he is constantly there for me in those ways. 
This post isn't about the emotional side of our relationship, because for the most part I think it's pretty great. It's the sex or lack there of that is troubling (at least for me)
In high school I had a boyfriend my senior year that I lost my straight-virginity to. With him I experienced my first female orgasm and it was just AMAZING. We just ""lit up"" when we were together and were extremely horny teenagers. 
I want that sexual experience again but M doesn't initiate and when I stop initiating (due to low self esteem from constant rejection) he initiates about once a week, and only if we are drunk. I have no idea why he wouldn't want to have tons of sex with me. I like to think I'm attractive and intelligent and fun. Plenty of guys threw themselves at me my freshman and sophomore year. 
Our sexless relationship has been an issue from the very beginning and I just thought it would get better with time. 
I didn't mention that he only lasts 1-3 minutes.. And that is honestly heart breaking. I try not to show it though because I don't want to hurt him. I just feel like he could put more effort into this. It's depressing when he lasts for such a short amount of time and refuses to go a second time! In high school my record with that boyfriend was 3.5 times in a row!
I used to think college would be a time for sexual enlightenment and whatnot. I wanted to experience my first double female orgasm, where they happen two or so in a row... But with M I don't think it will ever happen since he doesn't give me enough time. And at this point I'm so emotionally invested into him and his family. Not to mention how compatible we are on this deeper level. I can't imagine myself being shallow enough to break up with someone because of the sex (or lack thereof). 
TL;DR: I love sex and my long term boyfriend does not necessarily. Also he lasts 1-3 minutes and that makes achieving orgasm for me difficult. "

2xre6c,1,2015-03-03,Job Search Anxiety and the last year of my life,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2xre6c/job_search_anxiety_and_the_last_year_of_my_life/,"Ever since around the end of my Junior year in college, I'd say that's when I really started to have anxiety about graduating -- more specifically, what I'm going to do after I graduate. I hadn't had any internships, and didn't end up landing one that summer either. So now, I'm looking for jobs and I have little to nothing to show for real work experience. But those are just the details.

Around the start of my Senior year, I started having real symptoms of anxiety. Rapid heartbeat, even though I was totally at rest. The feeling of my stomach dropping (best way I can think to describe it) 50-100 times throughout the day. I got really good at preventing my body from letting that happen. There were certain days where I knew I would be battling it *all day*, and other days where I knew I should be alright. It was especially worse at night. Well, I sort of got over it around Christmastime. I still get times where I feel like I'm going to have another anxiety attack though, and now that graduation is looming I feel like things are going to get worse. This is seriously not good for both my mental and physical health, and it doesn't help that I was lonely/depressed before either. My family is all going to come out to see me graduate. I'm afraid I'm going to have to, as usual when talking to people, answer questions about where I'm going to work, if I have a job, and so forth. I hate it so much. Even my peers do it. I'm so jealous of the ones who already have jobs lined up. They get to go through their final year of college knowing that they have somewhere to go when they graduate. Graduation should be a time of celebration, but the idea of it only brings dread to me."

2xrf52,1,2015-03-03,"My SO (32M) and I (25F) have been trying to patch things up for a month now, but I don't think I want to anymore. (Long vent)",[deleted],venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/2xrf52/my_so_32m_and_i_25f_have_been_trying_to_patch/,"My SO and I have been together for almost 3 years now. Like anyone else, we have the good &amp; bad, but everything good is just lying over a deep, dark foundation. Before we became a couple, he managed to hack into my social media accounts and snoop into my business. I didn't find this out until months later, but it made a lot of sense because he was very suspicious and judgmental of me all the time. I have a promiscuous past (that I'm not ashamed of) and he always held on to it. He never liked me having friends of the opposite sex, or my social life. I was very social and outgoing before I met him; I stayed busy, went out on free weekends, and was always with friends. He judged me for going out because I have a son. I tried explaining to him that I would only go out at night when my son was away on his weekends with his dad, but he still thought it was wrong ""for a mom to be doing things like that"". 

Well, I did change my behavior. I stopped going out as much, and I don't drink nearly as I used to, almost not at all. We still got into several arguments all the time and looking back I think it was because he wanted so much of me to change, and I was feeling sheltered and miserable. 

It wasn't like he kept me at home while he went out, though. He did everything in his power to make sure I was his number one person. It felt nice, because all my past exes were horrible and cheated on me. I felt so comfortable with his loyalty to me, I never felt so stress free about someone (in that aspect). Although I never asked him for this, he had no numbers on his phone that were to female friends, and he didn't speak to others at work. He really devoted his whole being to me. It is a wonderful feeling to be so sure that someone loves you. 

But then again, I guess this is why our relationship was so dark. He did everything in his power to assure me I was everything to him, but then held it against me because I didn't do the same. I couldn't comfortably go out with friends alone because he ""didn't understand why he couldn't come too"". Instances like that just made me not want to go out at all, plus the fact that he would text me all night if I did go. 

But that's just his jealousy/trust issues. What was the beginning to our end was his lack of motivation for anything. He has been unemployed since July '14. The job he had he worked for 6 months and was unemployed for a long time before that one as well. He has two courses until he completes an A.A., but never went back for that either. He also will never separate from his father. The two won't (CAN'T) do anything without the other; they are useless without the other. His father financially supports him, and he does any paperwork or important day-to-day things for his dad (because they have the same name). It is frustrating. I can't suggest that we move out somewhere away together because his dad won't want to move there. Once, when we were daydreaming about our future, I mentioned that his dad could be in a back house or a separate room downstairs and he immediately scolded me for trying to put his dad in ""a doghouse"". He said I was being selfish because he didn't judge me on the fact that I have baggage(my son) but I wouldn't accept his. I never spoke about his dad again--albeit a lovely and sweet man, but they are both enablers to each other. 

**I'm so sorry if you've made it this far. I just needed to vent about the most of this...and this isn't even all of it.**

Anyways, so that's how our past has been. I do love him very much. Although all I'm saying is negative, he is just a troubled man with a bad past and my psych-instincts keep telling me to give him the chance and the opportunity to change himself. When we broke up, we said some nasty things to each other and I realized even after all this time he still judges me for my past, how many people I've slept with, and how I parent. We ended up apologizing to each other a few days later and he told me he promised me he would change...and he has. He has been proactive: he signed up for health insurance, is getting glasses, went to his school to re-register(although he won't start school until the fall) and has had a few tests for employment in our county. He has also asked me to find some information on where he can do internships to help him find employment better. He is making progress, and although small, it's big for him especially with his personality. 

The problem is, now that we have separated, I am loving being single. I am not out partying, drinking, screwing guys or anything like that. I got myself a hot, short haircut and bright hair color. I have picked up going to the gym and yoga, and I feel great! I plan on joining the psychology club at my university because I no longer feel any reservations about there being guys there who would talk to me. I am making it rain with copies of my resume to employers everywhere, because I'm trying to find a better job. And, I'm working on a research paper (With a brilliant MALE student-teacher) and planning on submitting it to a symposium so I'm pretty mentally taxed, **in addition** to being a mother. He doesn't have a connected phone, so he can't really contact me, only sometimes through email. This gives me even more freedom, and I have been slowly rejoining my friend circles whenever I can. I feel horrible that my SO is doing these things to try to keep me at his side, but I'm slowly drifting away and enjoying my new busy life. I wish he would continue to do things without me and for himself. 

I feel so conflicted, but now that I write this out I think I know what the right thing to do is. It feels so bad, and it hurts like hell, but I feel as if we will both be better off without this dark cloud of our failed relationship looming over us in our lives. 

If you're reading this V, I'm sorry love. We just couldn't save this relationship."

     I am currently a Computer Engineering at San Jose State University, but I am debating transferring to Cal Poly in Fall 2016 as my sister went to Cal Poly and I feel like I would fit in much better in SLO.  I have spent time there and really love the town and surrounding area. However, I have a few questions:

1. I am fairly introverted and therefore don't have a lot of friends here.  How hard will it be to make friends as a transfer student?

2. How is the Computer Engineering Department at Cal Poly in terms of internship opportunities and hands on education?  Obviously, being in the Silicon Valley, there are lots of opportunities in the San Jose area and want to make sure my options would be relatively comparable.

3. As a computer engineering major, how difficult will it be for me to transfer classes? I've looked at assist.org so I have a little bit of an idea, but was wondering if anyone here had some insight? 

4. I am currently taking CMPE 30 here, which is an introduction to C Programming, however the class on the flowchart for Cal Poly is a CS Class, and therefore does not transfer on assist. Is there any way I could get credit for a class like this?

Any input is greatly appreciated, I am really trying to figure out what to do in the coming years. Thanks in advance!!

EDIT: Fall of 2016 not 2017. Wasn't thinking properly when I posted.

So since I was little, my mom raised me with a very hoardery/""collector"" mindset, and this mentality has followed me throughout my life in different ways. Lately, this has manifest in the form of my rapidly expanding makeup collection. Back in August, I got my first thing of nice eyeshadow, a baked Lorac palette, and the first time I used it was honestly a game-changer. Up until then, I'd only used low-quality drugstore shadow, mostly ELF and Maybelline. I honestly didn't realize that eyeshadow was supposed to be that smooth and blendable, and it only made me want more. And more and more and more.

I was doing honestly alright until right after Christmas, when suddenly all these deals started popping up from brands I really wanted to try. At first, it didn't seem like a big deal, and I was sure that after I checked out a few brands, the sales would dry up and I'd go back to normal spending habits, but it feels like every week there's another palette begging me to try it. Like now, I just bought a palette for $18 in the Too Faced sale and I'm so stoked about it, but I literally dropped $100 on the Lorac Hautelook sale four days ago and I have no business buying anything else for probably the rest of my life. The justification for spending $100 on Lorac? It's my birthday this week. Which is such a weak excuse and I'm really mad at myself for doing that, and even though I'm super excited to get all the new products I ordered, I know I'm still going to want more the minute they get here.

I'm a grad student working an unpaid internship. I can't keep buying all of this. I've had issues with compulsive spending in the past but never this crazy. I'm hoping that posting here will help keep myself under control. You know Spirited Away? I feel like No Face when he gets into the bath-house, just devouring palettes left and right."

I am a student currently trying to save up some money for a house deposit or something for when I finally start working. I have saved up 30K throughout my highschool years and through uni scholarships. Currently I only make whatever youthallowance gives and I live back with my parents who dont want any rent or food costs (so pretty much no expenses).

I am looking to place my money in a high interest savings account until I can get my job lined up (internship as a doctor) before I decide if I want to pay up a deposit on an apartment.

I already have placed my money in Ubank with its Ultra feature - 3.75% (if I deposit 200 per month aka youthallowance). I was wondering if I could also open up an ING Orange Everyday + saver account for that 4.00% interest. The trouble is ING needs 1000 per month to be deposited for the bonus interest (otherwise its 2.5%). 

What I was hoping to do was to move my 30k to ING and then shuffle 1K between my Ubank and ING accounts each month for the bonus interest. My question is would that work?

Anyone have any experience with this type of thing?

Thanks for your advice people."

Though I think mine is a bit more different because of work practices in Eastern Europe and my general situation, so here we go.

My situation is quite shit in large part due to my absolute lack of experience. I'm currently employed at my first job - the sysadmin at the IT department of an Eastern European university, top exact sciences uni in the country. I got the job offer straight after getting my bachelors. I've been working for 2 years, part time.
At first it was hell - I had absolutely no experience and during my studies I learned next to nothing about sysadmin tasks. This was my first experience with both Windows servers, Linux servers, setting up and maintaining all kinds of application and web servers used for educational purposes (got thrown head first into setting up and configuring Microsoft Sharepoint and Dynamics ax), advanced networks (those fancy industry grade routers, nuohmygod) Part time turned into pretty much full time, it's just that I was working days on end from home. During the first year it stabilized - I learned to manage all of my work in a more or less timely fashion (new software was the exception sometimes), but I was burned out as fuck.

At that point my part time salary was 280 EUR with no raise in sight. I also started getting shit from a single higher-up colleague about me coming in late/leaving early. The habit developed because of my overtime from home - I could manage it all a lot more efficiently from my home and was always there in person when it was required, no matter the time of day. Still, it was true that I didn't come to work at 9 at didn't leave at 5, I came after 10 and left shortly after 4. After having had the talk with said colleague, I'm now working 9-5, 2 times per week with whatever extra work is required from home.

Said colleague (and higher ups, to whom I talked about this later on) straight up said, that I shouldn’t be surprised if they let me go if ,when I finish my masters, I don’t go straight for the PhD. If I’m not into science, I’m a waste of resources for them. We’ve also hired a 2nd trainee sysadmin, the guy is even greener than me, but I assume that he’s supposed to learn from me and eventually replace me when I’m let go. (they assume that I won’t go for the PhD. I’m a good student, one of the top ones, but definitely not the Star student that they assume would want to get into science) The thing is, I’m really not sure where I stand. I’m gonna have my masters degree in IT in 9 or so months, so I still have time. Everything that I’ve learned – I’ve learned by myself. No tutoring, no nothing, just google-fu. Granted, the knowledge I’ve gained in these ~2 years is immense. Pretty much going from 0 to being able to handle my whole department in a timely fashion is a huge deal to me. Of course, it’s nowhere near a perfect sysadmin environment. Security and performance were never big concerns – getting shit done on time was, so I never learned any good practices in relation to that. The fact that we use loads of different software made it so that my primary concern was to get it all up and running without any issues, but I didn’t really have the time to delve inside any of those specific systems and set them up flawlessly, good practices were at least partially ignored. So here I am. I’ve started slowly considering my options. I’ve already sent my application to a small IT company that was interested in taking me in before I got the lucrative offer to work at my university 2 years ago, but for now all they can offer me is a free internship, but I really didn’t spend 6 years studying IT for this shit. 

Of course, there’s also an option of getting my PhD and doing, as they call it here, science, but I’m not sure if that’s what I want to do at all. The environment isn't terrible, but it’s definitely not friendly. Everyone seems to consider themselves a big time scientist with everyone else without a PhD being a dumbass code monkey/PC repair guy. 

In the end – it could be worse, but it could be loads better and since I’ve never changed workplaces, I just hope for some advice. Also I needed to vent, thanks.

2xs5z7,1,2015-03-03,Life Expectations vs Reality,[deleted],ExpectationVsReality,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/comments/2xs5z7/life_expectations_vs_reality/,"When ever you were younger you had plans of where you wanted to be when you were older.  You had expectations and even planned around those ideas, but there's always something that almost always gets in the way........Life.

      On turning 26 this month I reflected and thought wow I'm in a way different place than I thought I would be in life than my 18 year old self expected.  

    A little background on myself I never have really wanted much just enough to be comfortable, even though we all want to be rich/famous(if it happened I dont think any of us would mind at all).  I grew up in a town of about 100,000 people, graduated from a christian school and my families middle class. 

  So my expectations: 
-go to college graduate with an engineering degree when I was 22ish, 
-have a long term girlfriend about the age 22(maybe the one I was with at 18).  
-I wanted to move out of my town and get a good job when I graduated, nothing extreme just enough to get comfortable. 
-When I turned 23-25 get married and about 28ish start a family.  -During college I expected to throw back a beer or 2 when I turned 21 but never get drunk.  I'm a pretty conserved person and not really outgoing as I'd like to be.  

So here I am 25 going on 26 and while its somewhat on the same line its much different than I expected.  I went into college and dated that girl for three years(until I was 21). I thought she was the only one for me, young love's blinding and funny right? She turned out to be a crazy bitch and cheated on me.  Thank God that happened though because I was about to put a ring on it and she did the number one thing I can't tolerate.   Now I'm here at 25 and have been single for 5 years, shoot I haven't been on anything I really consider a date for that long.  That relationship put such a bad taste in my mouth and made me even less outgoing.  It's really nice though being single because I don't have to really worry about taking care of someone.

Now for college. I started out going for my bachelors degree and did better than I did in high school grade wise.  The crazy girl I was wanting to get the MRS degree.  If some of you don't know what the MRS degree is its where they just go to college to find a husband and leech off him and his money their whole lives and she doesn't really work at all.  So I decided to try to do the quick way out and get an associates degree in computers to start a life with her and her leech like ways.  It went very well and I was earning the degree quick with good grades. The Semester before I was due to complete my associates degree, that's when she cheated and I as completely devastated.  I had no idea what to do with my life, so I was just like hell with it I've gone this far and got my associates degree.  I then moved to a much big party school for my bachelors, and well i partied.  That was the worst I've ever done in school.  So I decided to move back to where I originally am from and went to school, but before that of course I make friends and then have to leave.  I came back to the school I got my associates from, but I had no interest in engineering anymore and decided to study film because I worked in the broadcast industry and loved the job.  I finally got my bachelors degree when I turned 24 the semester I turned 25, 2 and 1/2 years after I expected to get a degree. 

As for moving out of the town I lived in I did for a year going to the party college, but had to come back.  The only time I left for an extended period of time was a 3 month internship in Florida.

Now for the job.  Luckily this is one of the few things that has gone right because I found something I love doing.  Now its not engineering but its broadcasting and I love it.  I don't earn as much as I expected, but I'm at least comfortable and actually have a job.  I am in a boat load of student loan debt though.

For the drinking part I never expected to be where I'm at now when I was 18. I had my first taste of a fruity drink with alcohol in it when I was 18, but couldn't care less.  I started to actually drink when I was 20 and discovered I like to party.  This is still one of the things that I can actually socialize with people, sadly.  So I do enjoy drinking to socialize, but if there's nothing for me to gain then I don't drink.  Hey though I never thought I would be like this when I was 18. 

What the message I'm trying to convey is that you can't really plan out your life, only a path that you would like to take that you may not like and have to change paths or even worse fall off the path.  It's like this, life is like a staircase you can look at the steps in front of you and want to plan 4 to 5 steps in front of you.  The thing is you're planning for the 4th and 5th steps and not the first step right in front of you, then when you take the first step in front of you could trip and fall because you're paying attention to the 4th and 5th rather than the one right in front of you.  The tripping is life, it throws curve balls at you that possibly ruin the other steps that you planned out. 

The final thing I have to say is live life and don't always expect everything to go to plan.  You can make plans and expectations, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't go as expected or doesn't happen at all. 

Thank You for listening

2xsa15,15,2015-03-03,What We Think Works,Deus_Viator,SourceFed,https://www.reddit.com/r/SourceFed/comments/2xsa15/what_we_think_works/,"A lot of the mood lately has been negative about various changes and i've participated in my fair share of that but feedback goes two ways. We can contribute just as much, if not more by saying what we think works instead of what we think doesn't. This is a thread for the other side of the coin, what aspects of the new videos do you like and what do you want to see more of? 

This whole thread was actually inspired from the Leonard Nemoy video on SFN which I thought was extremely well done, dealt with the topic in a mature and respectful way and getting in the interns for their experiences was a nice touch.

Similarly i've been liking a lot of the tech news videos, especially with Trisha (the apple watch one is the most recent I liked off the top of my head) as they are very direct with the information but still leaving enough space for the personalities without letting each one become it's own sketch. Reina's short anime educational videos are good as well, as someone who is completely lost in that world, and I learnt a lot from them.

2xsc8a,6,2015-03-03,Should I [23/f] still marry my depressed fiance [24/m]?,idoorgoodbye,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2xsc8a/should_i_23f_still_marry_my_depressed_fiance_24m/,"TL;DR - Fiance [24/m] has gotten depressed 3 times in the last 3.5 years. I [23/f] am unsure if that's the life I want for myself. 

I would to preface this by saying I love my fiance. He is caring, smart, funny, and treats me the way any girl deserves to be treated. We have been together for nearly 3.5 years, have been engaged for the past 2, and our wedding date is in a month. We are nearly perfect for each other - have the same goals in life, have a similar sense of humor, and are best friends. The only problem is his depression.

I first heard about it when we were dating. He told me he was depressed around July 2011, a couple of months before I met him. He had an internship in a very small town, lived by himself, and was the only college-age person in the office. Apparently it was too much for him, got depressed, and had to have his parents bring him home a month before the internship was actually over. I guess that would've been depressing - though I wouldn't have given up after 2 months like him, but I chalked it up to it being his first time living alone and being more or less isolated. 

Fast forward about 2 years, November 2013. We got engaged February 2013 and he graduated college in May 2013, moved to a city 6 hours away from our college (where I still went), and roomed with 2 fellow graduates. He hated that town (I would too.. it's awful), hated being away from both me and his family, and apparently had a stressful time at work. So he got depressed again. This was worse than before and he attempted suicide twice. He eventually got better, and by March 2014 things were back to normal. This time I attributed his depression to being away from people he cared about, and not being able to care for me (he's that type of person). At this time I also learned that his mother has been on anti-depressants for most of her adult life. 

Now, here were are at February 2015. Life has been pretty good... I graduated and moved to a city 8 hours away from home, and he came to join me in January. We were happy. But it is also an uncertain time in the industry we work in. Both of our companies are a little unstable at the moment. His company has laid off quite a few people. At mine, layoffs are impending and bankruptcy is on the table.  We (mainly me) are also knee-deep in wedding planning (less than a month to go!!) It's a little stressful, but it's manageable. All you can do is keep on going. And then, out of the blue, the fiance gets depressed again last week. Nothing bad has happened. He has to take off work because he can't focus. It's utterly horrible being around him.. he's all mopey and miserable. He has told me that he will just need to take medicine, and it may be that way his whole life because he has some chemical imbalances.

So Reddit.. here's my dilemma. It's one month til our wedding. I'm already $15,000 into it. I consider myself very good at handling stress.. but I can't handle his issues too. I love my fiance very much and a few days ago, couldn't imagine a future without him. But I worry that this pattern will continue my whole life with him, and when he's depressed, it affects my mood too. And what if something ACTUALLY bad happens in our lives? I don't know what to do, Reddit. I am so lost. 


UPDATE: Just learned that he (along with his group) had gotten a meeting request last week (and didn't freaking tell me or his family) from someone who ""lays off everyone"" on March 12th. Since he's not a permanent part of the group he's currently in (he rotates every 6 months since it's a newbie), I really don't think it will affect him. So I guess there's a ""reason"" to get depressed. But to me, it's still uncalled for. He should have just powered through it, updated his resume, and applied for a couple of jobs just in case. That's what I would've done. Now I have to coach him through this because he's not strong enough to do it on his own. 

UPDATE (2): Found out from a coworker that this person who ""lays off everyone"" actually just comes to the office to discuss goals, etc once a year with all the employees individually. So my fiance freaked out over nothing... 

UPDATE (3): Called to check in on him over lunch, and he tells me that his parents are here... We live 8 hours away. More non-communication from him. It definitely makes things more difficult to hash-out and discuss things.

I need your advice.

So, to make a very long complicated story short…

A few years ago in graduate school, I met a very nice boy (He wasn’t a man, at all haha). We met at a bar (typical) and hit it off pretty quickly. Now, he wasn’t very good at courting me then- but I was smitten, so I didn’t pay much attention. 
We dated in the same town for about 5 months and then he had to move about 45 minutes away (to this parent’s house) for an unpaid internship. (He couldn’t afford the gas to travel from my place every day). 

During this time, he didn’t visit as much as I had hoped- even though I offered him gas $. He said I should come visit him just as much (but I lived alone, and he lived w/ his conservative parents and we had to sleep in a separate room). So this caused some tension.

Then, I took a temporary academic-like position for 8 months about 5 hours north of our town. I got a 2 bedroom and asked him to come with. At this point, we had both finished grad school and he was unemployed. He didn’t come with. He stayed at home and eventually got an on again off again shitty fencing job. This caused a lot of tension. 
So, I was applying to jobs all over the country- but mostly West, as it was our dream to move west by the mountains. He didn’t apply to jobs with me, though.

So, I landed a great job w/ benefits out west. He didn’t come- he landed a job in the same town we had been in. This job required a 2-3 year commitment. And he took it, without asking for a night to think about it…This one hurt. A lot. I felt nauseous. Like I was in love w/ someone that just wouldn’t commit. 

He promised he would come out west after his 2 years- so we stayed together…well, we tried.

I got out here, alone. It was very hard. I had an injury that didn’t allow me to do much all winter and I was very lonely and still really hurt over him taking the job. Eventually, I started to feel like I wasn’t important at all. If we got into a fight, he wouldn’t respond for days- because he was “busy with work.”

So, I couldn’t take it anymore and broke it off (hoping he would see what I meant to him). It backfired. When I caved and said I missed him weeks later, he said he didn’t love me anymore. He told me this via email after 2.5 years together. . . 
So, I was depressed. For months. Sick to my stomach. Lost 12 lbs…etc. But, I moved to a hip city a little further from my job. Made a bunch of friends. Got into new hobbies. And I was REALLY starting to feel happy- but, I still felt empty, a part of me was missing. We really did love each other.

And then, he fucking writes me. The morning after I had an amazing weekend and met someone I think I could really like. 
Now we are talking again and he wants to move out here. He said he realized that he was scared of leaving his home town, his home state, his job, and his family- and he feels sick to his stomach that he hurt me due to his own fears. 

What do I do, Reddit?


A part of me feels like I was on my way to a happy, well-rounded life- and I know I would meet someone who would never take me for granted.

Another part of me feels that if we didn’t have that break up and the time  apart- we both would have kept fighting, treating each other like shit, and it would have been a disaster. (Which is most likely what would have happened- I wasn’t perfect either- by the time things were falling apart, I was such a cunt to him). 


Thank you for reading this and any advice you have is much appreciated. 

** tl;dr** The love of my life and I broke up. 7 months later he contacts me. Just as I am starting to feel happy and okay without him.

Rosie Jones: http://i.imgur.com/1sqXaxm.jpg

I have five main ideas, but I want to hear yours as well! I like it to be as realistic as possible:

1. You are a journalist, and the questions and topic gets a little naughty.

2. You are a fan who happens to meet her. Maybe on a beach / staying in rooms next to each other in a hotel / At a bar or club / At a fan meet up etc...

3. You are a teenager living with his parents. They decide to hire someone to help around the house, little did they know that she is a glamour model. You are a fan, and have jerked off to her countless times. I imagine that there would be lots of build up in this scene, as you want her badly, but she not so much wants you.(This scene would only work with Jessica or India)

4.You work in the photography industry, but you aren't a photographer, e.g. Light guy, set up crew, intern, agent etc...

5. You are my lawyer (I'd love to hear your ideas for this scene, as I have never tried it out so I don't really have many ideas. Nothing to do with leaked nudes though!)

6. You are a student who is going on a school trip to Spain for a few weeks with a few other students, and your hot teacher Ms. Reynolds (India). She shows off her amazing body in sexy bikinis and you get to know her a little more personally... 

Any of these scenes can be fully-con, semi-con, or even non-con if you are interested, but it doesn't matter if you don't like that aspect.

I'd also like to create a threesome scene, so If you are interested in that pick two girls from the list!

Some kinks that I am interested in: Facial, blowjob, titfuck, public, clothed, groping, threesome. .

I'm always looking for some fun so don't think that you can't message me a few hours after I posted this :)"

First time I ask if she wants to hang out sometime when she isn't being paid to be friendly with me. She says she doesn't give her number to guys she doesn't really know and proceeds to give me her Twitter and email. I @ her on Twitter a couple times and we follow each other, blah blah.

I get a DM later and she says she lost my number somewhere between her for foyer and living room. I respond with my number. She texts me and says now I have her number, what is my next move?

We stayed up talking that night until about 2:30am... I thought I was doing well. Still hadn't got her to agree to a date yet because her water had froze up that week so she was busy dealing with that, blah blah.

We text a lot the next couple days, then things get weird. She had been arguing with her mom one night and randomly texted me ""my phone is wet"" ""heading over"" and she showed up in a few minutes and me totally unprepared. Brought her dog with her and she sat on the couch. I pulled up a chair directly in front of her... And I think I fucked it up at that point instead of sitting with her.

Sat around and talked for a few minutes. Let her cool down... And now the texts are few and far between. She has said that she wanted me to know she wasn't just blowing me off and that she has actually been busy... But I don't know, seems a little excessive for it to not be intentional.

Did I read the signs right? I mean I do not doubt she is busy, she's in grad school, working, doing an internship, and has a dog to care for by herself. But if you were interested in someone you would find some time, right?

I've deleted her contact and our conversation today. I genuinely liked this girl and at first felt like she had interest in me too, but now I'm doubtful so it felt easier to just delete her and treat her like a bartender again.

Is it possible for me to recover from this and possibly get another shot? Just leave her alone for awhile and be a normal bar patron for awhile and see if she opens up again?"
2xtduy,4,2015-03-03,Why do I have so much difficulty getting offers?

I apologize for the way I came off there; I was very upset at the time I made that topic and I didn't present myself the way I'd like to.

So, I seem to have a lot of difficulty getting job offers.  I don't have much trouble getting an interview, but I often hit a wall after the interview and get declined.  

Here's a bit about me: 

- I go to a school ranked #10 in the nation for my program (Marketing Bachelor's)
- I have a 3.85 GPA
- I have great internship experience as a Marketing Consultant Intern
- I have many other related work and volunteer experiences
- I'm involved in extracurriculars related to my major
- I've had people in my school's career center and company recruiters look at my resume and they said it's amazing
- I've done multiple mock interviews and was told I did a fantastic job
- I have extensive training and knowledge on what to do in recruiting (thank you emails, follow-ups, what to say, how to sell yourself, how to answer interview questions, etc.)
- Personality-wise, the words others most use to describe me are: sincere, intellectually curious, determined, intelligent, driven, and conscientious (and I often get complimented on one or more of those in an interview)

Despite all of this, I haven't gotten a single job offer across 20 or so interviews. Every person I know is shocked by this. My friends, my family, my professors, people in the career center, etc. They all say I'll do incredibly well and be super successful, landing some great well-paying job out of college.  It's creating a ton of pressure on me when everyone I know has such high expectations of me and I keep failing.  I'm getting to the point where I'm losing hope because, as far as I know, I'm doing everything right, I'm doing everything I should be doing, but it's not working and I don't know how to fix it.

So please, any help and advice you all can provide would be much appreciated - thank you!  "

Posting here because it feels like a safe space and because the only thing that has been helping is to share my story and hear others' in the past week.

Quick story: My partner of 10 months broke up with me about a week ago, and I was completely blindsided. He played the role of a loving, caring boyfriend until exactly the moment of the conversation. To make matters worse, this happened 2 days after I matched at an internship site (I am getting a doctorate in psychology) an hour away, and I factored him into my decision about ranking sites because I believed that we had a future together (and he did not inform me otherwise). I felt ready to build a life with someone and wanted to make the relationship a priority. The site is still great, but my idea of what it will be like next year has crumbled in a matter of seconds.

Either way, I have accepted that the relationship is over and that he does not love me. I am trying to practice self-compassion and remind myself that I am still lovable. I am trying not to panic about my age or my stage of life (turning 27 in a few months - hoping to graduate from my program in a year and a half) and to grieve and let go of the future I thought I had. 

I just feel like I need help with accessing hope. Can you tell me your stories of recovery and renewal after breakups? If you are partnered and feel loved, could you tell me about how you met the person despite feeling like that would never happen in the midst of a hurtful breakup?

For women in academia and/or with successful careers, who have focused their energy on their education in their 20's, can you give me some hope/support that I do not have to choose career vs. love or that I have missed the train that apparently brings people a life partner by age 24? (I know this is misguided)

Thank you so much in advance."

What I did not consider right away was that I was working in a different township than where my permanent address is (Moon Township near Pittsburgh PA as opposed to my permanent address in Upper Allen Township in Central PA).  Apparently there was a form to give to the company stating this that I did not provide right away, and only ended up sending in the paperwork towards the end of the internship.  I thought about this when I was calculating what my tax refund should be, and I was wondering if this will have a significant impact on what my refund will be.  My current estimated refund is something around $1,100 and I was wondering if my error will cause me to get less of a refund (or even have to pay extra).  Any thoughts will be very much appreciated!

I was a brilliant student a decade ago, but I dropped out of college due to family commitments. Along the way, I got random jobs to support my family, ended up doing different things to get by.

I'm now approaching 30, married, with a kid. The last couple of years I worked at a small private school in Agadir teaching languages (Arabic, French, English) and computer science (algorithms, programming, networking..). I didn't have any qualifications (since I dropped out of college), but I initially got the job through a friend who asked me to fill in for him while he was doing an internship. The school ended up calling me back on and off, and at some point I became the replacement for my friend when he left for a better job.

Then the school went through some financial issues a couple months ago and ended up closing. I have since been out of a job, since applying to any other schools required having formal qualifications. Even though I have the knowledge, experience and know-how, I lack any of those qualifications.

I went through my humble savings, and still no luck finding a job. I applied for the call centers in the area (webhelp, comelia), but they are only hiring telemarketers, something I would be very terrible at.

Come Monday, I will have to answer to my landlord and face the likelihood of my family being homeless since I'm a few months behind my rent/bills.

Anyway, I'm posting here in the hope of hearing from someone who has any advice on how to go about getting a job in Agadir, taking into account my lack of qualifications. I can't move to a different city since it would be almost impossible with a wife, a child and no money. If someone knows of possible job opportunities in Agadir, please let me know. I would forever be grateful. "
2xudge,2,2015-03-03,I need some help on setting a path for the future,thrwawayfnclife,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xudge/i_need_some_help_on_setting_a_path_for_the_future/,"Hello Reddit, I am a 18 year old dude living in NYC looking for a few answers. I perfectly aware that at my age I shouldn't be worrying about what will be 20 years down the road and the main thing should be finishing college. I wasn't big on high school and my first semester ( fall 2014) I managed to get a 3.8 GPA, which I'm trying to upkeep ( probably will drop a few points this semester because of a bs prof). 

Anyway, I have a lot of choices in terms of career and I'm very lucky to have them but for some reason I feel so incomplete. In reality I'm not doing anything and it's making me really anxious.

On Jan 1, I left to Russia for a week because I needed a change of routine for a little bit and I met a girl there ( daughter of my aunt's best friend) and I fell in love. I ended up staying there 10 extra days because of her and now I'm returning there at the end of this month.

I've decided to start my adult life since returning ( working, financial planning etc) but I can't seem to establish myself, I'm not sure what I want exactly. I'm going for a BS degree in Accounting but I'm just doing it for the versatility of it.

My current school schedule is tues/thurs 8-2 and fri 9am-12pm so I have a lot of free time but the problem is I always feel like I don't have enough time to do things. 

I work for a company as a personnel administrator and make $200 a month ( startup company by college students ). It literally requires me to work a few hours a week but still I feel so loaded from it because I have to work about two hours on campus but I don't wanna stay in school after school.

I also work for my mom sometimes doing clerical work whenever she asks but I don't really like doing it because I don't know what it's for ( I feel pretty left out ( It's a family business) )

My brother's wife is offering me an internship at a company she works at which would probably look good on my resume, but I want to spend 2/3 of my summer in Russia and intern in August.

In September I will take courses @ H&amp;R block to become a tax specialist to do income taxes for people and make some $ on the side and get experience. 

Also my brother told me he will teach me how to fix cars so I can buy broken ones and fix em for profit. Currently I'm searching craigslist for such and he tells me whether they're worth buying or not for flipping.

Now with all that background ( sorry for sloppy formatting, this is my first time with this) I ask you Reddit, what should I do?

I don't know how to find a niche except for just doing random things but the problem is, I feel so busy when I'm actually not, which provokes me to go home and ""relax"" because I feel like I won't get the chance to later.

I want to set myself up so that I can make money anywhere ( incase I move to Russia when it's time to start a family (I'm that confident that I'll be staying with this girl for a long time ( not being cliche, just seriously took a lot of thought, spoke to my family about it,she's just the best )))

What should I do as of right now? I started saving money up but it seems like I'm not spending any money at all. Yesterday I accidentally broke a sprayer nozzle from my car. It cost me $15 to buy a replacement and I was anxious throughout the whole day because of it.

My skills include : computers ( I know how to build em ( but who doesn't really), 110 WPM, fast learner, able to communicate well with others 

I'm pretty sure I have more skills, I just don't know how to classify them.

Once again, sorry for the sloppy format.

I'm very anxious and I would like a path or some incite on what I can do in the near future to set myself up for the future.

This is when places such as Waterloo, Guelph and even Carleton, begin to stick out.

I have a 92 average, and with my AIF, I don't really have any worries when it comes to an acceptance from places such as Waterloo, however, I've heard that Loo is very boring. I've even heard someone use the word 'depressing' to describe it.

Hi, so as my username indicates, I'm a new intern at Ford (for this upcoming summer!). I've got one more year of college left, and I'd like to have a car for my senior year at college.

Conveniently, as a perk of working/interning at Ford, I can purchase a car (well, theoretically up to 4 for family?) discounted with their A-plan, which if I have done my research right, is a little bit below the invoice price at a dealership, how much below invoice depending on supply/demand and what not.

I plan to lease either way, probably for 24 months, maybe 36 months but no more than that. I figured I'd get either the Fiesta or the Focus since they're in my price range.

I'm thinking of buying one of:

* Fiesta SE, cheapest by a large margin ($60-80 less per month for the lease), also the ugliest by a good bit in my opinion haha

* Focus SE, larger trunk space and backseat, so just more useful if I need to transport large objects and/or people around, also safer by virtue of not being a subcompact

* Fiesta ST, sportiest/fastest/quickest, most fun to drive (if the reviews are to be believed!), costs almost exactly the same as a Focus SE according to Ford's online lease calculator

This is also going to be the first car I own, I usually drive my parents cars when I'm at home for breaks. However one big thing is that **I've never driven a car with a manual transmission before**. No matter which car I choose I'll be buying it with a manual since I've been wanting to drive a manual for a while, just never had the chance. This however, does make me wonder if it's worth buying a relatively sporty car like the Fiesta ST if I can't even drive a manual, I'd probably blow out the clutch within a month! 

All kidding aside I'm still worried that the Fiesta ST ""too much car"" for somebody who hasn't driven all that often and has never driven a manual, and therefore instead I should get a more tame car as my first manual, i.e. most likely the Focus SE.

TL;DR: Is the Fiesta ST a suitable car for a somewhat green driver who has never driven a manual?"

While the current job I work at is great, I feel like I've settled in a little bit and I have run out of more programming-oriented projects to work on (my boss has done a great job of helping me come up with some projects to lead). 

I was wondering if alternating jobs in short periods of time looks bad on a resume. I've been at my current job for about 7 months now and my last job I worked at for a year before moving. I left the first job because it was purely IT help desk support and I was more of a ""to be seen and not heard"" type of employee.

As a result, the only offers I have gotten are for internships geared more towards consulting and analytics.

- I am a college student looking for a summer paid internship

- I cannot afford to decline a good job offer (broke college student syndrome)

- I have been interviewing and looking for a paid internship since the fall semester. This includes mainly going to career fairs and talking with employers during their information sessions.

- I have been upfront with potential employers about this but I do not give specific company names to anyone.


Since last fall I have applied to about a hundred job postings and had interviews with about 12 different companies. Some of them I got eliminated immediately some of them I didn't. I originally interviewed with Company A in December/January. I went through two rounds of interviews with them and they both went very well I thought. Then I didn't hear back from them for awhile.

In the meantime, I approached Company B in February at a career fair. Got myself an interview with Company B in mid-February. Last week Company B informed me that I will be moving to the next round of interviews(last round). Also Company B's HR gave me an application to fill out that was different than the public one.

Yesterday, Company A called me with an official offer. On this end it felt very ""out of the blue"" to receive that offer. I had assumed that they had filled the position with someone else. I asked for some time to think about it, and to email me the paperwork. Company A's HR gave me until the 3rd week of March to accept the offer in writing.

All in all Company A is a great opportunity, but personally I would like to work for Company B more. Company A is giving me a summer position only. The position I'm interviewing for at Company B is more long term. (1 year, full-time summer, part-time during school year.) Company B also is known to convert their interns to full-time employees while Company A is not known for that.

Do I approach Company B and tell them I've received an offer but I am still interested in their position? Would it seem rude to tell them that I have an offer from somewhere else?

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2xv0lu,2,2015-03-03,"[internship] Have an offer from Company A, Moving into the final round of interviews with Company B - I would like to work for Company B ... looking for advice.",collegeinternthrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xv0lu/internship_have_an_offer_from_company_a_moving/,"Some background on this situation:

- I am a computer science major (junior) looking for a summer software engineering internship (paid)

- I cannot afford to decline a good job offer (broke college student syndrome)

- I have been interviewing and looking for a paid internship since the fall semester. This includes: applying to jobs, going to career fairs and talking with employers during their information sessions.

- I have been upfront with potential employers about this but I do not give specific company names to anyone.

Since last fall I have applied to about a hundred job postings and had interviews with about 12 different companies. Some of them I got eliminated immediately some of them I didn't. I originally interviewed with Company A in December/January. I went through two rounds of interviews with them and they both went very well I thought. Then I didn't hear back from them for awhile.

In the meantime, I approached Company B in February at a career fair. Got myself an interview with Company B in mid-February. Last week Company B informed me that I will be moving to the next round of interviews(last round). Also Company B's HR gave me an application to fill out that was different than the public one.

Yesterday, Company A called me with an official offer. I was ecstatic to receive this offer from Company A because I really liked them when I interviewed with them. However, the time frame threw me off a little bit so I asked for some time to think about it and review all the paperwork. Company A's HR emailed me all the paperwork and gave me until the 3rd week of March to accept the offer in writing.

All in all Company A is a great opportunity, but personally I would like to work for Company B more. Company A is giving me a summer position only. The position I'm interviewing for at Company B is more long term. (1 year, full-time summer, part-time during school year.) Company B also is known to convert their interns to full-time employees while Company A is not known for that.

Do I approach Company B and tell them I've received an offer but I am still interested in their position? Would it seem rude to tell them that I have an offer from somewhere else? Is there a professional way to handle this? What I am most worried about is that Company B will drag out their interviewing process past the 3rd week of March. If I come up on the deadline of this offer with nothing back from Company B, I will accept the offer from Company A. Even though Company A is a short-term opportunity it is still a really good offer.

2xviqq,38,2015-03-03,What depression *feels like* in law school,justsayinkthx,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/2xviqq/what_depression_feels_like_in_law_school/,"I've seen a lot of posts and articles claiming that law students suffer from depression at rates of around ~40%, but there seem to be very few narratives about what it *feels* like to suffer from depression in law school. 

So here goes:

I spent most of 1L convinced that law school was just stressful, and that everyone was stressed out...so how can you tell that what you are experiencing is ""abnormal"" as compared to how everyone in law school just is? (By “abnormal” I really mean worthy of clinical treatment...). How is *anyone* supposed to react to what we deal with?

During 1L, my hair started falling out in clumps. It was everywhere. I'd find hairs in my books. One time I looked on the floor around the chair where I study and it was like a ring of hair had formed all around me. Every time I found hair it was like a persistent, tangible reminder that law school was actually attacking me. The physical experience of my hair falling out was like a confirmation of the despair I was feeling inside.

I started grinding my teeth. I lost my 20/15 vision and had to get glasses. I lost touch with most of my friends from before law school. Sometimes I would sit on my bathroom floor and just cry. Other times, I couldn’t cry but I would try to force myself to cry because I knew it would make me feel better. I saw a therapist who said “if you were crying every day I’d be really concerned.”  But honestly, I know myself, and not being able to cry feels SO much worse. It feels like a sickness inside you that you just can’t get out. I wished I could physically cut it out of my body.

I realized at some point that all the people I know are crazy. Some just act absurdly, some have really strange or strong paranoias, some have serious additions to alcohol, some are so self-interested that I’d be tempted to call them psychopathic. We all have problems but we never, ever talk about them. No one ever talks about getting help. No one talks about needing help. Everyone just buries it deep down in themselves or deludes themselves into thinking that they don’t have a problem.

2L has been better than 1L in the sense that everyone around me is less stressed out. But the feelings of alternating anxiety and depression remain.

Some days, I'll come home from class and it just feels like I've been beaten up. Sometimes it feels this way even if I haven't been cold-called, even if I haven't said a single word to anyone. 

I have this pervasive sense that everything I say isn't smart enough, and that everyone is making fun of me behind my back about how stupid my comments are. It doesn't even really seem like a paranoia because I've seen how viciously people (all of my friends included) attack others for being slightly imperfect or mistakenly committing a faux pas. One stupid comment and you’ve developed a reputation for being dumb among hundreds of people you don’t even know and may never talk to.

I force myself to do almost all of the reading, but it always feels like I haven't read it close enough or didn't understand it the ""right"" way. It always feel like I am not prepared enough for class, not prepared enough for the exam.

It feels like I will never be a good lawyer because I can't do everything perfectly.

Most days feel like a huge struggle. I force myself to go to class, but every time I force myself to go I lose a bit of the small amount of willpower that remains in me. Some days, my will is just so depleted that I can barely get out of bed. I'll wake up, go to the bathroom, and go directly back to bed and wrap myself in as many blankets as possible. 

I know that a lot of my negative thoughts aren't true, but I think them and feel them anyway. I try to change my thoughts to more positive ones, but that also eats my willpower.

I came to law school with lofty goals of actually making a difference in this world, but it feels like I haven’t been able to fully take advantage of the opportunities available to me because either I am just not good enough or I am totally incapacitated by my feelings.  

Sometimes when an opportunity that I am excited about is available to me, I fail to tell the person in charge that I am interested because the worry that I am not good enough is just too overwhelming. 

I haven’t told anyone at law school that I have any feelings of depression because I don’t want to appear weak and unable to handle the pressure. But I also feel like my school has a culture problem because everyone is purely self-interested and they don’t really do anything to make sure that students with mental health struggles get the resources they need. I don’t feel like anyone at school really cares about me, or about anyone else besides themselves.

I am irrationally scared that my summer internship will just disappear and I’ll be screwed.

I watch an extraordinary amount of Netflix because I just don’t want to deal with my actual life. I will watch things that I have already seen, because it’s somehow comforting that I know how it will end (and that it will end well). I also buy a ton of shit I don’t really need. I do dumb things like take tons of Buzzfeed quizzes. I waste a ton of time on Facebook but don’t actually use it as a tool to contact people I care about. I know that I am using these things as an escape. I procrastinate, and then do a lot of my work in the panic that results from not having enough time to do stuff. But unlike undergrad, I don't have enough energy to start before the panic sets in.

I am tired all of the time. I drink cups and cups of coffee but it feels like it just washes right through me with no effect. 

I go home after finals and I can’t get out of bed for days. After 1-3 months I feel a little better, but then I return to school and everything falls right back where it used to be.
 
Does anyone else feel this way? Is it different for you?

2xviw4,79,2015-03-03,I NEED some advice on how to get my career started after 8 months of fucking up,Accardi_Don,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/2xviw4/i_need_some_advice_on_how_to_get_my_career/,"I need advice on how to get my life and career back on track and fix all the mistakes I’ve made

It seemed so simple, make a name for myself as a writer/director while enrolled in film school, take on some internships during the summer breaks, take full advantage of the wonderful equipment my school had to offer and build myself a kickass demo, and all leading up to moving to LA after graduation and working my way up the industry ladder like the rest of you with my folks helping me out during the dry spell of unemployment. But I fucked up so bad.



I should have seen the writing on the wall when my dad lost his job. Now internships in NYC or LA seemed incredibly impractical, so I decided to not bother with them and just focus on school. MISTAKE #1



I am an incredibly introverted and quiet guy. I never had any idea my introversion would had any negative effects on my life outside of having a lower number of friends from other people.  It became incredibly difficult for me to make an impression on other film students and convince them to join me in collaborative projects. Where other writer/directors/producers could sell the hell out of their pitches and make themselves seem like the next fucking Refn, I would quietly and awkwardly pitch myself while sweating like a stoner at a DEA waiting room. Guess where the DPs, Sound Designers, Effects Artists, Editors, and PDs all flocked to? While I did eventually make some connections and networks with some awesome guys, I had nowhere near the number of connections I should have gotten, and lets not even get started on the sheer number of projects I had to drop due to there not being any interest. MISTAKE #2



I didn’t want to be anything other than a writer/director. I had no backup plan on any other career in film; not editing, not cinematography, not producing, I WANTED TO BE THE WRITER/DIRECTOR. Where my much smarter friends would take classes in digital cinematography, lighting, advanced editing, and even Steadicam (to the point that they actually changed their career goals and are now finding jobs as either ACs, Best boys, or assistant editors) I was stubborn and only took the directing and screenplay classes as my electives, with 1 exception! I took a dolly class. It was fun. MISTAKE #3




Because I was so bad at pitching myself and my screenplays in order to build a crew, I could only get a couple of unambitious projects off the ground.  The projects that did end up going to production would end up looking pretty rough, due in large part to the director (ME) not knowing how to make the maximum use of a 5 man crew, and the producer (ME) not being able to properly finance the project. So now I have a directing demo reel that looks pretty bad. Ironically enough, my dolly demo reel actually looks pretty good. MISTAKE # 4



I write as well as “direct” so I kept all my screenplays ever written in PDF form on a special hard drive. During my final year of film school I moved to a dangerous part of town and while I kept to myself and tried to be a good neighbor, some kids decided that it would be a blast to break into my apartment 5 days before I graduated and steal my laptop and all my hard drives. While I could contact my DP and get copies of my raw footage back, my screenplays from the past 6 years were gone for good. It had never occurred to me to back them up into either the cloud or another hard drive. MISTAKE #5



After graduation last May, I had a conversation with my parents about me moving to LA and trying to get my foot in the door in the industry. It became obvious that moving to LA without even at least a minimal job offer, would be risky especially since I didn’t have my parent to fall back on in case money got tight. I decided to just try to find a job in my college city just so I could maintain myself and hopefully make time to work on sets on my time off or write some new screenplays. MISTAKE #6



I eventually found a job working at a call center back in my college city in October, and this is where I am right now. I haven’t written a single damn thing since I moved back. And due to my long hours, I am unreliable to my friends still in film school as a member of crew, I’ve only been one 1 set since I moved back here in October. My job exhausts me and has led to me developing writer’s block. The writer’s block is what has really pushed me over the edge, have gotten so distressed over not being able to fill the blank page with words, that I started getting migraines. 



Ten days ago, much to the terror of my roommate, I had a pretty violent nervous breakdown that ended with me crying and paramedics having to give me some sedatives. I had to take a couple days off and see a professional. Guys, I wanted to be a filmmaker since I was 11. It’s all I ever wanted to do, but I fucked up big time during my four years in film school. I didn’t develop nearly enough contacts as I should’ve, didn’t try my hand in other areas in filmmaking outside of directing, have no internships or nonstudent film set experience I can put on my resume, and I’m in a soul sucking corporate job that has taken away all creativity I had.
I’m at a crossroads right now, I have been off the path for over half a year, I NEED to fix this. I know some of you here have been in a similar situation like me. I desperately need to hear some advice on how I can get back to working a becoming a filmmaker. I’m sorry for the long post I just needed to get all this out.'



TL;DR I made a lot of mistakes during my four years of film school and ended up with just a degree, a shitty directing demo reel, hardly any contacts, writer’s block, a resume with no set or internship experience, no real know-how on the more technical aspects of filmmaking (you know, the stuff you can actually find employment for), and a shitty call center job that led to me having a nervous breakdown. I need advice on how to get my career back on track.

2xvomy,0,2015-03-04,Completely fucked over by a pop-up 'College',Idonthaveapoint,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2xvomy/completely_fucked_over_by_a_popup_college/,"A few months ago I was looking into changing uni courses because the old one taught me that that wasn't really what I wanted to get into. 

So I look around at a careers expo in my city and find an amazing uni very new in my state but has a great history of 25 years in a state nearby. It has set up internships for you (normally very challenging to get in my area), it teaches you by actually making the content you need for your job which in turn, gives you experience. 

I thought this uni was a great idea. The $60000 price tag for 2 years of full time study hurt the pocket a little bit, but if the education was as great as it was, I'd happily pay it, knowing that I'd have enough experience by the time I'm out, to know that I'd be able to get some sort of income straight away. 

Well obviously that was a load of shit. Me at the time just before enrolling had a lot of shit going on in my life as it was (horrible job, family drama). Just enough to distract me from how badly run this college was. 

First day we get in to learn that one of our classes is cancelled for the whole trimester. Not okay. I just quit my horrible old job just to come study at a place that doesn't even have a class planned the first day. I get support off the government to live without a full time job on the proviso that I do full time study. By them taking away this class from me, I'm not longer a full time student. Already I lose out on $280 a fortnight which would have just pulled me through with the savings from my old horrible job. 

Second day, I tell the teachers I have to take the last day of term off because I'd planned to go overseas knowing it was 99% during the term holidays, to find out that I will 100% fail another subject if I do that because they had exams on that day that I wasn't informed about earlier. 

I told them this the second day, it wasn't until the 3rd week (which also happens to be the cutoff week for the cooling off period) that they told me, as I was leaving that no 'it's okay we can give you the exam a day earlier'. This was once they knew that they were losing my $60000. 

The other options they came up with for me was to take yet another class off this semester, further screwing me over financially. Or do the class, pay the $2500 for it and just be happy knowing that I would definitely pass when I redo the class. 

By having the first class cancelled alone (because there were family issues with a tutor and they weren't organised enough to get a replacement), I realised I would have to redo that class which would add on 3 months onto the end of this course. Let alone doing another class in that 3 months which I shouldn't be there for. 

But that's not all. For the government grant (which I was very thankful for) we were going to be charged an extra 25% on the $60000 we owed because it was a private college. 

So now I'm going overseas in little under 2 months, haven't been able to get into another uni course this semester because of it, haven't been able to get another job because of it. I found out today that I lost the government support (I knew I would as soon as I said I'd leave the uni) so I'm living off my savings. So I'm just stuck in a horrible limbo where all I can do is exercise, learn to eat better and organise myself heaps so I can blitz through uni at a much more respected uni in my area. All I want is a quick job for 2 months before I leave that I can go back to afterwards. 

Moral of the story is, whether or not your job makes you depressed, don't leave it until you're sure the next job/education path you go forward with, will work out. 

Good thing is I do have a seasonal job at an entertainment complex so I'm getting $200 a fortnight. I live at home and even though I pay for most of the bills because my parents can't, we're still going to get by until I go back to uni, pending my savings hold out, which by my budget they definitely will. 

If any Australians read this can you give me any ideas on how to let people know that this 'college' is giving out sham degrees (the quality of the classes compared to my old uni was nothing) and is falsely advertising what they actually offer?

Sophomore year, a lot of stuff clicked and I felt like I could really succeed in programming. I got an internship during my second summer, doing IT work for a company in my home town. It wasn't what I wanted ,but it was something. 

I tried getting a programming internship for my third summer in college, but I had no luck.

o hasn't been declared anywhere, nor do I know what the ""=&gt;"" operation does, so I am confused as to why this works and what exactly it does.

I want to keep it short and simple, and I hope you guys have some suggestions.

Now, we want those processes online, where employees can access them and it’s clear for everyone where the responsibility lies and there is something to fall back on.

2xw43u,42,2015-03-04,[B/s] Getting something off of my Chest,Pendragon01,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/2xw43u/bs_getting_something_off_of_my_chest/,"* Preface: To start off, this is more of a confession or journal entry, don't expect a wank session here. PMing with another Redditor who was **very** open and honest helped me work up the courage to do this, so thanks for the help.

I kind of have/had a thing for my 1 of my younger sisters (identical twins, 3 years younger) and we spent a lot of time together when she came back home last summer and stayed in my guest room. I was bit of a late bloomer and didn't really come out of my shell until I graduated high school (class of '08) but my sisters were always there for me.

My sisters are quite honestly very hot: they're about 5' 6"", blonde hair, blue eyes, athletic (they played soccer &amp; ran track), occasionally they'll wear reading glasses (I kind of have a thing for glasses, so this was always a treat) and just a lot of fun to be around. They dress attractively but not slutty. All around catches, basically.

The majority of what friends I had growing up were guys and the only time I could really talk, as in *literally* talk, to girls was in classes because I was willing/able to help answer questions if the teachers were busy. 

I've always been on the nerdy side: 5' 10"", glasses, on the heavy side until freshmen year and football slimmed me down &amp; bulked me up. I'm no George Clooney but I'm not *too* hideous. As for now, think nerdy redneck- I work in IT but do a lot of outdoor stuff (hunting, kayaking, woodworking, etc), and I tend to wear practical clothes (work boots, jeans/cargo pants, &amp; flannel). I'm still awkward around girls, not as much though. My sisters helped me out a lot, especially the one I was interested in, I'll call her Elise. 

When their college courses ended for summer last year, Elise came home and moved into my guest room. She started to hang out a lot with me and it was great all around: we watched tv &amp; movies together (I hooked her on anime and introduced her to ""Fairy Tail""), took turns cooking dinner, went shopping together. Elise wanted to try a few new things out so I taught her to kayak and we went rock climbing a few times. We went out to some clubs/bars together after she broke up with her boyfriend at the time. Cliche as it may be, I had a couple of White Knight moments when I had to pull some guys off her and wound up in a few fights but everything healed up OK (nothing too major, just some stitches) so thank God for bouncers. Basically your standard boyfriend/girlfriend activities and it seemed like they carried some more weight to me, probably because she was literally living with me. 

Elise has always had some trouble with depression (nothing too serious, just gets really blue) and towards the end of June she started to feel real down and didn't talk to me like she had been. She didn't really want to talk about it, just said she was kind of lonely. I kept trying to open her up and she eventually asked if she could sleep in my bed because it made her feel better. 

To my, admittedly, inexperienced self this was huge! **She** asked to sleep in my bed with **me**. I told her yes, if it helped her out she could do pretty much anything she wanted. (I'm pretty sure you could hear my heart beating the first couple of nights). We *just* slept together and usually woke up snuggled up together with me as the big spoon. 

I've always been a morning person and would usually wake up an hour or so before either of us had to get ready for work so I would usually kind of take advantage of the times I woke with my hand Elise's chest- I never squeezed anything but I usually didn't stop copping a feel. 

We got a little more comfortable with each other over a couple of weeks and she went from sleeping in full pajamas to tank tops and shorts; I kept wearing my usual pajama pants and t-shirt. I eventually started to talk to her about relationships and tried to kind of feel her out: she was helpful and never threw any red flags, so no bad signs.

One Friday night, I finally worked up the courage to try telling her a little more by asking her a kind of general/hypothetical question about more taboo relationships when we were in my bed one night- like if cousins loved each other in a romantic way, what did she think of them having a relationship? We don't have female cousins our age (they're all older and married), so I figured that it was obvious but not too creepy, and way better than grinding on her or any other answer the horn dogs here would say. Elise was quiet for about 5 minutes, not a word. I would have thought she was asleep if I couldn't see that her eyes were open, brow furrowed. 

Eventually she said something along they lines of ""other people can live their lives but that's not something she was into"" but she wanted to think a little more about it.

... [Shit](http://cdn3.teen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/james-franco-realization.gif). It wasn't the answer I was hoping for, but it wasn't **ANYWHERE** near as bad as it could have been. 

I woke up at my usual time the next morning but Elise was already out bed. I went to the kitchen where she had made breakfast, bacon and eggs which happens to be my favorite, to get some coffee. What really surprised me is that I **knew** we hadn't had any bacon in the fridge the night before. I... notice things and my memory is almost eidetic. She had been up long enough to go to the store and come back, with the drive to the closest store that was at least an hour. 

She asked if I wanted any. I nod, mumble ""yes"" and shuffle over to the table. She brings over our plates and some orange juice, we eat a quiet breakfast together with small talk about the thing we were going to do that Saturday (I had to finish sanding my back deck and she was going to go golfing). I ask her how she's feeling and Elise gave me a kind of weak smile and is still quiet. She looked into my eyes for a minute, then away before saying ""better."" 

The only thing she added was that she's feeling happier and that she wanted to to sleep in the guest bed that night. I nodded and kind of smiled down towards my plate. We're quiet for another couple of minutes before she asked if it was ok that she still stayed there. I love her, she's my sister before anything else and want her to be happy so I told her that. She gave me another smile and asked if I was done eating. She picked up my plate to take to the sink and gave me kiss on the forehead and reminded me that she [loves](http://www.chapterscapistrano.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Help.jpg) me. 

Eventually she went back to school when classes started again. We still talk, not as much as before but it's not awkward. She's a Marketing major and is in an internship at a pretty big firm and all but guaranteed a summer job there. It pays well, she's good at it and she met a guy so she she's doing well.

I'm still awkward but I've been told that I make it work. All in all, it was a part of growing up and the not knowing had been bothering me more than I thought.

I want to keep it short and simple, and I hope you guys have some suggestions. 

I’m an intern at a production organisation. They asked me to map all processes in the firm, using process modelling. Which is going fairly well.

Now, we want those processes online, where employees can access them and it’s clear for everyone where the responsibility lies and there is something to fall back on. We want it in three layers where you can click on a task (within a process model)  which will open a new window/layer with another process model. See the link below for an example.

I'm a 3rd year (out of 4) Computer Science Student from the Northeastern United States desperately trying to find work here in London, or elsewhere in the UK for the coming Summer.

So far, I'm having no luck at all. I just don't have enough contacts here to ask around like I would back home, and my University doesn't really provide placement help for non-graduates looking for temporary work.

As far as eligibility goes, I have a work visa permitting me to work full time until the end of the Summer (with the option to extend), so I do not require sponsorship.

My speciality is iOS app development and Web Design and lately I've gotten pretty good with Database Applications. In the past I've worked at Hewlett-Packard and Bose Corporation as an Intern.

Whatever the position, I'm absolutely committed to learning and making myself a proven member of the team - I would just like to devote more time to another country in this point in my life while I can. And what better way to do that than to work!

I have a resume handy, if you'd like me to send it to you please comment or PM me! Thanks :) "
2xwc4i,183,2015-03-04,UAxDeath and CCP Leeloo drama,EVE-RU_Insider,Eve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2xwc4i/uaxdeath_and_ccp_leeloo_drama/,"You guys are missing out on a drama which is going on eve-ru.com  
[As you already know, UAxDeath uses pretty fishy methods to gain votes](https://eveskunk.com/e/347842916).  
  
UAxDeath [posted his CSM campaign on eve-ru.com](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=112689) and received a great deal of criticism. Players accused him in attempting to get in CSM solely to become an insider, to strengthen his position as a landlord.  

Soon, CCP Leeloo, [who was an X.I.X member before getting a job in CCP](http://evewho.com/pilot/Astarta+Atrax), showed up and started defending the UAxDeath's CSM campaign. [This is her ""civilian"" account.](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showuser=34778)  
  
Soon she [registered on eve-ru.com as CCP Leeloo](https://twitter.com/ccp_leeloo/status/572804231050227712) and continued to counter community's accusations - in a fairly bold manner.  
  
[""We care about opinions of those who were chosen to the board by players. It doesn't matter if it's a carebear, a newbie, a leader of a nullsec coalition who doesn't actually play the game or a multiboxer. They made it in CSM because people voted for them. Why did they vote is something people know better.""](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=112689&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=2978250)  
  
This is a response to an accusation of UAxDeath not playing the game for quite a long time.  
[""9 out of 10 nullsec diplomats play EVE at forums and in chat conferences. I don't see a single reason why we should not listen to those people. Their commitment to the game is in no way lower than that of some carebear Vasya who spends 10 hours a day in an asteroid belt. More than that, diplomats who don't actually play the game are much more familiar with the player's community than Vasya whose social circle is limited to npc agents and drones in his drone bay.""](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=112689&amp;page=9#entry2978225)  
  
[""At the moment, none of our official regulations, including the white paper, prevent candidates from paying for votes in ISK or ingame assets. We will review our regulations on this subject provided that a sufficient number of representatives support it.
I don't think that paying for votes is unacceptable. Paying for votes is pretty much the same thing as giving promises to fix lags or to fix the POS code.""](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=112689&amp;page=14#entry2978780)  
  
There is more to it.  
https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/csm-x-candidacy-now-open/  
&gt;CCP employees, ISD volunteers, CCP interns, CCP affiliates, CCP strategic partners or employees of other gaming companies/games and family members of CCP are all ineligible to run for the CSM.  

UAxDeath is (or at least was) the executive producer of [Digital Forest](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-forest-inc) which is a gaming company. [He deleted this information from his twitter, but you can still see it on the cached version.](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:S2NplJPMkJcJ:https://twitter.com/uaxdeath+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ru&amp;lr=lang_en%7Clang_ja) If he still works there, he is ineligible to run for the CSM.  
CCP Leeloo commented this fact:  
[""This company localizes mobile applications, it does not develop MMO games. Besides this, the company consists of a single employee and was not really active for the last year. It is hardly a competitor to CCP. I've allowed a guy who is a programmer for a mobile gaming company to be a candidate this year, because this company is also hardly a competitor. A single person I had to exclude this year is a person who works for Star Citizen. No names, it's a private information.""](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=112689&amp;p=2981133)  
  
First of all, this is clearly a lie. [Digital Forest](http://en.dfcorp.ru/) is an active company which [consists of a number of employees](http://i.imgur.com/PJCtbz9.jpg), [runs a number of projects](http://en.dfcorp.ru/projects/), [attends conventions](http://i.imgur.com/G6yA3Ur.jpg) etc.  
Secondly, CCP Leeloo says that the rule [which she wrote herself](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=112689&amp;p=2981167) is actually misleading. It works only against specific gaming companies - and it is CCP Leeloo who decides which ones.  
  
What's going on? Why a CCP employee openly defends a candidate whose methods are of questionable ethics? I'm posting this on reddit on behalf of the Russian EVE community because I believe that it is the best way to clear up the situation."

Cutting to the chase, I have the repo for their website (Angular) cloned on my machine. So I can make code changes, do whatever git stuff I have to do and that's all fine.  I was also setup with a remote dev environment where I can ssh onto the server and navigate to my  own personal folder /my_name. All the devs have their own personal directory like this. The directory contains another copy of the website repo with git and all that. The files on this server are hosted on a private site 'https:my_name/serverURL.com' All changes I make to code on the server can be seen at this address. 

My question is, what should my workflow be?  I would prefer to work on the local copies on my machine and make all git commands locally, but then I won't be able to test and watch 'https:my_name/serverURL.com' to see my changes. I could get a plugin to automatically push my local changes to remote but then wouldn't I also have to switch the remote git branch to correspond to whatever local branch I'm on?  

I was hoping someone whose worked in this type of enironment can sort of just talk me through how this works.  I would really prefer to not have to work on the remote server all the time.

From talks around me i understand that Erasmus program is some kind of party time then you can have fun from the EU budget (free money - all needs covered), make friends go to see another country, culture and don't bother to much about studies for short period of time.

Thing is I don't really care about meeting new people or seeing new country, culture at present. More important for me is IT knowledge in theory and practice. No time for funny time as I already wasted a lot of it with video games and now sometimes struggling (i.e. English language).

So, have you been in this Erasmus program and maybe could share your experience ? is it worth if i don't want/can't to socialize with beer and people (no offense) but rather to work/study and gain experience in IT?
The choice is complicated by the fact that i just finished one internship and was offered part-time job which is perfect for my studies. If i go to Erasmus, i most probably will lost a perfect part-time job opportunity.

I know it sounds lousy question, but i really care about the time i do have; don't want to waste it for entertainment. So was you participating in any Erasmus program and could you share your experience as IT guy. Any advice is welcome.

First job I had during law school was an internship with district attorney's office and my mentor was a real by-the-books, bulldog attorney, a really talented lady and a total ballbuster. So one of my first job is doing the Informations where basically I have to ""inform"" the criminal defendants of the charges against them. 

So they bring all the defendants from jail to the courtroom and I read the charges against them.  My mentor had trained me to read *everything* in the information completely and in its entirety. So the defendants are sitting on the bench, orange jumpsuits, handcuffs, all together and I read the first guys stuff. 

""Burglary, conspiracy blah blah blah."" Second guy, ""petty theft, receiving stolen property blah blah blah."" Then I get to the third guy 

""Your honor, may it please the court. This is the case of the Commonwealth of Wankistan versus Mr Hicky Redneck. The changes against him are a violation of the crimes code, title 42, section 6, subsection section A.2"" Like I said, my mentor wanted me to read EVERYTHING.  My eyes scan along and then I stop. I look up at the judge, he gives me a smile because I'm a greenhorn attorney trying not to pee my pants, I look over to my mentor who gives me the 'keep going' signal, and then I look at the defendant who is wide eyed with a look of sheer horror on his face.

 So I hesitantly continue ""Incest, a felony in the 3rd degree. Specifically in that the defendant did have knowing sexual intercourse with a blood relative, his sister, an individual who suffers from mental retardation..."" I then go on to describe even more specific acts mentioned in the criminal complaint.  

I finally look up.  The judge's jaw hung 6 inches off the floor, my mentor is looking at me with a mix shock and humor and I'll never forget the look on the defendants face, a look of pure shame and the other prisoners are just staring daggers at him.

I was supposed to do things by the books but after the hearings were over my mentor pulled me aside and told me that I ""probably should have just read the statute he violated and not the actual crime."" She said his time in prison was going to be...""not very pleasant after that"".

2xxd5k,1,2015-03-04,I made a pact with my husband last night,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2xxd5k/i_made_a_pact_with_my_husband_last_night/,"I've been diagnosed with dysthymia and ADHD. I've been on medicine for a while and although it helps my outlook and mood, it does nothing for my motivation. For the longest time I've been chalking my complete lack of motivation up to my ADHD. I have an extremely hard time starting anything and once I start I have a hard time finishing it.

But yesterday I realized I might have been looking at this all wrong. Any time I have a day or afternoon off (I'm a student), I spend the whole day in bed. I lie in bed as soon as I get home from class or internship. I often take naps of more than an hour and can usually still sleep at regular hours during the night. When I wake up each day, I have a lot of ideas about things I'd like to do that day and they sound fun but then I just... Don't do them. I just browse reddit or play on my 3DS all day. I've started wearing sweatpants anytime I'm not in class or at internship and I don't put on makeup, brush my hair or my teeth as often as I used to. Cleaning the house or cooking is a total joke. 

So yesterday I realized maybe this doesn't have to do with my ADHD but with my dysthymia. I always thought it was more about motivation than depression because I don't feel sad. I mean I feel ashamed that I am living this way but I'm not in bed because I feel sad. I just feel... Like I don't want to do anything that requires any effort. 

So last night my husband and I both briefly woke up at 4:30 am and I felt that I should tell him this. I told him I needed to make a pact with him and that it was going to be extremely hard for me. I am going to stay out of bed between the hours of 9am and 9pm. It won't solve everything but it's a first step. 

Today I've been on the sofa since I got out of bed at 9am. I watched a little TV, made some food, and yes was on Reddit. But I also took care of my dogs, and I haven't napped. I feel better because on the sofa I can get daylight from the back door whereas my bedroom has thick curtains we keep drawn. Maybe not all that different, but it's a start. 

Thanks for reading. "
2xxldu,0,2015-03-04,[22 M]having problems getting over my ex-girlfriend.[21F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xxldu/22_mhaving_problems_getting_over_my/,"My ex-girlfriend broke up with me about 3 months ago. She told me she didn't have feelings for me anymore and said it would be best to go our own ways for now. She also said school and internship are bothering and keeping her busy. She also said ""it's me not you."" So who knows what the fuck she's done.

All of this happened a few days after she spent the night with me saying she loved me etc etc..


Of course the moron that I am I kept begging her to give it one more try etc etc. Which she eventually said she didn't want to be with me anymore.

So I felt horrible for days ... After a few days I tried being positive and told myself to just accept the fact she's not mine anymore.

So I told her in a chat conversation that I respected her decission etc etc And I also told her she can always count on me (stupid of me to say). She said alright and suggested to stay friends.

I told her that as long as we stayed friends I'll always think there will be another chance for us. Which she said ""mhm""(yes) to.

So a few days passed I'm still trying to heal about all the stuff that happened. She asked me a few times how I was doing, sending me snaps on snapchat etc. So I didn't ever start a conversation with her.

So two weeks have passed and I left on holiday to celebrate new year's eve somewhere else with friends.

After a week when I came back she contacted me and asked me where I went etc etc.. So I told her. Kept the conversation pretty much short and told her I had to go.

About a week later I contacted her... I spent a whole afternoon talking to her on skype about stuff. It felt as if nothing happened between us. She even said to me when she has more time in a few months she would even wanted to go work out with me. So I said sure....

For a while there was not really much contact.. Just a hey here and there always keeping convos short.

By the end of januari I had met her once more because I needed to go pick up a jacket of mine.

We talked for about 40 minutes, all felt good. Again when I said I was leaving she said we should do something another time. Which I replied to; maybe, sometime.

A few days after that I had another conversation with her, she didn't reply right away, so i asked if she doesn't want to talk to me anymore just say yes and I won't bother me anymore.

After an hour I got a reply saying she was watching television, okay whatever.. So I asked how she was doing she said tired..


Then she said she was going to bed so I told her to talk sometime when she can, I was curious what she had been up to. She said sure.

So a few days passed she didn't bother talking to me anymore.
So on the second of februari I promised myself to not contact her anymore for a month. Which I did. But a few days ago I checked her facebook profile and it said she was in a relationship(rebound?). There was no post about it and it didn't say with who she's in a relationship with. So right at that moment I said fuck it and I unfriended her.

So here I am, trying to feel better and moving on but I just can't. What else can I do to feel better again? I'm gonna be honest; I do hope she'll contact me again and we'll eventually start dating again.

But if that happens, I want to be happy without her playing a major role in it. Or for any other girl in that matter.


She was also my first... we were together for about 7 months. 


---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend dumped me, didn't have feelings for me anymore. Stayed in touch with her for two months. Then no contact in february, still no contact. Deleted her from fb. She has a bf. How do I feel happy again and how do I get rid of this emptiness?"

First, some background about myself:

I'm trying to break into the actuarial industry. I don't have any relevant work experience. I've worked as a lifeguard and for a time as a supervisory lifeguard for many years at an amusement park and also as a lifeguard at another company. Most recently, I've worked as a Teaching Assistant in Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto. I didn't do any teaching, it was mostly an administrative role for the professor, but I did help guide students through the course and their final project.

I have a B.Com in Finance &amp; Economics and Management from the University of Toronto (Rotman School of Management), and I have a decent GPA (3.73/4.00). I've passed exam FM and P, but I don't know if I'll be able to land an internship or an entry level position with my current experience.

I believe some volunteering opportunities would make me look more attractive to employers, but I'm uncertain of what to pursue.

I want to be a P&amp;C actuary in the long run. What jobs/volunteer positions should I pursue to help me break into the industry?

Thanks so much!

However, a majority of my internships have been spent as a software/business role at some top firms (GE, etc.), as well has my own entrepreneurship endeavors creating software for startups and other tech consulting.  I have a software engineering position lined up this summer at another Fortune 50 company, as I go into my senior year of undergrad.

I'm looking to break into management consulting at one of the big 3, in the tech sector.  I'm not interested in implementation consulting like Accenture or others, but strategy.  

My question and options are, what should I do for a few years to become an expert in the field and be hired for an advanced degree position?
M.S. or Ph.D in Comp Science/Software Development/Computer Engineering?
A few years working in the field for known companies, possibly working on my own stuff full time?
MBA? or is this not needed because of my B.S. in Business?
M.S. in Information Systems?

Any recommendations for career advice would be appreciated, thanks!"
2xxqj8,3,2015-03-04,Does anyone else work at a public access station? Whats your experience like? Let's have a discussion!,Mrdudemanguy,videography,https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/2xxqj8/does_anyone_else_work_at_a_public_access_station/,"I was lucky enough to be able to intern at my local public access station when I was in college. I ended up loving it so much that I'm still volunteering here now while I look for a job. I majored in Communications with a specialization in video production. Everyone here really seems to enjoy having me around, they listen to what I have to say, and I was given freedom that I wouldn't be able to dream of anywhere else. 

Many people look down at public access because of the poor quality videos and shows that are often produced, but if you know anything about videography, it's all what you make of it. The cameras are a little old, but you can still make great videos with them. 

I noticed when I first came here that the cameras were almost always on auto focus, making the end result not so nice. When auto focus was on it was constantly adjusting to the movements of the guest, and the feeling you got from the videos were very amateur looking. Just a slight tweak of the frame, and changing it to manual focus made all the difference in the world. All of a sudden all the shows that I worked on seemed to be of much more professional quality. The hosts of the shows were very appreciative. 

I was also able to teach people a few tricks on final cut pro 10, which they were grateful for. Overall my experience here has been fun, and I'm thinking about trying to make my own show here soon. 

I recommend volunteering at a public access station if you're in high school and enjoy video production, it'll give you all the experience you need to breeze through your intro college video courses. 

Also it's a pretty easy internship to get if you're in desperate need of an internship. Even if you're not in desperate need it's great! But overall I enjoy it because I'm able to practice my skill without getting rusty. 

Also, I know I'm rambling but another thing worth mentioning. I was in a press booth for a convention I was able to get free press passes for. (Another public access perk!) I was talking to other people about my internship, and they said a public access station is one of the best places to be. Why is this? Well out of the three or four people I talked to, when they were interviewing for work, all of them were asked if they had ever helped out at a public access station before. Basically, what I got out of it was that working for public access increases your marketability in this field, and is respected far more than you would think. 

So i'm wondering, what are your experiences, if any with public access? Good times, bad times, horror stories, I'd love to hear it all! "

I spent 6 or 7 semesters either dropping/withdrawing from/failing classes. As a result, my cumulative GPA is atrocious. 

I had undiagnosed major depressive disorder and PTSD that I've been suffering from since before I started at my first college in 2003. Since I started receiving treatment around two years ago, my grades have all been As and Bs. The material was never tough, I just couldn't make it through a semester without having a depression incident that would make me miss 3-4 weeks of school on average. 

I have documented proof of everything including medications taken, therapist visits, etc... 

Would it be worth bringing this stuff up when applying for internships and jobs eventually? I'm honestly embarrassed talking to people about it, but I also don't want that time in my life to ruin my future.

College was something I loved back in the day.  I used to be so happy and full of life back in 2013, having a very positive image of what my future will hold.  I am doing very well in college and it really felt like things are just going to get better from here on out.

Now, it's the complete opposite.

This year has been nothing short of godawful.  I feel like an absolute failure now.  I am still doing well in college, but I am pessimistic about what the future will hold for me.  I haven't gotten a new job in almost 3 years now.  I tried to apply to other places and tried to apply to other internships as well, but not one has accepted me.  With all these rejections, I often wonder whether or not I am going to have a good future.  Meanwhile, all my friends are getting all these amazing internships and are getting close to graduating, but I have nothing besides just this one job I had for 3 years.  This has really put me down to the point where I have given up.

I don't know what to do anymore.  I feel like I am down in the dumps, with my dreams of having a great life just being that, nothing more than a dream."

What I'm wondering is where would be a good place to find less competitive internships to apply to? I'm still going to try to apply to some bay area companies, but obviously I'd have a better shot at local companies. There isn't much immediately around where I live, but I can commute to both Philiadelia and NYC if needed, so at least there's that option.

I really need some third party advice... 

I've known the guy I'm seeing, Mike, since June. We work in a semi-obscure field. He was an established employee and I was an intern. He helped me a lot by mentoring me and giving me advice. I wouldn't think about dating him while I was at that company but 6 months later I got a great job 4 hours away. Mike and I were friends, texting every day but I was always clear it was plutonic and just to help my career when I needed it. He was always very supportive and was just happy to talk to me.

When I moved away I realized I kind of started having feelings for Mike. Even after I didn't work at his company anymore I never thought about it much because of the age gap. A few months ago I would've thought what could a 25 year old possibly have in common with someone who's almost 40. In actuality we have everything in common: music choice, movies, weird profession, humor, etc. I realized I wanted to try to take things to the next level and asked if I could come visit him at his house.

That was a month ago and it went fantastic!! He cooked me dinner, we laughed for hours and had a blast. Every weekend since then we've seen each other and he even drove 4 hours to see me last weekend.

Since we knew each other so well before we hooked up, the relationship escalated quickly. He told me he really likes me and I really like him. But he just got out of a 10 year relationship 2 years ago and I just got out of a 6 year one a year ago. I was happy that mike didn't push to try to be my boyfriend because even though I really like him, I'm still unstable in my career and am enjoying being single and not tied down. But because we like each other we both have expressed that were not hooking up with anyone else.

When mike came to visit he was helping me with something at work that really needed fixing. He solved it for me and in that moment I realized how he's always been there for me, just accepts me for who I am, and is so mellow and easy going I realized I was really falling for him. Strong feelings. I think he felt it too because he told me he was going to change his shift so he could see me more. He also gave me a key to his house to have.

Today I'm at his house and he has to go to work. He tells me stay as long as you want, use my computer if you need it blah blah. I went on the computer to try to find a sushi restaurant. As soon as I typed in ""su"" a website popped up: sugardaddyforme.com. It's a dating website where older men can sleep with younger girls in exchange for buying fancy dinners and trips. Of course I clicked. He had a paid profile and was looking at girls photos that were 18 (and on the opposite coast from us?) worst of all, he had been on the website a few days after he just came up to see me.

I left the sushi search up on the computer hoping that he gets curious what else I looked up, checks the history and knows I know. I don't know where to go from here though. I mean we're not exclusive but that's just such a sleazy website to be on it's gross. Maybe he's only interested in me because he gets to have sex with a much younger girl, which is obviously what he wants?

My question: do I confront him about this? What do I say if he brings it up? Should I even still see him? Is this a major red flag or his prerogative because he's technically single? I don't know how to think or feel about it. Hoping for some advice.

I was dating a girl [22F] for 3.5 years. Things were good between us for most of those 3.5 years. We had 1 ""break"" after getting into a small fight, but after a few days she wanted to get back together. She's been a bit depressed about personal stuff that does not involve me for the past couple of months and I tried to help her through it, but there was not much I can do.

We went to dinner Valentines night together and things seemed normal. 2 days later she texts me breaking up with me. Her reasons were that we are too busy (I have grad school, she has school and internship) and she said she does not feel the same about me. I was angry at first and cut off contact for a few days. Then I tried to get her back, and told her how I felt. I wanted to propose to this girl next year on our 5yr anniversary. Its been a little over 2 weeks since she broke up with me and she seems fine. She went out this past weekend with her friends (who are all single) and seemed to have a lot of fun. I deleted her off social media, but reached out one last time this past weekend just telling her that I had to do it because I want to get over her and I wish things worked out. She said she loves me and always will, and she is also struggling getting over me but she just doesn't think she can fix the way she feels. I think she wants to be single with her friends and just have fun, but idk. Maybe there is someone else, but she denied this and there has been no indication there is (though she has a lot of guy friends I'm sure shes talking to so she doesn't feel tempted to text me)

I feel lost now. I can't focus. I don't know how to move on. I focus on all the good instead of the bad between us no matter how hard I try. The thought of her with someone else drives me nuts. I honestly have no idea how to move on, what to do, or what. I know its over. She would have missed me and reached out by now if it wasn't. I haven't fully accepted this but very close. I have a good group of guy friends I am close with but all have serious relationships. They've been talking to me and trying to help me, but the majority of them went through this same exact type of break up and after a few weeks the girl came back. I don't think this will happen to me. She dropped the ""you deserve better than me"" and ""you can talk to me about anything, even a new girl"" lines on me which shows shes pretty much over it.

How do I get my mind right and move on? I go to class and can't focus. I go to the gym and have no motivation. I'm tired of feeling like this but no matter how hard I try to get her off my mind, she creeps back in. I even went to try tinder for the first time, but it made me feel like an idiot and for some reason I was worried she would laugh at me if she found out.

Any and all help would be great.

-be resoinsible for additional expenses beyond ""college start-up"" (personal sewing/art projects, entertainment, recreation, additional toiletries, toner/ink for [nonexistent] printer, computer paper, etc.)

-share all financial info from college -FERPA- ""access to all"" on [website] to allow us access for paying bills, etc.

[Okay, tangent here: The pw for the website is a univeral pw for access to everything for my college- turning in assignments, health info, email- all of it. I wasn't allowed to go to college until I gave them the pw for it all. Yes, they screamed at me and told me that I wouldn't go to college unless I did that. I changed the pw as soon as I got there.]

-share all part-time paycheck info (needed for both financial aid and income tax reasons)

-actively look for opportunities to add unique items to your resume (internships, teaching assistant, work abroad for summer (Austria or Germany!) anything that shows a potential employer you are exceptional!) [They're actually really obsessed with me graduating to go work for a particular company in New Zealand. It's really weird.]

-coordinate any unusual needs far in advance of when they are needed, so it's not an ""emergency""

-protect your laptop from other people, it contains bank info [paranoid security guy tyrant father wrote this one, yet he gets access to all I did on the computer. Don't worry, I'll wipe it pretty soon.]

-actively pursue and secure summer employment each year [last time it was halfway across the country. Like I need to be told I need to escape from Their hell.]

-take on all responsibilities of an independent adult at school and at home including good personal relations, cleaning up after yourself, etc. [this is the one that Nmom quotes in the email I've written about.]

**[Holy hedera helix, I swear I hate this name so fucking much]- To Do Now**

-actively pursue and secure part time job [spoiler: didn't get a job summer before freshman year, almost killed myself]

-begin to keep track of expenses for incidentals

-look at wardrobe and develop realistic list of needs [no, Nmom, I *seriously* need a feather bikini and a dress made of cheese with a 10 foot train of swiss with brie applique.]

-make a list of preferred brands of toiletries and cosmetics for start-up kit

[aaaaaaand somewhere on their copy is my signature and their signatures. No clue if there's a date on it. There's a second page detailing what I get in my ""start-up kit"" mentioning hangers, sheets, and everything on the list from the college quoted exactly, but I don't feel like typing it.]
_________________________________________-
Guys, please tell me that just because I signed this thing, doesn't mean that they can enforce it or somehow take away my laptop and desk lamp and blankets or something. I wouldn't put it past them.

I don't need their support for tuition anymore, I don't even need their info for FAFSA- I'm free of that. Just... please, tell me that being forced to sign this at a time where I did try and kill myself and I wasn't necessarily an adult doesn't mean that they can take back all the stuff I'm using to survive, like blankets and clothes and stuff.

Really, though, they wrote it and you'd think I'm some sort of completely incompetent bag of stupid. It's most fascinating. And insulting."
2xyobi,1,2015-03-04,How stressful is it to work as an Infor/Lawson consultant/sys-admin?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2xyobi/how_stressful_is_it_to_work_as_an_inforlawson/,"I'm currently a senior at a college going for Business Management (going part-time). I'm a self-taught Python/Django developer with 5 months of experience and 3 months of internship. I've recently quit my job in a fast paced SAAS startup company (10 employees and based in NYC). I got burnt out. I had to work long hours (10+ a day) and work on the weekends. My salary there was $40k with a raise to $50k after one year. The company doesn't make any revenue and only had 2 developers on-site including me and one overseas.

After a week of job hunt I got an offer as an Infor/Lawson consultant today from mid-size profitable IT services provider (based in New Jersey). It's a junior level position with $45k as starting salary and with a raise to $55k after 6 months. The job requires travel to client sites which is the main reason I applied. But the first 6 months I will be provided with some training, and be working in the office.

I wanted to get a job at a more slow-paced environment so yesterday I applied to mid-size non-tech companies for developer/sys-admin positions. I'm not sure how stressful a job as a Infor/Lawson consultant would be. The job description says I will be installing/upgrading enterprise software, fixing issues if any during installation/upgrading, migrating data, etc. I want to be able to take some online classes from my school while working full-time. So is the job stressful as Infor/Lawson consultant? Should I wait and apply to more companies?"

In the past I have had tests the day of so I have had no time to prepare as needed.  I know all of the basics when it comes to career fairs but I obviously don't know enough (since I haven't had an engineering job yet). 

Here's what I have done to prepare so far:
I have made an excel sheet of every company that is looking for mechanical engineering interns, read about their company, found their internship descriptions online and saved the links. I have updated my resume.
I plan on going out to my laptop between every ""interview"" and doing a quick read on their position(s) they are looking to fill and telling the recruiters that I am interested/qualified for that internship and that way I'll be able to talk about the position and look like I'm really interested.  

Is there anything else I should do to prepare?
Any tips for while I'm there?

My only downfall is my GPA, which isn't too bad (i hope).  It's 2.8.. is that a big problem?  I feel as if it's not a big deal because I am so busy with other things while in school. I'm in two engineering groups ASME and ASHRAE.  I'm working on a community sustainability project through ASHRAE.  I'm in a fraternity, on a hockey team, and have always worked at least one job.

Thanks for the help!  Any thoughts are appreciated."

In the last episode Chuck said that he's known Kim for neraly 10 years. (That means Kim probably knew Jimmy when he still Slippin Jimmy!) Going by the math that makes the most sense my theory is that Kim was Chuck's intern when she was still in college and Chuck had her help him deal with Jimmy when he was arrested.

&amp;nbsp;


On my resume I list the following as my expertise:

• Onboarding
• Talent Acquisition
• Employee Performance Reviews
• Social Media Branding
• Vendor Relationships
• Training
• Payroll

&amp;nbsp;

But these ultimately don't explain what I want to do in life. During my lay off I've been thinking. A lot.   


&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately what I've decided is that I really enjoy helping people. Motivating people. Telling people that they DO have a purpose. Helping people work through their problems and help them down a path to success. The issue is I've helped many friends/cousins/etc try to figure out ways to be happy, but I haven't sat back and looked at my own situation.

&amp;nbsp;


I'll stop rambling now and get to a list of what I enjoy that may narrow down a career:


- Sports 
- Lifting Weights / Sports Training
- Running
- Working with kids (used to work at summer camps and LOVED it) 
- Working with sales/forecasting
- Basic IT work (I am ""good with technology"" I guess is the common way to word this)
- Working with Social Media (while with Compass Group I ran their IG/Twitter for the East Coast)
- Motivating people (I've been told I should be a motivational speaker, but what basis do I have for that?)






&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr - I've worked my whole life in food service rising through the ranks all the way to a Director position at a corporate cafeteria, but I've never enjoyed it. I need help finding a new career path with things I actually enjoy, not just what I've done my whole life.** 






&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Life Background / What lead to this:

&amp;nbsp;


I'm 25 years old - I graduated from Penn State University. My whole life I have worked in food service from the age of 15 working as a dishwasher, moved to bus boy, eventually working on the line as a cook, and spending time as a waiter (typical restaurant story). I enjoyed aspects of the job, but never really was happy. I did this all through High School and when it was time to move onto college I naturally selected a major that I was comfortable with - Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management.

I never really thought about what opportunities it would lead to or the life I would have to live post college. I went through my schooling (Penn State University) and finished with a 3.4 GPA while completing multiple internships with ARAMARK (large company in Food Service). Post college I was offered many positions within food service, but because all of my friends/family/etc worked typical M-F, 9-5 jobs I chose to enter Business Dining - aka serving food to people at corporate locations Monday through Friday. 

I joined a company, Compass Group, and did business dining for 3 years post college and was NEVER happy. The hours were long (typically 10-12 a day) and the environment constantly reminded me of my High School job that I never really liked. I was promoted 2 separate times (held 3 positions in my 3 years with the Company). My final position I finally had my own cafeteria that I was running - from the kitchen, to the marketing, the the sales, accounting, management, etc...but I was thrown into a fire (insert lame Food Service joke here). The guy hiring me knew the cafe would close within a year as our client was planning on making major cuts to their blue collar division (the people I served). Whenever times got tough he'd tell me ""Don't worry, I've got big plans for you!"" This always kept me motivated as I thought there would be a light at the end of the tunnel...turns out my cafe was closed and my boss forced me into a catering/management role in a larger cafe. Most people would think ""wow, great!"" but at this point I was beaten down with long hours and a low salary. The new position would offer no bump in pay. I declined the position. My boss was furious (I believe me taking this role was his plan all along, but it was never discussed). He threatened to fire me if I did not take the position and I saw no other option but to seek help from Human Resources. After a 2-3 month dispute where I was forced to work ridiculous hours at random locations throughout the state I was finally laid off (unexpectedly). It was ultimately a blessing in disguise. I can now choose something I will actually enjoy doing. I won't have to wake up every morning at 4:00am and think ""what am I doing with my life?"" "
2xyw1y,2,2015-03-04,"Big decision looming, please help",aboliver,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/2xyw1y/big_decision_looming_please_help/,"5/5 acceptances at schools so far, waiting on 6 more, including my top 3.  Currently a senior undergrad w/ 159/3.6.  I'm about to finish an internship w/ a CPA firm and receiving a job offer is a good possibility.  I'd love to get some work experience and my CPA license and improve my LSAT.  However, accepting a position would require another year for a Master's degree before starting work in fall of 2016.

I'd love to know if anybody has postponed law school and waited 2-3 cycles?  

Law school is what I ultimately want but a JD/CPA only looks that much better, plus my summer schedule is really weird where I won't be able to hold the normal summer jobs like I have in the past and will allow me to have so much spare time that studying 25+ hours a week to where I think I would have a good shot at a 164-166.  I wouldn't like putting off law school 2-3 years, but I obviously am thinking of the long run.

My top choices are Wake, UNC, and William &amp; Mary.  If I decide to go the long route and hopefully improve my LSAT, my goal is to attend one of these schools w/ a great offer, not attend a higher ranked school. "

My favorite things are the smaller special parties like the parades (especially the one which ended w Portugal The Man playing our Mr T float) and more recently the ROBE RAGE. -KB.
 |One of my favorite aspects of the Festival is the week leading up during the build.  Watching projects, that we've worked on for a long time, come to life.
 |Love being on the farm and hanging with the team..some of my closet friends.

Each year we try and raise the bar and with that comes increased expenses.
 |The increasing number of festivals has created more competition for talent which increases talent fees.
 |We believe the pricing is still a great value for a 4 day, around-the clock camping festival.

Amazingly already working on 2016! January/February is my busiest time as we are getting the identity and website ready and dreaming up new activities.
[Given the recent increase in smaller, more genre-specific festivals that may be less expensive or less difficult to travel to, how do you see Bonnaroo competing for attendees in the future? Do you plan to transition to a more genre-specific event, or do you think the gestalt of Bonnaroo will continue to draw attendance despite arguments that your focus is too diverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xygej/we_are_jonathan_mayers_and_kerry_black_cofounders/cp4lfer?context=5)|We're going to continue to invest and raise the bar each year.  Lots of focus is being put into the overall experience….from on-site accommodations to art installations to immersive theatre.
 |Bonnaroo will continue to be a diverse offering.  It gives people a chance to discover something new they may not have been initially drawn to.  We think that's fun and interesting and hope you do too.

I know with Cisco, you have the ability to move up to higher level certs and different types of Cisco certs, but for general IT is there such a thing?

Example: 

Becoming a Windows Admin

* Course/Basic understanding of General IT
 * Understanding the Internet Standards
 * Understanding OSI Model
 * Basic Computer Functions
 * Basic Hardware Repair
 * Basic Network &amp; Security




* Optional Certifications - CompTIA A+
* Working with various MS Operating Systems
 * Use of Win 7, 8.1 + Servers
 * Use of MS Virtual Academy/Dreamspark (if student)
 * Use of other resources for MS information
 * Setup Lap Environment

* Learn basic scripting
 * Python or Perl (Optional)
 * Learn Basic Windows Shell/Bach Scripting
 * Learn Basic Scripting 

* Gain real world experience (internship, computer repair for friends, etc)
* Get Certified with MS Basic Certifications for Desktop and Server Operating Systems

Something along these lines but for various areas of IT? I have a younger brother who wants to get into IT, and asked how I did it. I was rather unstructured and learned a lot on my own. 

Hell, these past two months I've learned how to set up a Hyper-V Server with multiple VMs. A few weeks ago, I created a VM, set up a 2012 box for 802.1x/RADIUS authentication, reissued a 3rd party cert, logged into our WLC to re-point everything. Last night I created a print server, installed/customized printers, deployed via GPO, figured out how a KIX script from the previous consultancy worked, and made it delete the old printers on logon.

I have never had any experience with any of those things. It just took some really late nights, lots of reading, some trial and error, and a boss that somehow lets me get away with this shit. But that's the thing. I have a job that allows me to learn more and I got it by sheer luck and curiosity.

My brother is 5 years younger than me, but at 19, he hasn't applied for college as no one else in our family has been able to go. (Our family has had a lot of financial issues).

I'm hoping that if I can help lay down a foundation for him, maybe it will give him a boost in the right direction."

I think I am getting good at classifying deductions, however I find myself spending a lot of time meticulously searching for the appropriate form/line to enter items.  I have searched for instructions for many of these items (as well as asking more experienced coworkers when possible) but it takes a lot of time.

Does anybody know of a quick reference guide for which form/line deductions go to?  I primarily deal with Forms 1040 and 1120S, and Schedules A and C.  Does anybody have some generalized advice on how I might become more knowledgable/productive?

2xzcwy,4,2015-03-04,"Left home last August, wasn't supposed to come back until this August but showed up at my moms door 6 months early to say hi and her reaction was priceless",Llewey,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2xzcwy/left_home_last_august_wasnt_supposed_to_come_back/,"I'm pretty new to reddit but this seemed like a decent place to post this. I know it isn't a picture of a cat, so let me know if there's a better sub

My mom was single for the first 5 years of my life and I was her first child. Even after marrying and two more children, I will forever be her baby. I've always been nearby, going to state school only 30 minutes away for my undergrad, so it was incredibly hard for her when I flew off to Europe to start a two year graduate program. Due to the school schedule and my internship obligations for next summer, I wouldn't be able to come back until August after a full year away, and even then only for a single week.

Well, sometimes things change. A small window opened in my schedule and Uncle Sam told me he wanted his nephew to retun via a larger than expected tax return, so on my birthday I purchased a round trip ticket back home. I told noone, save a very small group of confidants in pursuit of somebody to pick me up from the airport. I had a ride lined up within an hour, but had to fight my excitement and loose lips for a month to keep the secret safe.

It might sound silly, but every time I fly I am terrified that it will finally be the flight that kills me, so I make sure to tell my mom that I love her before I board. But I couldn't just randomly message her ""I love you"" out of the blue. I thought about the best way to go about it, and eventually found the answer in Subway. I grew up being the pickiest eater on the planet and avoided almost all veggies but lettuce and corn. As I said before, some things change. On the way to the airport I picked up a sub and messaged my mom ""Just grabbed a veggie patty sandwich from Subway and put TOMATOES on it! Proud of me? Fuel to get me through another day of studying. Love you and miss you!"" She may not have known I was coming, but if the plane went down she'd know I loved her.

Of course, everything went fine and I made it across the ocean, through customs, and made my connection in Chicago without problems. If you've ever flown through Chicago you know how miraculous that can be. So it was dark at 730 when I got back so I went up to the closed door and rang the doorbell. My 8 year old brother came to answer it and peeked through the window to see me, and then started to open it and I heard him say ""It's [my name]"".

My mom, accustomed to him saying silly things and knowing full well that I'm in Europe and not coming home until August, said ""no it's not"" and got up to come to the door as I came in.

She saw me and the impact of the shock overwhelming her was obvious as her jaw dropped, her arms went up, and her legs gave out. She almost went all the way to the ground, her legs taking the shape of an accordion, but somehow mustered enough strength to stop at a deep kneel.

The noise she made was somewhere between a pterodactyl and an injured wolf, and combined with the tangible emotion leaking from her throat, eyes, and even her pores got my dogs jumping and barking with confusion. In a few short moments she managed to squeak out some questions, most single worded ""what?"", ""why?"", ""how?"", and ""when's?"", a few stretching to multiple syllables like ""how long?"" and ""what happened?"", but I answered them wordlessly with a hug.

The embrace seemed to last an eternity, as if she was afraid that when she let go I'd turn around to board a plane back to Europe. In fact, she held on so long that her fears almost became a self-fulfilling prophecy. She did eventually calm down, though, and within the hour everything was chill and normal.

TL;DR - I'm my mom's baby and was supposed to be gone for a full year. Six months early, out of the blue, I show up at her door. She turns into a pterodactyl and flies away."

I've hit a wall and after a lot of thought, I'm pretty sure I want to switch to IT.

I definitely think I'm pussying out here and that I could complete the degree, but I don't want to jeopardize my scholarship failing classes or scraping by with Cs. 

Ultimately, I'd like to write code when I graduate. I love programming -- I've got high As in OOP and CS1, but I have no interest in becoming a scientist. 

I think there's quite a few people who have made this switch for similar reasons, and I'd like to know how it worked out for you. Am I really shooting myself in the foot by switching, or will I be okay if I continue working on personal projects and getting internships while pursuing a degree in IT? "

2xzg92,1,2015-03-04,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xzg92/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2xzkdm,0,2015-03-04,Standing at a cross-road in my pathetic computer science career so far,random_person7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xzkdm/standing_at_a_crossroad_in_my_pathetic_computer/,"I had been into computers and technology since I was a little kid. I had my mind made up all along that I will have a computer science degree. Up until college, I was the guy among my friends who knew it all about electronics.I was the guy they came to for help with computers and other stuff. When my friends and I took computer science in high school, they frequently asked me for help. I knew I was never as good as I made myself out to be. In school, I would open up a hidden directory on school computer with all the student accounts shown on it and I would show the Windows explorer window to my friends and brag about the fact that I got inside the system (I didn't actually have permissions to open those user account folders, but never told them). Even when I was doing computer science, I performed poorly on tests. For projects and homework, I frequently found myself going to stackoverflow to get help.

I learned Java from that class, but if someone tested me on it and gave me a decent task, I would fail at the first step. I taught myself c#, vb, js and php but over the past 6-7 years that I have used them, I'm only intermediate in it. Despite being into programming for that long (started around 12 or 13, now 20), I don't know a single language that well or ""good enough"" at it. 

I'm a college sophomore now in a community college. Enrolled in a computer science major that is designed to be transferred. I have almost nothing to show for projects. One simple windows phone music player app, a simple basketball info site and an attempt at an operating system in vb and c# (it was really just a collection of forms and screens) way back in 6th grade. I have one internship with an extremely small company for almost one year now, which I actually have because of a personal reference and the fact that the CEO needs someone my age to help build a product so school students my age can use it. So being able to program is a very small part of why I'm there. It's because the product I'm building is for school students and because I probably can get them to the website since I'm a student too and I know what others my age like.

So basically, while others (as can be seen on this subreddit itself) are making very advanced things and getting solid internships at massive companies with a great future, I'm desperately trying to land a reasonable internship with any company (I need a change from the current company now, plus a bigger and more reputable company would look better on resume). I'm a horrible computer science student. No, I don't understand floats, signed and unsigned integers, base conversions, add-subtract-multiply-divide bits by shifting, data structures. No; I'm not good enough to have a nice and attractive github project. I don't have a long enough attention span to watch hours of lectures, I lose interest if I'm not doing anything myself.

It seems that I've finally learned that computer science was never for me. Being in a community college puts me behind most, I don't have any good side projects or good experience on my resume. My skillset is even more pathetic. Oh well, time to make the decision of whether I want to continue struggling horrifically and stay with some really low job or think in my second year of college about what I want to change my major to."

He told me to let him know what a fair compensation is and that he's willing to pay equity, cash, or a combination of both if I so desire since he's worked with me before and knows that I have a good work ethic. I told him I would let him know.

However...I'm not sure how to come up with this number so that I can start bargaining. I know roughly how much my employer pays me per hour, so I can give him (that number + 5-10%) for the cash amount, but I kind of want to take some equity in case the startup takes off, and I'm really not sure how to give myself a ""fair"" amount of equity. Am I even being fair by asking for my salary converted to hourly wage + some percent?

Thoughts? I've never really worked with a startup before (except when I was an intern and didn't have room to negotiate) so this is all new to me.

Just wanted to give some quick background. My ex and I broke up around August of 2014. We dated for about a year and a half. At the time I had decided to change careers and transfer back to my local university. It was tough on me [M19] and shortly after school started she broke up with me citing religious differences. She said I didn't put any importance in my faith and religion. I felt that we were doing great and at the time I felt like I was being forced into something I truly didn't have my heart set on. 

Throughout the semester I think I might have experienced a mild form of depression. I say this because looking back there were weeks on end when I felt I had no purpose in life and getting out of bed was a struggle. Anyways we stop talking for a bit and then around December we start hooking up again. I'm confused as to what I want and she's still wants someone that cares about God, faith etc. In January i realize that she matters a lot to me and that I really do want her in my life. 
It is also worth nothing that around this time I had decided to change lots of things in my life. I was tired of being miserable all the time. I decided to start discovering my spirituality I guess you could say? But this was independent of what my ex had said, I didn't inform her of this and I didn't talk about it with her. It was a very personal decision. 

So fast forward to February and she leaves for her 6 month internship. Night before she leaves she's very affectionate, ""I'm going to miss you, kiss me etc"" and I tell her that things will work out and things will be better when she gets back. That I can promise. She smiles, kisses me and says goodbye. Also worth noting is that throughout the month of February though I realize that I do want to rekindle my faith. I've felt that I've made leaps and bounds in terms of my faith but I still have lots more to go. I also begin to change my attitude, started yoga, etc. I really tried to change my outlook and just better myself, for myself. 

However ever since she left I've felt like there's this growing rift between us. It feels like we hardly talk and I can't even bring up something or call her out on anything because she just says ""I don't know what to say"" and just chooses to not even respond. We hardly text, much less talk over the phone, plus she says that this is part of the new chapter in her life. I guess I've come to accept the possibility that we might not ever be together again but even as a friend it feels like she's shitty. For example, we agreed to send each other two videos of music we like a week to the other. I thought of this so that we'd still have something to connect and bond over while we were apart and also to introduce each other to our different tastes in music. So far she's only sent me two while I've sent her 8 videos total. On top of that she's the only friend I really have that is really close with her faith and I'd really like to talk to her about my faith and how I've grown with it. I felt like talking about our faith would help and might even make her happy because she cares about it but she won't even acknowledge it when I try to bring it into the conversation. I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't feel like I can bring this up with my parents because they like her so much and it feels like they wont even acknowledge that she does some shitty things. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Part of me says to let go and move on even as friends but it's just I don't give up on something until I know I've done everything physically possible to make it work. Advice? "
2xzww1,1,2015-03-05,"Me [23F] with my husband [23M] of 3 years: He reddits and games almost addictively, and I feel like it's putting our future in jeapordy",hersheykiss01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xzww1/me_23f_with_my_husband_23m_of_3_years_he_reddits/,"Okay. So when we got married, my husband and I had a rocky start. Our relationship has always been volatile: he has a tendency to shout and swear and call me names. I'm prone to saying sharp and nasty things. Both of us bring up stuff from the past, have difficulties overcoming things, etc. We've had a rough time of it. 

But here's the thing. When we met and married, my husband was one of the most responsible, hardworking people I'd ever known. In high school he graduated with a 4.0, and managed to make it through the first year of college with a 4.0 while going to school AND work full-time. I was so proud of him. We were both ambitious with high expectations for ourselves, and worked ourselves into the ground to achieve these. 

Then we got married and things changed. We went from a community college to university, and while my GPA stayed the same, his began to drop rapidly. He had trouble befriending people in his classes and study-buddies became sparse. He began failing classes left and right. Three years later his GPA hovers at 2.25, and it isn't uncommon for him to spend 12+ straight on the internet or gaming. And yet with all this he remains extremely optimistic that he will still get into Pharmacy School when all is said and done (Pharmacy is his dream). I have already graduated with a graphic design degree, and he is still floundering with only 75% of his Bachelors finished. We started at the same time, 6 years ago. 

I am the breadwinner. I have a job as a receptionist that he constantly complains doesn't pay well enough (while he works three days a week and takes one 4-credit class that he is currently getting a C in). I haven't been able to do much with my degree aside from several unpaid-yet-worthwhile internships. And so I decided I would like to go back to school. I have always had Pharmacy Tech in the back of my mind, and made the decision to pursue this. Seeing that he is getting NOWHERE with his current degree, I asked him if he would do the program with me. It's only a year at a local community college, and though very rigorous, I figure it will at least get him somewhere better in life that where he is right now. 

The thing is, for this upcoming Spring Term, I am going to need to take some prerequisites for the program. This will require me to take full-time school AND work. One of the classes is a hybrid intro to biochemistry and organic chemistry class that is INFAMOUS for its difficulty. As in, the class drops 4/5ths of its students by the end. And yet my husband cheerily tells me that it's no problem, the class is ""Only 100 Level"" and should be easy enough. I remind him I've never taken Chemistry before and he blows this off. I sit by and watch him play hour after hour after hour on his computer and begin to feel dread. Whenever I interrupt him, even for important things, he acts like it's a huge chore and absolutely could be put off until later. I'm scared that when the time comes for me to take these classes, he will leave me high and dry. He promises he won't, but I don't know if I believe him. He isn't very empathetic and doesn't seem to grasp how difficult it is going to be for me this term. 

My husband says I am being unreasonable for worrying, and it's not normal. He gets angry when I bring it up. I'll admit I get emotional about it because he doesn't seem to acknowledge that he has a problem and I need to know he'll be there for me when I need him. 

I am very hardworking. I'm incredibly ambitious and have a drive like nonother. I graduated Summa Cum Laude at my school, and I'm confident I can do this... Once I'm able to get financial aid and not work as much. But I don't know if I can drag his ass through the program at the same time. I am scared. 

As a note, he admits he is probably depressed. He tried counseling but stopped because he didn't mesh with the therapist, and hasn't attempted to get more help despite my encouragement. 

**tl;dr**: So basically, my husband has a terrible track record of blowing off school to play games and reddit, and I'm not sure if I can count on him. Am I being unreasonable? Is this a disaster waiting to happen? What can I do?"
2xzyzf,5,2015-03-05,[Update] Do not get involved with College Works Painting!,colintw24,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2xzyzf/update_do_not_get_involved_with_college_works/,"I researched the shit out of College Works and made it my mission to find out the bad parts of the company and question the hirer ups about it. They had an answer for everything and it made me feel very comfortable with the company. However when I went to the 2-day training weekend, I realized how much they are selling you on the ""internship"" the entire time. They are sales people and that's really the only thing I learned from them.

When I went home for the first weekend, it was super shitty! My RC (regional consultant) was a pain in the ass. She would call me everyday and dictate what I was going to be doing until we talked again, plus she had a super annoying voice. They tell you that you have freedom to do what you want with ""your"" company, but really they get SUPER PISSED OFF if you deviate from their plan at all. Plus they want you knocking on doors at 8am on Sundays, I don't care who you are, FUCK YOU if you do that.

When I made the call to the VP of the California region, he was an asshole. Once he realized that I wasn't going to be making him any money this year, he became a fucking dick. Everything I said was SUPER offensive and he took everything the obvious wrong way. I told him that I looked up to him for being an unbelievable sales and business person, and he spit in my face. ""You don't look up to me, you are just saying that because you want to make me feel better about you leaving the internship. If you really looked up to me, you would stick with the program."" I then told him that I don't want to work for someone who treats ""ex-employees"" like that.

Every weekend, for the second semester of college, you are at home. You are bossed around by super cocky people and given very little say. Then if you have any second thoughts about the program, they spit in your face and tell you how shitty of a person you are. In retrospect, they should have told me what was expected the first day and not fucked around."

I'm going to write about our background, and our personalities, while she can write about her feelings since she's the one who's falling out of love after all. I know it's a long read, you have our thanks. **TL;DR at the bottom**

**Me, the boyfriend:**
**Background (skippable, not the problem)**

We've started dating near the end of high school. Back then, I had very low self esteem, confidence, and almost zero motivation due to depression. I was seeing a psychiatrist weekly, until my current girlfriend (we weren't dating yet) and I started talking more and getting to know each other. She has an eating disorder and was hospitalized, though it's still something we both have to struggle with, it's not as bad as before we met. 

We were both broken people that felt normal after meeting each other, knowing that we are people that deserve to be loved. Love came quickly, it felt so right like something that came out of a fairy tale. Our friends who saw us said we looked like couples who have been dating for years.

In hindsight, it seemed unlikely a guy like me and a girl like her would end up loving each other for such a long time. I excelled at math, and thought with logic. I love video games and was terrible with writing (still am actually). She, on the other hand, loves reading and writing, and was a total romantic in a beautiful way that some people might even call naive. It's a time of innocence and purity that not many people behold. Though she's been through many hardships, she still hoped for a love that lasted forever. Times would always seem to get tough but she'd get off her scraped knees and keep on trying. Her undying ambition was one of the reasons why I started believing in myself. I love her for all that she is, and I wanted to be the one to fulfill her dream of a love that lasts forever.

We've been together, happily. When problem arose, we always talked it out afterwards. I prided myself in the fact that I could keep our relationships so loving and civil, (unlike some other kids our age amirite). One time, a guy even tried to ask her out to a formal and wouldn't stay away from her even after she told him off. She went to a different university at the time, so I couldn't be there for her when she went to class. Until the day of the formal, she managed to get an extra ticket for me. I showed up after waiting in the cold for 2 hours due to bus dysfunctions and roads being closed off and told the guy to stay away, which he finally did. I've shown to her and myself that I would do anything for her. I never thought I'd love someone so deeply, due to the fact that I was dumped by someone I really loved back in high school, which was one of the reasons why I became depressed, other reasons being loneliness, self-loathing, family on the verge of divorce, etc.)

**Problems begin**
Our passion didn't die out, it burned lively for the first year, and started whittling away the second year. She started becoming more distant from me, and got annoyed with me more easily. She would push me away sometimes when I try to hold her or kiss her. This was the biggest issue during the winter of 2014 for us, until it another one arisen that winter. She’ll tell you about that in her part. I was hurt due to the fact that she tends to push me away more often in public, thinking that she was ashamed of me when she just didn't want to be seen as the PDA couple. I've done many things that I guess subconsciously annoyed her. To be honest, back in the winter when we started having small arguments, I just thought that they were inconveniently timed miscommunications that all happened during a short time so it seemed like we were going to break up. I genuinely thought that they were just all small misunderstandings, and maybe they were… 

What I did to bug her the most was that I would jokingly bring up another girl’s name every now and then. A long time ago, I think before we even started dating, she somehow figured out which girl I thought was the cutest. Early on, some minor jokes would be fine, she even made them herself. Like “I bet you wish you joined cheerleading so bad, to catch her in your arms must be a dream come true for you”. However, I subconsciously started bring her up when I got unsatisfied with our relationship. Because of my girlfriend’s self-critical nature, she couldn't look at me in the eye for more than 7 seconds max. At first it seems cute how shy she was, but late into the relationship it just felt disrespectful that she couldn't even face me when we talk. So the harmless joke about that high school cheerleader slowly turned into something toxic like “why don’t you go date *cheerleaders name* then?” “Yea I bet she would look at me in the eye” I guess I was feeling dissatisfied with our relationship and I didn't know how to address these issues, so they came out in a depreciating manner that I was unaware of.

I've come to realize my passive aggressiveness in my jokes, and 2 weeks or so ago I've apologized to her and we've had a deep talk about our relationship which caused us to see we have much deeper troubles. I realized how hurtful it could be when I joked like that and have cut them out from the relationship once and for all. 



**Her, the girlfriend:**

Since fall semester of second year university, things have been feeling different with my boyfriend. I want to travel and intern, and experience everything outside of my comfort zone. It feels like I've outgrown him in some ways. I'm tired of our intimacy and sex life, been getting annoyed with things I used to accept about him, can't find the attraction anymore and feel like I can't leave and yet a big part of me thinks I should. I don't feel like I'm in love with him like I was in high school. Little by little I just found him to appeal to me less and less, and he seemed to care less about how he came off too. It's not bad, but it's not good. I don't feel like I'm in love with him anymore and even though he feels as if we should give it a shot, it seems to me like I won't be the same and that's the hardest thing to tell him


Around wintertime I began to feel frustrated with all the little arguments cropping up lately, and met an older guy in two of my courses. We ended up being friendly and it felt nice to have a friend, I didn't want to think about the problems my boyfriend and I were facing at the time. Long story short: the older guy had his eye on me and ended up taking advantage of the situation by kissing me and constantly bombarding me with texts, calls and messages afterward. It was messy because I didn't do anything to stop him and it strained our relationship. Others felt it was sexual assault because of its nature and so I filed a report on him to security in January. Even before the messiness of the assault, things had been going downhill for my boyfriend and me. This incident just made it worse. 

We've been through many things together and both imagined what it would be like in the future. Our relationship isn't abusive, long distance, or anything like that. We've grown out of many phases but have always loved each other at the end of the day. I'm not sure if we just need to break up for good and see what we really need


**boyfriend note** I understood that curiosity to be with other people and I too have wondered “is this the person I’m going to spend the rest of my life with someday?” So I forgive her for the tiny part of her that was curious. I still think it’s mostly sexual assault though, and told her to file a report. After two months, we've gathered enough courage to get her to file one. The guy actually wouldn't even bother to talk to me, until one day where she introduced us, and all we said was our names and shook hands. I tried to tell her that I felt bad news from him (he added her on Facebook saying he noticed her form the first class or so and just built up the courage to talk to her. Even asked her out to dinner in a half joking half serious manner “if your boyfriend allows it”. Basically was wayyy too into my girlfriend and never bothered to invite me whenever he tried to ask her out). My girlfriend tried to convince me that he was genuinely just a good friend because she believed him. This caused a strain in our relationship because we didn't agree, She also started feeling something for him, until he betrayed her trust and kissed her, put his hands on her boobs, and made her sit on him in a way that she felt his dick on her inner thigh. Though she didn't stop him out of panic, she did tell me that she was curious, but it felt very very wrong right away. Though our relationship was already straining in the fall, this became the primary concern in the winter, and now that we’re over that, the old problem showed up: she’s falling out of love.


**TL;DR:**  Basically, we were struggling a little bit. She’s getting annoyed of the things I do that didn't annoy her before. She feels like she’s out growing me, and loving me less and less. Then back stabbing sexual assaulting “friend” caused us to have more arguments. I've been as supportive as I can to help her and we started loving again, until she started feeling like falling out of love again. Please help us, I see so much potential in our relationship, and there’s so much we haven’t gotten to do... I still love her very much and a break up seems like the “final, no other solution” option.

It was your average interview, a little introduction, a programming problem, and then some questions from me to him.

It was my first real programming interview, and to be honest, I was nervous as hell, but I think it actually went pretty well. The problem wasn't too difficult and as he was giving me the problem statement I immediately identified that using a HashMap would perfectly help me solve the problem.

The one thing I think I did poorly on was my test cases; literally anytime I wrote a few lines of code that could lead to a mistake the interviewer stopped me and guided me towards figuring out the problem. From what I've read, I usually heard that interviewers let you carry on coding for a bit with your mistakes, so I wasn't sure how to take that.

After I solved the problem the interviewer took some time to talk to me about the importance of thinking of your corner cases and potential inputs before you write code, so that you don't spend time after you finish polluting your code with extraneous test cases and such. Being a novice programmer, I don't think like that yet but I truly believe it's a great ideal to hold.

I'm planning on sending him a thank you email today for interviewing me, and I wanted to know if you guys think that it would be a good idea to mention my lack of testing and how the interview gave me valuable insight? Thank you!

I am currently a student at DePaul University but am an accounting major. My younger brother, however, is a sophomore in high school and is very interested in obtaining a computer science degree. We live in the Chicagoland area, he wants to stay close to home, and most likely will not get into University of Chicago or Northwestern, so it looks like it will come down to DePaul or UIC.

Information from DePaul says their CS graduates average starting salary last year was ~ $61,000 but I cannot find stats for UIC. I am wondering which program would be better for my brother to attend strictly based on internship and job opportunities upon graduation (ie not considering tuition). 

If anyone can shed some light on this I would really appreciate it. "

* The first is a conventional two-year/four-semester program at a large, prestigious university. It's also in the middle of a large metropolitan area so summer internship and networking opportunities are sure to be plentiful. I've looked over the courses and spoken to one of the current students and he says the classes are very good and taught by both well-known academic researchers and industry professionals, and there's a wide selection of electives to choose from so you can gear up your coursework for your sub-field of choice. The downside here is it would cost nearly $25,000 per semester for the tuition and fees (sans room/board and living costs) with little to no opportunities for scholarships.

* The second is at a very small, virtually unknown state school. It's 15 months, but it's still four semesters if you include the summer sessions. The upside here is it also comes with an internship at a data science facility--I'd be working 20 hours a week for those 15 months and receiving a $25,000 stipend. The tuition is a lot cheaper, too--around $10,000 total. And the last thing that makes this appealing is it's a full on M.S. in Mathematics instead of a ""professional"" or ""industry"" degree, which usually aren't as good. I've spoken to a current student and he says the coursework is fairly shallow for a graduate math degree--a semester each of Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra, SQL, and independent study along with two semesters each of Machine Learning and Applied Statistics (no variation--if I want to specialize in business intelligence or NLP or whatnot I'd have to do that on my own time). As for the internship, he says the work is interesting and you're doing actual data science work/modeling/analysis (not really sure what that entails) and the guy in charge of it is very well respected in the data science community (ICDSE committee member). 

The other option would be to choose neither. A couple months ago I started an entry level software engineering gig that pays $20/hr, so maybe I can work my way up from there.  

So ... Any thoughts or opinions on what I should go with?"
2y16sa,3,2015-03-05,[FL]Employer did not pay me in full and on time. Payday is tommorow and I'm still waiting on the rest of the money. He is also violating intern laws. Do I have a case in court?,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2y16sa/flemployer_did_not_pay_me_in_full_and_on_time/,"I was hired a month and a half ago. We agreed to $8.50/hr or $340/week. I wasn't sure if I was hired as a wage worker or a contractor. I didn't sign any paperwork but was asked to bring my social security card and my ID. Every website I design will reward me with an extra of 30% of what the client pays him, so if I work quick enough I could get $600-$1000 per week. I was hired as a secretary and paid to answer phone calls and stuff because I did not have any design experience, but not paid to do any design training. So my hours get cut off when the office closes and training starts. I'm also on a 90 day probationary period which my performance on the job will determine whether or not I get a raise in pay.

Employer came to me one day after several secretary screw ups, and how I'm not designing sites fast enough, and stated that he's losing more money with me than making it. I made several mistakes as a secretary, and as a result I was released from the position and moved on to web design, which while I'm still an intern, won't pay hourly, but by percentage(30% per website made and sold). I don't blame him since I wasn't being very productive enough. He wanted me to make one website per day for clients, and within four hours.

During the first three weeks on the job, I was a receptionist and was paid by the hour. However, training for web design and web marketing is not paid. Normally the office closes at 6pm. There were a few instances where I had to stay as late as 9pm or 11pm to get projects done. I logged in my hours for after 6, only to be reminded that I was not paid for it because I was training.

After doing some research on internship laws, it stated that unpaid interns are not allowed to do projects that would benefit the employer. I stayed at the office until 11pm with no car or a way home without him dropping me off, which he did, and all I did was write a script for him and constructed a video for him and his website. I only just remembered this recently, and was not paid for those hours. **I don't know how I can prove that the video made was mine, and I constructed it, and the script.**

I was scheduled to be paid on the 20th, but did not get paid until the monday after, but it was half. (he said he ran out of checks or something.) I was supposed to be paid at least $640 before taxes, and he only gave me $300 in cash and stated that he'd pay the rest at the end of the week, which he did, but it was an extra $180 instead. He said as soon as the client pays him, I'll get the rest. I try to be understanding as he is a human being and he's running a small business, not some big corporate company.

I reluctantly called him yesterday while he was in a meeting, and asked to be paid the remaining amount since the next pay day is this Friday. He said he'd take care of it the next day. The next day, he was never in the office, and that is where I put my foot down and state that if he doesn't pay me by friday, I'll report him to the department of labor, and possibly sue him for damages, overtime, and transportation and IRS taxes since I can't prove that he deducted taxes out of my pay(though he asked me if I wanted to). This Friday was the next pay day, and I'm giving him until that time to pay me the remaining $200+ plus the $680, that was from orking the last two weeks, for if he fails to pay me, I'm walking out and reporting him. 

**Should I wait for the client to pay him the money? Or should I just leave now? Am I being reasonable to the employer?**

Is what he's doing illegal? Is there anything I can do about it besides just leaving, because I lost my last job for this one, and all of my money from it, and at this rate since I didn't realize he didn't take taxes off until recently, I will owe the IRS a substantial amount of money that I can't afford. I don't have working experience, or I wouldn't be in this situation. There's no company out there that wants to hire me because I have no working design experience. I've been looking for a design job for over three years, and this was the first one I got hired in.

The problem is, I was not given any paperwork to fill out other than an application. I have heard interns don't require I9s yet, some of them managed to sue companies for millions for unpaid work. So I don't have any proof that I worked for him. Actually, I talked to his secretary and she stated that the i9 form is in the mail and after 6 weeks of being on the job, no paperwork is filed.

**Do I have recourse in court? Can I sue the employer for damages? What can I do without doing something I'm going to regret?**

**TL;DR**

* Been on the job for 6 weeks as a web design intern in training and a desk receptionist. Employer did not pay the full amount from last payroll. He still owes me $200 until tommorow which he will owe me $880.

* Was informed that I will not be paid after closing hours which is considered training hours. I naively did a project thinking it was training and the employer used my work, and I was not paid for those hours. He violated internship laws because of this.

* I have no proof that he deducted taxes off my pay. So he gave me a regular check, without a payroll information for the first pay period. So as a result, I could be owing the IRS a lot of money I can't even afford.

* I have given him until tommorow to pay me the rest of the money from last payroll and the current paycheck and if I don't get anything by then, I will report him to the Department of Labor and the IRS and I will consider the possibility of suing him.

* Wants to know if I have any chance at court."

We met through a mutual friend, and really hit it off.  Both his and mine parents are divorced, I used to live with my mom before dating him. My mom and stepdad are very, very strict when it comes to dating (Having to wait until college to be in a serious realtionship, no dating anyone older than 2 years or at least have to sit down and ask for permission to do so) However, about three months into our relationship they made it very clear that they disliked him. They would constantly tell me that I could do better, were constantly trying to dictate how our relationship would work (No sex, no staying out past 10, no hickeys, no sleepovers etc. etc.) It got to the point my boyfriend felt very, very uncomfortable being around them, and I ended up moving in with my dad a few months ago. Now my Dad's family LOVES him. My dad enjoys when he sleeps over with me, he's nothing but respectful (Often bringing food and treats for my family) and it's very clear he wants nothing but to get along with the family. My dad understands that I am growing up and doesn't mind when we stay out, come back late, so long as I let him know I'm alive and ok periodically. Recently my mom's side of the family has once again began expressing their dislike of my boyfriend, to the point they're using my sister's facebook to message me to tell me that I am being very inappropiate, telling me that this is just a phase he's going to break up with me where would my life be without him, he's good for nothing (My boyfriend went to a tech school for musical engineering, and has a part time job in the works, has an internship at a studio, an interview lined up at a major label, and also works the convince store down the road from him) It's getting to the point it's affecting our relationship in a really negative way. I am the survivor of a sexual assault, and severe bullying. He's one of the few guys I feel safe with, and who understands my triggers and is very respectful towards it. He honestly makes me happy and I was wondering if anyone had similar problems that had advice on how to help my parents accept him?"

http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xono9/i_hate_being_young_and_naive_mom_is_demanding_300/

I'm still young and I wish someone told me about things like this when I was younger so I don't run into it. But I was blinded by desperation and the fear of never getting a new job, that I didn't step back and think about things. I've been looking for a design job for over three years, and haven't ran into any of them except this one.

I'm going to take your advice but this time, give him until tommorow to give me the money he owes me from 2 weeks ago, plus the current check because tommorow is payday. If I don't get a cent by tommorow, I'm walking out of the door, reporting him to the department of labor, the IRS, and considering my option of filing a lawsuit, because he also violated internship laws by not paying me for staying outside closing hours, staying until 11pm to make a script and promotional video for him that he used on his website that he's using to get referrals and sales. I set my hours until 11pm and he said he is only paying me for office work, and after hours is training. Internship laws state that Unpaid interns must do projects that only benefit them.

And there were instances that unpaid interns filed lawsuits against their companies for not paying them to do their projects.

The only issue I have is how to muster up the courage to say that I'm not getting paid. I have this fear that I'm going to do something I'm going to regret, because he's providing me training and experience and he will mention this. I can't afford to spend potentially another year to get a new job. 

After all this. What can I do to avoid this mistake again? How do I know who is an honest businessman, and who isn't? "

**Gender:** Male

**TL;DR of my life:** I had lots of freinds as a child and I used to be very socially active. I had a very vivid imagination, and I'd sometimes play by myself, or with friends, in the forest and make up all sorts of weird scenarios in my head. I used to be really into video games, and used to walk around thinking about game design and how I would make my own game if I had the opportunity. I used to draw a lot as well, and I'd often draw ideas about my video games. Becoming a game desginer used to be my dream from an early age. I used to play both soccer and handball, and I also did taekwondo, but I was never a jock, or into sports for that matter. I was never really particularly good at any sport, and I used to daydream about other stuff during practice. I think my parents wanted me to play sports. I have never been popular around girls, and I have always been somehwat eccentric and dramatic in a weird way, but I still hung out with the cool kids somehow. I was always right in between the normal kids and the weirdos, and I used to hang out with both groups. I stopped playing sports when I was about 13. I started playing guitar and listening to metal music. I even started playing in bands and stuff. Between 13 - 16 I still had a great social life, but I started getting into a lot of fights. People started picking on me, and I would always stand up for myself. I was very tall and strong, so they would always gang up on me, but sometimes I'd still win. I used to do really well in school, and I used to have really big ambitions. I was one of those annoying kids that thinks they're smarter than everyone. From 16 - 19 I started becoming more and more of a seclusive weirdo. I played a lot of video games, I started smoking cannabs, whenever I went out with friends I'd usually drink way to much and I'd end up in a fight. When I was 17, me and my family moved to Singapore for a year (I'm from Sweden), and that probably had a big impact on my life. I never really had a girlfriend, I stayed a virgin until I was 20. In my last school years I rarely showed up, and I had to do another year to finish up some classes. I was not very happy with myself to be completely honest. After school I decided that I wanted to become a welder, so I took my welding license. I was unemployed for a long time, because I couldn't find a job. I then decided to that I wanted to become a chemical engineer, turns out I couldn't keep up with all the math, but I was really good at the programming courses. I dropped out either way, and now I'm going to join the military.

**Interests right now:** I have a really big interest in music, and I want to create my own album some time. I mostly like progressive rock and folk music. I'm really interested in philosophy and comparative religion (I'm not the least bit religious). I like to think about how things connect with eachother, and how history repeats itself. ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell was a very inspirational book for me. I've also been into some spiritual stuff like new age, occultism and what not, mostly because of curiosity and because I'm very interested in personal development. Programming is kind of itneresting as well, but I'm not really good at it. 

**How I percieve myself in general:** I've always been a very serious person on the inside, but I can sometimes come of as laid back and friendly. Sometimes I'll act like a complete goof because I don't take the situation seriously, it's like an intern joke that only I get, and everyone else thinks that I'm a goof for real. I don't really care about what people think about me. I guess I'm a bit paranoid (not in the medical sense), because I have a hard time trusting people, and I have a very negative attitude towards the future. It's usually easy for me to get along with new people. I'm usually very helpful when ome of my friends need help. I'm sort of critical towards myself. Another interesting thing about myself is that I can't focus on learning something if I feel like I'm not going to have use for it in the future. When I was studying programming as one of the starting courses when I studied to become an engineer, I had to tell myself that I was going to become a programmer, in order to get the motivation to learn it, and I actually ended up changing programs to computer science before I dropped out.

I'm very thankfull for anyone that took the time to read all of this, and I would be very thankful if anyone could guess what my type might be. "
2y1qed,1,2015-03-05,Nvidia vs. Nest,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y1qed/nvidia_vs_nest/,"So I'm a third year in college with two offers for internships at both Nvidia and Nest Labs.  
I'm having an extremely hard time deciding between the two. (Salary and location are not issues here.)

At Nvidia, I'd be doing work with customizing and debugging Android kernel (essentially linux kernel).

At Nest, I'd be doing applications integrations, which is essentially integration testing for mobile apps.

On one hand, I can get more stimulating and challenging work that would give me harder-to-get experience for future jobs (I like systems, gpu-computing, and HPC and eventually would like to work for a company such as SpaceX.)

On the other hand I have a chance of getting more connections in a trending startup that also gives me Google employee status, but the job itself sounds less interesting.

My offer for Nvidia would be a returning offer. Does taking that look a lot better than jumping among different companies, since it shows consistency and that a company wants me back?   
Would the chance of getting closer to Google be worth interning at Nest?"

Background: I have previous internships as a product strategist and business consultant however halfway through my schooling I shifted to majoring in only computer science (was a double with an engineering discipline). I love coding but I also love taking big picture views of software products as a whole. I am graduating in Dec. and am cautious of not getting software development experience in the industry before graduation but honestly I love product manager descriptions. I do not, however, enjoy being stuck on excel or gantt charts all day. I don't mind working on them but I prefer something more challenging. I have a broad idea of what everyday tasks may be like but I am partially guessing at this point.

Think some miserable cubicle job doing menial coding day after day (taking your lumps is one thing, being in a dead end position is another). I'm 32 with no professional experience so I already feel very behind. My original goal was to go to school for the degree and the exposure to the different parts of computer science and work on side projects in the meantime - side projects which I believe will teach me more then anything I'll learn in a classroom. So I worry that if I focus too much on my school I'll miss out on the more important things I should be doing.

So this is where I'm at - go to the more 'prestigious' school or a more convenient one that'll let me focus on other things for the next two years.

The thing I love about coding is that your skills matter more then some pedigree in this field. Going to a mediocre school and improving my skills on the side or going to a better school that offers more opportunities (internships, etc.).

Thanks for the advice."

Of course i was very nervous and shy at first of and everyone was very welcoming. Everything was great...till now. Idk why but lately I've felt so out of place there and I barely speak to anyone. The fact that my desk is separated from my department doesn't really help either I guess. But the one thing that is driving me crazy is that I can't say good morning anymore. I feel like when I've said it before they're just like whatever...and it makes me feel crappy so now I awkwardly walk in and say good morning to the people closest to my desk. I walk in an I get so anxious, telling myself ""OK today will be the day I say it!"" Its something so stupid and I was able to say it fine before. I guess just the fact that I know I'll go there to do nothing is really starting to get to me and idk what to do."
2y31l0,6,2015-03-05,CS Major ENG needs counseling !,alibaba0304,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/2y31l0/cs_major_eng_needs_counseling/,"Hey, guys.
I'm a Sophomore CS major in ENG, and I want to ask other CS majors about how the life of professional CS industry is like. 
In more details, I'm a CS major who just finished two most basic CS courses : 125 and 173. I had no previous CS experiences unlike some CS majors who had interests in CS since they were young. So, I am really confused if ""only following the school curriculum"" is fine to be a professional CS person after I graduate. Well, following the school curriculum and getting good enough to graduate doesnt seem to be that difficult, but what I really worry about is that I really don't get how CS companies work and how my learnings in college will help me with it. I have no internship experiences and not really sure what the CS companies are looking for. I don't know what to focus on when I take CS courses. 

I'm sorry for making the question too vague, but this is my situation right now; my identity as a CS major is vague. 

Let me rephrase my questions:

1. I'm not sure what to focus on when I take CS courses. What will be helpful for me to be a professional CS major in the future?
2. What is a good thing to do other than just following the school curriculum to be fully prepared for working in CS industry?
3. How do CS companies work? Im sure that it will be way different from how school works. 

I'm so proud to be a CS major in UIUC, but I really want to utilize this opportunity to be successful in the future. I will appreciate your advice! "

2y35cm,8,2015-03-05,Exit Interview Advice,BobSagetAshleyOlsen,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2y35cm/exit_interview_advice/,"Hi everyone,

I have my exit interview next Thursday and was looking for some advice. I feel pretty good about getting an offer. All my current and past teams have basically said I'll get one. I had my exit chat with the head recruiter last week and I mentioned I might be interested in transferring to the transaction advisory service line down the road. 


The recruiter mentioned that the firm has a 3 year rotation program where you do audit for 9 months and advisory for 3. She said she couldn't guarantee anything, but that we could definitely talk about it more in a month. 


Anyways, I'm so focused on landing a spot in this program. I'm meeting with a partner tomorrow to see if he knows anything about the program. I've worked with him on 2 engagements during my internship. My goal is to get as many people as possible to vouch/back me for this spot. So far I have established some great relationships and my reviews have been good so far. 


Now for the exit interview.. So the partner is an alumni from my school. I've never met him, but he's apparently really nice. I've heard that the interview is pretty standard.. talk about the internship for a while, then he/she will extend you an offer.  Now should I mention my interest in the program during the interview, or should I wait until if/when I accept my full-time offer? 



Thanks everyone!"

[Jamie and Renee, did you ever feel like quitting twloha? What kept you going? Ps. When I was depressed in 7th grade I found out about twloha and you guys have me the courage to ask for help.  I'm forever thankful for you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5tovo?context=5)|I've definitely thought about quitting! And there's grace for those feelings and those days. It's okay to rest and take breaks. Self-care is important. Having a life beyond work is too. It's healthy that i'm part of something bigger than just me. i'm part of a team, and something that means a lot to a lot of people. It's a marathon, not a sprint. 
[I wanted to thank both of you because due to you guys a lot of people know more about the battles that are faced but also that there are people that WANT to help! I just had a couple questions... 1-do you think there would ever be a book of the film? 2-any advice for someone who wants help but feels depleted  when they tell someone something private?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qu5g?context=5)|Prob not a book about the film. There's already the original TWLOHA story. Renee wrote a book called Purpose for the Pain, and my first book comes out in May. i believe she has plans to write more as well. My advice would be to keep being honest and to ask for help even when it's hard. We've heard so many stories of people's lives changing as a result of them getting professional help.
[Thank you and I will keep trying... One more think I thought of; how can I try to get my parents to forget any preconceived ideas about depression, self injury?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5rn5z?context=5)|I would encourage you to be honest with them. It's hard because you can't control what comes of the conversation, but you can tell them what's important to you, what you wish they could see. Perhaps you challenge them to learn and understand.
[Former intern here :\) How is the program going today? Very well, I hope!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qn28?context=5)|I love our intern program!! It's one of my favorite parts of TWLOHA. i love the way it continues to evolve and build on the past. Right now we have 8 folks living together and working together. Come back and say hello : )
[Jamie: What role did David McKenna play in the development of your organization? Renee: What role did David play in your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5t57r?context=5)|David encouraged me to believe i could leave my previous job, that TWLOHA could become an organization... and then he was on our Board early on. More than anything, he was a huge encouragement to me. We laughed a lot. 
[, you guys are awesome. Love the hope that you both spread. My questions: How does it feel to have moments of your lives put into a movie? Were you both satisfied with the way it came out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qa7k?context=5)|Hey thanks. It's definitely not something i ever thought would happen, seeing someone play me in a movie. i can't speak for Renee but i do feel satisfied. Overall, i'm happy with the whole thing and so glad people can finally see it!
[(Jamie and Renee\) Is there a thought, word or mantra that get's you through the hard days?  Also what's the story with the purple quilt in the background of the office scene? I've seen it a lot in friends intern house pictures.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5rvec?context=5)|The purple quilt came from the intern house, i do believe! Hmmm... i guess i just try to remind myself that things pass, and not to be so hard on myself... It's okay to rest. It's okay to unplug and do something that helps me smile. 
[Jamie and Renee, both of you were kind of suddenly thrust into this place where a lot of people were coming to you with their questions and their stories and their cries for help. Have either of you ever felt pressure to have all the answers? What do you do with that kind of pressure? How do you offer yourselves grace in the process of offering others grace?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5th5g?context=5)|It's been about 9 years now. The beginning was definitely the hardest, when it was just her and i. These days, there's a whole team of people who do this work together. i'm okay with saying ""i don't know."" And there are professionals we love to point people to. Grace is definitely a good thing : )
[Hi! do you think that one day there will be events for twloha in the uk? also, just wanted to say that i love you both so much. Thanks to spread hope and love &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qh5h?context=5)|I hope we can do more there. i got to go with The Rocket Summer in 2007 and i absolutely loved it. Folks from our team have been there since for events, and we hear from lots of folks there. i hope to get back there soon!
[I have been a fan of TWLOHA since the beginning and am in recovery for self-injury and sex addiction. What do either/both of you believe is the biggest motivation for change in an individual?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5s4qg?context=5)|That's so awesome that you're in recovery. Be encouraged. i believe a lot of people get to a place where they know a better life is possible, that things don't have to stay the way they are. Perhaps hope starts there.
[It seems like the film gives a new view than the postcard story. What encouraged you to retell the story in such a different way? What are your hopes for the film now that it's released?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qima?context=5)|The idea started with David McKenna. The vision began with him. The hope is that it starts conversations that lead to people getting help and even choosing to stay alive. 
[Jamie! Thanks for years of inspiration!  How did you and Jon Foreman meet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qdyv?context=5)|I met Jon back when i was working for Quiksilver. i was a fan and found out he was a surfer. We've been friends for something like 15 years!
[Did you guys enjoy the hometown screening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5q420?context=5)|We loved it. Two very special nights. Lots of friends and family. i definitely cried introducing the movie : )
[I have followed basically both of your individual stories since Jamie started TWLOHA. (probably the creeper that favorites both of your twitter accounts\) and I want to know how the movie or if it has changed things in your lives? Have you been able to reach more people? and Renee: Has is been weird for your life to go a step further besides youtube, twitter, and books to a large film to be displayed for everyone on this scale and with hollywood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qbe8?context=5)|It's only been out for a couple days but the hope and belief is that we will get to reach more people because of the film. And not so much to introduce them to us, but to introduce them to the idea that it's okay to be honest and it's okay to ask for help. i think we both get excited about that.
[What are your favorite movies?  Thanks for everything that TWLOHA has done. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qa2a?context=5)|My favorites are Brick, Inception, Lord of the Rings &amp; Good Will Hunting. You're welcome : )
[Jamie, who is your favorite Lord of the Rings character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qmpz?context=5)|Frodo!!
[TWLOHA and Renee's story has seriously helped me in so many ways!! What is the best way to reach out to people in my own community who are struggling? I have found it quite hard because I'm under 15. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5s9ix?context=5)|I think you start with your friends, people you know. That's where you have the most influence. From there, we've learned that honesty is contagious. 
[Question, About the 5K, I'm not exactly the runner type, lol. But I was wondering if there is any other way I can help out at Satellite Beach during the run?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5tf5f?context=5)|I'm sure you could volunteer and/or you could simply walk. Some people push strollers. We would simply love to have u there!
[ - thank you. What you have done, and are doing, is an incredible service to those of us with mental illnesses.  I'm sure you both have met some amazing people and heard some inspirational stories. Do any of them stand out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5rych?context=5)|Every time i meet someone who says they're still alive because of the work we do, that's the moment. That means the world to me. That's the dream and the goal.
[ off, let me first say that both of you are my biggest inspirations.  TWLOHA has done a lot for me personally, and I love sharing the messages behind the organization with everyone I know. Thank you for helping me realize that I'm not alone.  My question for both of you is: Do you feel that the movie does the story justice? Does it adequately capture every aspect you wanted it to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5q4v0?context=5)|I definitely think the film captures the spirit of the story. For me personally, my favorite part is David McKenna, played by Rupert Friend. His performance really takes me back and reminds me of my buddy David. 
[I haven't finished the movie yet. Had to chat. But duo you have any quick words of wisdom for the person who hurts more than they want to admit, and feel trapped by life? They don't think ending it is the right answer, but scared by thoughts of things never ending.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5r1gr?context=5)|I think it's important to be honest. You deserve that. And it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to walk through this alone. Be encouraged. You definitely matter. 
[I just want to start by saying that the both of you have helped inspire me to start recovery and I am on my way to two years. Thank you for that.  I'm sorry because my question is not as much about the movie.  I want to know how you show others you believe in them beyond saying it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qbzq?context=5)|That's a great question! i think actions go a long way, the way we show up and keep showing up for people... Listening, being present, making people feel important and known. 
[Jamie, one of the questions on the intern application video is ""Tell us 5 random/quirky things about yourself."" On my video I listed that I love horses, I love to take photos in the snow, I read psychology books for fun, I love stuffed animals more than most children do, and I think Dr. Seuss books are better when read out loud in an english accent. What are 5 random and quirky things about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5sa19?context=5)|I read about basketball every morning. 
[Jamie, I've wondered about your story for a while. Have you ever filmed it or written about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5sh4s?context=5)|I have a book coming out May 19. It's called If You Feel Too Much : )
[Oh! I didn't realize it was going to contain your story! (haha, fail.\) That makes the book release even more exciting! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5sola?context=5)|It's not a memoir but it definitely contains a lot of my story.

I don't mind doing light coding but the idea of working with a team to build something from the ground up while trying to meet a dead line sounds extremely stressful. Also, i'm insecure about my skill level compared to my peers. Are there branches that require less development than others? I just don't know what to expect from the professional world but software development sounds like pure hell.

Edit: I'm particularly interested in the field of cyber security.
Edit2: Do all internships require software development? Everything I've looked at seems to just want people to develop and I feel like at my current skill/knowledge level I'll get fired from anything I apply for."
2y3e4y,1,2015-03-05,I (21F) am unable to get wet after 2 years with boyfriend (22M),throwaway756398,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2y3e4y/i_21f_am_unable_to_get_wet_after_2_years_with/,"My boyfriend and I started dating two and a half years ago when I was 19, he was my first real relationship and sexual partner, we happened to be roommates on a short term contract at the time. Sex was great, frequent, I absolutely loved it and if I had an issue with arousal it was that it occurred too frequently, we couldn't even spoon without me grinding into him, never had an issue with lubrication. 

For the first year and a half we alternated living together and separately and had a great sex life. Like obviously there was the occasional time where I was crampy or needed additional warming up but in general great sex that I was always super into and adequately wet.

Then he moved away for an 8-month internship. I don't think there's anything better than long distance sex but issues started surfacing here, it was great the first time but later into the trips I started having issues getting adequately wet, probably just because I wasn't use to it and all of the sudden it was all this sex at once, no big deal we just grabbed some lube and off we went.

He's been back and we're been living together for 6 months now and my ability to get aroused has completely declined since. The idea of having sex without lube is inconceivable and no matter how much we use its always painful going in, once its in it takes some time to get used it, I believe the vagina expands when aroused and in absence of this it hurts me. Foreplay doesn't seem to work, at one point I asked him to stop trying to finger me because being fingered when dry is not a good feeling, oral is generally good but it takes me some time to adjust to it because I'm extremely ticklish. It doesn't make penis insertion better either.

We both still initiate sex, me more than him. I want to have sex but once it gets started I just lose interest. Sometimes I'll be really into it when we start kissing but then I just won't be anymore and will feel like I'm just going through the motions, not aroused. Other times I'll be really into it and initiating but then he remembers about the dishes or some other task and by the time he gets back to me, I am no longer into it.

Probably half the time once the sex gets going, like minutes after penetration, I'll start enjoying. But there are certain positions we can't do anymore because no matter what they hurt me.

I've tried talking to him about it multiple times. When this was starting I would often be a teary mess right after because I was so mad at myself for not being able to be aroused and so upset that at 21 my sex life was already terrible. His response has generally been along the lines of ""what can I do to help"" but I honestly don't know. I can see it hurts his pride and he would be mortified if he knew how uncomfortable sex generally is for me.

I read the FAQ which basically said ""make sure you're wet"" but that doesn't happen for me and foreplay is painful because I'm not aroused.

Something that changed when we went for his internship is that I started watching porn regularly for the first time. Previous to that I had masturbated regularly for years just never to actual porn. I also started masturbating less when he left which continues to now. I stopped the porn to see if it was maybe messing with my ideas on sex and only masturbate based on imagination now maybe twice a week. I also stopped taking my birth control pills a month ago which I've been on since the start of our relationship. I couldn't pick them up due to circumstances but I know they can mess with libido. I've been off them for a month but I don't know if maybe the effects linger longer than that. Those are the only things I can think of and changing them doesn't seem to be working, I don't know what else to try.

Looking for advice on how I can get aroused when even foreplay is painful or if anyone has other advice based on all these TMI details.

TLDR; Stopped being able to get wet after 2 years, want to have great sex again

2y3est,1,2015-03-05,"Me [24F] with my mom [50sF], trying to figure out how to broach the subject of living with my SO [24M] of two years for the summer.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2y3est/me_24f_with_my_mom_50sf_trying_to_figure_out_how/,"Throwaway because my SO is a redditor.  Sorry (but also not sorry?) for the crazy-long wall o' text.


Some background:


I'm currently a law student living and studying in another state.  My SO and my mom live in my home state.  My SO lives in City, and my mom lives in Suburb, which is about 20 miles north of City.  


This past summer, I had an internship in City and commuted to work everyday.  I was on the road at least an hour and a half everyday (on a good day) and paid up to $50/week in tolls on the tollway.  It was a pretty straight shot, but still a hassle and left me with a dilemma.  I could either come home straight from work and deal with traffic for an hour in the afternoon (spending no time with my SO and limited time with my mom when I got home) OR have dinner with my SO until rush hour passed and get home in 25 min around 9pm (spending some time with my SO and limited time with my mom again).


This summer, I have a paid internship in City.  I'm expecting there to be long hours for work.  I'll either be working late on assignments or going to work-related events for the associates (happy hours, bowling nights, etc).  It's really important that I attend a LOT of these events so that I can make a good impression and get hired at this firm.  There's also likely to be alcohol at these events, and I don't want to be a square and refuse to drink just because I have a long drive home.


My SO lives about a five-minute drive away from my firm's office.  From his place, I could walk to work in the same amount of time that it would take me to drive to work from my mom's house.  My SO suggested that I live with him this summer while I work.  He wouldn't charge me rent, but would like to split groceries.  We're not engaged, but we're in this for the long haul, and we were planning on moving in together before we get married anyway.  We've also been long-distance for almost two years and living together would be AWESOME.  We knew each other in college, but we've never experienced being adults-with-jobs together.  Because we're both planning on having somewhat stressful careers, we want to live together this summer to have a ""test run"" now so that we wouldn't have to navigate the stresses of having new jobs AND living together at the same time.  


I know that this sounds like a no-brainer so far, but here's where the dilemma lies.  My parents were both immigrants that started with nothing and worked their way up to an upper-middle-class life.  My father died seven years ago and my mother is very protective of our time together, especially now that I'm at school far away (I went to college in City).  She's also pretty traditional about relationships/marriage and a fairly strong Catholic.  I'm the oldest in my family, and I've always been the one with ""boy problems"", since I've dated a few duds in the past, so I don't know how much she trusts my judgment on men.  She seems to like my current SO, but she has reservations about me being in a relationship at such a young age (she got married at ~30 after dating my dad for 10 years).


My mom and I are very close, and I love her a lot.  She's a wonderful parent who goes above and beyond to provide for my sister and me - she's paying for my tuition and all expenses while I'm getting my degree.  She doesn't charge me rent over the summer and she pays all the associated tolls/gas - they're not consequential for her.  She really treasures the time we have together while I'm in Suburb during the summers and breaks, so anything that makes it easier for me to spend time with her (such as tolls for commuting or gas for my car) is a good purchase in her eyes, even if the dollar amount is large.  Mom is an introvert and runs her own business, so she doesn't really spend time with other people.  My sister and I are her pride and joy.  


I don't want to seem ungrateful by taking her money and then ditching her for the summer.  I am very well aware that I am damn lucky to have a mother like her, so the last thing I want to be is entitled.  I am also well aware that this is an unusual dynamic to have between a mother and her adult daughter, but we are from a country where adult children often live with their parents until their mid-twenties and three-generation households are normal.


My mother's and my relationship dynamic has caused some problems between my SO and me.  He's a very independent person and comes from a family that valued independence.  I have made the mistake of prioritizing my time with my mom over my time with him before, and it's something that makes him upset.  Understandably so.  He has mentioned to me that he would be very hurt if I didn't live with him this summer, especially because it is logistically a smarter option and it would mean so much for our relationship.  He didn't mean it in a ""dealbreaker"" way, but I can understand that he would see it as a reflection of my priorities, and he would be upset if I didn't consider his needs and wants for our relationship a priority.  I want to live with him, not just because of logistical reasons, but also because I think this is a smart step in our relationship.


I plan on talking with my mom about this sometime in the next week, and I would love ideas on how to approach the conversation.  I've thought about compromising on the amount of time I'm living with my SO if she's very opposed to the idea - I have an eight-week internship, so I could suggest two weeks with her and six with my SO, etc.  It's also important to her that I go to church, so I could join her on the weekends (or at least Sundays), but live with my SO during the week.  I basically want anything that will be different from last summer.  I was constantly stressed out that I wasn't paying enough attention to my mom or SO.  If I left my SO's place at 10pm on a work night, he would be blue that I couldn't spend the night, and my mom would be blue that I got home at 10:30pm and we didn't get a chance to eat dinner together.  I feel like living with my SO would allow me to focus plenty on my internship, focus a lot of time on fostering a relationship with my SO, and leave my weekends to be 100% dedicated to my mom.


**tl;dr**: Love my mother, love my SO.  I want to live with SO over the summer due to relationship progression and logistics, but don't want to be an ungrateful daughter and make my mother upset.  I also don't want to cave 100% to what my mother would want because my SO would be hurt.  How should I bring up living with my SO this summer to my mother in a way that will help her understand my position?

Thanks in advance!"

A little about me, I am a freshman in college wanting to major in Computer Science and minor in Cognitive Science. It is a little early to be looking for internships or jobs but I like to plan and I want to get a early start on forming my resume to suit this field I want to enter. After a long time spent researching into potential careers that I may be interested in, I have come to find something I feel truly passionate about.

What is this career you ask? I'll try my best to describe it.

Names I can come up with are: Computational Neuroscience, Neural Engineering

The idea of [transhumanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) absolutely **fascinates** me! Artificial Intelligence is really neat, but [Intelligence Amplification(IA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification) is really what gets me excited. The H+ YouTube series is kind of what sprouted this idea and excitement for the future of technology. Researching, and hopefully developing products in this field is my goal and I don't really have any clue on what road to start down. 

I searched around on here and couldn't find anything similar to what I was looking for but if I missed it could someone send me the link?

I found [this](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/6140418) ad by Qualcomm on Linkedin and it seems to match with my interests.

I am also interested with any kind of CS work with the brain so even careers involving AI/Robots and so on still interest me. Brain Corp jumps out to me as a great option.




What I need help with:

* I can't quite find a label/name to categorize it under, when asked by family what I want to do it ends up being some long winded explanations that end in them being more confused than when I began.
* I feel like my interest isn't quite in a field that is actively being done, meaning that it's mostly in the research stage, so I am unsure of things like where I should intern, what companies I should aspire to work for, how to even find companies hiring in this field etc.
* What language(s) (if there are any specific languages for this field) should I begin to learn on my own to better my resume?
* Since most of the work being done in this field is in research, should I go beyond a bachelor's? It appears that research work is done by people with higher levels of degree's.
* Are there other companies that you know of that are doing what I am hoping to do?



Sorry for the long post, but I'd appreciate any kind of answer to any or all of the questions, I could really use the help! Thanks in advance!

2y3hsu,6,2015-03-05,Do research assistant positions boost a resume much?,Nixonite,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y3hsu/do_research_assistant_positions_boost_a_resume/,"Hello everyone,

Does research assistant work carry much weight when it comes to finding a job? 

My situation is that I have a low GPA but a lot of side projects (on Github). I also have a data mining research assistant gig at the math department going on right now, and I might soon join another research group in the compsci department (also regarding data mining/ machine learning). 

I love projects, I'm a very competent self-learner, but I just don't like formal schooling very much. I am considering applying for some online grad school programs for compsci in the future if I can boost my GPA from my current level of about 2.66 to somewhere near a 2.9, and I'm hoping that all of this might come into consideration for an application. 

For jobs, I know that internships carry a lot of weight as it demonstrates prior work experience, but what about research assistant positions? They seem a bit different, and I'm not sure how they are perceived **in comparison to** internships. 

Any input is greatly appreciated."
2y3ism,2,2015-03-05,I (F/23) feel like my best friend (f/22) only contacts me when she needs something and it's hurting my feelings. Am I being overtly dramatic?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2y3ism/i_f23_feel_like_my_best_friend_f22_only_contacts/,"Me and ""Jane"" have been friends since fifth grade. We were super close until high school and then we went our separate ways, she went on to college and I went on to do absolutely nothing.   
I dealt with depression, anxiety and all the crappy bullshit that comes with it (something I didn't had to deal with in high school, I was chatty, had a large group of friends, so in retrospective I think that when she probably talked to me, she felt like she was talking to an annoyingly draining person)    
I then moved to another state and we started talking less and less until we went almost six months without messaging or even texting one another. All of that changed within the last couple of years. I started getting better, moving on with my life and feeling good enough to actually talk about better things than ""Oh, woe is me"".
We resumed our friendship as if nothing had ever happened and started planning ways to see one another. That opportunity arose earlier this year when she was given an internship in a city close to my town. I offered to pick her up at the airport (which is really, really far) and I was super excited to finally spend sometime with her.
I guess I should've mentioned this earlier in the post, but due to the issues I dealt with within the last years, even though I feel much better, I still struggle with making friends and meeting new people my age, so I basically only speak with friends I already know from years ago that don't live anywhere near me--I guess this is worth noting.     
Jane mentioned how amazing it would be for us to be so close to each other and to be able to hang out and do the things we used to do in high school.  
That week she spent at my house was just like I had envisioned. We joked, we went out everyday and I had fun for the first time in a long time with someone that's not part of my family. It was great.  
When it was time for her to leave, we spoke on the road about the next time we would see each other and how she couldn't wait to spend more time with me.  
Well, that's not how things have played out. 
We've barely talked ever since and yesterday, she did something that really hurt my feelings. She texted asking me to call her so I did.  
When she answered she said something along the lines of ""Thank you for calling me. I needed an excuse to leave the living room so I asked you to call me"". Like, is not like she wanted to talk to me, is just that she needed me to get out of a situation and I was the only one that would call her so late.  
The few times we've talked since she came to live here have been because she needs something, or she needs to complain about her bosses and I let her because I feel guilty for all the times I've bullshited her with my own crap. I cut the conversation short by telling her I was going to bed and she apparently sensed I was upset and said she was sorry for not calling me that often or making any plans to see each other, that she was really busy but the truth is, I have her on Facebook and apparently she has made some new friends and am no longer needed, because all of these weekends she's hanging out somewhere new with them. I'm not saying I begrudge the fact that she made new friends, good for her, but I can't help feeling hurt and a little used when all she talked about before coming here was hanging out together. 
I haven't mentioned this to anyone else because it even sounds pathetic in my head.   
Should I cut the friendship or tell her how I feel? Or should I just accept this is the way things are and move on?  
She still expects me to drive her back to the airport when she leaves (It's 5 hours away), am I being unreasonable when I just don't feel like it anymore?   



**tl;dr**: Best friend got an internship in my state and I was excited we were finally going to hang out after quite some time apart. She apparently doesn't even want to speak with me unless she needs to."

Here goes. 

I have been working for a little over a month for a mid-size accounting firm as a temp-to-hire intern. The firm employs four interns in our department, of which there are three subdivisions and numerous managers. The manager that is ""in charge"" of me and the other interns has been extremely rude to me since day one; at first I thought it was just in my head but subsequent events during the third week of work made me think differently. 

To begin with, the manager in question has been rude from the first day. She will not smile or answer questions if I direct them at her or greet her should I see her in the halls of the office, even in front of other associates or staff members. She will actively stop speaking if I greet her when she is with others or alone. We have an ""optional"" (it is not enforced but participation is ""strongly encouraged"") happy hour event each Friday with alcohol provided. The first week of our employment, we had a training meeting to answer any questions that had arisen with interns during the first week. I had been provided contradicting information from her and other staff members I asked her who we were to speak to when addressing our questions and she informed me point blank that ""there is no reason for you to be in contact with me. If the other interns can't answer your questions, your buddy should be able to. You only need to go to a manager as a last resort."" This is in direct contradiction to her later actions; she has, on numerous occasions, provided extended personal guidance and training to two of the other interns. When I have asked her verbally for something, she sends me to someone else. At our happy hour, she  would not (and will not) interact with me at this event; at the first event held when interns were present, while playing a game she told me specifically to ""stand next to me because I don't want to be on your team,"" in front of others. 

The following week, while helping the other intern with a project, she entered another team-members cubicle and began to talk very quietly about me in a mildly disparaging, but indirect, manner. When she noticed that I could hear her, she stopped speaking entirely and hurried back to her office. 

During a weekly ""training"" event, three weeks previous, she asked all participants to contribute to the meeting by sharing something. She skipped over me as she called on people; at the end of the meeting she asked if anyone else had any contributions (we were sharing computer tips) and when I asked anyone was aware of the trick I wished to share, she said, very rudely, ""Yep, everyone knows that."" After the meeting, another intern, unprompted and in private, pulled me aside expressed condolences and surprise that the manager would be so rude to me in front of the assembled staff, and that she (the other intern) was very surprised that the manager ""hated someone else as much as [the manager] hated [the other intern]."" The following week during a mandatory ""check-in lunch"" with new interns, the manager, my ""buddy"" (a tenured staff member that acts as a guide/mentor) and myself went out for lunch; during the lunch, the manager refused to speak to me or look at me, and when I addressed her directly she answered (if at all) with one word replies. Likewise, during what are supposed to be bi-weekly check-ins witih our buddy and the manager, the manager refuses, point blank, to speak to me. She will not return feedback (verb or written) on any work that I have delivered (obviously not obligated) and I am no longer being assigned work in our scheduling rubric.

Today broke the camel's back for me. The interns were given specific instructions that, while overtime is permitted, if our work has been completed for the day and we have reached the 8 hour mark, we are permitted to go home- the firm does not want us ""milking the clock"" with overtime unless we have specific projects or needs to fulfill. Numerous times over the previous few weeks I have reached the 8 hour mark one hour early, as I have not been able to take a lunch in order to finish projects in a timely manner. When I hit the 8 hour mark at 4pm (an hour early) if all my work is done, my buddy (a senior, one step below a manager) has sent me home so as to avoid me going into overtime- again, we are expressly discouraged from working overtime if not necessary. Today my buddy gave me permission to leave but asked me to check in with the manager before leaving. I went into her office and had the following conversation: 

Me- ""Hey, I have finished all my projects and I don't have any more work for the day and because I wasn't able to take a lunch, I have hit 8 hours. Should I go home or should I stay?"" 
Manager - ""Working through lunch was your choice. I would stay."" 
Me - ""Okay. I should go into and use the hour of overtime, then?"" 

At this point, the manager (she wouldn't look at me) let out a very loud and annoyed sigh and said ""I don't know, whatever. Just go. I don't have time to figure this out for you. Just go."" (That's a quote. I wrote it down). 
This worries me greatly. Though our firm has policies in place regarding the expected work day length (8 hours) and time (8am to 5pm), I have on numerous occasions worked through lunch and been given permission to leave at 4pm by my ""buddy"" so as to avoid overtime.

In general, the manager is very cliquey. She has three staff level associates with whom she is very close; they frequently get coffee together and they also are very close and very open about their relationship outside of work. They plan after-work activities together during work hours and frequently spend work time talking about things they are going to do or have done together outside of work. 

I am at something of a loss on what to do. The work environment is extremely hostile- the members of her group of friends generally do not speak to me if I address them, especially in her presence, nor will they help me or answer questions if I ask. As I mentioned, they frequently plan extracurricular events (clubbing, bar hopping, shopping trips, etc) on office time, and while one of the interns is invited, the other interns, myself included, are excluded. She also spearheads group lunch and dinner activities, but I am expressly not invited (she will skip my cube when taking orders or discussing invitations and planning for the lunch excursions). 

On the one hand, I am not at work to make friends. However, I am extremely concerned- the firm was very strong about reinforcing the notion that ""we can teach you skills but we can't teach you fit. We're more concerned about how you fit in with the firm than anything else."" The fact that this manager will not interact with me directly is undermining my ability to learn and do my job well, and it also makes me extremely uncomfortable. The fact that another person on staff would express their concern for how rude they perceived this manager to be really is distressing. What's killing me is that I suspect that this manager treats me this way because I am gay. There are no other out gay people in our region's office, but the other managers and partners in our firm have no problem with it at all. I do not make it a point to ""advertise,"" but I have spoken casually about my partner in the past- being out at work is nothing new for me. 

Our firm does, unsurprisingly, have a non-discrimination policy in place that covers sexual orientation (and so does our state and city, I believe). Likewise, they have a code of behavior and conduct that explicitly prohibits unprofessional behavior. I am just at something of a loss as to what to do about this situation, however. I am now actively seeking employment elsewhere, but I am afraid from this last interaction we had that she will try to punish me in some way for this behavior.

Furthermore, I'm embarrassed and now feel extremely uncomfortable. I am not entirely sure on the company policy for handling this. We operate on the west coast. I am entirely comfortable confronting her, but I am not sure what the generally advised course of action is- report her? Do I report her for being rude or because I think she is treating me this way because I'm gay? Confront her? Talk to another manager? 

I know this was long but thanx for the time. 

Edit - I was a bit flustered when I wrote this yesterday and realize I didn't clarify my reason for posting. I understand that I ""harassment"" has a specific meaning, but was at a loss for the wording to use. I also understand that she has not done anything to indicate overtly that she is rude to me because of my sexual orientation. My question here is:

- What is the ""safest""/preferred course of action to get the behavior to stop?

I don't really care about her behavior personally; it's annoying, yeah, but life is annoying. However, I need the behavior to stop, not because it's embarrassing but because she is actually making it difficult for me to do my job and I am increasingly concerned I am making decisions that may be against firm policy at best and possibly creating liability issues for the firm at worst. I have been concerned about making certain decisions that might put the firm at risk. Her refusal to interact with me- she is technically my supervisor- has more than once put me in a position where I am unable to select and/or verify that I have selected an acceptable course of action due to conflicting information that has been given us regarding company policies and procedures. She is also, frequently, the only available resource to resolve these questions and she is the designated person to whom we have been directed to take these questions. In the absence of communication with her, I am frequently left having to make decisions that are of questionable value or done on the questionable authority of her subordinates and thus may expose me and/or the firm to liability.

I'm hoping this can help people out and give the Oldschool team some help.*

*If your bug is easily abusable don't post it here, post on the official bug report post on the forums*

.

**Known bugs**

* Barbarian assault only ticks off task for leader

* Mangled bones don't work for pyre but it doesn't specific chewed in the task

* **wildy bosses sometimes don't work**   Major bosses (elite task) must be done in the order stated in the task (bear-&gt;spider-&gt;skele guy) and it will complete. Minor bosses (hard task), appear to not work at all.

* **gwd is really broken** decided to remove info so people don't abuse as much, but it also appears to be luck based on whether or not it works at all for you. edit: I think it actually just requires 1 kill once you've got 1 kill count of each boss (these are lifetime kills not just since the update)

* Tiara task in rellekka sometimes doesn't work for no known reason.

* rune scim in wildy sometimes doesn't work - It won't let you mine 1 ore then smith that bar then mine the rest and smith another bar, you have to mine all the ore first?

* fish and cook 5 sharks in catherby doesn't work? I fished 5 and it went to count of 5 on the progress thing, then I went to cook and it didn't add anything. I revisited later (after logging out) and cooking 10 of them without fishing any more worked (it started from a count of 1 again in the progress).

* Progress on almost everything resets when you log out (bad for mining addy ore on jatitzo for example, you need 5 ore but only 4 are easily accessible without knowing the dungeon so you might try hop for the extra 1 and it resets). Also if, for example, GWD tasks are fixed so you have to do all 4 bosses, you wouldn't be able to log out between the kills.

* fishing bass on ape atoll is broken (you have to use the south west spot not the middle one even though task does not specify)

* Kill a zombie in the Draynor dungeon: has to be the level 13 not one of the 24s even though not specified in task.

* plenty of people complaining about the estate agent redecorating but can't give specifics sorry

* only one specific tree in varrock works for cut yew I believe

* Bake pie spell doesn't work for summer pie task in Varrock, task does not specify on a range. The new range that you get from hard diaries also doesn't work for the bake pie task.

* Small seed in to saw appears to only work when you right click ""sing"" on the bowl

* Rusty sword trade in only works when you *don't* right click the NPC

* Dragon darts in Bedabin camp should be more specific, I think it only works in the tent when the ""camp"" may just seem like the whole area to some people.

* Broken agility shortcut. OP: http://redd.it/2y2pg6

* Broken monastery teleport. OP: http://redd.it/2y1yyq

* Edgeville furnace open to f2p when it shouldn't be. OP: http://redd.it/2y1ykm

**Unverified claims:** 

* Yew log burning on balcony in nardah not working

* The task to travel to gnome stronghold appeared to not work for me the first few times, I believe you have to ""click to continue"" on the text saying you've arrived rather than running off straight away. I'd say it's a bug for sure.

* ""You can get the mahogany plank task completed by making only 1 plank if you click ""make 20"" but only have the cash for one.""



**Suggestions/Points for discussion**

* Maybe make it so you don't need to get something again if you already have it, such as the upgraded iban staff. You couldn't do this with the d square task though as it would mean bypassing the smithing requirement. OP: http://redd.it/2y2r8f

* Zulrah as an elite not hard task? Personally I agree, if elites are 75+ in skills then you are saying people can do it with lower stats as it's a hard task. But trying to zulrah with under 75 stats would definitely be difficult, much harder than some elites we do have. (obviously it's not that difficult none of the tasks are really, but just looking at it relatively, I think it's an elite) OP: http://redd.it/2y3mnn

**Pro tips/things people (including me) got wrong:**

* When making blurite limbs you're making them north of fally at dorics, not the guy from the original quest

* When making mind helmet you need the battered book from the digsite centre (north east bookshelf), *not* the slashed book which you get the key from. If you only have the slashed book you will make a mind shield and have to repeat it again

* Anywhere it says ""wield/wear"" something, you need to put it on in the area, for example wildy cape needs to be put on in the wildy. If it's already on then you walk in it will *not* complete the task, take it off and put it back on. Not sure if I'd call this a bug, minor inconvenience though.

.

So yeah if you want a summer intern for QA stuff...

Please contribute

p.s. I can't finish tasks because you need prospector RIP (which was never mentioned even though void was??). I was first to 1 task off diary Cape lol."

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I know you've probably seen these posts about 230985230 times in your life, and so I apologize for another one. I don't know where else to go, and you guys **seem** nice enough to provide substantial help. 

Anyways -- a bit of back story is almost required, right?
I'm a ""veteran"" of league of legends--by that I mean I've been around since season 1--but looking at my lolking [profile](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/22964442) you wouldn't really think so. There was a spree in the last two seasons where I almost exclusively played 3v3 and let all my mechanics of 5v5 drop. Recently (I say recently meaning the end of season 4 I pushed rating) and got to Gold V playing almost Lucian exclusively, mostly due to him being a tad bit on the broken side and being able to get away with a lot. Anyways, start of this season I went 2-8 in promos. Win one, lost one, won one, lost the rest. I went on super tilt. I've been working on this recently, and I think I've gotten a tad bit better. I instantly mute all players at the sight of the first salty comment and turn on chill music that kinda eases me a bit. 

My friend had told me that Kayle was a bad champ, and so I was out to prove a point and tried to push to gold with her. I was doing well and climbed to Bronze I in about a week to a week a half. Then all of a sudden, I hit a spree of a few bad games and just didn't know what to do. I think I might of gotten cocky and thought I could outplay anyone else. Either way, I've essentially been on permatilt since then and I'm back down to Bronze II, close to demotion due to losing so much (I'm pretty sure my MMR is so f'd up). 

I'm not uninformed in the ways that I don't know what to do. I understand the mechanics of the game. I understand last hitting, I understand applying pressure. I understand trading (to an extent. Could always use more on this). What I don't understand is 

1. Positioning (In almost every lane)
2. When to take turrets.
3. Matchups
4. How to snowball a lead
5. How to either carry a game or get my team to work with me.

I'm thinking about taking a break, buying a Wii U and Smash to take my mind off things, but I really don't want to be stuck in Bronze. I'm a full time second-semester college student with an internship. I can't play League all the time like my friends. Everyone that I play with is considerably higher in rank than me, and while they say they think I don't belong here, I really don't believe them. I was in a Skype call with them today and they were on accounts where they intentionally threw their promos to play Bronze accounts because they think it's fun to smash people in. They consistently made comments on how bad Bronze players were. I just left the call and didn't say anything because I didn't want to be subjected to that. I'm surrounded by those that have succeeded in this game, and I'm just kinda left out. (These are close irl friends, not internet friends). 

I feel like quitting and not looking back would be the easiest way to deal with this, and I think it's kinda the ""cowards"" way out. ""Something worth having isn't going to come easily"" as the saying goes, but I'm just stuck.

Do you guys have some tips? I know it's hard to guide a player with any kind of recording to see where they stand during laning phase, mid and late game. I can try to get some footage if necessary, but I'm just... I feel like I'm stuck here forever.

TL;DR: I can't get out of bronze despite understanding the majority of the game.

Any and all help is welcome with open arms."

I have been the goto for all my friends for interview/internship advice because of all the things I have learned here.

I have recently accepted an offer from the Microsoft Office team for a SDE internship! So glad that the work has paid off. Without the constant resume reviews, interview advice, and internship advice I'm not sure if I would have gotten it.

2y419j,9,2015-03-06,My Experience,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2y419j/my_experience/,"I started smoking during my senior year of high school. I eventually developed a habit of smoking 3-4 times per week as I entered freshman year of college. These habits had no clear negative effects on me for quite a while. I was able to get a 3.5 GPA in a difficult freshman engineering program and got a nice internship for the summer. I initially felt some sort of superiority complex for being able to balance school and weed. The problem, I soon found, was that weed was not providing me with anything but a challenge. As the days of my freshman year dwindled down I began to realize how much marijuana had affected my social life. Throughout the year I found myself frequently deciding to stay in and smoke as opposed to going out and meeting new people mainly because it was more convenient. The marijuana intensified my social anxiety and I made excuses like ""it's better that I'm getting high rather than getting drunk"" but I was clearly not focusing on the real purpose of going out. College is so much about finding who you are and so much of finding who you are is exposing yourself to things you are uncomfortable with. Once I realized marijuana was not helping me push myself I stopped smoking. I stopped cold turkey about 5 months ago. This gave me confidence that things will always be better if you go into them with a positive mindset and a goal in mind other than just quitting. You are in control of your life. Make the most of it. "
2y46h0,26,2015-03-06,One year on: my birth story,merveilleuse_,beyondthebump,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/2y46h0/one_year_on_my_birth_story/,"When I was in Baby Bumps, I read everyone's birth stories with interest, and was determined to write my own, but once I had a baby, what I didn't have was time.  So today, as my baby turns one, (ONE!) I would love to share my birth story.

I had just started my maternity leave - technically I was still on annual leave, and my maternity leave didn't start for another week.  I had been on leave  since Monday, and it was Wednesday.  I was knitting my baby's coming home outfit, and watching some TV - she wasn't due for another two and a half weeks!  I had been wearing pads for about a month, just because of general discharge, but my pad started to feel really spongy.  I thought that maybe I was losing my mucus plug, and even posted about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1zl1nl/i_think_im_losing_my_mucus_plug_possibly_tmi/  I changed my pad, but in less than an hour, it was saturated again.  I wondered if maybe my water had broken, but you learn in antenatal classes that this almost never happens, typically you are in active labour for hours before you water breaks, and I wasn't having contractions.  And when you see it in the movies, it's a huge gush, and that wasn't happening.  I had been told not to go to the hospital unless contractions were at least one minute long every 10 minutes for at least an hour, but since I had group-B strep, and would be put on antibiotics when my water broke, I called the midwives at the hospital to check.  They told me to come in and check.

I called my husband, and told him I was heading into the hospital, but that he should not meet me there, as I wasn't in active labour, but that he should maybe come home, have some dinner and get ready to come to the hospital.  Once I went in, a midwife confirmed that my water had broken, and placed an IV to give me my antibiotics while it was decided if I would be admitted or not.  Since I still wasn't having contractions, it was possible that I would be sent home once I had the antibiotics.  While the discussion was taking place, my contractions started - very mildly, still hardly there, and an inspection showed that I was beginning to dilate, at about 1 cm.  I was admitted, and lead to a birthing suite.

At first, I was in denial that I was going to have the baby.  I said to  the midwife, ""I have a kilo and a half of mince in my fridge that I'm supposed to make into meatballs.  I haven't finished my baby's coming home outfit.  Lots of babies have worn things I have knit when they come home from the hospital, and mine won't."" and then I burst into tears.  She gave me a hug, and told me that my baby wouldn't care.

A couple of hours after I was admitted, the contractions started in earnest.  I called my husband, and told him to get to the hospital right away.  Soon after he arrived, I went into the birthing pool and enjoyed the warm water for a while.  When the contractions got stronger, I wanted to move, and got out and started walking around a bit.  A while later, each contraction sent pains shooting down my legs, causing them to buckle, and me nearly collapse.  I had gone into the whole thing knowing that I wanted to make it as far as possible without an epidural, but didn't have a problem if I decided that I wanted one.  I decided to go for the epidural.

The OB and anaesthetist came in, and gave me a run down about the  epidural.  I was warned that it might make my blood pressure drop, and an IV was started to counter that.  Once the epidural was in, my blood pressure plummeted, and during my next contraction, my baby's heart rate slowed.  the midwife hit the panic button, and the OB, the OB intern, the anaesthetist, the charge midwife and two other midwives came racing in.  Someone started squeezing the IV bag, and the anaesthetist grabbed a spray that causes muscles to relax and stop the contraction immediately.  A second, large bore, IV was started, and everything returned to normal.  I slept on and off for the next few hours, waking to push my epidural.  When I was about 8 cm, my labour started to stall, and the midwife suggested I start on Pictocin to increase my contractions.  I agreed, and that was added to my IV.  A few moments later, the panic button was pushed again, as my baby's heart rate was dropping really low (about 80 BPM) with each contraction, and barely recovering in between.  This time, nothing was helping to get it back up, and the OB suggested that we move to the theatre for a C-section.  Someone woke my husband, and got him gowned, and we headed for the operating theatre.

Since I already had an epidural, it was decided to top it up, and do the C-section that way, rather than giving me a general.  Once I was numb from the armpits down, the OB did a quick ultrasound, and saw that my baby had flipped over, and now had her spine along my spine.  He reached in, and manual turned her over, which allowed her heart rate to recover.  It was still dropping  during contractions, so the OB wanted to get her out quickly.  He checked me, and I was close enough to 10 cm that he suggested a forceps assisted delivery.  He told me I had four pushes to get the baby out.  I couldn't feel the contractions, due to the topped up epidural,  so the midwife told me when to push.  I pushed through two contractions, then threw up through the third.  With the fourth contraction, I delivered my baby.

She was whisked away, and I couldn't see her.  I turned to the anaesthetist's assistant next to me, and asked, ""Why isn't she crying?""  I was told that it sometimes takes a while for babies to cry.  My husband later told me that she was blue on delivery, and not breathing.  She was quickly resuscitated, and started to cry.  She was handed to my husband who brought her over to me.  I couldn't hold her, as the epidural was making me shake, but he held her to me.  

When I was later given my discharge notes, it was written that the cord had been wrapped around her neck tightly.  She had spent the whole pregnancy with her spine facing out, and when she twisted around, the cord got tangled.  This is why her heart rate was dropping with each contraction.

One year out, she is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me."
2y49u4,5,2015-03-06,Asterisk hacked behind a closed firewall... How?,injustice93,Asterisk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asterisk/comments/2y49u4/asterisk_hacked_behind_a_closed_firewall_how/,"First, allow me to give a bit of context. I am not too experienced at Asterisk, but I know how to set up a box with FreePBX and how to troubleshoot common problems. I set up boxes for rather small offices in my spare time (I have a full time sysadmin job) for a company where I did my internship.

So, I have prepped a ""pre-made image"" which I could re-use with ease, so that I wouldn't have too much work with every new client. I based myself off off the most recent PBX In A Flash image (CentOS 6), because it has a good bunch of security stuff built-in (pre-configured firewall, pre-configured fail2ban, etc...).

Now, two weeks ago I've set up a PBX at a new client. Everything was working as it was supposed to. Client had no remote extensions, so the router firewall was as tight as it could be (except for a port range of 30 ports, for RTP streams). Last week, they got hacked. Hundreds of attempted calls to foreign country on our VoIP account. I contacted our provider, they could tell us every call came from the clients IP. The client ONLY has the RTP ports opened up in his router. The box isn't update with the latest updates and security patches because that generally breaks PBX In A Flash, but I can't imagine why that would matter when no service on the PBX is facing WAN. 

How could hackers possibly hack my box? I'm clueless, I hope I'm missing something really obvious, but I don't know what. Please, help me out. Thanks!

I wanted to share with you the story about how I managed to get a real job as a photojournalist for a paper. I know there is a lot of doomsayers out there that want us to believe that the print industry is dead. I disagree - but I'll admit that it is changing at a blisteringly fast pace, and nobody knows where it will stop.

I operated a DJ service as a side job while in high school. I loved music, and the pay was fantastic. I didn't really think I needed to go to college because I was doing so well for myself, but my father practically threatened to disown me if I refused to go (first world probs, I know) so I went to a four-year private university. 

I was not interested at all in photography at the time, but I figured that Broadcasting Journalism was close enough to DJing because of the focus on radio work. I was trained in radio, video, and stills work. I was an anchorman for a few years with the schools TV station, and was a announcer for several FM radio stations in the area. I have an exceptionally low voice, and so I found easy money to be made in recording voice-overs for commercials. 

I say all of this to show you that I've always been a hustler of a businessman. You can be one of the best photogs of the century, but if you are not a ruthless business operator, you will starve. I took photo 101 and did reasonably well, nothing inspiring at all, but I really enjoyed the work. It was an excellent excuse to interact with people who would usually never talk to me, and visa versa. It also helped that editing photos takes 1% the time of video.

I took the advanced photo course and was instructed by a real working photojournalist. He pushed us to actually take our work seriously and to tell stories that matter. Half-way through the semester, he told the class that he had one opening for a journalism workshop in Haiti over spring break, and if we were interested, we'd have to commit in 24 hours. I knew I needed to go, but I didn't even have my own camera.

After class I sold my car and half my belongings on Craig's list totaling about $1,100. I dug into whatever savings I had and bought a Canon 5DII and a 50 1.8 - I had just enough cash left over to buy the plane ticket.

I spent a week with two photographers whom I hold the highest respect. I barely spoke the entire time, because I didn't want to miss anything. Sitting around a campfire, they would exchange stories of travel and people, I was hooked. That was the moment I knew that I'd do whatever it takes to become like them.

After the workshop, I used my new portfolio and secured an internship with a production house in South Africa that helps film Shark Week and other productions. That's a long story in itself, but the TL;DR is that it was expensive, fun, but mostly fruitless when it came to networking.

When I returned for my senior year, I became the head student photographer of the university and shot every assignment I could get my hands on. I almost failed all my classes because I had a camera to my eye 8 hours a day. I shot about 70k photos that school year. During that time, I worked with my old photog teacher and filmed a pilot episode for the discovery channel about some farmers and a crop duster. The show was turned down, but the experience working with agriculture proved to be key in securing the job I have now. 

I graduated eager to join the workforce. I browsed monster, careerbuilder, journalismjobs, and the NPPA job boards every day. I built a strong portfolio website, and had a very strong resume for someone my age. I expected it would take about two months to find my dream staffer job. I was wrong.

During my time in limbo, I worked as a freelancer for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, an organization that I really loved. They paid well, and were always open to story ideas. Half my work with them came from assignments I'd think up. I shot everything from a 5k to fundraiser banquets. No hard news, but I still enjoyed it.

Then, halfway through Summer, I got a call from one of the photogs I work with in Haiti. He invited me to come down and be the personal photographer for a very important politician in the country. I would be taking photos of world leaders, skipping years of climbing career ladders. Sadly, after I had sold all my belongings and packed everything down to two suitcases, the situation deteriorates, and eventually the politician resigns. I was crushed. From August to October I was stuck in an overwhelming depression - my once large ego was completely gone. My sister took me in at her home in KY, and I freelanced for the Louisville Courier-Journal for a while. They were a completely different ball game from Little Rock. They had 40 freelancers on staff, and I'd get one small assignment every three weeks or so. A couple months in, I had a typo in a name on my caption, and after chewing me out, they never called again. I remember the photo editor saying these words exactly - ""You have a good eye, kid, but this type of shitty work will end you.""

I had to get a job as a fry cook in a bar to pay the bills. I was so humiliated, but never defeated. I received a great gift from that bar - my sense of entitlement was completely gone. I realized that nobody was going to help me get out of this job. I had to fight a bloody fight to get my way into the business.

I began again with my job search. In the span of the next few months, I sent out 382 job applications, each with a specific, written from scratch, cover letter and my resume. Exactly two weeks after submission, I'd try to call and talk with the photo editor. 382 of these.

Out of those 382, I received four rejection letters and two call backs. The rest were silent. The first call back was from a paper in Havre, Montana. We chatted for a while, and I was so desperate, I'd move to the north pole for a job. The told me that we'd have an official interview the next day over the phone. They never called back.

The second caller was a kind man who told me about a little paper in SW Kansas. He seemed really interested, and I forced myself to put the last 381 negative responses past me and give it a go. We had two Skype interviews over the course of a few days, and at the end he said I'd have an official response by Christmas. At 10:58pm Christmas eve, he called and offered me the job. I never cry, but after I accepted and hung up. I cried. I let everyone know, and within two weeks, I drove 15 hours across the country to settle in the town of 30k where I am now. 

I love my job. The pay kinda sucks, and there is nothing fun to do around town, but even on the worst days, I am still making money taking photographs. I don't know the moral to this story, but just know that if you choose to pursue it, you gotta have great contacts in your network, and the stubborn will of a pissed-off wolverine. 

If you have any questions, or stories of your own you'd like to share, I'd love to hear them. I get night terrors, so I'm pretty much awake all the time anyway."

I've always been interested in IT, but just recently decided I'd love a career in QA testing. My area offers either a specific 9 month program for software testing or I can go for the AA in computer science. Im not sure which one would be more beneficial.


 I'd love to get hands on experience, it's the best way I learn, but thats a long shot for someone with no experience. Internships are out of the question as I'm not yet a student. For now I'm working on code academy learning javascript, ruby, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

Mostly I'm looking for some direction from people that are already in the business. Which schooling will be more beneficial? What can I do besides that to further myself a bit? What are the stepping stones for getting my foot in the door? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

2y4pd9,2,2015-03-06,My ENFP college/career story &amp; trying to figure it all out,thefinestsomething,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/2y4pd9/my_enfp_collegecareer_story_trying_to_figure_it/,"I posted a post here last night on a few general career questions for ENFPs. You can see it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/2y0652/career_questions_for_enfps/

The reason why I started that post instead of directly posting my own situation is because before I talked about my specific example, I wanted to know if my thought process really does root from my ENFP personality. I just came across the personality tests it while lurking on other subreddits and hope to find people who can at least understand where I'm coming from.

Here's my story: I'm 24 and just graduated pharmacy school from a 6-year, out of high school program. I've always been a kind of person that can't see myself interested in just one thing: I love the idea of combining ideas and topics together, and focusing on things using multidisciplinary or unconventional approaches. I have always loved biology (and some areas of chemistry) because they're very visual sciences and I'm a heavy visual learner. Prior to pharmacy school, I did incredibly well in human anatomy and physiology and actually enjoyed reading my textbook. But aside from my science and math interests, I write as a hobby and enjoy learning about people. From the music I listen to, to the people I meet, I love getting to know how people's work and how their passions are shaped from their experiences. I love knowing the why behind everything and the intrinsic meanings and implications behind them. I also love knowing about different cultures &amp; languages and am constantly curious of the world around us. My initial plan when entering college was to be a pre-med majoring in an ethnic studies or similar major while double majoring or minoring in neuroscience or some variant of human biology. After I didn't get into the schools of my choices, I had to shift gears and think about what I wanted to do in the school I decided to go to, which didn't offer a lot of what I was looking for and where I had made a serious consideration to transfer later on. Upon summer orientation, I found out that I was accepted to my school's pharmacy program: a very competitive and renowned major, which I didn't know much about as I was coming from out-of-state.

Instead of being excited, which I kept telling myself I should be, I was instead filled with a lot of anxiety. Everybody, from family to friends, kept reiterating what an excellent career choice this was and how I was so lucky to be in a professional program at such a young age. But the only thing I could think about was ""is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life?"" My biggest priorities for my college career at that time was not really being in a degree program where I was told I was ""guaranteed"" to make good money, but being at a school where I could meet friends who care about the issues I do, have a sense of creativity and could start initiatives with me. My idealistic thinking was the driving force of my passions and motivation at this age. 

I'm not dissing pharmacy here-it's an important career that serves as an extremely valuable asset on a healthcare team. But in the back of my mind, I didn't think it was for me. In retail pharmacy, you have to get comfortable with the idea that while you will make an awesome salary, you will be doing the same exact thing everyday: there isn't much to ""learn"" everyday, nor anything new to expect or anywhere to keep growing (and I know and completely respect people who value those certain qualities in a job and do it well). And while retail makes up most of the jobs, there are some hospital jobs that I was looking into, but essentially, there aren't that many options you have under specifically a ""pharmacist"" title. Others in my class were incredibly ecstatic about it as well and I felt like the only one with doubts and I had started to feel immense guilt in not seeing that I have a HUGE opportunity in front of me to get in a stable career with an incredible pay. Back and forth this dissonance plus guilt was eating me up. 

In addition to that, I was having a hard time becoming friends with people in my major, but in my second year, I was finally getting to know a few and they seemed pretty fun and laidback. Thinking long and hard, I decided that I should stay in the program: I was making friends who became a part of a study group with me, I was learning that pharmacy has an increasingly clinical role and knew that I had retail as a backup that I could either eventually get used to and be happy in it or do in between finding a new opportunity or going back to school.

My professional years instead served to paint a different picture: the friends I initially made, after coming into the program, were becoming increasingly cold, sometimes aggressive. In the years before, I did share notes and homework, but it was becoming more obvious that I was only a friend because I was empathetic and useable: plenty wouldn't show up to class &amp; would barely socialize otherwise. I was the go-to for notes and work.  Instead of being passionate, having conversation about ideas, etc. I would only see my friends compete with each other on who gets the highest test scores or put down people in other majors of having ""easy coursework"". And the lack of interest in learning concepts outside of ""pharmacy"" that deal with a general sensitivity towards people amazed me at how such people could be serious about being healthcare professionals. 

I'm sure all of this exists at some level in every college, every school, etc. But I felt that being in a professional program so early in our lives, there was an overhauling insinuation that the most important thing is that we will be professionals and that we're ""important"", not about how we work with our colleagues, will treat our patients or roles we serve on a more nuanced level. I started to get depressed with my social life and academic career that I started to see a therapist (I've always had depression and anxiety and it came and went, but it was the first time that I was losing my motivation and sense of purpose)

At this point, I tried to stop thinking about friends and become a little more 'selfish"" to zero in on keeping up academically and career-wise. In doing so, I was trying tirelessly to get an internship which many other kids in my class seemed to be getting easy. For some reason, even after doing more than what most kids in my class did to get an intern position, I was not able to find one. I did a little online research and found out that pharmacy was starting to become saturated (more students, less jobs) and in addition to this, many retail chains were cutting their tech/intern capacity (leaving more work for the pharmacist). On internet forums, I would see pharmacists bringing up that retail, what was once seen as ""easy"", was becoming so burdensome that they can't even get a lunch break or a bathroom break. 

With a lack of an internship, I spent my time in college doing a lot of leadership activities, other clinical opportunities that pharmacy students didn't typically do and a campus work study. This was the only thing keeping me sane until my last year, when I had rotations. It took me till my last year to really understand what pharmacy is about and what my niche is. Retail was a terrible experience for me, hospital was okay but my clinical pharmacy rotation was by far my favorite-but here's the catch, it wasn't the pharmacy part I liked: I enjoyed the medicine part that I initially wanted to do pre-med for. I loved learning what the doctors did, I took notes in morning conferences while the pharmacy student with me kept complaining it was pointless. I had suddenly become keen on attempting medical school, but with my lack of motivation during school and my depression, my GPA was definitely not cut for medicine. As graduation was approaching, my anxiety was getting worse: having a struggle simply finding a job during school and having the saturation become worse, I knew I would have a hard time finding a job post-graduation. And along with the difficulty in looking for a job, I wasn't even motivated to work as a pharmacist. I wanted to be a doctor. Or do something alternative healthcare. I even started looking into nursing, PA or biomed engineering. But I knew I needed a first job. I applied to 60-70 jobs: hospital (my first priority), clinical, retail. I have heard back from NONE of these places, even in places where I have direct connections. I was becoming so frustrated, that for the sake of my mental health my family told me to take a break. I felt unhappy not only because of my difficulty finding a job and my uncertainty in pharmacy, but also because of friends who used me throughout pharmacy school and treated me like a resource instead of a human being, as well as disappointment from a  professor-who I worked with earlier last year who gave me awesome feedback throughout my time with him but refused to write me a letter of rec for a program, saying I did ""nothing worthy to deserve one"". Everything just coupled together and put me in the most under-motivated and dispassionate state of mind I have ever been in my life.

Currently, I am doing better. I am handling my anxiety and depression a little (although, could do a lot) better. But I am struggling to find the lost motivation. I am still applying to as many jobs within pharmacy as I can find but am shifting to look at non-pharmacist positions as well. I'm keeping my mind open for grad school, but I'm looking for work first. Graduating has been so confusing, and even though some days I'm excited about looking at different jobs and opportunities, other days I'm overwhelmed with an anxiety wondering what the heck I'm doing with my life. 

After all this, I have no regrets going to pharmacy school: I had a good game plan going in and it was out of my hands the job market changed while I was in school. And even despite my bad experiences, I did learn a lot and made the most of my opportunities. But I wish I was a little more confident in my ""idealism"" as an ENFP. I think I started to feel that my idealism is impractical when starting school, that I convinced myself my more realistic peers who only focused on being pharmacists and the salary and nothing else were doing the right thing and I was wrong. I am currently trying to come to terms with myself that it's OK to take a different route, even if people think you're crazy for trying out something that makes less money or taking huger risks. I'm not sure if I've fully convinced myself, but I guess all I can do right now is try it out"
2y51zc,2,2015-03-06,Me [24M] having a really hard time getting over break up with gf of 3.5 years [23F]...planned on marrying her.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2y51zc/me_24m_having_a_really_hard_time_getting_over/,"Hey guys, created a throwaway just in case. I don't know what is wrong with me or how to get over this. I dated this girl for about 3.5 years. We were crazy about each other at first, as most couples are, and then fell into ""comfort."" She always discussed marriage with me and talked about our future. About 2 months ago I said something jokingly along the lines of ""well my kids won't do that"" and she corrected me saying ""yes OUR kids will."" Back in December, she started crying saying she hopes I don't stop loving her because we won't have much time to see each other. I go to grad school about an hour away (take the train in). She is currently doing an internship and works a side job on the weekends. We saw each other maybe once or twice a week, but there would be some weeks we didn't get to see each other. We would text everyday. One of my flaws she pointed out is that I rarely called her, but I was usually studying. Granted I could have made more of an effort. I assured her that nothing would change and that I love being with her. 


About 3 weeks ago my gf texted me breaking up with me. The reason she gave me was that she just felt different about me, she wants to focus on herself, and she doesn't know if we can ""fix"" our relationship. I was pretty angry and didn't talk to her for two days. After that, I contacted her to make sure this is what she wanted. She was pretty cold and said yes. I asked if there was someone else and she said no. Nothing on social media indicated that there was. She was constantly posting statuses about being independent, not relying on guys, and that she was going to the gym to ""focus on herself."" So a week after the break up, I called her and let her know how I felt. I told her I wanted to fix it and I know there is more we can BOTH do. She came off really cold again and said she is sorry but she just feels different. She loves me, but she doesn't think she is ""in love"" with me. 


I go no contact for a week. It's been about two weeks after the break up and I message her again to tell her how I feel and that I wasn't the perfect boyfriend, but we both have stuff we can work on. Once again she says she doesn't think us being together and forcing it will change her feelings. 


Now most of her friends are single and shes an extrovert. I would say I am an introvert. She likes the EDM/club scene and I can't stand it. Somehow we made this work though. After I sent her the last message, that night she went out with her friends and posted some pictures on instagram. This really bothered me because I was miserable about the breakup while she was out loving life. I deleted her from all social media the next day, sent her one last message saying i dont hate you, i have to delete you because I want to get over you, I get your feelings changed, I tried all I could and nothing worked so I am moving on. She messaged back saying she is having a hard time getting over me, that she loves me, cares about me, but she just doesn't want to force something because she's not sure if the feelings are there. I said I get it, good luck, if you need to talk about anything you can message me. She told me the same and i could talk to her about anything (even if its about a new girl...yes this fucking hurt). 


I feel sort of lost now. Confused. I don't really fully comprehend the break up. She was pretty depressed about some family issue, but there was nothing either of us could do to change that. For starters, her parents weren't even aware that I existed (cultural/religious differences). Personally, I'm not religious so her background did not matter to me, and to her mine did not matter either. I feel as if she might have been unhappy/stressed in life in general with the internship, family, and maybe our relationship kind of ""stalling"" because we were both so busy. She couldn't fix the other two so the only thing she could change was me. Maybe I am just thinking this to make myself feel better, idk. I wanted to propose to this girl in the next year or two and I told her that during one of my outreaches to her (probably a mistake...but she ALWAYS talked about us getting married). I know no contact was the way to go but I just felt so lost.


Its been about 4-5 days since we last spoke and I don't plan on reaching out to her anymore. I figure if she misses me, she will message me. So far in the 2-3 weeks we have been broken up she has no reached out to me first once. She loves social media and posted a status about a week and a half after we broke up talking about how guys should ""show off"" their girlfriends (assuming by posting them on fb because all of her guy friends do this with their gfs...none of my friends do this). She has a lot of guy friends so I am assuming she is talking to them to keep herself busy from texting me. The thought of her with someone else is absolutely killing me. I don't even know if she is with someone, or has been, idk but I can't get it out of my mind. I was her first real relationship, first guy she slept with, etc. 


I wasn't the world's best boyfriend. I became really focused on school and I always told her I'm sorry but I just want a good future for us so we can be comfortable and not worry about financial issues like our parents did. She was pretty understanding about this at first, but it seems like it changed. We rarely ever fought honestly and I never really had an issue with things she did. Her best girl friends are single and love to go out. My best guy friends are all in serious relationships and work most of the time. I have been having trouble focusing in school. I miss the girl. I have had good moments where I will be okay without her, but sometimes it hits me really, really hard where my mind just races (like right now...). I have been working out for about 8 years now so that's not a hobby i can pick up.. 


I try to hang out with friends, but my mind just reverts back to her. I wake up at about 3am randomly and check my phone hoping she contacted me. I know she's not coming back, yet I still hold hope. She was somewhat distant once the family issue started, but I didn't think it had to do with me. We went out on Valentines day and had a nice time. We talked about school and work and other things. She told me she loved me the night before she broke it off with me. I just feel lost, confused, and lost all confidence. 


4 of my best friends all had a very similar break up. The girl wasn't happy, broke up with them, and after a few weeks she came back and they are all still together. However, I don't think my luck will turn like this. The line about telling her about other girls just killed me and made me realize that yes it is probably over. Our sex life was always good and never slowed down so I know she still saw me sexually and not just as a friend. However, I don't know what to really do. All my friends told me they just kind of broke off contact and eventually the girls just missed them and came back. Their girlfriends were less extroverted than mine though. She has a good amount of friends and enough attention from random guys that she probably will be okay. I know she won't be back, and yet...I still hold hope. Like an idiot...


Side Note: I've been listening to a lot of Bill Burr MMPodcast to make myself feel better and weirdly enough this has helped lol. 

   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 3.5 years breaks up with me. I feel lost, confused, and lost all confidence. How do I get over the thoughts of her being with someone else from driving me crazy? How do I stop being so down about it and clear my mind? How do I trust girls again...I got cheated on in my first long term relationship, and now this girl (who took me a while to let fully in) just left me out of the blue. I feel like I won't find a nice girl who I can trust. "

Sales and helping people solve problems have been my interests since I began my career.  I have a solution-oriented mindset that drives me to find ways to run systems more efficiently and to help find ways to simplify tasks.  My joy in sales comes from finding the right people for the right product and helping someone make their life worry free.  
As a candidate, the following is what I will immediately bring to the table.

An effective sales leader: In my current role I consistently push our sales team to exceed sales goals and be ranked among the best in the Northeast. I achieved this goal by putting together weekly sales competitions, developing employee word-paths, and bringing a positive energy everyday to work. I was also able to showcase my sales abilities in my previous role by being a leader in overall sales and fleet growth.

A disciplined customer service guru: I have always displayed a careful approach to driving customer satisfaction by putting myself in my customer’s shoes. In all three of my previous roles I frequently lead a team to receive excellent customer satisfaction ratings. In addition, I had the opportunity to lead a team that earned the best-rated customer service on the globe, which further shows my dedication to ascertaining complete satisfaction.

A passionate problem solver: My roles in my pervious internships and career positions have all been driven by my keen interest in helping systems run smoothly and helping people solve problems. Even as a college athlete, I made sure to dedicate part of my day reflecting on how I can make the team better. It is this passion that has driven all of my career decisions thus far.

**Background**

My name is Michael, or 'Mike'. I’ve been a gamer since I was in 5th grade. I played competitively on SOCOM I &amp; II, and on Rainbow Six. I love gaming and sharing my experiences with others. I enjoy helping others with certain tasks, especially on Destiny...in raids and strikes. I am 22 now, working and trying to finish up college.

About my stream -- I started streaming last year around January or February. I was up to almost 2,000 followers by the beginning of May. In May, I had to stop streaming for several months due to an internship and other schooling stuff. It killed me because I love streaming. I am back now for good, and trying to get off the ground once again. My stream has a fun atmosphere, we play some awesome music, and we have a great time!

2y5ago,1,2015-03-06,"I had to leave, it was clear I had no choice",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2y5ago/i_had_to_leave_it_was_clear_i_had_no_choice/,"I've been keeping this to myself for the past few months. I haven't been able to find the words until now, I suppose. I've just kept masking my feelings by distracting myself. It's becoming clear to me that I need to just let all of these feelings go so I can stop thinking about them and move on. 

I was very happy working for my company. I had gone back to school, pulled a 3.8 GPA and out of my internship received a job offer. Many pats on the back. Before I had felt like a failure and I was becoming more successful than I had imagined. I thought to myself that this was it. This was what I was meant to do. My job was my escape. I had good friends and a small community of coworkers who are good people. Then I don't know what the fuck happened. 

My boss started yelling at people and acting out in very unprofessional ways. She blamed her actions on the stress of her very important, very secret project. I always thought that it was just a cop-out excuse and didn't explain the whole story. My peer and a superior were trouble-shooting an actual work/client-related problem and just so happened to name off our boss who came around the corner and immediately got pissed off and yelled, ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT TO MY FACE"". Highly unprofessional amongst other things. 

Then I sank in my rankings. I have 2 other peers with the same education and title as me and yet I started getting treated as the lower one. My boss would not talk to me directly and treated me with less respect. After my review (which was 2-3 months late), I had a situation escalate and went to HR so that I could talk about some other things with my boss and an HR person. We sent her e-mails to no response and I found out later that she had gone snooping for information from one of peers and told them what happened at my review and was acting confused and aloof as to what I wanted. I definitely feel like she should've just come to me directly. 

Halfway through my employment there, we hired another superior that I would be tending to, like an assistant. I had worked with the other current superiors so I was confident in my abilities and had done things the same as I previously had. But this new superior that they hired was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Nothing I did was right, she would come to work and just act like she didn't want to be there, and yell and berate me in front of everyone. Constantly. Then my boss approached me and told me that my superior was going to her fairly frequently and just complaining about me. What I gathered was that my superior, who was hired after me, who was the third person that I had assisted, didn't think I knew how to do my job and didn't think I was qualified. She basically didn't think I belonged there, which isn't part of her job to determine that. None of the others complained about me, and I am 100% sure that is the case. 

I was approached by one of the other superiors I had assisted who talked to me a little about what she was seeing and the nuance of the conversation was that she felt sorry for me and didn't like this new superior. I had already defended myself to my boss but in the end everything my superior said was what my boss sided with. 

And so my resolve started to weaken. I sought counseling. I was in a very bad spot mentally. With counseling I started to pull through.  I had just gotten frustrated with my superior and decided to talk to her to set some things straight. And, in the end we worked together to make it work. Another accomplishment, I guess.

But my boss never treated me the same way again. I was always treated, for lack of a better word, like the ""retard"" compared to my peers. In fact, I was told that I needed to ""be more aware of others needs"" and to ""push and challenge"" myself. Bitch, like I haven't? How unattached is she to what's going on? If she's implying that I make things too easy on myself, by what stretch of the imagination is problem solving with my superior easy? 

It devolved into nitpicking me after that. I'm a bigger lady, I will admit that. I've been working on it. I've hired a personal trainer and changed my eating habits. So, for casual Friday, I put on some of my comfortable pants, as others in the office are known to do, and my boss called me back to chat with her and HR and basically told me that what I was wearing was inappropriate. I pointed out that others were wearing similar things but they never got talked to. I had a very strong, sneaking suspicion that I just got fat-shamed. In fact, for weeks after that other people in the office wore similar, same-brand clothing. 

It seems stupid looking back but I was tired of Hard-to Pleasy my superior and my disrespectful boss and HR wasn't looking to good so I put in my two weeks. They all acted surprised. And, my boss acted like she was going to cry. They all said their goodbyes. I must've built a good rapport with my superior because she got me flowers and a gift. I almost had a ""WTF am I doing!?"" moment. 

But it's for the best. I feel like I cracked. I had begun hating the place that I had loved. It was time. "
2y5c2h,95,2015-03-06,You guys suck at peddling arguments,strike_watcher,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/2y5c2h/you_guys_suck_at_peddling_arguments/,"Grad students, let's start with some tough love, [you guys suck at this whole media thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZKw-b4k_L4). Stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/2xr37b/why_im_on_strike/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/2xmcnu/a_clarification_on_what_graduate_school_actually/) work fine on some people, but how are you going translate this to twitter speak? There's a reason the front page of reddit is littered with crappy memes and sensational headlines. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ A NOVEL. This is a political campaign, treat it as such.

The university has distilled its message to this: ""Graduate students are entitled gen x-ers who want full time pay for part time work even though they're full time students who already get $40/hr. They're holding undergrads hostage even though the school already offered them a pay raise, what a bunch of selfish whiners."" You need an equally compelling (and short) message to counter this, not a 10 page defense based on misleading numbers and half-truths.


&amp;nbsp;


Biggest problems I see right now:

* **Your messages are too long** , people don't want nuance, they want snappy one liners like ""grad students are students, not full time workers"" or ""you're hurting the undergrads""
* **Your messages are not polished**, all grad students should have a 30 second elevator pitch and the *same* talking points about the strike, and it should hammer home the same theme every time. The poverty line argument is a good start, follow up strong
* **You don't have a human face**, gay rights activists learned this in the states, you need to make the debate more human (not %students live on $15,000, but meet so-and-so who came to Toronto and only has $15,000 and now her life sucks)
* **You need to make your arguments digestable**, nobody knows what graduate students do or what research is, make a simple analogy like apprenticeship or internship to explain to the average joe why you're not a student and should be paid. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/2xslcc/educate_me_please_on_the_ta_strike/cp351f6) is a good start
* **You let U of T dictate the debate**, then you get bogged down on the defensive, it's always ""U of T said this, but this is the truth"". Don't let that happened, you think Rob Ford spends all his time defending himself? Stick to *your* message


&amp;nbsp;


The union need to address the following in **1-3 sentences** each and make sure you're all are on the same page:

* What the hell do you guys want exactly? (e.g. peg the stipend to inflation is an easy sell, we want $8000 per person is not)
* Why does the poverty line apply? You're working part time.
* I thought the school already offered you a raise? Why are you still complaining?
* You should pay for an education and degree, not get paid to go to school
* If you can't pay for it, don't go to grad school, get another part time job like undergrads, or take out a loan like law or med students
* You're selfishly holding undergrads hostage! Why don't you strike on research instead?
* Your pickets are ruining my day
* People are scabbing, you guys will crack any time now


You guys seriously need some PR consultants, 5000 people saying different things is not conducive to an effective campaign. Good luck guys, I'm rooting for you."
2y5e8i,0,2015-03-06,Loving life,tloztoot,gamegrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/2y5e8i/loving_life/,"So as the title suggests, I have been loving life and everything that it has been throwing at me recently. Now I wouldn't say that I was in a difficult situation or that I was depressed, but there was a point in my life a couple years back where I was pretty down on myself and it felt like I wasn't setting the bar high enough. I had just graduated college with a degree that I felt wasn't really deserved and I didn't really have any leads on any jobs that I wanted. It took a lot for me to put a smile on when I thought about where I was going in life and how I just spent thousands of dollars at a pretty decent uni just to end up where I was. Like I said, I wasn't depressed or miserable, but I was in a place that sure felt close to it. I had alienated myself from a lot of my friends and felt a shit ton of pressure to go out in the world and start making a living. This went on for about a year before I realized that I needed to start doing something about it. This was also the time that I started watching GG, not religiously or anything, but an episode or two here and there. I couldn't tell you exactly what/why I did this, but (long story short) I went back to school and started taking CS classes. It has been super difficult and aggravating at times, so much so that I thought about quitting, but this is where the grumps come into play. I'm sure that most of you here know what I'm talking about when I say that there's just something about listening to them go back and forth, whether talking about games or life in general, that puts my mind at ease. If I get stressed about something I just put on an episode and it relaxes me enough that I can tackle whatever it was that was stressing me. 
I just got an internship and know more now than I ever thought I would a few years back, and although it's been a long road, I am very grateful for everything in my life, good and bad. I owe a thank you to you lovelies and to the grumps. You guys are awesome! 
Thanks for listening :)"
2y5g5i,0,2015-03-06,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2y5g5i/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I've always dreamed of living and working in the USA right after my studies.

I was looking at some websites online. It seems like to get a visa I have to apply through some kind of an organization?

Can't I simply find a company hiring interns and apply as any other candidate? These organizations that list internships exclusively for foreigners have a tax on every little thing including processing my application, which would be avoided.

Also, to anyone that has had experience getting an internship from abroad, I would love some advice."
2y5nu6,5,2015-03-06,Help picking between three internship offers...?,internthrowawaythrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y5nu6/help_picking_between_three_internship_offers/,"Hi. Looking for advice picking an offer between three companies. This is going to be my first internship (I'm a sophomore) so I'm actually not really sure what criteria I should be looking for.

1) Local corporate branch of massive bank. I'd be one of only a few interns there. Very unclear what work I'd actually be doing, but they promised me very individualized mentoring and it's close to home. Friend worked here last summer and said it was a little dry and the projects weren't very exciting. Pay is also a little lower than the other two. 

Edit: Forgot to mention why I'm even considering this one. They said that I'd be basically guaranteed an internship there every summer until I graduate, with a likely job offer at the end. Because I'm not looking to relocate immediately after graduation, I would be more likely to work here after graduation than the other two.

2) Huge tech company primarily known for hardware but trying to expand their software focus lately. Recruiter and interviewer assured me that I would be coding and in a technical role, but they don't have any of their projects planned out yet and can't tell anything about what I'd be doing. Huge internship program with a lot of fun opportunities, very structured, household tech name. Unfortunately the uncertainty means that I could be doing anything from software development to more general IT work where I barely lay down any code. The plans won't be finalized until well after the deadlines for acceptance. Recruitment process was also easy to the point where it seems like a red flag. Awesome location and housing provided.

3) Huge financial/insurance institution. Would definitely be doing software development. Long recruitment process, company flew us out and wined and dined us. Definitely care about interns. Very large intern class as well. Company has awesome work culture and is consistently cited as one of the best workplaces in America. However, name recognition is much lower than the other companies (average person would probably perceive it as less prestigious), and the location is far less preferable than the other two. Housing is provided.

Thank you!"

I mean I didn't really want to do engineering; I wanted to go few take classes and see where I fit in and decide on a major but my parents pressured me into getting into engineering same stuff like ""you're meant to be engineering"", ""you're good at math, go for engineering"", ""engineering gives good pay, go for it""...etc. I couldn't really take it anymore and I asked my dad if I could change my major two years ago and he angrily said ""why are you trying to change your all of sudden"" and I ended up sticking with engineering. Due to this, I had depression with no internship and currently only gpa of 2.4 (I even had to go see mental counselor).

I guess most of you will tell me to just graduate since I got less than a year left, but how am I suppose to get a job at this rate. All I've been doing these years is just keep having faith and telling myself ""just hold it in, it'll get better, keep it up"". Well, it's not working out at all.

I just have a question about some insecurities that are cropping up and how to deal with this as time goes on in my life.

I'm a 26 year old male who has been single for the past year.  I've been enjoying my time but the past few times I've started dating a woman these insecurities from the past start kicking in.

The biggest insecurity I have is that my last serious relationship (4+ years) ended primarily due to me having to move back in with my parents.  I was 24 at the time and had to go back to school for an internship with a company.  I'm currently 6 months in my new position making $30,000 / year with a good outlook for a raise soon.... but I'm still stuck at my parents place.  The girl at the time soon left me for someone else shortly after that, and gave the ""I don't know what to tell you, it's not you it's me, etc etc.."".  There is certain evidence that this wasn't the case that I discovered later and I believe it had more to do with finances.

So now that I'm on my way up, how do I stop fearing this kind of occurrence from happening?  I feel as if I'm less of a person due to the amount of money I'm currently making and though I do have plans to move soon I feel like my whole dating life is currently on hold until I become more financially stable.  Any advice on this?  I feel like I don't even want to enter the dating soon out of fear of being laughed at for how much money I make.  I don't have any other real issues affecting my confidence like this.

tl;dr : 26[M], How to deal with past insecurities of not making enough money currently / currently living with my parents."

2y69c1,9,2015-03-06,TIFU by using distilled vinegar to clean my desk at work and causing an evacuation and emergency response to show up,kalitarios,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2y69c1/tifu_by_using_distilled_vinegar_to_clean_my_desk/,"A good friend of mine showed me the power of distilled vinegar for cleaning.  It's eco-friendly, inexpensive and safe.

Today I decided to clean all surfaces of my desk and telephone, monitor stands and the front of my desk cabinets.  I work in a cube farm, but have a window seat as I'm in the corner against the wall.

The size of the room here is about 2000 square feet of open space, with a massive cube farm setup.  Mostly women from accounting (billing, finance, etc) and a few sales managers.

I finish my lunch, and proceed to clean it all off.  I bust out a cloth to wipe down the dust, and then a Magic Eraser and scrub the scuff marks off the desk and cabinet fronts.  I then took a spray bottle of white distilled vinegar and sprayed a new magic eraser with it and proceeded to re-scrub every surface.  Finally I used a damp towel to wipe the desk down.

Everything looked clean and smelled like a salad so I smiled and put the items back on my desk, one at a time, wiping them all off with the damp rag.  I proceed to continue working.

I work with headphones on, because we do a lot in Lync and remote desktop work, so I'm in contact with users.

Fast forward about an hour and I get an email from my boss asking why the hazmat trucj showed up on an emergency call.  He wanted me to call the main number back so I hit CTRL-P to print the email out and walked over to the printer.

As I got closer there was a bunch of people all upset, rubbing their eyes, someone was holding their head as if they had fallen down.  The facilities manager was standing there with one of the response members and a clipboard.

I pick up my document off the printer and joking ask ""Did someone break something?"" and got glares from basically everyone.

""There's something wrong, I need you to lock your computer and get your coat.  We have to evacuate.  In fact, everyone here stop what you're doing, lock your workstations and let's evacuate.""

Fast forward 15 minutes.  We're standing outside now, in 30 degree weather with people complaining, the HVAC guys and the hazmat truck belching diesel fumes into the air.

I didn't see my boss so I walked over to the facilities manager and asked again.

""Something spilled, we can't identify it, but people are complaining of headaches and someone said they were feeling dizzy and hit her head on the support column in the middle of the room.""

""What did it smell like?"" I asked, honestly curious as to what was going on.

""It smells like... I dunno, cleaners or processed food... almost like a big salad."" - a light bulb goes on in my head.

""Like vinegar?"" I asked him.

""Yeah, like vinegar. Why?""

""I used it like... an *hour* ago to wipe my desk down.  I don't like to use chemical cleaners on my equipment and desk.""

I immediately get eye rolls and groans.  The word traveled quickly around the 60-something pack of middle managers, accountants and interns.

""Well it gave me a fucking headache!"" this one woman said, as she stood there smoking and coughing.  ""You can't be using stuff like that in a workplace, I couldn't even breathe.  I had a headache and had to get out of there.""

Even more eyebrow raising was the woman who hit her coconut on the support column.  This is a 18 x 18"" brick column around a support beam in the center of the damn room.  It's in the corner of someones cube and not really in the way of the hallway.  Yet somehow she managed to get light headed and rang her own bell.

Fast forward 30 minutes later and I'm sitting in the facilities manager after everyone shuffled back in, holding the spray bottle of distilled vinegar while he looked up and logged the MSDS info for Heinz Distilled Vinegar.  He had this puss on his face like ""I don't need this shit.  I don't get paid enough.""  I scoffed.

""What?"" he asked.

""I chose to NOT use chemical cleaners because it's natural, eco-friendly and healthier than using aerosol and other cleaners.  All the stuff in the closet is bad for the environment.""

""Well we have 5 complaints and a workers comp claim from this now.  So you can't use it here anymore.""

I finally get back to my desk and there's a sticky note on my monitor with a smiley face on it.  As I log in, I have an email from my boss titled ""Not good""  Preview just showed ""This message has no content.""

TL;DR - A friend convinced me to switch from chemicals to distilled vinegar to clean my work desk. HVAC and hazmat show up and evacuate everyone for an unknown chemical spill/mechanical failure. Five complaints and one workers comp claim ensue, and I have to take the bottle home with me."
2y6dye,32,2015-03-06,"Oldschool Runescape QA Transcript for Reddit [Achievement Diaries, Prayer Renewals, In-game Clock and Horses] - 2/26/2015",rawktail,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/2y6dye/oldschool_runescape_qa_transcript_for_reddit/,"**Questions** | **Answers** |
---------|----------|
Can we have the ability to sell BH Emblems to the GE? | They will look into it, but it'll probably take a bit.
Which Achievement Diary was the hardest to make? | Western and Morytania. Trying to find things in Morytania was hard because the content is as old as 2002-2003 and three different people developed it with no organization. The Western Diaries were hard because of how messy the Ape Atoll, Pest Control, and so many other areas code's are.
Can we have the ability to Price Check all the items in our bank at once? | It's a big job, it'll take awhile, but they'll work on it.
Will Zeah have it's own diaries? | Yes.
Will any of the diaries become F2P accessible? | John C wanted to make Lumbridge/Draynor F2P, but because they first started designing them F2P wasn't a thing, it was too late to go back and redesign them. They'll work on something for F2P.
Will any of Zeah be F2P? | To be discussed. 
Can the skill outfits like prospector and Achievement Diary armors be merged together? | Varrock Elite armor functions as a prospector top, other than that, no achievement diary armor is better than skilling outfits, so you don't need to worry about them being replaced. Plus, you don't need to wear most of the armors to get the benefits.
What's the new Achievement Diary emote going to look like? | You'll hold out a diary, and on each of the corners of a diary you'll have a green, red, blue, and purple gem to represent the different difficulties of the diaries and to show that you've obtained them. It floats out and expands to the size of a table and a vortex appears with different aspects of the diaries that you've completed being sucked into the book until eventually it climaxes and get's so cluttered that the book snaps shut. After that, it reduces in size once again and drifts back into your hands.
Are any of the rewards up for change? | There's a thread open in Feedback/Suggestions that you can post on. 
Can you make the Fountain of Rune F2P? | Maybe.
Add other F2P worlds? | If they're needed we can add more F2P worlds. 
Australian servers? | Mat K is talking to some people next week about them.
Items kept on death based on GE value? | Will be polled. 
Add clan chat features like calenders for event reminders? | Reach would like to add a clan feature, this would probably be included. 
Can we see Mod Ronan opening up another 1000 Barrow Chests, but with 14 KC? | Sure.
Can you add more use to the Soul Rune? | New diary spells use soul runes. Maybe more on Zeah.
New Runes? | Probably not. 
In the GE if two people are buying the same item at the same price who gets the item? | Whoever offered first.
While you had previous designs for the Varrock Diary armors, but why did you choose black and purple? | Mod Ghost went into a thing about colors schemes. TL:DR It just works well together.
What do you think about burning down trees in farming patches to remove them? | Sure.
Is there anything we can do to manage the drastic drop in prices of resources since the GE came, such as iron ore? | There have been loads of items that people have kept around in their bank since the game began that they just never got around to selling. With the GE, people just dumped these huge quantities in. They aren't going to instantly react to these price changes, because they are expected. They will be watching prices over the next few months, and if something doesn't change, they can try to adjust things to recover prices. When GE first came out, even up to 6 months later prices were still all over the place. It's going to take awhile. Perhaps quicker because there's no trade restriction, but it's going to take time. It's only been a week, give it the time it needs.
Karamja gloves don't suit the new reward kits, can we get new ones? | Give feedback, it will probably be fixed.
Partyhat sets and Mask sets for GE? | They will come. God Page sets, too.
If you won the lottery, what's the first thing you'd buy? | Mod Mat K answered with Jagex. John C would waste it. Ghost and Reach would probably save it and spend the interest.
Where'd you come up with the design for the wilderness sword? | It's based off an Aztec weapon. It's more of a trophy weapon, which is why it was chosen for the diary reward.
When will we get dangerous clan wars? | Never.
Bounty Hunter/PVP timer to attack someone who steps into a safe zone? | Sure.
Will we ever get an in-game clock? | Sure.
Since the disconnections have subsided, can we see PK worlds reverted to UK worlds? | Sure.
Could we have all family quest gauntlets as a reward from diaries? | Sure.
Can we see the Onyx Ring (i)? | Wilderness rings do similar bonuses, probably not. John C would like to make it useful. They'll probably make the Onyx Ring remove the white dot on the map.
Can ultimate ironmen use protect item? | No. 
Destroy options on looting bag drop items in them instead of delete the items? | No. It could be abused. 
Is it possible to see our history of loots from old clue scrolls? | No it hasn't been kept track of.
Can an achievement diary reward increase the size of the looting bag? | It could, but there might be some technical issues.
Horses? | You can't ride them, but they can make them.
How did the ecumenical keys drop rate work with new diary reward? | 3, 4, and 5 have the same drop rates.
What's your opinion on spicy stew shakers being tradeable? | It's a quest item, not becoming tradeable. 
Can we have the ability to charge black masks? | The charge is useless. Why? 
Gilded to become F2P? | Take a stack of cash.
How did community feedback play into the design of the diary armor? | Not much, people generally liked it. 
Prayer renewals? | Sure, but there's been a fair bit of herblore content recently. 
Ectotokens tradeable? | No.
Why is there a bat on the Morytania legs? | It's the coat of arms.
Any updates on rooftop agility on the GE? | Soon.
Moving Varrock teleport to GE? | Will be polled.
New obsidian armors such as bows and arrows? | Sure. Sounds cool.
Bonus effect for full diary armor set? | What could it be? The gear is already highly useful.
Does the upgraded void look different from normal void? | It was void with a gold trim, it was updated today to look like elite void.
Did the oldschool team get larger with the F2P release? | Interviews for new QA intern will start next week! Mod Mat K has been talking to Mod Pip regarding new members if they're needed.
What's required to be a new QA? | You have to live in Europe and know Oldschool. Other than that, there's nothing much really. ""We hired John C, so anyone can get in really."" -Mod Mat K    Lel
Instance to Kraken? | Tweet Mod Ronan what the price should be.

2y6hxr,1,2015-03-06,Have you ever been accepted into an internship/REU/job when your application was put in 6 weeks earlier?,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2y6hxr/have_you_ever_been_accepted_into_an/,"I'm a CS/math major at Georgia Tech. I applied to [this REU in robotics at CMU](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri_static_content.html?menu_id=464) at the end of January. I applied to several other (9) internships for this summer, and a few (2) of them extended acceptances within a couple weeks of my application submission, or have requested a phone interview from me. 

CMU, on the other hand, has not. They mentioned in the application that ""offers would be extended in the middle of March"". But I imagine that if I were seriously being considered, they would have set up a phone interview with me much, much earlier than that. Right now I feel like a ""backup"" candidate, in case one of their first choices doesn't accept the internship.

**My question is**: Have you ever been accepted to an internship/REU/job after 6 weeks (or longer), without hearing a peep from the employers in the meantime? Did you find out if you were a first choice?

CMU is my ideal grad school. It has (one of) the best CS programs in the world, and some of the greatest professors. My dream school (along with Berkeley). I'd even put off going to grad school for a year after I graduate while working in some internships if it improved by chances of going there.

My application to CMU looked really good.... I got a recommendation from one of the best roboticists in the country, and I've worked directly with CMU research software. So I'm confident, but at the same time confused as to why I haven't heard anything.

**TL;DR**: See bold above."

2y77xw,1,2015-03-06,Salary Negotiating... for an internship,oureyesmeet,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2y77xw/salary_negotiating_for_an_internship/,"Now, before I go any further and get responses like ""interns aren't supposed to be making money/nobody cares about interns"", I'm going to say that I have two offers on the table for software internships and that I go to one of the top schools in the country that most large companies want to hire interns from.

Basically, I have two offers from company A and company B. Company A is the company that I really would love to work for, based in NYC and a career that I want to be in after graduating. Company B would also probably not be a bad career choice per se, but its not quite what I want to be doing and doesn't have the reputation or pull that company A does, and it is located fairly close (like maybe a 30 min drive, 40 with traffic) to where I go to school.

Company B offered me more than Company A did, and I know with most internships the students just accept the offer that is given to them without trying to negotiate. 

However, I was looking at Glassdoor posts for company A and out of about 50 interns saying they didn't try to negotiate, there was one who said they made a counter offer and the company accepted it.

I have never in my life tried to negotiate an offer, I am terrified of doing so, and I really only want $1000-$1500 more than what I am offered from Company A (which is basically the difference in the two offers -- they are both hourly rates though, so to get in this range I would need an increase of about $2.5-$3 per hour)

I'm not sure what an appropriate way to go about requesting a higher salary, or how much is appropriate for an intern to request. Would it be bad to say straight-up ""I have an offer on the table from Company B for $35/hr, would you be willing to match or beat that?"" Or would that make it seem like I am more interested in Company B?

Basically I would love to work for Company A, but it would be a decent amount more expensive to live in NYC for the summer than to live in my sorority's house or a dorm on campus, so I wouldn't have much money left over at the end. Also, I *think* the wage offered is probably for a rising junior, and I am technically a semester ahead in my coursework (currently technically in my first semester of junior year), so would it be a good thing to bring this up or not?

Any and all advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!"

I just wanted to introduce my self. I was accepted to OSU earlier this week and I am super excited to start later this month! I think it is awesome that we have a subreddit for this program. I have decided to pace my self and start the 2 year track, this leaves me room to try to get an internship next summer.

I had a few questions I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on:

1. How do I go about talking to an advisor? I can't find any contact information on the website. I did the online orientation and it asked me to fill out form to be advised but that was on Tuesday and I still haven't heard anything back.
1.  I am HORRIBLE at math. I got a C in College Algebra when I did my first undergrad. I am really worried I am going to struggle through this program. Any advice?

Anyways I am sure I will think of more questions as time goes on but I just wanted to pop in and say hello!"

#/r/Island

**1,819** Íslendingar hér í **4 ár!**

[Bold and bleak](http://i.imgur.com/pa0AzSl.png), a [chilled yet verdant](http://i.imgur.com/R5DPFiF.jpg) volcanic crag. Iceland fits the bill, and then some! With [stunning chilled landscapes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grantlsack/15647524444/sizes/l), a [rugged, rocky skyline](https://www.flickr.com/photos/8597354@N08/16119837740/sizes/h/) and some of the [most interesting geological features in the world](http://farm6.staticflickr.com//5325//7054666595_56ed2dfd7c_b.jpg), it's little wonder that Iceland is one of the most infamously beautiful landscapes - and /r/Island is there to document this beautiful land.

So few cultures nowadays remain untouched by the winds of time, and with an increasingly small world, it has been much harder to preserve local tradition. However, the people and culture in Iceland seem quaint to the outsider, a foreign glimpse into a land lost in time; just the other week, the main pagan religion in Iceland, following the pantheon of gods oft described in old Norse mythology, [began work on a dedicated temple](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-31065555) in the capital, Reykjavik. However, this is not to say that Iceland is out of touch - all the modern comforts are there, they are just complemented with the idiosyncratic culture of Iceland.

If you're more of a tropical resort person, and still aren't convinced, let the mods convince you!

&gt;#**1 - Tell us a little about yourself.**

&gt;&gt;**/u/unknown_name:** I am /u/unknown_name and i really enjoy photography. I should really upload more photos to my [500px](http://500px.com/kdstew3). I've never been outside of the USA save for a cruise to the Bahamas (still counts). I would love to travel to Iceland in addition to several other places.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TunicSongForKaren:** I am /u/TunicSongForKaren , one of the network moderators of the /r/NationalPhotoSubs network. When I am not shitposting dank memes, I post pics in /r/Island of places with names that sound like someone mashed his head into a typewriter.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT:** I'm a guy who likes photography and traveling! Never been to Iceland but I would love to go some day.

&gt;#**2 - How did you come to be a moderator of this sub?**

&gt;&gt;**/u/unknown_name:** If my memory serves me correctly /u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT added me after we spoke of our big aspirations regarding photo subreddits (and the fact that Iceland is straight up beautiful. It was actually my first NPS sub. I was added to /r/Schweiz shortly later and the rest is history as they say.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TunicSongForKaren:** Correctly pronouncing Eyjafjallajökull and eating a pound of rotten shark.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT:** /r/Island was the second of the /r/NationalPhotoSubs to be founded, at the time it was just a handful of us with the idea to make a group of subreddits to showcase how beautiful some countries were. We started off with /r/Schweiz and branched off to /r/Island when /u/TheLostCrusader suggested making a sub for Iceland. /r/Island was sitting unused and neglected as a subreddit once intended for islands, so we got a hold of it (Ísland is Icelandic for Iceland).

&gt;#**3 - What's your favourite thing about Iceland?**

&gt;&gt;**/u/unknown_name:** My favorite thing about Iceland is the landscape. It is the most beautiful scenery of maybe any country out there, IMO. Just check out [some of these top photos on 500px](https://500px.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;q=Iceland&amp;amp;type=photos&amp;amp;category=&amp;amp;order=rating&amp;amp;license_type=-1). I hope to one day take super cool pictures like this. All I have is trees.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TunicSongForKaren:** Sigur Rós.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT:** The ice! No but seriously, the photos of [ice caves](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/15197733061_caa4d0b5ff_o.jpg) and [glacial lagoons](http://farm4.staticflickr.com//3912//14489367776_21a0a5dc64_k.jpg) are stunning. Reykjavík is also pretty.

&gt;#**4 - What kind of content do you want on this subreddit?**

&gt;&gt;**/u/unknown_name:** I love the landscape but I definitely enjoy seeing other photos. Photos of people, places, and the like. And it makes it even better when subscribers are the ones submitting their original content. That is my (our) main goal for the whole network really: promoting OC.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TunicSongForKaren:** I like it most when people find an unusual subject for a photograph, that differs from the usual photo spots in Iceland. I am talking about street scenes, church interiors, modern buildings, small moments showing the human condition, the fauna of Iceland.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT:** Above all, I think we want original content from people who've been there or are there, residents, tourists, etcetera. Sure, it's awesome to see pro photographer images posted from galleries like 500px.com, but the original content has a story, it has that human touch.

&gt;#**5 - Do you have a favourite post from the subreddit?**

&gt;&gt;**/u/unknown_name:** I think [this photo](https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/54529592/m=2048/187251fcd0d33965982efca91da195e1) is really cool for a non-landscape photo. It's from [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Island/comments/2setlu/incredible_sunset_reflections_on_the_harpa/) **side note:** 500px changed the urls so the ppcdn prefix on the photos causes them to go straight to download now. For a landscape photo I will say [this one.](https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/96090783/m=2048/d82d1fae180bde4595c60de0a32d9b48) from [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Island/comments/2sxhn7/haifoss_2048_x_1366_by_mohammed_alsultan/) Háifoss is a pretty amazing waterfall.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TunicSongForKaren:** [This one](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7542/15905095305_55fa9b4686_h.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT:** [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Island/comments/2tog6v/a_few_days_in_iceland_dec_2014_albumoc/) - there's a reason it's the top post. Beautiful pictures, OC, an album - it's the whole package.

&gt;#**6 - How does it feel to be subreddit of the day?**

&gt;&gt;**/u/unknown_name:** I feel like I have filled out a million of these now! It is a great feeling. Too bad it has to end at one week! Please check out [this sticky](http://www.reddit.com/r/NationalPhotoSubs/comments/2l0bbn/click_here_for_a_complete_list_of_national_photo/) from /r/NationalPhotoSubs and pick the countries that you love and subscribe. Even better, if you have photos please submit them to their subreddit. We'd love to have you there!

&gt;&gt;**/u/TunicSongForKaren:** Effervescent.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT:** It's feeling pretty awesome :D You guys have given our network a lot of love and attention this week, and we really appreciate that!

Thanks to the mods for this interview, and the SROTD staff for featuring the National Photo Subs! This is also my 6th post as an intern, meaning that I should be graduating onto ~~a higher plane of existence~~ full SROTD privileges, assuming I haven't missed something!"

You're gonna think this is petty but here goes:


I am 24. I am a smoker. It is my one vice since quitting drinking after years of alcoholism almost two years ago. I have no intentions of quitting at this point to be quite honest. My boyfriend is not a smoker. When we were introduced, I was honest from day one because I requested we get outdoor seating at the restaurant so I can smoke while at the table. I asked him if that was a problem and he said ""I don't care"" however since we have been together he has been hounding me about how disgusting it is and how I'm such an addict blah blah blah. I explained to him that I was upfront from the get go and cigarettes were around for over a decade when we met so why would he expect me to change. It may sound dumb but it's not the fact that he hates smoking its the fact that he is trying to change me. Well yesterday he showed up at my house all upset because he lives in an old piece of crap building and his upstairs neighbors' plumbing exploded blasting a hole in his ceiling and covering his possessions in human feces. When he showed up I was excited because I have had a horrible week and was attacked at work (I work as an officer in a juvenile correctional facility) and had to taze a kid which never makes me anything but sad and I just wanted to spend my 3 day weekend alone with my phone off relaxing etc. of course I let him in and without fail he complains my house smells like an ashtray and then freaked out when I lit up a cigarette in my house and told me to go outside (it's 20 degrees out no thanks I don't pay rent to stand outside) and when I went to go pick up pizza for us to have dinner he threw out a whole carton of cigarettes and told me it ""was for my own good""..its not really a small deal because cigarettes in NYC are almost $14 per pack or $135 a carton. He fell asleep and I went in his wallet got his credit card and walked to the bodega and bought a new carton.

I'm done. I have stayed with him this long because he is attractive and intelligent but he is whiny, queeney, controlling, embarrassingly desperate for attention (he tries to be the ""funny guy"" when we are out with friends and if he was 15 it would be cool but now its sad and humiliating for me) and we have no common interests at all. I'm an Italian American corrections officer who values hard work and tries to always be up front and true to my values and myself and he is a WASP from Marin County, Northern California who moved here and works as an unpaid intern while his parents pay for everything. I want him out of my house. I'm thinking of waking him up and telling him to go but that would be low of me so I think 2moro im gonna drop him off at a hotel and wipe my hands of it.


Am I overreacting?? I have a tendency to be too serious and intense so I don't wanna do something if it was not as big as
I felt it was.  "
2y87ll,1,2015-03-07,3/6/16,UnrelentingWobbuffet,MyDayMyThoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyDayMyThoughts/comments/2y87ll/3616/,"Hey friends, gonna keep today's update short and sweet. Woke up around 11, worked on my MIS project for a number of hours. Skipped my math class... Feel pretty bad about it because I didn't go to either class this week. I will ask Edward about it tomorrow. I can't fall behind in that class.

My executive summary got crapped on. 15/20? Really? I followed the instructions and apparently I was supposed to do something that wasn't even included on there. There might've been something to read in the textbook about it, but the professor never really ever mentioned that. Why am I a business major....

Been having a breakout of acne recently, probably a good deal of which is due to stress. Think my facial hygiene is decent; wash my face regularly, 1-2 showers each day, I try not to touch my face too much, etc. Guess I've just gotta chill out a little.

Looked at the weather, realized it was relatively warm (52° today). Decided to give the solo sweater another go. Think it's a good look. Wish my shoulders were a bit bigger, but that'll come with time. At the rate everything is going, I'll be swole and fashionable but unemployed. Eh, I guess I can rock the trophy husband lifestyle. Just kidding, I'd go fucking insane. Never been one to ride on the coattails of others, although a gift or two never hurts ;). After eating dinner at J2, I worked for a number of hours more. It seems it's become a tradition now that within an hour of eating at J2, friends ask if I want to get dinner. Maybe this is the way to summon them. Not bad, need to get bigger anyways. 151 pounds is bullshit. Went to Sushi Junai with them, saw Ben again. Taylor didn't get me my Jameson, not sure why. Considering getting a fake myself. They went to Sixth today, but I stayed home to finish up my project. I actually kinda wanted to have a drink or two tonight, but I guess I'll save that for tomorrow, or never. Not too fussed about it.

Turned in my assignment on time this time around, which is a nice change. Lisa didn't, kinda sucks. She's been busy as hell this week, case competition and shit. Tough life. Me, I just bum around, looking for friends to hang out with. Very chill lifestyle. Not one I'm entirely happy with, but there it is.

I've been considering picking up a watch next. Maybe a [Tayroc](http://www.tayroc.com/collections/mens/products/txm007)? Very clean look - I like clean. [Domeni Company](http://www.domenicompany.com/preorder/copy-of-signature-series-watch-preorder-price) is another one to keep an eye out for, although it's a bit pricier. I think I'll hold off on buying those though; I'm not too comfortable with spending parents' money, which is how it should be. Should never be too loose with your wallet or your mouth, yeah? Words of wisdom on a sober Friday night. Looking for an internship or some way to make money myself; although you could justify it by saying I already have about $45,000 bucks in my pocket, that money doesn't last forever. Point of having that is to make it grow. Other people made an investment in me, and I've gotta produce returns at some point.

Not much else to say. Can't really think of any terms in Investopedia that pique my interest. Asked for suggestions, got none as expected :(. Might put Investopedia terms on hiatus for a bit until I find some worthy words to learn. Always about expanding that vocabulary!

Anyways, friends, like I said, this update is relatively short. Not much to say, because I didn't actually do much. Gotta let go of a lot of anger inside. That doesn't do anybody any good. I'm going to go to the gym tomorrow. Back and bicep day. Not sure which one I like more, back and bi or chest and tri. Fucking hate leg day, that's for sure. Chest was hurting today, I don't even know why. It's not cardio, I heard something in my chest pop when I stretched. Strange. Well, if I die tomorrow, y'all will know where to look I guess.

I think I'm done prattling for tonight! It's 3:21 a.m., get some rest. Still got one more week to go, then it's Spring Break! Pull through for a little while longer. Good night friend, I'll talk to you tomorrow."

2y8fct,2,2015-03-07,I just had such a shitty reality check and I'm not quite sure how I'm even suppose to handle it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2y8fct/i_just_had_such_a_shitty_reality_check_and_im_not/,"Honestly it sucks to realized everything you lived on was a facade. 

I grew up with a little glimmer of hope that my parents were good natured normal people who just needed time to grow and succeed. After all they were MY parents. It does suck though to see my parents as what I see now. I feel like my mom hasn't grown up since she was a teenager. She just broke an entire cabinet full of china in a drunken rage. 

My dad on the other hand is just entirely irresponsible. He abandoned my family when I was 12. Went off to another country saying he was on a business trip when I'm entirely sure now he ran away because he was embarrassed that he couldn't raise the family he made. 

He's been calling back recently sometimes saying things like he's doing great things and how he'll make up to my mom by buying her a house and giving her a great retirement. Honestly I didn't know what to believe. My mom was angry but she believed him. I didn't know what to think so I guess I lived on the notion that maybe one day I wouldn't be so dirt poor anymore. 

One thing I always hope with what he said was that he had my college tuition. I never had to worry because it was all handled, all I had to do was wait. I'm just starting to realize there is no college money. There is no nice new house. There is no anything. My mom has waited for over 10 years and I realized that I'm already 21. He's passed raising a family. She's spent her life waiting and is now a presumable alcoholic/chain smoker because of it. 

I admit I've inherited those tendencies to want to wait for something better. I realized I just can't wait. That all of it was probably a lie. That's why my mom drunken raged at me for being annoyed about some mundane non-issue and smashed the cabinet tonight.

I don't know. I didn't even react to what happened like I thought I should. I cried for about a minute and then I dried up. I can't even feel sad. I feel entirely disappointed and a new level of dejection.

I'm 21 half unemployed and not in school. Why? Because during what would be my gap year I thought there was going to be something better if I had just waited (I was told by my father that he arranged an internship for me in another country and he just need to file some paperwork if I waited a month... no another month... no next month... there's no fucking internship). My dad is actually just crazy. I haven't seen him in years.

Honestly I should have just been cynical from the start. My sisters never believed it and they're doing way better than me. Now I'm one year in without a internship and I just spent an entire year without school and nothing to show for it. 

It sucks. I don't even know where to start to pick myself up again. I wish I grew up learning how to support myself. Getting shit jobs when I was 16, learning how to make my own money and be my own person. My mom never let me before I turned 18 because ""your dad has something better in mind."" Those jobs never came. I either have to live now or just live life regretting. I honestly wish I learned sooner. There is nothing to be gained by waiting. You can only wait until you die. 

I'm getting a job application tomorrow from a friend's place and I'm figuring out how to go back to school. I'm now operating on the fact that I will have to pay for every single penny of my shit and there was no support. There never was. I thought about killing myself but I realized I had no intent on doing it. I accepted that life just became that much harder. Honestly I don't know where this year will take me now. 

TL;DR: I think my dad is pathological liar and my mom is an alcoholic. Don't wait for your life to start because it already has. "

I've been a software developer for about four years now and have made roughly $50,000 in the past two years from sales on the iOS App Store. I love Computer Science, and I love Software Engineering, and I absolutely loved Western when I visited. However, the one thing that Western seems to lack is a CO-OP program which, as I have heard, is absolute necessity. This is when places such as Waterloo, Guelph and even Carleton, begin to stick out.

I have a 92 average, and with my AIF, I don't really have any worries when it comes to an acceptance from places such as Waterloo, however, I've heard that Loo is very boring. I've even heard someone use the word 'depressing' to describe it.

What have your experiences been with finding a job outside of CO-OP, and how hard is it to obtain an internship? This is the only downside of Western I have found so far, so please, if someone could shed some light on the subject.

EDIT: Do you believe that students studying at Waterloo or Guelph will have an advantage when it comes to job experience? Also, how good is Western when it comes to Software Engineering. I've read into it and it seems as if the Computer Science over the Computer Engineering is a better fit for me!

Final question(s), IM SORRY! In what res are you and how is the walk to classes? Do you know many students outside Computer Science? I apologize for the mass questions, I have NO idea what to expect when it comes to University, and I am quite terrified when making the right decision.

EDIT: I'm not quite sure how Western's Software Engineering works. I was reading into it and, in order to get in to you Computer Science, you go through the Science department – but Software Engineering requires the Engineering department?"

2y8u7r,5,2015-03-07,Hair follicle test (employment),[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2y8u7r/hair_follicle_test_employment/,"Hey everyone,

So I'm aware there are other posts about this topic, but my situation is a little different from others. So I'm a college senior graduating in the Spring and have an offer for a full time job. This place is also the same company I interned for last summer and the signing process is extremely similar.

So last year, around this time they told me they had to do a background check and drug testing. Okay simple, I had been sober for a few months because I knew this stuff would come up in internship interviews and hiring processes. Then I was informed it would be a hair follicle test. Oh crap. However, eventually I was told by the third party they do the testing through that they couldn't do hair follicle testing in my state because it was ""illegal"" for hiring processes. I pass the urine test and continue with my life.

Now this year, the same scenario happens. I call to schedule my appointment, they tell me it will once again have to be a urine test because of the same reasons, stellar. I take the test in around mid-February and hadn't smoked since late November. I smoke later that day with a friend.

So I assume I had passed until I get an email from the HR person. They say that the test was done incorrectly and I would have to take another test, this time it would be a hair follicle test. I tell them about how this same thing happened last year and I get a sort of passive aggressive email back, real professional.

Basically what I'm wondering is, what should I do to make sure I also pass this hair test? Besides the one week after my urine test, I have not smoked since late November. Even in that week I maybe only smoked like four times (probably about 1 to 1.5 grams in total). I will be happy to answer any questions as I'm sure this has been poorly written, considering I have had to resort to alcohol (an actually destructive substance) during this Spring Break.

So should I start doing hair treatments? Or are there over the counter hair tests I can use to see where I'm at?

tl;dr what do I do to pass a hair follicle test, having been sober for over three months barring one week in mid-February"
2y8vkd,7,2015-03-07,"[Day 1] I have returned from the forest, and my decision to quit is completely decided.",[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2y8vkd/day_1_i_have_returned_from_the_forest_and_my/,"I appreciate you clicking to open my post.




4 months ago I started my first quit, after about two years of binge weekend smoking (/u/thatsharrelson). I successfully quit for 3 months, just long enough to give some serious attention to studying for an important career related test. The whole time I was telling myself that I was quitting forever, however in the back of my mind, I still rejected the idea that I could be abusing and dependent upon weed. I knew that I would not be able to go on living my life weed free unless I gave myself an honest chance to try and moderate my smoking.



So my test ended on a Saturday. I called my dealer, and the first place where I messed up was buying an 8th instead of a dub. I smoked that night, but had some important things to do on Sunday and Monday, so I didn't smoke at all Sunday. Fast forward to next weekend, I smoke from Friday night until the end of Saturday night.




 The next weekend I smoke from Friday night until Sunday night. While I wasn't proud of my consecutive day smoking from past weekends, my smoking from this weekend showed me how bad I was with weed. Not only did I dodge my friends and family all weekend, I also had a 2nd interview for my dream post grad job on Monday. I WAS SMOKING THE NIGHT BEFORE A CRUCIAL INTERVIEW. I realized it while I was smoking, and tried to eat a lot of food to bring me down a little bit. The interview still went well, but I knew that my weed usage was threatening my success in life.




The next weekend I was with my girlfriend, and we didn't smoke, but I definitely asked if she knew anyone with weed.



Then this week was the tipping point. When I got back from my trip home, my whole room smelled like rotted meat, because in my high stupor, I unplugged my fridge by accident, before leaving for home for a week. After cleaning it all up, I went to work the next day, and didn't smoke Monday night. I got a cold from something, so I smoked on Tuesday night to ""help alleviate the symptoms from my sickness"" (so embarrassing in hindsight). But I ended up staying up until 7:30 am, trying to get higher and higher. I skip work at my internship the next morning claiming that I was sick, and slept. I smoke again Wednesday night, and then missed my first two classes on Thursday. The class I did make it to, I had to lead a class discussion, and because my mind was hazy I wasn't clearly able to explain my ideas. I also missed my group work meeting. I then smoked on Thursday night, and Friday morning (skipping my internship again). I also skipped out on plans I made with friends. 




Friday, sitting on my bed, overlooking heaps of junk food crumbs and trash in my room, I knew it was time for me to quit.

Speaking of junk food trash. I probably have spent close to 200 dollars in pure junk food for my munchies. That is unresonable. I have also put on a solid 5-6 pounds. That is unreasonable.




So now I begin my final journey. I have seen that I am incapable of using weed in a responsible manner.

It causes me to:





* spend money I don't have






* ignore friends and family





* to skip work





* not go to the gym





* to get fat





* not do my school work





* to be over critical of myself





* causes people not to trust me






* not trust myself





* be paranoid





* be selfish





I am not angry at weed. It has allowed me to see the world beautifully. It has introduced me to knew hobbies, new people, and new ways of perceiving the world. Because I have quit before, and seen which issues are caused by weed, and which problems are exacerbated by weed, it is obvious that weed exacerbates more of my problems than it causes. That's not weed's fault. It's mine. I am just ready to move on to a new chapter in my life.




You guys helped me to quit the first time, so I know you can help me again. I am excited to start the rest of my life."

2y90q9,1,2015-03-07,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2y90q9/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

She responded with ""I'm not sure yet, but most likely. :/"" So I ended up texting her later that I wanted to see her before spring break started and I told her to text me if she wasn't busy. She read the text and didn't respond and the week already passed and she didn't text me to meet up or say she didn't have any time to meet up.

We're both in college and I know we both have busy schedules, but she had to have some free time to meet up, or at the very least tell me she couldn't, right?

We never really get the chance to see each other that much since I am a sophomore and she is a freshman and we're both different majors. We met through our campus ministry, but I have to be really lucky to see her there. I actually know her class schedule (she told me) and I know a couple of other events where I can see her, but I don't want to be a stalker, so the only times I see her is whenever I ask if I can meet her.

But when we do get the chance to see each other in person, she comes up to talk to me and ask me questions about myself and seems really interested in me. She also told me about a job she wanted over the summer and said I should apply there too with her (we both live in the same city too), but I couldn't since I got an internship.

Is it possible that I might have creeped her out by saying I wanted to see her again? She's not my girlfriend so I think that might have been a bad thing to say.

I don't know, should I text her over break and ask her how she is? I just don't want to appear creepy.

2y9e7n,14,2015-03-07,"Long distance for too long, with no end in sight",myeverlastinglight,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2y9e7n/long_distance_for_too_long_with_no_end_in_sight/,"I'm [M/20] and she's [F/19] for clarification.

So yesterday was the first day in 4 years that I didn't speak to my best friend. 

Her and I started dating in February of my junior/her freshman year of high school. We lived in the same town (obviously), and the year and a half we spend together was the most amazing time span I've ever had in my entire life. She isn't perfect, but she is perfect for me. I was and am absolutely crazy about her. I love her, her family, how we grew up together and shaped each other.

Then it was time for me to head off to college. I had done very well in high school, and had pretty much my pick of places to go. I ended up choosing a pretty good engineering school about an hour and a half away from our hometown because I wanted to stay relatively close, I wanted to stay together, and I was pretty good at math and science. It was between that, and the state university 3 hours away which I knew she was going to want to end up going to. I made the wrong choice.

Two years passed long distance. I completed my freshman and sophomore years and chose a pretty obscure major pretty much only offered at that specific university. She graduated high school. Last summer I got an internship 500 miles away, two states over, and I took it. During school I pretty much came home to see her every weekend. Last summer was the first stretch of time I was really unable to see her for multiple months, and it felt like the worst decision I had ever made. She had gone through some terrible things with people that were close to her, and I wasn't able to be there for her like I used to always be able to do. I got home at the end of the summer, and she brought up the idea of taking a break as she starts her freshman year at the state university. It wasn't an attempted breakup, just putting the option out there. I told her that the summer apart made me realize just how important she was to me, and that I'd be willing to keep it up just as we had for the last two years because our universities were about the same distance apart as my university and our hometown was. 

We stayed together, and the first semester this year went just fine. She got an amazing group of friends that she never had in high school, and absolutely loved college. I was able to visit somewhat frequently, but wanted to give her time to settle and make friends, so we didn't see eachother as much as years before. I told her I'd be willing to come up on weekday nights for dinner whenever it would work for her, and pretty much do whatever it took to make the distance work. I had even told her that after I graduate I wanted to move up to her town and find something temporary there so we'd finally be together again as she finished college.

Well. Our 4 year anniversary was 2 weeks ago, and she began to realize that we had spent more than half of our relationship long distance, and it didn't seem like there was any end in sight. She didn't want to limit me to moving up to her town a year and a half from now because I could be doing so much more. I told her to not worry about that, because it would be what I wanted. I suppose that type of pressure wasn't the best. On top of that, it would be unlikely we'd be able to even spend more summers together as we both get internships in various places, so that'd be more time even further apart like last summer. Plus she wants to study abroad for a semester in the future. So there no end in sight, and she held a constant sadness that she said she felt when we weren't able to see each other. And it felt like we were just beginning to be on the outskirts of eachother's new lives that we are building in college and with our future careers.

She told me all of this on Thursday, when she drove down to my house. I haven't heard from her since. She told me that after some time to herself, she would come back if she realized that it was the wrong choice. I just can't imagine the future without being able to share it with her. Yesterday was the first time I hadn't spoken to her in 4 years, 1 week, and 6 days. We're actually both back in our hometown this weekend, and I don't want anything more than to have her text me asking to see me, but I know that won't happen just 2 days after the breakup. 

She's my best friend, and I miss her like crazy already. I was and am willing to spend however much more time is necessary long distance to be with her long term. Seeing her for a few hours over dinner or a movie made the weeks not seeing eachother absolutely worth it. Being apart due to a decision I made last summer made me realize that, and I hope she realizes the same thing. I've even looked into what credits would transfer to her university. It might actually be possible, but I'd have to change majors because mine isn't offered there. And I doubt she'd want me to do that if she didn't want to ""hold me back"" by having me move to her after graduation. 

I just want her back. I miss my best friend. Keep in mind all of these details are just what is relevant to the break up. She is absolutely amazing, and we have never had any problems besides distance. Having it not be me, and not be her, but our situation is just so fucking unfair.

I've been throwing myself into school. It really helps take my mind off things. I've been talking to someone I knew from high school on tinder, and even though I doubt it will go anywhere it gives me hope that other guys could be interested. I'm not exactly ready to start dating again, but it's good to know that there's other people that I could be with. 

And, I think I got a job! I had an interview last week, and they want me to come in on Tuesday. It'll be around 25 hours a week, and along with school I'll be busy a lot. I've had way too much free time recently, and I just lay around thinking about my ex. Not good. 

Also, since I will be making money I can put some aside to travel. I remember telling my ex I wanted to do a semester abroad and he wasn't too thrilled. When we were together I dreamt I had been travelling and I was happy, then I woke up and remembered I was with him and that would make going anywhere hard. With his job travelling isn't an option, and it won't be for a while. He didn't like the idea of me going on long trips. 

But now I can! I've been looking into internships, volunteering opportunities, and travelling groups. I have so many options, and it's exciting. 

I can be totally selfish and just focus on ME right now, and it feels great! I put so much time and energy into that relationship, but now I can put all that time and energy into my own life. I really do think this is for the better.

My dad mentioned it today -- that I couldn't even get a fucking summer internship (which my program requires in order to finish the degree). I might as well drop out, because what is the fucking point.

And now my final question: what is the fucking point about life? People say disabled people can have a normal life. That isn't fucking true. I'm a godamn disabled loser. I don't have a love life, because every girl doesn't want a stupid freak, even tho I try and try. I don't come off as a neckbeard virgin, but I do my best to talk and be friends first. I'm not blaming them for not liking me, but this will continue to be a failure in my life, in addition to my other failures.

I don't have too many friends that talk to me. Just one or two. Which is fine, but I feel they only talk to me if they have nothing else to do. Which is also fine, because at least there is contact. Oh well.

Sorry about ranting. I just needed to get this off my chest.

2y9y4f,1,2015-03-07,24/F/LL - sex drive gone after medical diagnosis.,[deleted],DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/2y9y4f/24fll_sex_drive_gone_after_medical_diagnosis/,"So long story.  May of 2014 my SO and I moved to California.  He had been having a health scare before moving so I was the one the prep everything for the move and drove most the way from OH to Cali.  We get there and it takes me 2 months to find a job, he was working an unpaid internship, so I was the one to carry us until he could find a position after the internship was over in 6 months. Money obviously was a huge stresser that we never really had to deal with in our 2 years being together at that point.

Find a job working in the food business like I always had and after a few weeks... BOOM. I start having crazy symptoms. Fast forward to diagnosis 2 months later and I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and an auto immune disorder that they think is Lupus (testing is hard for a form diagnosis). Lost my job and we had no option but to move back to OH and crushed his dreams since a child to live in Cali. During this whole ordeal Libido ceased to exist. The stress, trying different meds (they all made everything worse so I went off them) and the fact of being overweight and my SO voicing that it wasn't that attractive to him threw me over the edge.
He clearly has voiced that I don't have sex enough with him and I am trying my best.  It just seems he advances at the most random time when I haven't been thinking about it, so I don't meet with the same enthusiasm off the bat and its over before it started. Also with Fibro and working a full time job I do get tired and staying up late it hard - and having sex late and going right to bed it his ideal sex life most of the time. It's hard to digest writing this because I used to be the one upset if it had been 2 days since having sex and fearing he didn't find me attractive, now it has reversed.
If no one knows what Fibro is its a muscle/nerve disorder so sometimes a prolonged session in one position for more then 10 minutes can make things hurt for hours afterwards. It seems intercourse is the only way for my SO to feel satisfied. I'm trying to find as many other ways to supplement and still show intimacy but without penetration all the time.
Also, him saying my weight was making me unattractive is something that can't leave my mind while having sex. I have changed many things like my diet and exercise regimen where I have lost 50 pounds at least to relieve my symptoms and it has worked to an extent, there is just no cure, only managing day by day. I just seems hearing it from him crushed me and I can't seem to shake it off.

Any suggestions to help me get into better mindsets and anything I can suggest that could satisfy him without always having to penetrate? I love giving him oral but he has a hard time going just from oral - he says it just was always a problem of his.

Thanks for any responses."

2yak27,1,2015-03-07,My boss is an asshole,TheWiseBrownGuy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2yak27/my_boss_is_an_asshole/,"If I could rewind six months, I would've rejected your offer of a job. But I didn't, since I was desperate for a work placement. Turns out, you were also desperate, since the guy you interviewed previously rejected your job. I wonder why. Maybe he saw straight through your character and decided you're an asshole. I've been busting my ass for you for the past six months and you have given me nothing but stress and fucking misery, you absolute cunt. 

I've been working my ass off to be a success like the previous intern and actually make something out of this placement experience, but ever since I've arrived in this job, you've just looked down on me like I'm fucking stupid.  Yeah, the previous intern was amazing, I've heard you chant his success stories like a billion times, just shut the fuck up about it. Stop comparing me to him. Just fucking stop, I don't need to hear it. 

For the past six months, I've been left in the dark. Limited support and guidance from my so called ""mentor"". Every piece of work I submit to you is fucking wrong. So why don't you fucking show me to how to do it your way then, instead of talking down to me like a fucking cunt. Maybe some guidance would actually help my confidence, instead of shouting at me every time something goes wrong. 

Do you want to know why I'm so quiet in the office? It's because of you asshole. You and your screwed up facial expression, looking like you just busted a shit in your underwear. I lose confidence in myself because of your shitty attitude and lack of guidance. I can't even function properly when I'm dealing with you, I become nervous, since you're always on fucking edge. 

You treat me like shit. You never treated the previous intern like this, you worshipped the fucking ground he stepped on. But me, it's different. I try to build a good working relationship with you, but you just chuck it back in my face. I've never been welcomed into this company by you, probably never will. I just sit at my desk and get on with my work, you never bother to even ask if I'm okay. 

This week, I gave you a piece of work which you had all week to look over and check whether it was up to your standards. Did it not concern you to just spend a few minutes checking over it to see whether it was correct in your eyes? Instead you look at it, ONE HOUR BEFORE YOUR MEETING AND THEN TELL ME IT'S WRONG. Nah, you didn't just tell me. You fucking humiliated me in front of the whole office, telling me how disappointed you were in me. Well, fuck you, I can't be bothered to deal with your bullshit any longer. I'm tired of the constant shit you give me over absolutely nothing. I'm a fucking intern, I'm new to business life. Instead of just telling me how to do it, why not guide me through it?

Since you fired the other manager, you've turned to me to pent out your anger and frustration on. Nah man, I ain't having it for any longer. If it wasn't for my university degree, I would've left after you raged at me the first time.

I've got six months left of this goddamn placement remaining, I can't even work for you for a single day longer. Everyday, I'm dragging myself to work, just hoping that the day goes by quickly and that I can just go home. You've made me go from being enthusiastic to just nothing. But, what I have learnt is not to be a dick like yourself if I'm ever managing people. Patience and maintaining good working relationships with your employees is key.

2yanke,5,2015-03-07,Is a research internship helpful if you want to go into the field?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yanke/is_a_research_internship_helpful_if_you_want_to/,"Basically, I applied for a LOT of internships (it's my last summer..) and to my surprise, no offers. even from people who said ""this interview went great and we will be contacting you about moving forward to the next stage of interview"" or from people who said ""I think you would be perfect for this. I will call you or email you soon with an official offer"". Very discouraged. Anyways, I may have an opportunity with my school to do a paid research internship with one of my professors. At this point, it's very tempting considering how badly I feel about my chances. Thing is, I'm not sure how helpful a research internship would be, considering that I want to work in industry (I know it's more helpful than no internship at all). More details, this professor mostly does research with microcontrollers or networking (complex data structures)."
2yatq7,1,2015-03-07,TIFU by having hot sweaty sticky sex in the dark,leone910,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2yatq7/tifu_by_having_hot_sweaty_sticky_sex_in_the_dark/,"This happened a few years ago. Just getting around to sharing it with the world.

I had been fucking this girl that was living in my city for a summer internship. We'll call her Crazy. Probably once of the best sexual relationships of my life. Crazy was hot... and a big emphasis on WAS... the past few years have not been kind to her figure. Sex just once a day wasn't enough for Crazy. We set our alarm early EVERYDAY so that we could wake up and have a fun romp before heading to work.

Completely irrelevant backstory... Crazy and a few girl friends has been to NOLA for a weekend, and a cabbie had enlightened them about the secret way to keep a boy around. You put ""the voodoo"" on them!! Literally bleed on them.. fuck them on your period.  Anyways, Crazy proceeded to fuck me on her period. Not that either one of us was going to go a day without sex. Crazy voodooed me. 

Somewhat relevant backstory... Not long after we started hooking up, CRAZY suggested I pull out and finish in her mouth. Now if you haven't tried this, YOU NEED TO FUCKING TRY THIS!!! BEST! THING! EVER!!! I was hooked. Every time, yes please. Pretty sure CRAZY regretted suggesting that move by the end of the summer. 

What started it all... I had drunkenly promised my little brother I would take him to Vegas for his 21st birthday. And no way did he ever let me forget that promise. So a week in Vegas... all that hot dry air. I got no less that one bloody nose every day I was there. Random fucking bloody noses that wouldn't stop for anything. 

Now queue my super horny fuck buddy, Crazy, after a week of me being gone. When I got back, we fucked around for a bit before finally heading to bead. Turn out the lights and... we're at it again (seriously, none of my other relationship has touched this amount of fucking). We'd already been going at it for a bit before this, so we both already hot, on top of my already hot natured self. So when I'm on top and we start to get sweaty, it's no surprise. We're really going at it, and the sweat is really starting to drip off me down onto Crazy. As I get close to finishing, I pull out and slide on top of her chest. Being the good little slut she is, Crazy instinctively swallows every last bit as I quiver a little bit while grinding on her chest some. 

More backstory... Crazy loved donating blood, but couldn't stand the sight of blood. Anytime she had blood drawn, she would pass out. Donating blood? Wake Crazy up when they're finished. Someone got cut? Crazy better steady herself and look away. 

Back to that night... At this point, I'm still straddling Crazy's mediocre chest. My dick still in her hand. I can still feel the sweat dripping off my face. I reach over and turn a lamp on. WHAT! THE! FUCK!! I had put the voodoo on her!! It looks like a fucking murder scene.

Blood is everywhere! My face, Crazy's face, smeared all across her chest, dripping down my chest, her hands. My fucking bloody nose had come back mid sex. Probably one of the only times we had fucked missionary style that summer. And what a time for this to be it.

As soon as Crazy realized that it's blood she's covered in, she starts hyperventilating. Her eyes tight shut. The only thing she could say is put me in the shower. I oblige and proceed to wash her entire body before Crazy ever opened her eyes. 

The aftermath... The rest of the summer went off without a hitch. Crazy moved back away to finish her masters. Albeit after she decided to stay with me her last week of summer before her classes started back. After her lease had already ran out, I should add. And oh, first day of class got cancelled? Crazy decided to stay an extra day. Four days later, class got out early? Only 5 1/2 hours to see me? Weekend trip.

I must have put the fucking voodoo on Crazy like a fucking champ. 6 months later, Crazy moved back for me. That was nearly 3 years ago. So much has happened since then... Crazy pitched all my shit pitched out her 6th floor window, had lawyers send each other cease and desist letters, Crazy had her new boy attempt to fight me, Crazy made enemies with everyone of my friends even while we were still dating.

Fucking voodoo. 

TLDR; Put the ""voodoo"" on someone by bleeding on them and they'll never leave. I put the voodoo on Crazy and she made my life a living hell. "

2yaxhk,1,2015-03-07,First time a dude made me cum. Older man uses his talented mouth on me,[deleted],gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/2yaxhk/first_time_a_dude_made_me_cum_older_man_uses_his/,"Hey there, long time lurker, first time poster. I thought I'd share a hot time about a summer ago. 
I'll start by describing myself: I'm a tall, decent-looking university student in California. I keep myself in good shape (weight-lifting), and although I'm not packing the biggest package out there, it definitely gets the job done. About 6 and a half inches more on the girthy side with a thick foreskin. Anyway, I was taking some classes over the summer and I had just left my job so I suddenly found myself with a lot of downtime. I used most of this time to look for internships for the next year, studying and burying myself in the books, and pumping iron. I hadn't paid attention to my cock in the longest time and found myself one Saturday morning with throbbing morning wood. I had drunkenly experienced with other dudes in the past but none were particularly enjoyable. So I decided to hit up Craigslist with something along the lines of: 

""Looking for experienced to show me the ropes"" 

After the usual spammers and weirdos, one particular reply stood out. He was an older guy in about his 30's who was in pretty good shape who seemed harmless. I would normally have taken more precautions in the past, but seeing as how I was thinking with the head down there instead of the head on my shoulders, I quickly agreed to head over to his place after a quick shower and shave.

I drove up nervously to his place, and after some confusion about the addresses, I see him walk out in a white tee and some board shorts. I follow him in and the usual small talk ensues. After a few minutes on the couch he says,

""Wanna head upstairs?"" 

I follow him to his bedroom and I can't believe how clean this guy's place is. He starts by stripping me down naked, (which made me feel pretty vulnerable) and tries to kiss me. ""I love your lips"" and ""wow"" breathe out in between frantic gropes of my body. 

It was strange. I was much more muscular and standing taller at 6 feet even and he was lean, kind of furry guy and a bit shorter. But he made me feel like a woman. I wasn't into that much kissing and he could sense that as he put his hands on my chest and pushed me down onto the bed. He was slobbering all over my neck, down to my pecs, gave my nipples a suckle for a few minutes, and traced my happy trail down to my cock until he finally plunged his mouth deep onto it. 

In a nutshell, it was the greatest head I've ever gotten. I still stroke myself to this day thinking about how talented this guy's mouth was. He ran his tongue up and down the underside of my cock, and would hum a sexy baritone as he took both my balls in his mouth. He kept mentioning how he loved how smooth my skin was and I assumed it contrasted so starkly with his slightly furry body. As soon as I put my hands above my head and started to get comfortable, he threw a curveball and threw my thighs up and got his mouth in my most vulnerable spot. 

My eyes rolled in to the back of my head as I experienced a man tongue my asshole for the first time. First he would be gentle with kisses on my cheeks and the occasional lick on my hole but as time passed he dug his face into my ass and completely devoured it. I felt his stubble and scruff on my soft ass cheeks as he slobbered all over my taint. 

It was only a matter of time before he started working his fingers into my hole and working his mouth on my cock at the same time. An almost ecstatic feeling overcame my body and I knew deep in my balls that I was gonna cum soon. He was frantically working my body until I finally erupted and he pointed my cock towards my belly as I spurted ropes of cum on my body and some got on my chin. He wiped some off his lips and began to lap up the cum on my body as I just lay there spread-eagled trying to recover from what had just happened. 

Unfortunately, that was all I would ever hear from him as school and work priorities consumed my life but to this day I look back to this experience as I'm fucking some girl or stroking it on my own and recreating in my mind. I don't think any other experience gave me such an explosive orgasm. Needless to say, I think I'll be more open to guys taking care of me when I need it.

2yaxma,3,2015-03-07,"My GF is being asked by her boss to work off the clock. how illegal is this, and what would be the penalty for reporting her?",woffdaddy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2yaxma/my_gf_is_being_asked_by_her_boss_to_work_off_the/,"Ninja Edit! I'm in New Mexico.

My girlfriend is the assistant manager at a tea shop, and over the last few months I've noticed some really shady business practices. It started when my GF was telling me about an ""intern"" that started working at the shop. after questioning her for a few minutes, I was able to gather that:

1. an 18 year old woman approached the store owner asking if she could volunteer at the shop to get work experience.

2. the owner agreed to the let the girl work, no pay (they gave her free tea) and with very limited duties (Taking out the trash, talking to customers about tea, and a few other cleaning tasks)

3. that after 2 months, the owner hired her and payed her in full for her previous volunteer time.

Now IANAL, but that sounds highly illegal to me, so I press a little deeper and find that there's a policy at work called ""always in purple"" (uniform is purple), and goes something like, no matter if you are in uniform, or on the clock, that if you are in the store, you should help out if you see something that needs doing (clean a table, assist a customer, fix the shelves). now I'm really worried at this point, because my GF is an assistant manager here, and I don't want her to get in legal trouble, so i told her that they should drop the policy to avoid legal issues. a few days later, she tells me that they dropped it and changed their policy. but now something else has come up. a few days ago, my GF and I were getting ready to go to a movie, when she gets a phone call from her boss. turns out, shes late to a class that she was supposed to be at. she apologizes and her boss says to forget it and to enjoy her evening. see, the owner runs a class on certain nights and asks her employees to come to it, its free for them, but they don't get paid to be there. but they also aren't required to be there, and can choose not take the class if they dont want to. but apparently my GF doesn't get that choice, and doesn't get paid to be there either.

so now I'm upset, what can be done about this? who should i contact? How Illegal is all of this? could my girlfriend get in trouble over this too?

Smaller firms don't make you specialize, so you can find out what you actually enjoy, but less overall resources.
Are there big salary differences between firm sizes? Smaller firms say they are ""competitive"" with larger firms...what the hell does that mean?!

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

So, Elise called me a little bit ago via FaceTime on my computer instead of just a phone call like I was expecting. We said ""hello"" to each other and the other usual pleasantries you go through at the beginning of a phone call. She seemed a little nervouse but otherwise ok. She asked if she'd made an ass of herself or said anything weird. 

I told her that no, of course she hadn't made an ass of herself (I specifically told her that she'd have to be totally wasted or trying *very* hard) and hadn't said anything too wierd, at least for her. 

&gt; I got her to laugh at that (I love her laugh)

She said she had a couple questions to ask me before we hung up but wanted to talk more before she asked them. The conversation went on she seemed to loosen up but hadn't mentioned anything about Spring Break. As I was about to try and broach the subject her doorbell rang. She said that either our other sister forgot her key or it was ""the second question.""

&gt; Now *that* raised some questions becsause I'm pretty sure it wasn't Renee Montoya

She got up to answer the door and I heard the typical high-pitched greetings that seem to happen when girls meet each other. I heard her voice and one I didn't recognize (so it was obviously not our sister). 

I saw a pair of legs in a plaid or tartan skirt walk by way in the background with Elise as she helped get her guest settled in what I would assume to be the living room. Elise eventually gets back on the call and she's looking a little nervous again. I ask her what's up; she says everything's ok but she still needs to ask me a couple questions and then asks if she can ask me anything. I assumed by now this should go without saying and tell her that much, plus I let her know that because I love her so much I won't even count that question against the two she wanted. 

&gt; She laughed and started to loosen up again after that

She asked if it was still ok that she stayed at my house for break. I reminded her that that should also go without saying but, yes: she can do whatever makes her happy and comfortable. If that means she spends some time at my house then she is **always** welcome. I added that with her there my scenery would be improved a lot and she said that was hard to believe. I have close to 100 acres, kind of in the mountains and she loves it.

&gt; It's ""picturesque:"" I had a herd of elk run through my front yard the last time she was there 

So now that the first question has been answered and I'm starting to feel a little better I asked her about the second question wich would seem to involve the legs I'd seen waking around in the background. She asked me if I remembered a coworker she had mention that she's in the same internship program with (I didn't mention her before because it wasn't relative). 

&gt; Elise says she's ""nice and has ""a great personality.""

I told her yes and that apparently she's there and has nice legs, this got a giggle but it confused me for a second because Elise's mouth didn't move and it wasn't because of lag: there was someone else in the room with her... Oookay, I wasn't going to say anything too inappropriate but now I know I have to be a little more careful. I figured I might as well make a guess (i figured I could pass it off as a joke if I was wrong) and said, ""Well, if she coming too, then I'll have to sleep on the couch.""

Elise gave me a surprised, sort of ""huh"" look after I said that. I returned it with a smug grin and reminded her there's a [reason](http://imageserver.moviepilot.com/sherlock-sherlock-themed-attraction-could-become-a-real-thing.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=768) I work in the job that I do (I work for a security company and a few things go into my job, but mainly it's forensic IT and I get to help piece things together) and in all modestly I'm *very* smart... Well, book smart at least. People tend to be harder to read and I've got [aspergers](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome) which tends to complicate social interactions so I tend to go with what's worked in the past and comedy is fairly universal.

&gt; I don't usually tell people that but the people I do usually say every thing ""makes more sense"" afterwards, so... yeah

I tell my sister that if it's what both of them want then I have no problem with some extra company for a while but reminded her that I can't sleep more than about three people in my house because I've only got two beds and the couch. Now, I said that but *thought* something closer to ""guess it's a good thing I didn't get my hopes up too high"" because **obviously** nothing's going to happen between my sister and myself if there's some stranger there for the next few weeks. I leaned back in my chair so I could try to hide my disappointment and said that I'd like the chance to talk to her friend because I'd rather not get turned into a skin-suit by someone a guest if I could help it. That got another laugh from Elise's friend and just as I looked back at the screen she entered the frame. Ho. Lee. Shit. My sister's friend is hot! Not as attractive as Elise, but close.

I've always had thing for glasses: she was wearing kind of hipster glasses like [this](http://www.bazaared.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nerd-hipster-glasses-wayfarer-6.jpg). Her hair is red and I couldn't see too many freckles on her so she would appear to be a daywalker and not a full blown ginger (not that gingers are bad, just the only description that came to mind). She started to talk and introduce herself and within about 7 words I hear her accent and she's Scottish! I'll call her Amy, because it's my post and I can do whatever I want.

&gt; Basically, my sister's friends with [Karen Gillan](http://blog.roopevintage.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Doctor-Who-Amy-Pond-Wearing-Round-Glasses.jpg) 

I asked her what clan her tartan's from. My family descends from the MacFarland clan, close to Lach Lomand, so I was generally curious as I've gotten into my heritage lately. Amy explained it was just the Black Watch, not any specific clan (she has a family member in the military) before she laughed again (not quite as pretty as my sister's, but close) and said, word for word: ""You said your brother was cute not cute, funny, *and* smart."" I can feel my cheeks heating up as I start to blush. ""Did you really call me cute?"" Amy laughs and says ""yes"" at the same time it was Elise's turn to blush and say ""yes.""

&gt; I literally fell out my chair at this [realization](http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-say-hallelujah.png)

We talked for a while, all three of us, and she seemed to be nice and I didn't get any sort of bad vibe from Amy and my sister obviously liked her enough to drive all the way to my house from where they go to school and work together. Eventually Elise said she had to something and got up to leave the room for a bit. 

Amy and I kept talking and she mentioned that Elise talked about me a lot. I asked what sort of things she said and got a wink along with ""mostly good, some great and all endearing."" I said that I hadn't heard too much about her because Elise and I haven't been taking as much lately. Amy said she knew that too and they talked about that, too. 

&gt; [What](http://static.gi2c-blog.org/images/blog/surprise-interview-questions.jpg)

""Oh? What a, what... did she say why?"" Amy paused for a second and looked at me kind of weird for a second and said ""Well, duh. She's been so busy with school, work, and that wanker ex-boyfriend (only a few murderous thoughts through my head) was trying to control her (some more semi/murderous thoughts went through my head) so she hadn't done very much for herself lately, like talk to her ""favorite brother.""

&gt; [Oh, that's all](http://www.solvencyiinews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRrLVBYh.jpg). It could have been worse

Elise came back a little bit after that and we talked a little more before Elise said she wanted to watch ""that last anime we watched together before she left"" because (trying to type her exact words, here) ""she decided she likes it more than she first thought and (Amy) thought she'd like it too"" since ""(she) was willing to try anything a least once."" I could have completely imagined it but I'm pretty sure that both of them were blushing when Elise said this. 

&gt; I repeat: [What](http://static.gi2c-blog.org/images/blog/surprise-interview-questions.jpg)? Did I take the blue [pill](http://upw-prod-images.global.ssl.fastly.net/nugget/5134316e1ed03e0002003278/WealthInequality-ce7387bef3bd7f6cade9ed62abc30096.jpg)? Am I still in the Matrix?

I'm trying to wrack my brain as I write this because I'm not exactly sure *which* anime she's talking about. We watched three different anime's the last day she was at my house. It was either ""High School DxD,"" ""Haganai,"" or ""Sekirei."" They are all fairly different from each other, and it could just be a coincidence but they share a theme- harems: multiple female characters persuing and/or sharing the same male character. The shows are fun to watch, funny and are written fairly well. 

I'm not sure how to take this whole thing because my sister's last comment could mean something or be completely harmless and mean nothing at all. 

&gt; Anyone know how to contact [Professor Xavier](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126825/3009276-786616-professor_x_00_super.jpg)?

I guess what I'm asking is: what the hell do I do now? I know it's hard to come up with much of a answer but I'm at a complete loss here.

**Update:**  The last few hours have been going by in kind of a haze since I talked with the girls. 

&gt; I can't believe I just had a legitimate reason to say "" the girls""

I didn't sleep very well and the while time change thing means my alarm went off an hour earlier than it should have. I'm going to FaceTime Elise later tonight but I had to call my sister a couple times and get some things straightened out. I got some encouraging answers from her. She also wants Amy to be involved in the conversation tonight so I'll do a full update later tonight after I talk to them.

Yeah, I’ve had my ups and downs over the years but for the last 2 years things have been pretty bad for me. I was living with a friend and he was also depressed but seeking help at the time. While living there we completely neglected the place and never did any sort of cleaning. We had water damage that we didn’t fix until the weekend we moved out (and all we did was put some drywall over the hole in the wall.) It was disgusting seeing all of the things we hadn't cleaned the whole time I was living there. I didn’t let my dad help me move because I didn’t want him to see the condition of my place.

I haven’t had sex with in about 2.5 years; I’m not unattractive and I’m confident about that. I just haven’t had any interest in sex. I’ve been in school this whole time and stopped caring what happens in my classes. Spending all of my energy on my group projects (to avoid letting the other people down) and not spending any time going to class or studying. I’m currently 5 classes away from an engineering degree and was going to take 2 classes in the fall but failed both of them because I never went to class or showed up for tests because I had really bad anxiety and didn’t feel like it or just didn’t want to think about it. Finally before the fall semester I moved to a new place and things are starting to look up. About 3 months ago I started taking Zoloft and got a medical withdrawal from school. It is nice because I got a refund of the money for tuition. I’m working full time while i take the spring/summer off and I just want to get myself better.

Let me quickly go back to last spring when I started having problems with ulcerative colitis (at the time I had no idea what the cause was.) I had no energy. I was depressed. I had to have a colonoscopy, pill cam, blood tests, MRI and taking all sorts of medications such as prednisone. Nothing was helping and I kept feeling worse and worse. I was sleeping all the time and had no energy. Luckily I was living at home for that summer while I was doing an internship at my fathers company. My parents saw that I was sleeping a lot and got worried. They called the doctor to tell him I didn’t look well, etc. Finally the nurse of another doctor entirely saw me and noticed how pale I was. She ordered blood work and after eating and heading home I received a call telling me to come back to the doctors office so that I could go to the hospital. My hemoglobin was down to about 6 which is pretty low and required me to get 3 bags of blood transfused. I was stuck in the hospital for 3 days which was a super shitty (pun not intended) experience. I started a medication called Simponi after another colonoscopy and then I had to have another transfusion one month after being in the hospital before. This time I only had to stay less than 24 hours which wasn’t too bad. This time I knew what to expect from the hospital and knew how to make myself comfortable and deal with all the rules they have; plus I made sure to come prepared with things to do. After another month of Simponi I can say that I’m actually feeling a lot better (in regards to my ulcerative colitis). It’s still painful when I go to the restroom but I’m not losing as much blood which means more energy/oxygen.

I really miss being in a relationship and miss having someone I care about in a romantic way. At about the same time that I started taking Zoloft I started talking to this girl I met while playing video games online. We hit it off and really had some chemistry; problem is that she is on the opposite side of the country. This girl made me feel amazing and she was very attractive. I found out her ex was someone she met online playing the same game and they dated for 4 years. It was at this moment that I realized I actually had a chance, however small, to make this happen. I started texting her every day and we would Skype some days, but I wanted to have her physically with me so badly. She kept telling me she had just gotten out of a relationship and she wanted to take things slow. I’m pretty sure she was just trying to make sure I didn’t tell her I love her; I had no intentions of doing that because I’m not that unrealistic, but I wanted to date this girl so much.

After 1-2 months on Zoloft I’m finally starting to feel better and this is when we started talking the most. I would text/snap/call her any time I could and she would do the same. However sometimes she would tell me she still wanted to take things slow and couldn’t have a boyfriend. She was super sensitive to my feelings but I didn’t dare tell her about being depressed due to fear of her thinking I was weird. One night I got sexually excited and I was texting her about how I wanted to be with her in that way. I asked her why she never talked about those things with me. This is when she reminded me that she didn’t want a boyfriend yet. 

She has also told me that she still likes me. I know there is a good chance she will be moving to live in my State in about a year, which was established a while ago. But when she told me she didn’t want a boyfriend it seriously felt like a ton of bricks landed on my heart. It’s not her fault whatsoever and I don’t blame her due to her personal situation (which was really hard for her because her ex was stupid). All the good feelings I was having, caused by the ""relationship"" and the Zoloft helping my depression, felt like it had disappeared. I was back to feeling nothing. I stopped texting her after she told me that and got a text from her later asking if I was mad at her. She reminded me that she still liked me but just can’t do the distance. If she was here it would be different. I responded in a reasonable manner and told her I’m not mad at her. I didn’t really go into how I felt because I didn’t really know what to say. I wanted to avoid telling her so that she wouldn’t think she was causing me to be depressed. That’s not the case at all. I realize that it’s something else entirely that is causing the lack of emotion.

The next day I texted her “hey” and she responded with her classic “hey you” which caused my heart to jump. I knew what she really wanted though and I realized I just couldn’t keep going on with this emotional roller coaster. I then told her I was dealing with personal problems and couldn’t have something unreliable in my life at that moment. We continued talking every 1-2 days which was much less frequently.

I felt really down for 2 days after she told me she didn’t want a boyfriend, that’s when I went to Tinder and started trying to line up a date or something. I meet one girl a few days later and actually had a good time at starbucks but we were pretty different and didn’t have a ton in common. I was supposed to have another date the next day but that girl didn’t text me back. I tried to line up a second date with the first girl but she tells me she has to work early that day I say we can do it the next weekend and she says ok but then doesn’t respond when I ask if she prefers friday or saturday; my two days off. Then a couple days ago I decide I will make an OKCupid account and have been trying to message girls from there. Maybe I will line something tangible up soon. In the meantime I just know I really want a girl to care for and have feelings for, but I can’t find her. I don’t really go downtown or do anything with my friend. I still talk to the girl I met playing video games and we play almost every night. But I don’t text her like I used to. I don’t know what’s going on with her or how she feels; I only know that she wants to be friends at least for a while.

So here I am. I have no idea what’s going on with me. I don’t know how healthy it would be for me to actually date a girl and each time I get rejected by one of these girls it kind of hurts. I just want to be happy and wish I wasn’t so reliant on girls who have no idea what I’m going through."

 I'm an Msc Computer Science student and my course is based in java and from there I've worked on some personal projects and currently attempting to get competent in android dev.

 So far the most promising response i got from a company (bmll tech for any interested) didn't go anywhere because they were looking for somebody with python/c++ experience. But other than that I haven't even go to a stage where a company has given me a chance to demonstrate any skill (or lack of). 

From some of the companies that I've sent CV's and covering letters to and then called up they said they wouldn't be making their decisions for about a month or so, so thats at least an avenue of hope.

 Any tips or advice from you guys?"

2yckb3,781,2015-03-08,The Body Farm,bloodstreamcity,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2yckb3/the_body_farm/,"I'm not a guy who gets scared easily, but I'm also not the kind who keeps his head in the sand, if you know what I mean. When something doesn't feel right, it doesn't feel right, period. I acknowledge that most of the bad things that happen in life can be blamed on people or the world around us, but I also believe there are things that fall outside those two categories, at least until we prove otherwise.

Like what happened at the body farm.

I've wanted to be a writer ever since I was a kid, so forgive me if I get too flowery sometimes, it's the habits of a writer. As I'm sure you know, though, writing doesn't pay the bills, and despite my dream of earning a living by writing, I've always needed a day job to get me by. Through the father of a friend, I ended up getting trained and certified as an unarmed security guard straight out of high school, which I did all the way through college. It was easy, and the money was good enough for a while, but eventually I looked for something with a future in it. So long as my writing wasn't taking off, I figured I might as well build a career. After a long search I got a job at one of the major banks- which one I'd rather not say. 

Six years I spent working my ass off, climbing my way up the ranks. That was until five weeks ago when they decided they had too many branches open on the east coast, as well as too many employees working those branches. So I got the boot. No severance, no fanfare, no apology, I was out on the street, and as I soon found out, no one was hiring.

When things started to get desperate I paid a visit to this employment agency up the block from my house. I've never liked the guy who runs it, but as I said, times are desperate. So I walked in and signed up. They didn't seem too hopeful when I asked about other bank jobs, but when they saw the security guard experience on my resume' they perked up. As it turned out they had an overnight temp guard position they were having trouble filling. Needless to say I was hesitant to take what I believed was a step backward. Not to downtalk or discredit guardwork in any way, it just doesn't fit the direction I'm trying to go in at the moment. You'd think being an overnight guard would afford me plenty of time to write, but the truth is I've always had a hard time writing while completely alone. For some reason it makes me uneasy, and I end up getting nothing done.

The point is, I didn't want to take the gig, but a man's gotta eat. My choice was helped by the rate they were paying, which was at the higher end of what guards usually make. Against my better judgment I accepted. They made a few phone calls, wrote down an address and sent me on my way. “It's on the water,” is the only detail they gave. My old uniform was a bit snug but it still fit. I actually found that fact a little disappointing.

Around five o'clock I arrived at the address they'd written on the card, which it turned out was a boat launch to get over to an island, on which was the actual gig. I'll call it Twain Island, since I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to be talking about it in the first place, even though its actual name is one I'd never heard despite growing up close-by. After a confusing exchange with the older guy who ran the dock, he told me something which very nearly made me turn around and get back in my car.
  
“I need to see your phone,” he said. I was confused, but I took it out of my pocket and showed him. Then he said, “If that's a camera, I need to take it.” I made a joke, something like, “What's on that island, the Queen of England?” but he wasn't amused. I argued with him for a minute but in the end I handed it over. Like I said, a man's gotta eat. A few minutes later an even older guy came got me and took me onto the boat. Since it was only the two of us, and since I had no idea what I had gotten myself into, I tried to make some small-talk. The guy wasn't very talkative, but as we approached the island he made the second sketchy comment of the day, this one in the form of a question.

“Have you ever been to one of these farms?” I told him I'd been to plenty of farms, to which he said, “Not like this one you haven't.” I had no idea what he was talking about, but by then we were already pulling up to the dock that stuck out from the rocky shore. We docked. Before I could ask where I was supposed to go he was already pulling away. It seemed he didn't want to stick around long. There was a building up the way's a bit which looked like an old rec center. Given that I had nowhere else to go, I headed for the building. Halfway across the lawn was a sign which read, “[Twain] Island Forensic Anthropology Facility.” They were words I was familiar with seperately, but together lost their meaning. As I contemplated exactly what they meant, a young guy wearing a guard's uniform came around the side of the building and waved me down.

“I heard the boat,” he said. He introduced himself as Eric and handed me a walkie-talkie. He explained that, other than a few computers with an internet connection, all communication on the island was done by old-school means. In case of emergency they even had a two-way radio set-up. I asked him why I wasn't allowed to bring my cell and he said it was so no pictures ended up on the internet, which I'd heard from a friend who did guardwork at a high-end jewelry manufacturer, so it made some sense. It still didn't tell me what the hell was going on out on that island. 

I point-blank asked him. All he said was, “C'mon, I'll show you.”

We walked not into but around the decent-sized building, past a second, smaller building and into the woods beyond. Eric said something about the island being the alleged site of buried pirate treasure, but to be honest I wasn't paying much attention at that point. There was a strong smell in the air, pungent and sweet and downright awful which I found impossible to ignore. Eric noticed my face and said, “Ever smell a dead body before?” I shook my head no. He said, “You’ll never forget it now.”

At that point we came into a clearing in the woods where the foul odor really ramped up. I've always had a strong stomach, but even this was excessive. I felt a ball form at the back of my throat. There were two people, one male, one female, both roughly college-aged and wearing similar, gray coats standing over what looked like long, low cages made of chicken wire. As we walked closer I could see dark forms in the cages like piles of trash. The girl looked over at us and nodded politely but the guy didn't bother. She was pretty and he looked like a bug. It wasn't until we were right on top of the cages that I realized what they held.

The first body I saw, in fact have ever seen, was a woman's. Her skin was impossibly waxy with large patches of discoloration, as if the wax had been burned. She looked like someone had sprinkled rice across her, like a new bride. Unfortunately, it wasn't rice. The maggots crawled on her legs and pooled in the crevices of her neck. Her surprisingly white teeth grinned up at me, exposed, and her belly was inflated like a birthday balloon. My mouth watered from the rising feel of vomit but I managed to keep it in check. It helped to not look at her creeping skin.

He introduced the two as Bernard and Terri, interns from the [name removed] Institute, and said there were two more wandering around somewhere, as well as the man in charge, a scientist by the name of Doctor Christianson. Terri could see I was bothered, so she was nice enough to finally explain what was going on. “We study human decomposition,” she said. The goal was to better understand the process in order to help, among other things, police determine more accurate times of death in a variety of settings.

I looked at the five or six other cages, which she explained were to keep birds away, and asked how many there were on the island. “It varies,” she said, “but it usually hovers somewhere around fifty.” 

Fifty dead bodies. One island. No boats.

They said some see-you-laters and then Eric led me around the rest of the island, first to point out some of the other body sites- more corpses, some caged, some not- and then to perform a perimeter around the shore. He said I'd have to do at least two such rounds during my shift, which I was already thinking about skipping. It took about forty-five minutes for us to circle back around to the dock, which I noticed was the only way onto or off of the island short of risking the waves crashing onto the sharp rocks and the ring of slimy garbage. By then the sun was starting to set. Then he took me inside the main research building which as I'd guessed had been converted from a sports center dating back some fifty years. We took a quick look around at the operation and I saw the back of someone's head inside one of the rooms, but other than that not much registered. I think by that time my head was spinning too fast for anymore information to get in.

We left the main building and went to the second building which served as the guard's office. Eric pointed out the bathroom, the lockers, the eating area with stocked fridge, the flashlights, the desk with the two-way radio, which he showed me how to use, though by then he was eyeing his watch. He gave me a grin and asked if I was all set. I shrugged, which was the most sincere answer I could give. 

“I'll be honest,” he told me, “most guys don't last long here. Especially the night shifters.”

“Thanks.”

“If you take out the mental part it's the easiest job in the world. But that mental part...” His voice trailed off, and I knew exactly what he meant. What could be easier than making sure a bunch of stiffs stayed dead? And yet with the sun going down I was filled completely with dread, the kind where you want to run and scream in no particular direction. Before I could articulate the thought, the sound of a docking boat rose up, and with a nod and a few more last-minute instructions about filling out the log book, he was gone. 

“Next boat's at three a.m.,” he shouted from across the lawn, which seemed like a pretty important detail to be leaving for the last second. Ahead of him were the two interns I'd met, Bernard and Terri, along with two others. Terri waved and I waved back, pretending to be unphased. On the boat already, aside from the old man operating it, was a man whose face I couldn't make out from a distance other than a beard. I assumed it was Doctor Christianson, though I had no way of knowing for sure.

After the boat chugged away and made a line for land, I looked around at the dimming island, inhabited by me and fifty rotting corpses, give or take, with the wind kicking up off the ocean, and wondered how I'd ended up that way. Just a month earlier I'd been sitting comfortably behind a desk in a warm bank. It was incredible how quickly life could shift beneath your feet.

I retreated back inside the guard's office and immediately decided to stay in it until the boat came to get me at three. I locked the door. Screw the promises, screw the temp agency, screw the Twain Island Forensic Anthropology Facility, I wasn't about to go stumbling around in the dark on an island full of dead people, caged or otherwise. There was no way anyone would know one way or the other whether I'd done my rounds or not, and I had a hard time believing that anyone would want to get onto the island, let alone be able to pull up to the dock and get past me without being heard. 

To pass the time I had the internet, thankfully, and that got me past the first few mindless hours. Before I knew it the clock over the door read twenty past nine o'clock. Outside it was pitch black, while inside it was way too quiet, so I pulled up some music videos and let them play in the background, a huge playlist of classic rock songs, as I opened a text file and thought of some story ideas I'd like to explore. Not surprisingly, most of them had to do with zombies coming to life and attacking the living. Nothing really stuck, though, and I began to have that familiar uneasy feeling that comes whenever I try to write alone. After a few minutes I stopped trying to fight it. I closed the file and then my eyes.

I'm not sure how long I was asleep. What I do know is what woke me up. With my eyes still closed I started to become aware of a sound under the music, the playlist still coming out of the computer's speaker, which was faint but getting louder. It was far off in the island, but I could make it out as clear as anything.

And I know it sounds crazy. I really know it does. But it was a woman crying.

When I realized this, my eyes shot open. I jumped out of the chair, grabbed my walkie-talkie and flashlight and ran out of the office, turning on the flashlight as I came around the building. I stopped for a second and shone the light into the forest, catching nothing but the trunks and leaves. For a second I wondered if I'd actually heard the cries or if I'd been half in a dream, the way light sleep messes with you, but then I heard a shout, definitely a woman's pitch, and I bolted into the woods. All I could think was some idiot had found their way onto the island, maybe even a group of idiots, thrill-seeking kids, and hurt themselves on my watch. I would have to carefully forge the log book to cover my ass on this one.

That already familiar stench came to my nose as I came into the first clearing. My flashlight picked up the metal of the cages. I stopped running. I remembered myself, where I was and why I had locked myself in the office. Those cages, just sitting there in the dark. Corpses staring up. Maggots and flies. The cries had stopped, which had me thinking either I was being pranked or much worse: I was too late to help whoever it had been.

I did what I swore I wouldn't, which was the job they'd hired me to do. With a major amount of hesitation I did my rounds. Either I would find the woman, I figured, or I could honestly tell the Doctor that I'd secured the island when they found a body in the morning. Another body, that is. A new one. As I walked the edge of the island I formed a joke in my head about how they could leave the dead woman where they found her and just add her to the guest list. The joke always ended with me saying, “You're welcome.”

I'll be honest, I didn't do a full perimeter, but I did do most of one. Other than half of a hollowed out horseshoe crab I didn't find anything, so I cut back toward the first clearing where I'd sworn the woman's cries had came from. I walked slowly in case I came across any more body sites, especially the uncaged kind, which I didn't want to stumble over in the dark despite the little yellow flags that marked them. The smell would probably warn me first, except for the really long-gone ones, the piles of bones which still stunk but not nearly as much. Needless to say, I was relieved when I reached the clearing.

The beam of my flashlight caught the top of the cages as I walked between them, using them as a guide back to the office without really focusing on them. For some reason I still don't understand, maybe because my eyes picked up something different in the dark, or maybe I felt a change in the air, I shone the light into the last cage, the first I'd seen a few hours earlier, where the bloated woman had grinned up at me.

My feet stopped. So did my heart. What my flashlight saw, what I saw, changed me forever. And I know it sounds crazy. I really know it does. But the cage was empty. 

I got in closer to get a better look, because there was no way what I was seeing was real, but I was horrified to find it was. The body was gone, the only thing left of it a long patch of dead grass, a puddle of half-dried fluids, and strips of what looked like leather but I knew wasn't leather. The cage around it was left exactly where I'd seen it. Only the body had disappeared.

As I stared down at the empty cage, my walkie-talkie crackled in my pocket. It made me jump a bit, the sudden noise in the night, and I fished it out of my pocket where I'd forgotten I put it during the perimeter sweep. But if the first sound made me jump, the second made my skin crawl worse than one of the corpses behind me.

A woman was whispering on the other end. I turned the volume up and pressed the speaker to my ear to hear better. The words were too low to make out, only the distinctly female tone, the same as the one who had called out from somewhere in the woods. Nervous, I brought the walkie-talkie to my mouth and pressed the button on the side.

“Hello? Who's there?” I tried to sound like I was in charge but it wasn't convincing. I let go of the button and brought the speaker back to my ear, straining to hear the whispers.

A laugh. A woman's laugh, high-pitched and delirious, came through the speaker. 

Instinct took over and I ran. I ran away from the cages and out of the clearing, into the woods and out of them again until I was running between the two buildings and back into the office, slammed the door shut and locked it. My pulse throbbed in my neck and I tried to catch myself with my hands on the desk, taking great, big breaths of air in.

Breaths of air. Stale air. Not just stale, but wretched. Sickly sweet and pungent, the smell of those bodies had somehow moved into the guard's office, even though none of the sites were anywhere near it, even with a strong wind to push the air around the island.

It was then, as I pushed myself up off the desk, that I thought again of the missing body. The woman's body. The woman's voice on the radio, the whispers and the laugh. It was then that I realized not just the air had gotten into the building. 

I looked at my hand- a smudge of something black was on my palm. There was a matching one on the table.

I also have some questions that might not be as straightforward to answer, but I can't help but ask: I got a B in my first Calc class, and it looks like I'm going to have a B in Calc II as well. How much does this affect my chances at admissions? I'm well aware at how selective the process is for CS and have begun to consider my other options, but I keep telling myself ""Your fine as long as you do better next quarter"" and it never happens... :|   Another thing I've been wondering is what type of things I can be doing now to strengthen my application when the time comes to apply.

I'm currently employed full time. I work in Brooklyn, 8am to 4pm as a data analyst.
Ideally, I'm seeking a position that would allow me to earn extra money while doing something I'm enthusiastic and passionate about. However, I'm willing to make some compromise if the situation seems right.  
I have advanced knowledge of Excel, intermediate level of SQL server. 
I have experience working with SSIS packages, data transformation, and data visualization. 
Software testing and QA have been part of my current job as well, I find this field interesting. Most of my QA experience has been manual testing, but I've been attending professional development courses, and well as sharpening my technical skills, to get more involved in automation testing.   
I can write advanced Excel functions, and create dynamic spreadsheets that are integrated with SQL tables.  

I have a Bachelor degree in Design and Digital media. 
I never had a job in this field, but occasionally have projects, personal or professional, that would keep my skills sharp. 
I'm proficient with visual design, typography,  and my Photoshop skills are up to par. 

I'm also a musician, my passion lies in the audio field. 
Engineering, sound design, composition, anything to do with music production interests me. (I can DJ any event, if that’s what you need) I had an internship at a recording studio in Park Slope during my college days. This was a great learning opportunity, but it never led to a job, so I had to look elsewhere for real employment.

I'm motivated, very organized, and have a hard work ethic.
My current living situation is changing and I need to find a side job which can help pay the bills.  

I'm willing to work in any of these areas mentioned. I'm very adaptable and resourceful. 
I'm available weekday evenings at around 5pm, and on weekends. 
Resume, work samples, or any other information available upon request. 
Thanks for your consideration.

I have my exit interview next Thursday and was looking for some advice. I feel pretty good about getting an offer. All my current and past teams have basically said I'll get one. I had my exit chat with the head recruiter last week and I mentioned I might be interested in transferring to the transaction advisory service line down the road.

The recruiter mentioned that the firm has a 3 year rotation program where you do audit for 9 months and advisory for 3. She said she couldn't guarantee anything, but that we could definitely talk about it more in a month.

Anyways, I'm so focused on landing a spot in this program. I'm meeting with a partner tomorrow to see if he knows anything about the program. I've worked with him on 2 engagements during my internship. My goal is to get as many people as possible to vouch/back me for this spot. So far I have established some great relationships and my reviews have been good so far.

Now for the exit interview.. So the partner is an alumni from my school. I've never met him, but he's apparently really nice. I've heard that the interview is pretty standard.. talk about the internship for a while, then he/she will extend you an offer. Now should I mention my interest in the program during the interview, or should I wait until if/when I accept my full-time offer?

Thanks everyone!"

Like I said in the title, my degree program is set up so I alternate semesters between full time classes and working a paid Computer Science/IT internship for about $22/hr until I graduate in 5 years. The $22/hr figure could grow each semester if I decide to stay with my employer (I plan to). If all goes well, I should earn enough money to pay off my student loans before I graduate, or if not close to it. 

I live at home during the semesters that I work so I have no rent during that time. I love my shoes (thanks /r/sneakers) but overall I'd say I'm pretty responsible with my money.

I remember in high school my AP Economics teacher would talk about how the earlier you invest, the better off you'll be in the long run. I asked my parents about it and they told me I shouldn't worry about investing yet, but they aren't exactly financial wizards.

So I ask you, /r/personalfinance, how should I approach my investing future?

2yd4na,158,2015-03-08,[M/s] Mom helps us get Pregnant,loving_wife,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/2yd4na/ms_mom_helps_us_get_pregnant/,"Ours might be one of the lucky few instances where a wife was more than accepting of her husband's incestuous past. 

Two years into our marriage, I revealed to her, everything that had happened between Mom and me. 

=====

About how our relationship escalated that winter, almost a decade ago. 

Mom’s wrist was injured, and I would help her dress. She needed me zipping her dresses up, helping her squeeze her pants and skirts up her hips. 
She seemed ok with me touching her bare skin. 
Sometimes she would have me clip her bra on, and I would feel the front of her breasts, pretending to straighten the strap.

When she continued asking for my help, long after her hand had healed, I took that as permission. While helping her dress, I would let my fingers roam about her soft inner thighs, even grazing the base of her panties a few times. This went on for weeks. 


I had to leave town for an internship; It was the hardest thing I’ve ever chosen to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

I would meet her next, at my cousin’s wedding. 
There was a lot of pent-up tension released in our long, lingering hug. Mom then revealed to me that I would be sharing her room at my Aunt's place.

After the wedding, back in our room, she shyly asked me to help with her evening gown. A long purple gown, with glittery lines along the front, the material was soft and almost see-through around her waist. 

I helped her zip the back of the gown up. A shy smile on her face, she then asked me to help with her garter belt and pantyhose.
I took my own sweet time urging the white thigh-length pantyhose up, feeling her soft moisturised legs. I noticed she had matching white lace panties on.

When it was time to fasten her garters, I parted her thighs further. I glanced at the front of her lace panties. I couldn’t see the shape of her pussy through the lacy material, but that didn’t stop me from looking again. 
While I worked on securing the belt, I let the front of my hand rest over her panties, softly nudging the area over her clit. 

&amp;nbsp;

Later that evening, we danced together, along with a dozen other couples around us. I believe we both had a few glasses of wine in us by then.

I wasn’t much of a dancer, but Mom was doing the leading. Her hands caressed my back, while her hips grazed my erect cock each time she swayed from side to side. She moved her right leg forward, placing us at an angle, attempting to hide my erection from the crowd by our side. 
When I was about to come, I held her hips tight, signalling her to stop. She obliged, smiling like she understood. We just stood there, her forehead resting on my chest, me smelling her gorgeous auburn hair, her hands wrapped around my neck. She continued this cycle of grinding my erection with her hips, swaying, pausing when I motioned her to stop. 

I’m not entirely sure how my mind stayed intact that evening. 

It was early in the morning when the party finally wound down.  

&amp;nbsp;

We stumbled into the bedroom, holding hands like a couple would. I could barely walk.
My mind was too tired for rational reasoning, and I bet Mom's was in a similar state. 

Its a shame much of the details are a blur. I remember asking if she needed help with her garter. I remember Mom locking the door.  

I remember her seated on the dressing table, her gown lifted all the way up, bunched around her waist. My tongue lapping on her steaming drenched pussy lips, her wetness smudged all over my face. I remember trying to stick my long tongue all the way inside her pussy, wiggling it, her fingers pinching my ears.
She was biting on some piece of clothing, muffling her moans. There were guests in the room nearby.

&amp;nbsp;

More hazy now. I remember at one point she had a white wedding veil on her head, and just her white lace bra on while I pounded her hard against the wall, holding her butt from under, her arms grabbing onto my shoulders. It was probably the first time I was fucking someone without a condom, and it was my Mother. 

I remember her hair all messy, both of us completely naked, drenched in sweat. My cock moving in and out of her ever-so-slowly, as I fucked her from behind, Mom on all fours on the bed. She bit my finger at some point. I bet our moans were audible from the next room; we were too lost to care. 

I remember grabbing her neck from behind, squeezing it tight, her neck and back arched up, while I came in her ass. Actually, I’m not even sure I came that night. I do remember crashing onto Mom’s body, a pool of sweat and pungent sex all over. Last thought I remember, my cock was hard and still deep in her asshole when I fell asleep.

The awkwardness the next morning at breakfast, I remember clearly. Mom and I barely spoke for the next month or so. 


=====

I moved back to town after a while. Mom was shifting to another apartment and I offered to help. 

Eventually, she became her playful self again. Inviting me to help her dress occasionally. It was like we had erased our memory of that night.

&amp;nbsp;

Then one evening she stayed over at my place. She asked me to lie beside her instead of the couch. She was naked under the sheets. She spooned against my body, and I felt her naked belly and warm thighs with my fingers, before we slept. 

This became a routine of sorts. Every Friday she’d stay over at my place. Eventually we were both sleeping naked. She didn’t seem to mind my cock pressing against her, my precum oozing over the back of her thighs. 

I guess I didn't want to ruin what we had by pushing further. Weeks later, as if she'd sensed my hesitation, she would place my hand over her breast, never turning to face me. I caressed her lovely breasts and rolled her hard nipples for what felt like hours.

&amp;nbsp;

A few Fridays after, while we were spooning, Mom led my hands to her shaved, tender pussy. I toyed with her clit softly, nibbling her neck while she came, her legs trembling.
The next time, she guided my middle finger into her wet opening, parting her lips slightly. While she came, I had four of my fingers deep in her creamy slit, my thumb pressed against her throbbing clit. 

Mom never touched with my cock with her hands. I wished she would, but it never happened. 

Mom stopped coming over. During our conversations, she seemed burdened by something. I would later learn that she got engaged a few weeks after she'd last visited me.

She wouldn’t entertain my attempts to bring it up. 

Months later she married my step father. Things were back to normal between Mom and me. Almost like nothing had ever happened. 

I got married a few years later. 

=====

Our lives took quite the turn when my loving wife, Nina, the perfect daughter-in-law (who was also my Mother’s student at the time) got me to rekindle my romantic relationship with Mom, who was 48 at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

She was like a friend to Mom. They would often go shopping together, chat for hours over coffee. Nina seeded the idea over a couple of months. 

I’ve no idea how she convinced Mom. We were trying to get pregnant for a while; perhaps that squeezed into her reasoning. 

Mom had agreed to meet with me, alone, and discuss the past over dinner. 

That evening, she finally opened up about the feelings she’d bottled up all these years. 
The true surprise of the evening came when I learned about the conditions Nina had firmly set for Mom.

I've decided to go through with plans to move from NC, and *might* be coming along with a friend to split rent.  A little background info: I'm 23, gay, BFA in Creative Writing, will be (hopefully) retaining my work-from-home ESL position (~13/hr) when I arrive. I will also be searching for a writing job or some internship in the area. 

* What areas offer the most affordable housing?
*  Are there any areas to avoid living in, if possible?
* I read that the trolly is actually terrible. It looks so cute, though. Do you use it?
*  Most apartments seem to have no parking, it's all along the side of the road. How hard is it to find somewhere to park? Is there a lot of car towing? haha.
* What did you wish you knew *before* you moved to San Diego? 
* I have a big dog (Standard Poodle). It looks like almost no housing will realistically accommodate him. My parents have a big house/yard here, so that's plan B. But how far out of San Diego should I look, if I wanted to find a place that allowed bigger dogs?
* Best events/activities to make new friends? 

Right now, everything's flexible. I'm fine with living in a shoebox studio apartment as long as it has a stove. I like cooking, and probably wouldn't be able to afford eating out anyway. 

My ideal is to live somewhat close to the water or balboa park because I could see myself visiting either a lot, but I'm also curious about Hillcrest because I hear it's the lgbt hub. 

I plan to visit before making the bigger choices, but I just wanted to go ahead and get some opinions about where I should be focusing my attention. 

Thanks :)"

It's a great city, but I would really like to intern at their headquarters in New York City. I am considering moving to NYC after I graduate so it would be great to experience the city for a summer.

How do I mention to HR how I want to relocate? I do not want to seem unappreciative because I assume they would want me to do the internship in the city I interviewed in. I was thinking of mentioning how I would like to be closer to family (I live in Boston), but thought that would sound weird. How should I approach this?"

She started working at the office about 2 months ago but has been absent a lot due to the sheer amount of workload she has this semester (something along the lines of 18 credit hours as a Computer Engineer Major), so I haven't worked with her as much as one would expect working together for 2 months (she and I are on the same assignment/project with adjacent cubicles).

She'll be at the office a lot more this week and I figured if I'm going to do this at all, now would be the time. I understand 18 credits is a lot for anyone in a single semester and as a Computer Engineer major it is a bottomless time vacuum, but I would go into this relationship willing to adjust my time however necessary.

2yda65,19,2015-03-08,How do I undo effects of being emotionally neglected as a child?,invisibledenizen,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2yda65/how_do_i_undo_effects_of_being_emotionally/,"I was mostly neglected as a child, if I was paid attention to, it was so that my mom could scream at me or say things children shouldn't hear. She told me that she wanted to die and that she didn't know what to do with my brother when I was in elementary school. I still remember how anxious and worried all this made me, now I constantly feel vague anxiety. I felt very hopeless; perhaps I have learned helplessness from this? I don't think she was emotionally stable. She yelled at my brother almost every day over the smallest things ,and would get...panic attacks or the equivalent. She would have trouble breathing and she would say that she was dying. One time when I was 7 she started screaming at my brother with me in the car, and she threatened to crash it into the brick wall of a gas station. I don't even remember why. I never saw my dad much. He only started paying attention to me when I started getting accepted to good colleges, so he could brag.
All the attention was on my brother, who did poorly in school, didn't have friends, and overall had many problems. I always felt like I was in the margins, and was invisible most of the time. I did try my best in high school though, without any emotional support. The only thing my mom really did for me was buy me necessities and sometimes money, and make me food. She has a huge garden so I suspect she feels as if she has failed raising my brother and I.

I'm saying all this because I think that this is where all my problems stem from.
I constantly feel like people look down at me and treat me differently. I don't have any confidence and I feel like I am being judged every time someone is nearby. I don't feel comfortable unless I am alone, or in a huge crowd of strangers. Most of my friends in HS didn't treat me well, never remembered my birthday, called/messaged me first, included me only 20% of the time. They didn't respect me, I wish I knew why.

I tried my best in high school and finally got away from my family. Now, I'm a freshman at college in one of the greatest cities in the world and there are so many opportunities for me. However, I find myself unable to make stable friendships or relationships with anyone. I'm always sad and I feel like I have a lot of potential but I can't reach it. There are so many opportunities like studying abroad and great internships but I apathetically watch them all slip by. There is so much that I can do but I find myself using all my energy just waking up and doing normal things like dressing myself. I have no energy to talk to people, even though I am extremely lonely.

I want to change but I don't know how to. How can I start to change and mend old wounds so I can think and function like an average human? The free counselors at school don't help much, but I'm on a scholarship and can't afford anything else.

If you read all this, thank you so much. It really means a lot to know that someone finally knows.

2ydi2f,3,2015-03-08,"Me [26M] with my Exclusive-But-Not-""Dating""[23F], 3 mo., Dissed...But In a Weird Way",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ydi2f/me_26m_with_my_exclusivebutnotdating23f_3_mo/,"/r/relationships,

So bear with me here. Been a minute since I've dealt with this sort of quandary re: the fairer sex and I'm trying to work my thoughts through.

Background on self: 26M, released back into the wild in May. Have not really dated since then, not because of an aversion, but more just had bad interactions in that span. I also tend to be both very direct and emotionally subdued, which will become relevant later. 

I (have recently been) a Tinder user, although I'm not promiscuous and I do not utilize it in a ""hook-up"" sense - usually talk to a woman, if I like her take it to a personal interaction, if not, happy trails. 

**Meat and Potatoes**: Met woman, 23F bisexual, on Tinder in late October. Very cool, make plans to hang out that weekend. We do so, I like this girl a lot. She is in town looking for an apartment in anticipation of a New Year move. So we agree to stay in contact, and then keep seeing each other once she heads to my neck of the woods.

There is a significant text message correspondence during this time, which I'm okay with - the tenor of these conversations establishes that we will have at least a sexual relationship, and take it from there otherwise. I am ok with all of this.

Come NY, and all proceeds as planned. Interest seems equal on both sides, interaction takes place between 2-3x a week, split pretty evenly between my place and hers. I like this girl very much, and am enjoying her company immensely. According to her repeated statements, I am an excellent sexual partner. It is a welcome change. 

During this time, a recurring joke develops wherein we each term the other ""slampiece"" (a term frat boys utilize to denote the women they keep around for sex) - apparently this is how she refers to me to her friends, and how my sister (who lives in the same town) asks about her. However, our interactions are not strictly sexual, and there are other things peppered in (although sexual intercourse always results) - cooking (mostly me for her, I like to cook and show off the results, and also I lost a bet), talking shop (we are both stand-ups), etc. 

Come February, the tenor seems to change a little - one Saturday morning early in February as we were both leaving her house she said ""Inigo_Jones, you could meet L!"" (her best friend) since we were taking the same train, and I declined - purely because I reeked of vagina and didn't want to meet the best friend of a woman I was seeing in such a state. (At least not the first time.) 

The curveballs keep coming around this time, which make it unclear to me what, if anything, this woman is looking for. Some of the more relevant ones are listed below:

* She keeps saying things like ""You like me. You think I'm a cool chick."" (I usually just chuckle at this.)
* ""I kept your attention for two months."" (Said in a bragging way.)
* ""I'm *very* happy with our arrangement [consistent sex]."" (Said so earnestly it almost seemed forced.)
* ""Are you still on Tinder?"" (Asked once, in a sneaky way. I replied no, I wasn't - which was true.)
* Week after: ""Tinder date?"" (when I mentioned a place I had taken her on a date, to which I had gone that night with my brother-in-law.) 
* When she tells me a story about a coworker (F) who is going to have an MFF threesome with her boyfriend and another girl, and I reply ""What an awesome girlfriend"": ""[mock offended] Shut up, Inigo.""
* Made very clear more than once: ""I don't see more than one person at a time.""

She also grows more distant during this span - less female-initiated contact, interaction goes from 2-3x/week to maybe 1x (even when initiated by me). I think little of it, as she has an internship during the day and a second job at night - when we do hang out, it is as fun as ever. 

At end of February, she leaves our state to visit family in her home state, and goes almost entirely no-contact during this time, so I know something weird is going on. She snapchats me some cat videos (her cat lives in her home state), but that's it.

The following Monday this text message exchange ensues:

23F: Hey Inigo! I hope you and your cat had a good weekend. While I was home I had a lot of time to think and I feel that I should be honest with you...I've been developing feelings for someone else and I don't feel right having a physical relationship with one person while I try to figure out my feelings for another. I also don't think it's fair to you.

 And I have thought really hard about this because trust me I know what I am giving up if it blows up in my face...besides the awesome physical part you're smart and funny and really fun to talk to and hang out with which is why if you'd want to be friends I would like that but I knew from the beginning that this probably wasn't headed that direction, so I understand if you don't.

Anyways, I'm sorry to just kind of spring this on you, I just wanted to be honest and you don't have to respond if you don't want to but I hope there are no hard feelings. 

IJ: Ok.

23F: You can say more than that, even if it's not nice.

IJ: You should have informed me of this sooner, and not via text message.

23F: I honestly didn't know how to do it, for some reason I saw you getting more mad in person. I also literally have no idea the next time I would be free to see you. But you're right, I'm sorry.

IJ: OK.

23F: Inigo I really am sorry, I've loved getting to know you and I like you a lot which is why I wanted to be honest. You are just a little hard to read so I wasn't sure the best way to say anything and I am realizing now that this wasn't it and I apologize.  

I never replied to that last.

So from the sound of that interaction, it's pretty unequivocal - girl likes somebody else. I don't initially feel any hurt, simply anger - if this woman likes me enough to fuck me for almost three months, she likes me enough to tell me she doesn't want to see me anymore to my face. However, come the weekend and my mind is all kinds of fucked up - I miss her very much, and I feel a great deal of emotional pain. Keep running through the whole ordeal in my mind. 

**So /r/relationships, my questions are these:**

* **Is anything in this scenario salvageable? As I said, I liked this woman very much, a rare feeling for me. I wanted to see where this would lead.**
* **Could somebody break down the womanese in that set of texts? A lot of it sounds like trying to let a guy down easy, but I really can't tell.**
* **Was this woman looking for more and waiting for me to pull the trigger? Many of her stated feelings prior to this interaction would indicate yes, but her texts obviously say the opposite.**


   
**tl;dr**: Redditor gets let off the hook in a semi-dating situation which he enjoyed immensely, after numerous indications of further romantic interest from a woman he is seeing. Doesn't understand how this game works, seeks counsel. 

All advice appreciated, /r/relationships. This whole debacle is fucking me up much more than I would like. 

**UPDATE: /u/Inigo_Jones arranges meeting w/ 23F, is honest. 23F says, ""Oh, I didn't ever feel that way, I don't think I was ever unclear. I was just having fun."" /u/Inigo_Jones thanks 23F for her honesty, says ""Bye, Felicia"", and punches things on his walk home, because pain.**

**Thank you for the perspective. This matter has concluded.**"
2ydqst,22,2015-03-08,Nmom and my move - last torment before freedom,fecal_festivity,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2ydqst/nmom_and_my_move_last_torment_before_freedom/,"Hey there, this is my first post. Please don't be irritated by my username, I chose a fun name mainly for other subreddits. Also, I wanted to mention that you all are great! :)

Anyway, this week I finally moved out of my parents' home. Since my new apartment is quite small, I managed to make the move with my Nmom and grandma only. Currently I am waiting for the bed to be delivered so that I can move in completely.

I was more surprised by the fact that they even helped me than by their behavior during/afterwards.
At first, they started to complain about my shitty friends and boyfriend because none of them ""was willing to help me"". Yeah, see, not everybody is retired or on vacation just because you are. In fact, over here we have semester break right now but my friends from university (and my bf) are doing internships at the moment and the rest is working/going to school anyway. So, to make it worse I didn't get any chance to speak or do something, they just went on and did everything on their own because ""you can't do this, just let the adults do it"" and ""believe me, I am experienced, it's bad how you want it"". Followed by the grand finale: Nmom totally bursts out about how bad of a person I am because I did nothing on my own and my poor old granny and her poor overworked self had to do everything. She didn't have the chance to enjoy her vacation just because of me. Classic. Doing something without being asked for it and then complaining about it.

I told her many times that I'm grateful but want to have a say in this whole thing as well because it's my apartment and I'll have to live in it. She started crying after that every time because ""I just want the best for you"" and ""I know you can't make it, so I have to do it"".
She also allied with my grandma and started yelling at me when I got angry about them bashing my friends and bf because ""I should be grateful instead of being nasty"". 

Bonus: Grandma and Nmom fighting over stupid shit like ""wtf are you doing, you are going to drop this"" or ""you placed this thing 2 cm too close"" or ""stop standing there, you are distracting me with your presence"" or ""go away, you do everything the wrong way, I'm going to do this"".

More bonus: Went to the furniture shop together. I just needed a new bed, so I skipped the first two departments only to find myself standing there alone because Nmom &amp; grandma were busy having a look at a few couches since ""these would fit perfectly into our living rooms"". Keep in mind, in the last years they never wanted to buy a new couch, were never even a slightly bit interested in it and not in need of a new one. Same thing with washers, lamps, wardrobes etc. Classic again. Everything has to be about the Narc. 

Even more bonus: 5 minutes ago, drunk Nmom yelling at my dad ""why are you on her side?! - No, I'm not going to stop yelling, she's a piece of shit! You know what will happen? Her apartment will be full of crap. - I'm not talking shit, just imagine this future shithole! People will come and laugh at her and then they will laugh at me because everything falls back on the mom."" Classic as well. Pretending to be worried about another person but in fact just being worried about their own ass (for ridiculous reasons).

But however, I'm sitting here smiling because I know that I will be able to start a new life soon. I have wonderful friends and a loving bf, my life will change completely and I know I can make it awesome from now on! Whereas they will be stuck forever in their vicious circles they call their lifes created and enabled by their own toxic behavior. That's the price they pay for closing their eyes to their own faults. Unfortunately, they have to realise this fact themselves.


Edit: Thanks for all the replies. It's pretty relieving to hear encouraging words instead of the usual ""but it's your family, they love you and so should you"" when talking to others.

So I've been wanting to create a custom case for a while now. This summer while I was working at an internship. The actual process of building the case took a long time due to needing access to some tools via friends. I absolutely could not have done it without the two of them though, so I hope they know how much I appreciate the help!


Onto the actual design decisions, I wanted to create a case that offered something no other case on the market could offer. 

* Minimal footprint
* Vertical airflow (even though natural convection is far less effective than the forced convection of fans the idea is still appealing
* Clean look and related to the Marvel theme I've been developing on this side of the room. Venom is one of the coolest villains and the color palette works really well for a simple look.
* Maximum airflow for minimal noise. The whole case is designed to work with no additional fans with direct access to airflow for the GPU, CPU and the power supply.

I've had a couple of successful internships, and have much better business knowledge, soft skills, and practical programming skills, than the majority of CS students. I work specifically in the mobile web sector, and have taken on a fair amount of freelance work in addition to the internships.


**Goals:** Take a year off of school to work as a software engineer so that I can gain more experience, money, and connections. These things are specifically what I need to focus on to maximize the chance of being in a position to start a successful tech company within the next few years.

**Situation:** I fear that obtaining a full-time junior role will not be possible. Having a salaried junior role would mean I'd earn more than a co-op or intern, but it'd also means a longer term commitment is expected. I don't want to lie about my intentions to secure a long-term position, but at the same time, my primary goal is not school, but to position myself for success for any future companies I may start. There is a good chance that I'd stay at the company for longer than a year, and go straight to my own venture.

**Question:** If I'm *planning* on taking 1 year off of school to work, should I be trying to obtain a salaried junior-level position? Will it be necessary to acknowledge the fact I plan on returning to school, or can state that I'm moving on from school to start my career early? "

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2ye73w,7,2015-03-08,Me [22M] with my ex-girlfriend [20F] together for 4 years and have now been apart for 1 year. I miss her so much.,ayearinthedark,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ye73w/me_22m_with_my_exgirlfriend_20f_together_for_4/,"I dated this girl when I was a senior in high school. She and I got along SO well. I've never met another soul whom I connect with so well. It's as if this girl is a female version of myself.

I broke up with her about a year ago. I did it because I was very depressed. University had me feeling very much in the dark. I also noticed that I was beginning to notice other women. It was at this time that I decided I needed to end the relationship (maturely, of course). I broke this girl's heart. It was very upsetting for me and I could not help but feel guilty for causing so much emotional pain. While I did not want to hurt her feelings, it would not have been fair to continue the relationship if I felt that I was not entirely devoted to it.

A huge reason for my depression was the fact that I was entering my 4th year in university and still had not obtained a single internship or a co-op for the summer (or any summers throughout college). I still had a resume (or CV, for some) of a high school student. My GPA was average and I felt that I was very under-qualified for any position that I would try and pursue. I felt stuck and hopeless.

Well... a couple of months later, I finally landed a summer internship with an international company. I did very well at this job and exceeded very quickly. I saved the company tens of thousands of dollars in the short duration that I was there for the summer and also earned an award because of my work. I was given an offer for a full-time position upon graduation.

Things were looking better for me. The depression seemed to fade; I was feeling more motivated than I had ever felt before. 

It was at this point that I realized I had made a mistake. I didn't know if my depression was from feeling isolated in a relationship (this was my longest relationship, and after being in one for this long, I began to wonder if I was missing out on experiencing close connections with other women my age). I had followed the saying ""When in doubt, choose change."" So that's what I did. I ended the relationship and worked on myself for a while.

Fast forward a bit: I put in a lot of work (into my career, as well as my fitness). I received the satisfaction of having accomplished so much for myself. The depression faded. I wasn't depressed from being isolated in the relationship, I was depressed because I felt I wasn't going anywhere in life.


I miss this woman more than anything. I've dated other women - beautiful women - but nothing will ever compare to the connection I shared with my high school sweetheart.

We talk every now and then, but it's mostly small talk. I've talked to her a few months back about potentially getting back together, and she claims she doesn't know what she wants. I completely understand that. She hasn't experienced much on her own yet. My guess is that she's curious to see what else is out there, as she hasn't had the opportunity to experience any of that (having been in a relationship for the the majority of high school and all of her college career up until the breakup).

It was my birthday a couple weeks ago (and hers a couple weeks before mine). We exchanged birthday wishes and talked a bit about how we spent our birthdays. It turns out we were both extremely busy and didn't really get to celebrate either of ours. I suggested that we go out for a belated birthday dinner, to which she agreed. That is this coming Saturday.

I don't know how I should go about this. Do I take her to our favorite place? Or is that to reminiscent of the past? I take her to a new place because I'm after a new experience (and a clean slate, you could say) right? I have so much to say to this girl. I would pour my heart out to her if I didn't know any better. But I know that that might do more damage than it would help. Do I withhold sharing my feelings with her and just have a casual date in which we can both enjoy ourselves comfortably? Or do I bring up how I've been feeling. This is all a giant game of chess, and I do not want to fuck this up. I love this girl more than anything, and each day without her is another day I spend with a piece of my heart missing.

**tl;dr**: Dated a girl since high school and partially through college. Absolutely fell in love with this girl. Broke up with her because I felt I wasn't going anywhere in life. Worked on myself for a little while; achieved great success, but now I wish I had never broken up with her, as I am still very much in love. We have dinner plans this Saturday. Do I refrain from sharing how I REALLY feel and instead just enjoy a nice evening with her? Or do I bring up the situation that is present in this post?"
2yedr5,2,2015-03-08,Life is mildly exploding (but in a boring white-collar way),techieforhelp,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yedr5/life_is_mildly_exploding_but_in_a_boring/,"I feel almost bad asking for help because really Im not in bad straights...but I'm so mentally lost right now I feel I'm at the edge of simply exploding. 

I have a good Masters program on my resume in interaction ux etc. (computer design) and worked for one of those shiny companies as an intern (apple/microsoft/twitter/facebook etc. trying to be anonymous so I won't say which one) 

I've been working for almost 2 years at a good but slightly less shiny company. In the last year things have gotten pretty bad. I'm still producing good work but my manager's incompetancy has left me so distraught I'm nearly comatose when I get home from depression. 

Recently things happened where I might be fired. I should fight it I think it is based on false perceptions the manager has put forth...but really I just dont' want to be here anymore. 

I came close to a good job out in SF but came in close but not quite....and came close to another at another shiny company but once again, close but not quite. 



The fact I keep coming close but not quite is getting to me. And the firing may happen fairly soon. My sense of self is very related to doing good work....people ask what my goals in life are but really my career is might top priority? So the fact this manager has left me feelign lost for so long...


Basically I should be able to get a good job. But I'm just feeling incredibly lost...I keep on applying to jobs but I don't know what I'll do if I'm fired. My family is all in areas where I wouldn't be able to find work. I'm sure if I can get to SF/NY/Seattle I can find a good UX/Design/Tech job but I don't know how to afford that first step...part of that is my fault I've been trying to pay off my student loans quickly rather than saving (I honestly didn't expect this firing, I thought I was safe for a few years). 


TLDR: I'm sure I can get a job in SF if I can get there, I have a good resume, but my current job has left me so depressed I worry I'm coming off badly in communications. 

Sorta second...part of this problem is that I've walled myself in. If I can escape this explosion and get to a next step, how do I not end up alone again? Right now I'm making 85k but feel more alone than when I was jobless out of undergrad. "

Currently on an internship on the other side of the country +1000 miles away from my few friends and father. 

My only friend here was hit by a car a while ago and has been unable to take care of himself. Its been over a month and he won't be walking for at least 2 more months. He is from another country and so I was at the hospital doing everything I can every day for the first few weeks until his mother could get here. She gets here and has no drivers license so I have been a taxi for her. She does not understand American culture and frequently gets mad about it and takes anger out on me yelling that I need to fix it. Only reason I am still around is because he is my friend. That and I have been the messenger for the university, company that gave us both the internship, and all of his friends asking about him.

His father was murdered two weeks ago. I have been at his place almost 24/7 because mother can no longer care for him properly due to emotional state. He calls me at all hours of the day/night.

Internship is basically a full time job +40 hour work week. Trying to balance internship, sleep, life, friends life and failing. 

Last week I was placed on suspension from internship due to small knife. My grandfathers knife that he gave to me before he passed away several months ago. He was a huge part of my life. Lost knife in process.

Called boyfriend upset and phone is answered unintentionally by him while he is sleeping with another woman. 

Just feel lost. And very depressed. This past week I have slept a total of 12 hours. And I have only been able to eat once and that was some plain unseasoned ground beef with rice (a cups worth). Each day it's getting worse. I've lost 12 pounds this past month. (I used to be 125). 

I feel like I have nobody to talk to, and because of my job and cannot see a counselor or I risk being considered ""unqualified"" to do it.

I dont know, I feel like just typing this out on here is better than nothing."

2yenxa,13,2015-03-08,"Ireland &gt; US - [M29] Finishing Computer Science PhD in 18 months, want to move to Bay Area if I get a junior/starting Robotic Engineer position.",majesticphalanges,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2yenxa/ireland_us_m29_finishing_computer_science_phd_in/,"Hi,

I'm a single 29 year old Irish male, with a degree in computer science, advanced degrees in robotics &amp; space science, and I'm currently doing a PhD in computer science. I've done internships at the European Space Agency and NASA JPL. I will be submitting my thesis September 2016, then performing my defence before Christmas. I am really tired of Ireland, it has no job opportunities in my field and there are a couple of startups in the Bay Area that have gotten my attention.

The broad strokes, I want to live in the US, work in robotics companies, build experience, if I work hard enough and with a bit of luck, start my own company. I will need to get a job with a company before leaving, they will vouch for me, and I can get a work visa for a year, if I have read the rules correctly.

Questions:

* How many months/weeks do companies give if someone is moving from abroad before starting the position?
* How many months before September 2016 should I be applying for positions?
* After getting a position, how long does it take to get a work visa?
* Then, after how many years would I be in a position to apply for citizenship?
* What income tax will I be paying (~$65,000 starting salary)?
* Are there additional taxes that I would be paying?

I know that the cost of accommodation in the Bay Area is insane. I've been living the student lifestyle for long enough, but it is OK if I have to settle for something similar in the Bay Area for a while.

Questions:

* What online services are routinely used for searching for accommodation?
* How much cash I should set aside for first month's rent and security deposit?
* Are there any other charges that I should be considering?
* Will I have to get a place with roommates?
* Are there cities I should avoid due to the crime rate?
* What commute time should I be looking to hit?

Finally, what are the cold hard realities of this decision?"

I've been pondering and decided there are two options: 

**(1) Go three semesters in a row.  Graduate May 2016.**  Summer, Fall, and Spring semesters all back to back.  I would graduate quickly but the tradeoff is that I don't have any internships or work experience so I would be trying to either get an internship after college and job hunting with zero experience.  

**(2) Take summer off.  I haven't been able to land an internship so work at a crappy job over the summer.  Go Fall, Spring, and then Fall 2016.  Land an internship Summer 2016.  Graduate December 2016.**  The advantage of this is I feel if I did this I would have a better resume/portfolio when I got job hunting.  I could have an internship which would demonstrate experience.  The tradeoff is graduating 7 months later could be worth thousands of dollars if I could theoretically land a job earlier without delaying.  

**I need your advice reddit.  Should I graduate faster or should I go slower for the possibility of landing a summer internship?  Any and all advice is welcome.**"
2yeupk,2,2015-03-09,I am a fresh graduate with a Network Security Degree. Is there any other job in IT besides help desk that can suite me?,skippy647,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2yeupk/i_am_a_fresh_graduate_with_a_network_security/,"I went to a community college for 2 years and couldn't really find anything that really interested me. My interests mostly followed electronics, computers... That type of stuff. I transferred from the community college to ECPI University (a technical college) and just recently graduated with a Bachelors in Network Security. YAY!

As part of schooling in ECPI, we are required to participate in an internship. I did so and my job was ""Help Desk Support"". I absolutely hated it. Whenever my parents bug me with the electronics, I get frustrated but, with actual customers, it started destroying me. I know that if I work somewhere long enough as Help Desk support, I may be promoted but, promoted into what. I can't decide if I REALLY wanna do that.

I still love electronics and computers. I am A+ certified, Network + Certified, and am working on getting Security + certified.
Unfortunately, it feels like the only thing available to me is Help Desk position jobs. I have an interview this Tuesday with a company for this type of position.

Is there anything else out there that could suite me?"

I recently started working at a new company. This happened about a month into the job or so. It was an internship at an engineering firm, and I was loving it. I would perform my work well. A little too well. I began finishing everything my boss assigned me with (at the time, my responsibilities were very dependant on what was going on that day) faster than they anticipated the work would take. This led to me being assigned more responsibilities, which entailed me working with more different coworkers.

One of my coworkers was giving me the run down on how to file certain paperwork. I had been thrown a bunch of different tasks that day and was ordered to come speak to this coworker and help her with whatever work she had for me. At that point I was just wanting to begin working again. I had a lot on my plate that needed to get done.

It's important to know at this point the coworker was assigning me work that she normally does, but she couldn't do since she was flying overseas. Her mother wasn't doing too well so she was going to visit her.

My coworker was making small talk with me, and I guess I was kind of spaced out only thinking about finishing all the work I had to do. I was only half paying attention to the conversation. I'd pick up key words and answer with an appropriate response.

I had been reading the paperwork she handed me when she began her next sentence. All I caught was ""... and my dad took my mom ..."" and I replied with ""oh that's sweet of him"". I assumed what I didn't hear at the end of the sentence was that he was taking her out somewhere so I complemented him. She finished explaining to me what I needed to do and I went on my way.

Fast forward a couple weeks, she's still overseas and I've been filing the documents. I overheard a couple coworkers talking about the whole situation and overheard something about her dad having passed away years ago.

Then it hit me.

When she said ""my dad took my mom"", she was implying that her mom passed away.

I didn't think about it at the time cause I hadn't known about the whereabouts of her father.

I don't know if she noticed but I feel awful for saying it almost immediately after she ended that sentence.

TL;DR Complemented my coworker's mother passing away"

2yf86f,9,2015-03-09,Best way to work through negative associations with fitness?,[deleted],xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/2yf86f/best_way_to_work_through_negative_associations/,"This post is as much of a vent as it is a fitness relevant: my goal is to reach the shape I once maintained, but in a healthy way.     Frankly, I'm part scared to get back into old habits, and part exhausted when I think back to the effort I once demanded of myself. I'm also plagued with an aimless sense of, 'What's the point?' thanks to an experience I'll sort of share. But despite the heavy feeling, I do have a willful knowing that I don't want to be the chick in the bathrobe at grocery store. Ha, AKA, 'She's definitely given up on life...' And I don't know where to begin new training without slipping back into the so-called discipline I once unhappily demanded of myself.   
Background: I've always had body issues. (""Classic."" Ha, and a sense of humor about them, sometimes... sometimes.) Three years ago I leaned on those issues for the worse and got serious about getting in shape. I was starting a summer internship, and I'd just been accepted into the school of my dreams. I wanted my physical discipline to match my mental aptitude, as I believed in myself, and wanted for great things. I ran about 2.5 miles daily, practiced yoga three times a week, and ate what I now believe to be a less than healthy vegan diet. Lara bars, leafy greens, dried fruit... And lots of coffee. At 5'6"" I was 112 pounds, which may be acceptable in some cases, but I wasn't doing anything right. I was tired all the time, and depressed, and anxious due to the amount of coffee I was intaking. I felt like I looked the social ""best"" I had in years... But I wasn't happy internally. Worse, I'd decided to give someone a chance (context here) I shouldn't have (he wasn't good for me, and a very negative person who talked about himself a lot... which just increased my insecurities. i.e. Once, post-intimate moment he put his own band's music on and sighed about how great it was. I was quietly weirded out... but also strangely insecure that I didn't have a project to show for like that), likely because of my vanity/insecurity/need for validation about my newly toned body. (Very dumb. It's one of those motivations you look back at and shake your head embarrassed about, refusing to believe you were so stupid.) The whole thing went south quickly for many reasons, a major one being I didn't value myself and was a total basket case. I'm pretty sure my poor diet was messing with me emotionally as I've never exhibited behavior as erratic as I did when I was with this person. In less than a month it was the worst relationship I'd ever experienced and it put me in such a low place. I ended the experience feeling worthless and began what should have been the most awesome semester ever at my dream school. Instead, I didn't want to live.         
I somehow sulked through it, and over the past few years I've been learning to let go: of the person, of my emotional issues, and the negative behavior and that led me to such a dark place. And so, the positive part: now that I'm feeling stronger and value myself again, I'd like to give it another go fitness-wise. Fitness has always made me feel great and 'empowered.' But I now have so many negative associations with working out. For instance, I constantly think, 'If I looked my best and was still rejected what's the point?' Part of me knows that's crap, but it's hard to ignore having experienced rejection looking like, what you thought was, great. It's stupid, but hard to shake my despondency about it. CW: I am now a regulated 125 +/- which is, weightwise, okay, I guess, but I'm not at top shape. And by regulated, I mean I'm rightly scared to be hungry, as that is part of the thing I believe caused me to act out (for example, sending unreasonable texts and emails, when I'm generally a sharp, easy person.) I'll snack, which I didn't allow myself to do before, to stave off any encroaching hunger. But I don't believe that's contributing to my overall health. I need a more nutritional meal plan. Protein powder, perhaps? And basically when I'm about to go for a run, the stops come out: 'No. Remember what happened last time?' I warn, and end up sitting on my ass when I could be out working my muscles and getting fresh air.     
I'm sure suggestions to my 'health' aversion are things I can google, or tell myself, but I guess I'm seeking community, here. It's always (as, clearly I have aforementioned human issues and do seek validation) nice to hear the strength of another's voice and shared experiences.    
**TL;DR: My body issues drove me to workout too hard and have an emotional breakdown. I've spent time healing and now would like to get fit again. How do I get over my negative associations and get fit in a healthy way?**    
Thank you for your time."

The class goes on for the next two months where we will be working with them going from a simple one page aspx to about 12 pages of content. 

The problem is I want to avoid downtime on their old site. So the easiest option is we take down their site, install the wordpress site with a bare amount of content and keep it in maintenance mode. 

They are open to getting a new hosting provider but I would rather them not have to go that route. 

Are there any other options I am overlooking? This is my first re-design and I would like to avoid downtime as our group meets certain class milestones. 

TLDR: Creating a new site, would like to avoid downtime on their old site without switching hosting providers. 

EDIT: I have multiple  Wordpress installs on my home and class server to give them theme options. I really want to just make this easy and install the theme they like, make it look acceptable while we build it up. The problem is it won't be a complete site for a couple months.

2yfcpn,5,2015-03-09,Advice for a future young mathematician,OneStringBustaRhymes,mathematics,https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/2yfcpn/advice_for_a_future_young_mathematician/,"At this moment, in my country, Mathematics is a somehow trendy thing to study. There are much more people studying Maths than there were when I went to college.

I finished my studies in Mathematics 4 years ago and now I have a good job as a teacher. I got this by myself, but I'm aware that one of the reasons for that is that there are not so many mathematicians my age, so the job market was not excesively competitive.

My brother, who in two years will start his college education, wants to study mathematics as well. He is very smart and loves mathematics, so I'm sure he will successfully pass his studies with no problem, but I'm worried about the fact that the job market will be more competitive when he finishes (also, the financial situation in my country right now is not good, and I'm not sure about if it will get better in the future).

That's why I would like to give him some advice, so he can make sure that he will have a good future when his education is over. And, I think the best way to do that is to build his own CV. Not just passing all the courses of the degree with automatic pilot, getting C after C and finally getting a piece of paper with the signature of the king, but also getting involved in projects. If he was interested in becomming a programmer, I would advice him to get develop his own libraries and upload them to GitHub, and if he was interested to become an artist, I would tell him to produce as much as material as possible so he can build a nice portfolio. The difference is that, if you are studying fine arts, there things you do at college are portfolio material per se, while if you are studying math, you only get exam marks, which is not the same.

So, the question is: what can he do in terms of building a nice resume as a mathematicians? Some of my ideas:

- Getting involved in divulgative activities. As a speaker, but also as an organizer when possible.
- Obviously, take as many summer internships as possible.
- Becoming a decent programmer / web developer on his spare time. If you can really program and understand the math at the same time, then you are golden.

What are your ideas?"

Avantajele publicitatii online sunt multiple: costuri reduse fata de alte medii , posibilitatea de a targheta publicul tinta si , poate cel mai important , se pot estima si masura rezultatele. Campaniile se pot adapta din mers astfel incat rezultatele obtinute sa fie maxime. Degeaba ai cele mai minunate produse daca nu sunt cunoscute si nu oferi servicii exceptionale .

It's basically doing a lot of research and putting data into an excel spreadsheet. Nothing too hard and I get to do it from home. The lady I work for is very lovely and supportive.

The problem is back in October she promised me my internship would be paid. Since then I haven't been paid anything but I've never really mentioned it to her. I've just get on with my work. Everything is done remotely so I speak with her via email or sometimes on the phone.

Does anyone have any advice on the politest way of bringing up the subject of pay? "

Hi there,

I'm a 3rd year (out of 4) Computer Science Student from the Northeastern United States desperately trying to find work here in London, or elsewhere in the UK for the coming Summer.


So far, I'm having no luck at all. I just don't have enough contacts here to ask around like I would back home, and my University doesn't really provide placement help for non-graduates looking for temporary work.


As far as eligibility goes, I have a work visa permitting me to work full time until the end of the Summer (with the option to extend), so I do not require sponsorship.


My specialty is iOS app development and Web Design and lately I've gotten pretty good with Database Applications. In the past I've worked at Hewlett-Packard and Bose Corporation as an Intern.


Whatever the position, I'm absolutely committed to learning and making myself a proven member of the team - I would just like to devote more time to another country in this point in my life while I can. And what better way to do that than to work, and learn!


I have a resume handy, if you'd like me to send it to you please comment or PM me! Thanks :)"

I finished my project back in December. My manager at the time congratulated me. She told me to take my project with me to interviews and that she'd be happy to be a reference. The only issue is that she wanted me to present the project to the city council. She decided to schedule the presentations when I had finals conflicting. I told her I couldn't present at the time she wanted. She said it was okay and that if we couldn't get it done at another date it would be okay. We tried for a date in February and once again it conflicted with an exam. I told her straight up that this semester all my classes are in the evening which makes it hard for me to present the project at the times she wants. Having majors in Accounting and management makes it tough to miss a whole day of classes.

I recently interviewed for another internship. He asked for her name. So he called her. I got an email from her saying that I never finished the internship and that she is not comfortable with me having her as a reference on my resume. 

I'm extremely livid that I spent so much time working for her and she lied to my face. I would leave it off my resume but right now that is my only relevant experience in accounting  otherwise the only other job I have is my part time that I've been doing for the past 3 years. Is there anyway to address this if I interview again? Or anyway where I can keep the experience on my resume without the employer calling her?  Thank you!"
2yfyok,1,2015-03-09,Need some career advice.,sirdarkpaw,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2yfyok/need_some_career_advice/,"First some background. I have been working as a Junior IT Assistant (basically a paid intern) for the last ~2 years. We are a 2 man team. I have been doing mostly help desk for roughly 60-70 users while my boss (the IT Admin) handles the bigger stuff. I assist him with the bigger stuff when I have no help desk calls. I currently have an associate's degree in computer networking. My current employer will pay for certification classes. I submitted a request for CCNA classes, the VMware Install Configure Manage class, and Linux+. I am still waiting for approval on those. I have some basic experience with VMware's vSphere. We have a small cluster (3 physical servers) with a NetApp FAS2040 for shared storage. I also have some basic experience with Citrix XenServer. We are currently moving our cluster from VMware to XenServer. I have also been tinkering with Linux for the past ~2 years. I have played around with LAMP stacks, samba, NFS, iSCSI, drbd, pacemaker, glusterfs, and ceph. I have also dabbled in FreeBSD with HAST/CARP/ZFS. I was never able to get a working script for automatic failover with devd though (was successful with manual failover however). Currently I am mostly interested in virtualization and storage.

&amp;nbsp;

So, on to my question. I want to get into datacenter engineering/administration and specialize in virtualization/storage. What would my best options be? What other classes/certs should I look into?"
2yg1bf,7,2015-03-09,I'm not sure if I [26/F] want to start a relationship with my online friend [27/F],RECTAL_FOREIGN_BODY,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2yg1bf/im_not_sure_if_i_26f_want_to_start_a_relationship/,"I met my friend on an MMO about 6 years ago. We get along really well, have similar a similar sense of humor, and can chat for hours on end, etc.

Fast forward to last December. I decided to visit her for the very first time over Christmas break. We really hit it off and developed a genuine connection. We also slept together while I was there. Since that visit, we've been voice chatting on Skype pretty much for 5+ hours a day, and we found that we have developed feelings for each other. She offered to fly me over so I can stay with her for a few months after I graduate and finish my internship in September, and during that time we could test the waters of a relationship. (FYI, this will be my first ever relationship) I agreed to her proposal.

Lately she has also been suggesting that between now and September, we could try having a relationship online since we would be trying that in September anyway...saying that it would really help with her depression and give her something to look forward to. Last night, she also mentioned the idea of coming over to stay with me at my parents' house in June, while they are away on a trip.

I have been hesitant to accept the above two proposals. I know that it wouldn't take much effort on my part (at least to test having a relationship online), but it really just isn't something I feel I can comfortably do unless in person. As to the second proposal, I don't want to be sneaking behind my parents' backs and secretly bringing someone into their home that they definitely won't approve of (for context, I have conservative Asian parents).
Thing is, I am not sure if I want to start a relationship with her, but I would be more than happy to test it out once I see her again in September. Part of what makes me uncomfortable is that it feels like she is pushing boundaries and pressuring me to do things that I am not quite ready to do. On her end, she is really bothered by my indecisiveness and unwillingness to put in any effort.
What do, reddit?

*tl;dr:* not sure if I want to start a relationship with my online friend, looking for general advice about how to proceed. It will be my first ever relationship."
2yg9dt,3,2015-03-09,Am I being creepy?,[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/2yg9dt/am_i_being_creepy/,"Hey folks, how's it going?

I'm having a bit of a trouble discerning whether this behaviour of mine is getting creepy to some people.

To add a bit of context, I'm working as an intern in a company and I know someone who is working nearby. We usually see each other when grabbing a coffee.

All pretty natural till now. Thing is, sometimes I can be awkward as fuck. The person I know usually is sitting together with the company she's working in and she is still getting to know them. Usually I come compliment her everyday, but then quickly leave since I have no conversation topic.

There is also another problem: I ain't really discreet when staring around. Today I was staring around, trying to see where she was so I could compliment her (I didn't find her). As a result, I might have ended up staring a lot at the company workers. I don't know why, but I got a feeling in my gut that they were feeling bothered. Might have been just me too...

So that's my question. Should I stop visiting so much? Of should I try to fit in? Or do anything else? I don't really want to become ""that guy"" and get into trouble with the other company, I might Work with them one day...

Sorry if I broke any forum rule, it's my first post here...

2yg9n2,3,2015-03-09,25/M in the UK seemingly lost,JustExtreme,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2yg9n2/25m_in_the_uk_seemingly_lost/,"I studied an HND Computing followed by BSc (Hons) top-up in Computing (Digital Media Development) which I got a 2:1/upper second classification for. I worked a part time technical support role in the halls of residence the whole time while I was studying. Also maybe relevant was that I got diagnosed with Aspergers' during my final semester but I don't don't like to be treated differently because of it - I like to do things for myself. I suffer with anxiety and depression at the moment.

I graduated back in January 2012 staying around my university city in the West Midlands/Black Country (originally from rural Norfolk the east coast of England which is where my family are all based) and things have kind of gone downhill since then. I couldn't get any work whatsoever for the first year after graduation and I applied for all sorts of stuff. 2013 started off OK when I got an 8 month low paid programming graduate internship with my university but unfortunately it was very poorly managed so I didn't really learn much from it and much of the time I had nothing to do and couldn't motivate myself to self teach on initiative - it was nice to have a routine, somewhere to go every day, and enough money to just about survive and get by though. As part of the internship I was placed with a startup games development company for the remaining 4 months and helped with data entry and light development tasks relating to Unity3D. 

After the internship finished I tried to start my own business making apps for local businesses but unfortunately couldn't get any customers through networking or marketing so that wound up around April or May 2014.

I started a job working for an app development agency in May but unfortunately despite showing them my previous work in the interview and being very honest about the depth of my skills they let me go after a week. This is desspite saying they were happy for me to learn iOS dev on the job because they had assumed a bunch of prior knowledge I didn't have and they couldn't afford for me to keep learning at the pace I was going at and ""needed to make money out of me right away"". Obviously this made me feel pretty shitty and demotivated - I thought I'd finally got a job with a decent salary only for it to be crushed in front of me.

Anyway I feel like I've burnt out on computers recently and find it incredibly difficult to engage with learning anything about them or pursuing a career related to my degree. At the moment I'm working an early morning 6-9am cleaning job at my old university which I started back in October which is OK - gets me out of bed and keeps my finances ticking over. I also volunteer at a women's refuge where I help the clients to learn basic IT skills which I find rewarding.

My ideas about what I'd like to do are pretty widespread and not all things that would necessarily provide an income (at least to begin with). I'd like to try something where I can express myself like stand up comedy, public speaking, music, writing, etc. which I could in theory do alongside a menial job like I have now. I also like the idea of working for a charity of some kind in a paid capacity as I've been enjoying my voluntary work and feel that work in that sector could be rewarding.

Autism support staff from the university have suggested that I perhaps consider studying autism/aspergers in adults at a postgraduate level (at a different university, this one doesn't run courses in it) as I'm apparently very candid and self aware of my condition and how it affects me and others. I'm not really opposed to this and feel it could be interesting but I just don't know. Also I'm not sure I'd be able to get on without having a prior qualification at undergraduate level in the subject although I could try to justify my application or personal statement with life experience.

I just have no clue what I want to do next and while the cleaning is OK and gives me time to think I'm not sure I want to do it forever..."
2ygcaa,2,2015-03-09,Leadership difficulties in a small startup,tbutlah,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2ygcaa/leadership_difficulties_in_a_small_startup/,"I'm in the CEO position of a small software startup that I cofounded with one of my best friends along with one of his friends. We've been around for a little over half a year now and while it's not been enough to sustain ourselves solely from the business, we've been making passive income. I own about 3/5 of the company while the other cofounders own around 1/5 each. 

So for the entire time we've been operating, we've been having weekly meetings, sharing ideas, and I thought we had great team cohesion. However, recently the cofounder who is also one of my best friends went off on me for micromanaging him and ""treating him like a child"". I'm only 20 and haven't had that much leadership experience, but have taken leadership classes through ROTC that stressed the importance of not micromanaging your competent subordinates. Like most young leaders, before he called me out I had had the image in my head that I was doing an outstanding job and giving the perfect amount of freedom to my cofounders, while also checking their work over for quality. 

For background, I am supposed to be in charge of the technical development of the product, and he is supposed to be in charge of  everything non-technical, such as marketing, customer support, etc. As the CEO, I also make the major decisions, usually swaying in the direction of the recommendation of the cofounder whose area the decision would affect. My friend came to me recently saying that he thinks we should move over to a new, much more expensive marketing style and I reacted in a somewhat hostile way to the new idea since we just changed marketing styles and it showed no effect in sales. This was admittedly a bad move on my part, since he usually does alot of research before coming to me with these things. I start to accept the idea more as he talks me into it, but I know that even though he is a very good researcher and one of the smartest people I know, he has a bad attention to detail. For this reason, even though I was pretty much sold on the idea at this point, before I okayed the spending of money I asked to see the chat log of a conversation that he had with a marketing expert since neither of us have any experience in marketing and he may have missed or misinterpreted something in the conversation.

This is where he went off on me, complaining that he always does so much research only to have me second guess him and disregard his advice. He said he doesn't feel like he has a purpose, that he just researches things and presents them to me with a recommendation just to have me look over the research he went through himself and decide against his recommendation. He brought up that in his former internships with somewhat prestigious organizations he would be able to write articles that would go straight up on the website without review, because people there trusted his ability to research and decide. A direct quote from him is: ""you dont start with the presupposition to question someone's work. Then you're undermining their integrity, their autonomy, and questioning their intellignece"".

Obviously I have failed as a leader since one of my cofounders feels like he isn't taken seriously and what he does is useless. However, keep in mind that we're friends that have known each other over 6 years so the dynamic between us is different than just a typical leader-subordinate relationship.

My question to reddit is: what are some strategies that I can use that will give my subordinates freedom to work on their own parts of the business autonomously and be happy, while also maintaining control of the business, ensuring quality and that proper decisions are being made? Also, how does one do the same thing, but specifically when in charge of a development team and responsible for controlling the quality of software being produced by your team (it seems like there would be good books on this topic). 

While our current startup is small and may not grow that much more, these questions are very important to me since I'm sure at some point in my career I'll be in the same situation again.

Thank you!"

Doesn't know what to do... anyone help?,robdiqulous,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2ygdyt/recent_grad_losing_hope_doesnt_know_what_to_do/,"So here it goes. I am a recent graduate. By that i mean i graduated in 2012. So it has been a while. I graduated with a Bachelors in Finance and Business Management double major. I was also dumb and did not do any internships during college. I didnt need them i said... : ( anyway...I was working at this decent size company  that was expanding as a production line worker out of school. They had several office positions open while I was there and even entry level accounting position. They told me to keep applying and I ended up waiting almost 6 months for the accounting position to open up when he said about a month. 

So I apply to these office positions and I get none of them. I dont even get interviews. For entry level accounting. I later hear that it is because they couldn't afford to lose me on the line because I am a good worker. I am finally gone from there.

My whole life I have done basically manual labor jobs and jobs where I build things. Never had to answer phones or things like that. So I dont have any job experience. 
So fast forward 6 months, me and my gf moved for a promotion for her to a smaller city. So now I have been trying to find a job here. and NOTHING. I have had interviews. Im using staffing companies. But apparently no one wants to hire me with no experience. I dont know what else it would be. 

I am great at excel, pivot tables, vlookups, macros. Great with computers, I fix them on the side. I can answer a darn phone and transfer calls or do data entry. but apparently not. 

Now that I am just ranting, I ask. What should I do? What CAN I do? I am more than capable of performing these jobs. 

I don't exactly know what I want to do in finance but I have not even had a chance to see what there is. I just want to get in somewhere and work my way up and gain experience. 

If you have any suggestions or advice at all I would love to hear it. Im at the end of my rope. We are thinking of moving again, but I have no money to move. I am thinking of getting my MBA but I dont know where I could go around here now that we moved. Any help is appreciated...

2yggco,9,2015-03-09,Some advise on Kidney Stones,[deleted],KidneyStones,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/2yggco/some_advise_on_kidney_stones/,"I'm a long-time sufferer of kidney stones due to a metabolic disease (cystinuria), which is sort of like hitting the reverse lottery. I've found that this subreddit is less of a 'support group' and more of a 'oh shit what do I do' area, so figured I'd offer some support and guidance. Here are my suggestions, having passed over 20 kidney stones, been hospitalized 5-6 times, and had most of the available procedures and surgical types.

1) Kidney stones don't 'hurt', per se. Many people have a kidney stone hanging out in their kidney that's not causing any problems. The pain is when the kidney stone begins to travel from the kidney to the bladder, through the ureter. Even though kidney stones can be spiky, what's causing the pain is the inflammation and distention of the ureter, due to blockage. The ureter, which is not a 'skeletal' muscle, just goes crazy on its own and spasms itself to maximum pain.

2) Dudes (and girls too) - from personal experience, if you can pass a kidney stone from your kidney to your bladder, it will most likely leave your bladder with zero or minimal pain (I acknowledge that some people have bladder stones that cannot pass, I have never had one). Most people think it will hurt coming out when you pee, but it's no more painful than a sharp, very brief prick (like a shot). It's over and done, do not fret about that pain at all. Because you control your urination, you can actively push the stone out with force.

3) Kidney stones form because one of a number of different compounds crystallize and compound in the kidney. No matter what your cause is (calcinate, uric, etc.) the common denominator of crystal formation is that you can reduce it by dilution. That means, full stop, drink lots of water to minimize the risk of kidney stones. I first discovered I had kidney stones when I was a college student 15 years ago and drank a bunch of beer, which left me dehydrated at night. Defer to your doctor, I am not qualified to provide medical advice, but generally if you're prone to kidney stones it's ok to drink alcohol or caffeine, but try to offset with an extra glass of water. Now that I have my kidney stone disease more under control, one thing that helps is to drink 16+ ounces of water every night before I go to sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night to pee, but whatever, small price to pay.

4) Urine Ph can increase the formation of some kidney stones. CVS wanted to charge me $200 for Ph strips (and I have pretty good insurance). It's $10 on Amazon for 100. Just make sure you get strips for urine / saliva, they are not the same as those for common tap water. Your doctor will tell you if you have stones that can be managed by adjusting your urine Ph and will provide you with solutions on how to do so. Many stones are addressed by diet or other factors.

5) Finally, one of the things that's really seemed to help me manage my stones is exercise. I am a big runner, and I tend to get stones in the cold winter months... why? I'm pretty sure because that's not when I'm running half marathons, and am instead sitting on my ass and watching TV. You should never really need an excuse to exercise, but I've found urologists don't really like to bring it into the equation because patients don't go to the urologist to talk about weight-loss; nonetheless, pick up running or another active sport if you are prone to kidney stones.

6) Ok, so you got a kidney stone in your ureter, you're doubled over in pain, what should you do? You should go to the emergency room. I volunteer as an EMT and work in the health field so I spend lots of time in the ER! Here is what to expect and how to behave: 

- Have someone drive you to the hospital, you'll almost definitely need transport home. Do not drive yourself, because you're gonna be on drugs when you leave. If you have any drugs you take regularly, bring them - you might find yourself in the hospital for longer than a few hours, and the hospital marks up drug prices 1000%.

- When you get to the hospital, you'll be confronted by the triage nurse. It is their duty to evaluate you and decide whether or not to admit you. You're gonna be pissed the hell off and miserable, but treat this nurse like gold because they are your ticket to the ER. It is possible that the ER is full, or that a huge mass casualty incident is occurring (like a fire), so even though you're in unbearable condition be advised that your life is not acutely threatened and they may make you wait. You'll hate them for it, but understand. It's unlikely you'll need to wait more than 10-15 minutes.

- A word on pain: there are a lot of people addicted to pain relievers, and they go to the ER for drugs. The triage nurse hates these people because they are taking the beds of deserving patients. When you come in without any visible external signs and complain of 10 out of 10 pain, the triage nurse is going to be skeptical. Now is not the time to ask for pain relievers or specify the type you want. Focus on the symptoms of the pain - when it started, where it hurts, how it feels, point to the pain, talk about how localized it is. Talk about the symptoms, and try to be professional about it even though you're in fall-over pain. If you've had a kidney stone before, tell them and compare the symptoms. The triage nurse will respect you for being professional, and thank them as they evaluate you. You want them to see you as a deserving patient and not a drug user, and if you can win over the triage nurse the goodwill will flow with you as you progress.

- Once you are admitted to the ER they'll put you in a hospital bed, most likely give you an IV, and start pain medication. For me, morphine is 100% the best drug, and I always get nauseous so I tell them and they give me nausea medication. Be honest about any drugs you are on and list everything, including illegal drugs (you won't get in trouble) or stuff you think that's not a big deal (e.g. anti-depressants or the like). Tell them if you've taken anything to manage the pain (motrin / tylenol) and how much.

- Nurses in ERs have one thing in common: they are overworked and underthanked. Thank them profusely. However, a rusty wheel gets the grease, and do not in any way hold back on ringing the nurse buzzer if you need attention. Just be honest, kind and professional to the nurses and they will take care of you because they enjoy being in the room with you more than the next guy over.

- Once the pain is under control, you'll most likely be on a very high volume of drugs and they'll begin to talk about radiology. You might have a conversation with the ER doc, but honestly you're more likely to run into some doctor intern who is very intent on showing off their Audemers Piguet watch then having any clue what they're doing. The nurse's job is to help you, the doctor's job is often to write scrips and decide whether to admit you, more on that later.

- Anyways, you're gonna take a trip to radiology where they'll take a CAT scan (ideally) or x-ray. This will verify the size, placement and likely chance of passing the kidney stone. When you get back, after maybe 45 minutes, the doctor will swing back over and discuss your results. They will make a decision to do one of two things: either send you home with medication and instructions to see a urologist (remember to ask for the CD with the CAT scan, you paid for it!) or admit you upstairs so someone can do surgery on you in a day or two. And that's the outcome, most often 4-8 hours in the hospital followed by follow ups with a urologist. If you are sent home, ask the ER doctor for a flomax scrip before you go, do not forget!

7) Passing that stone! I have found that flomax is an amazing drug, it is a targeted drug that shuts down muscle movement in parts of your body (it's more complex than that, but this is good enough). One of the targets is the ureters, which reduces inflammation and helps the kidney stone pass. Upside of flomax is in clinical trials of myself, conducted on myself, it works about 90% of the time at passing a stone within 48 hours (often in less than 24) when coupled with profuse hydration (approx. 16 8oz glasses of water per day). Downsides include that it targets other parts of the body and you may have mucus buildup in your nasal cavity, strange peeing sensation and (if you're a dude) strange effects on the prostate (flomax was initially cleared as a prostate drug). Also, flomax makes you sleepy. Talk to a doctor before taking advil / motrin / ibuprofen to manage pain, because if your kidneys are not filtering correctly it can lead to complications (many doctors will recommend different pain relievers).

8) People have insane theories about how to pass kidney stones on the internet and they're mostly bunk. Remember: for something to help you pass a kidney stone it has to make its way into the kidney... so if you ingest it, it must be a compound that enters the bloodstream through the GI tract and is filtered by the kidney, not the liver. As such, generally speaking this limits you to traditional drugs that metabolically address the body once in the bloodstream or Ph agents or water. Everything else - such as olive oil - is completely junk science. *If you pass a kidney stone, save it* and bring it to your urologist for analysis. This is critical, so they can determine how to prevent future stones.

9) Good luck people! Kidney stones suck, but they are an acute mechanical failure that can be removed and your life will continue without impact. They can be prevented with moderate lifestyle changes for most patients. Stay healthy, and thank your parents, friends, spouse, roommates, EMTs, nurses and doctors for taking you to the hospital and being there in your time of pain."

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

I need help.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ygrih/im_stuck_in_my_life_and_dont_know_how_to_move_on/,"I graduated college last year, finishing with a 3.5 GPA in an engineering major. I hate engineering. I hated studying engineering and I hated even more the engineering work during my internships. I needed a break.
With the money saved up from my internships and Co-ops over the years, I headed out to do some backpacking in Europe. But I got stuck in one country, and really only one small town with family relations, because I was totally unprepared for travel, and terribly afraid to do so. I didn't and don't want to be that kind of person, but I am. I was hoping to find something out there, maybe even someone, just a thing give me something to push forward, to find a purpose, to be willing to put up with some 9-5 or head back to school. Just something to fight for, or at least enjoy enough that I wouldn't mind working for it. I didn't find anything.

The only thing I realized was how much I don't know who I am. Everything I have done in the last 22 years of my life was because someone was telling me to do that, telling me that whatever interests or dreams I had were wrong, would lead no where, telling me what to like and what not to, telling me what was right and what was wrong. And all I know now, is that I don't know what any of those things are to me. I am not really anybody. I'm just millions of pieces of all the people I've ever known, believing everything they've told me, and having all those conflicting beliefs battle inside, switching me in one direction to the next from one day to the other.

I'm stuck at home now. I've been back since last Thanksgiving. I haven't gotten a job. I can't imagine myself doing so, because frankly, I couldn't live with myself if I did. Every day at my internships I found myself putting on a mask, lying, saying I liked the work environment, saying I was interested, that I would consider coming back to work after graduation. Because I supposed to. Was told to. I felt bad lying, because these were good people. But I was always looking out the window, every fucking day, and wondering, ""What is out there?"", and hoping to be there, finding it. 

I worked a little in Europe, volunteering at a winery and farm, and I found myself for a moment taken back to the labs from when I was in high school, where I took a special class. For the entire year, we carried out an experimental project of our choosing. And it also reminded me of my senior design project, the only time in all four years where I was actually able to think and build something of my choice. The only chance to learn how things in the lab work by ourselves, get an intuition for them. And maybe I thought, I should go back to school. Maybe becoming a professor is something I might enjoy, doing research on something, learning and focusing on the area of my choice. But besides the first problem, which is what I would even go back to study, I realize, I have no chance of getting into a doctorate program, the only further education that I could afford.

I never did any research during undergraduate. I never talked or got close to any professors, except for one. He was the only professor who I respected, and was the one who suggested I go on to graduate school and the like. Unfortunately, he passed at the end of last year. Not only do I have no recommendations, I don't even have someone to talk to who I trust about going for more education.

I keep wanting to get away. To go back to Europe and retry, knowing the mistakes I made last time. Or maybe, to just pack my bags and head for a hiking expedition like the AT or the PCT, even though my experience is nill.  I know I'm an adult, that I can make my own choices, but here I am living with my parents still. Though I can technically leave whenever I want, I can't. They keeping getting me to stay. I've been saying I was going to leave for months and I haven't. Part of it is the feeling of guilt, like I owe it to them to stay here, and go get a job and so on, because that's what they expect. For me to be somebody, whatever that means. And I also feel guilt when I read about others on Reddit, the situations they are in, panicked because they won't be able to make this months rent and I can't help but feel like this idea of me finding something or just becoming someone new is nothing more than a fanciful delusion, and I'm just a lazy, pompous ass. The other part is my family hanging inheritance over my head, not out directly, but in a rather complicated way which they have been saying demands my attention and my signature, which they have been doing for the past 6 years, but nothing has ever happened. I know the moment I make my action to leave, I'm going to miss out and get burned by my own family.

I'm stuck. I don't know how to move on. I'm afraid of taking action, and realizing it dooms the rest of my life, constricting me to a lifestyle I couldn't stand to live. And I'm afraid of doing what everyone expects of me, turning whatever daydreams I have into regrets. And all the while I sit here and stagnant, decompose a little every day, and both fears are becoming a reality.

TLDR: I'd appreciate if you read the post. In short, I'm stuck, and don't know how to move forward in life. I couldn't make a simpler and meaningful explanation, because if I could, I wouldn't have had to write this post.

Thanks.

I feel kinda silly for even asking now haha

-------------------------
So I was just offered my first job. I'm a senior in college majoring/focusing in structural. The offer is 54/yr, health, dental, 10 days vacation, 401k starting after 6 months. All that stuff sounds good to me. 

My concern is the fit with the company. It's a small company, maybe 20 total employees. And only 3 of those are structural people. I'm worried about my development and if I'll be asked to do too much or not enough. I don't really know what to expect with a small company. Have any of you had a similar experience?

I would wait for another offer but I've only had one other interview. My GPA is a 3.9 but I never had an internship so I think that's making employers look the other way. I have two months until graduation so there's still some time to look but I don't if I should risk it.

If you want to see the jist of the internship [here](http://puu.sh/gtlaR/542be8e22b.png) is some info on it.

I applying for a internship for Engineering, Math, and Science majors. I plan on getting my computer science degree, so I assume I fit into this since a CS degree requires a decent amount of math. I also meet mandatory qualifications and preferred abilities.

Right now I have taken:

 Java, and C++ classes

Calc 3A and 3B or calc 1 and 2 these are the two classes right after pre-calc (These classes were basically application of derivates, techniques of integration, applications to geometry and physics, parametric and polar curve differentiation and intergration)

English 1A (Basically your first transferable english course, college composition)

English 1C (Critical thinking skills, developing argument, analysis of argument)

My other classes I assume would be irrelevant for this internship since they are GE classes, Astronomy, Intro to philosophy, History of Jazz and rock, Humanities in Film

As of right now I have a 3.7  GPA and made dean's list last semester

Things I think I might be able to list as skills, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Installing Computer Software, Knowledge of computer components (motherboards, HDD’s, CPU’s GPU’s, etc.), Building Computers, Ability to communicate effectively and professionally with others, Basic understanding of Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas Pro, Microsoft Visual Studio,  Experience with Windows XP/Vista/7/8

I have no work experience really as of now besides doing some computer work for a few people and cutting wood at my grandparents house during the summer."

As part of schooling in ECPI, we are required to participate in an internship. I did so and my job was ""Help Desk Support"". I absolutely hated it.

I know that if I work somewhere long enough as Help Desk support, I may be promoted but, promoted into what. I can't decide if I REALLY wanna do that.

I still love electronics and computers. I am A+ certified, Network + Certified, and am working on getting Security + certified. Unfortunately, it feels like the only thing available to me is Help Desk position jobs. I have an interview this Tuesday with a company for this type of position.

She'd gone to get a drink a while ago, but she wouldn't abandon you right? After all, she was the one who dragged you to this costume party anyway. 'stupid costumes' you think to yourself, tugging at out outfit and generally feeling self conscious about your decision. 'Is it too slutty? Not slutty enough? Why aren't any of these guys coming on to me?' Plus you hate how you don't know who anyone is. 'But that's the fun of a mask party!' Your friend had explained, how the anonymity made everything so much more exciting. The idea had grown on you, the idea of hooking up with a masked stranger at a party becoming a common fantasy since you agreed to come.*

*But first you needed a guy, and for that you needed your frie... damnit, she's hooking up with someone on the dance floor. Screw it, you can find a guy, no problem, right? That's when you see him, a shirtless, masked cowboy already undressing you with his eyes from across the room. Something about him seems so familiar...*

Welcome to the costume party, ladies of DPP. That was the setup, now I need you to tell me who you are (Age, character background, appearance, and costume [I recommend www.yandy.com, if you're totally at a loss I can give some suggestions]), what your kinks/limits are, and which of the following scenes you'd like to play:

Scene 1: The Surprise. We know who you are, but not who I am. The masks will come off when the time is right and all will be revealed, for better or worse. Could be before, during, or after the deed, and I could be anyone (Obviously if you have hard limits or a specific set of possibilities let me know)

Scene 2: The Secret- You figured it out. Who I am, but I don't know who you are. Does the idea horrify or tantalize you, or a bit of both? Will making a scene about it ruin me, so you have to play along for now? Or do you want to see how long you can get away with fulfilling your taboo fantasy before I find out? (For this one you will need to pick who I am, ie brother, boss, intern, coworker, enemy, etc etc)

Scene 3: The relationship. You're pretty confident that the hot stranger across the room is your boyfriend (obviously this alters the initial setup a bit). Sure he looks and acts a little different, but he seems so familiar. It would be such a shame if he turned out to be someone else, especially when your boyfriend is at the party too.

3 alt: You can't believe you're in the same costume as that skank/your best friend/ your sister (or whomever). That must be why her boyfriend is eyefucking you across the room. Maybe if you play your cards right his eyes won't be the only thing fucking you.

Turn ons are: mild ageplay, cum play, incest, cheating, cuckold/cuckqueen, exhibitionism, rough sex, power dynamics, light bondage. I'm totally willing to workin other options and some of the scenes naturally fit with Non/dub con and humiliation if you're interested

The only things off limits are blood &amp; gore, bathroom play, extreme ageplay, and animals.

2ygww7,3,2015-03-09,Lessor/lessee issue,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ygww7/lessorlessee_issue/,"Hi LegalAdvice!  So I have a bit of a story and I want to preface it by saying that I should have looked for help sooner but was stupid about it.  So I am in grad school right now but last year I was only here for half a year due to graduating early.  In order to avoid subletting I joined my girlfriend at her apartment building where she actually worked and lived.  In order for me to legally live there they had me sign the lease that she was already on.  She worked for her rent basically and told me every month that it was fully paid off.  Fast forward a bit and I moved out in December for an internship and because of graduation.  (Note, this original lease was for August 2013 to July 2014.)

Towards the end of the school year (May or so) she told me that she was basically forced out of her job and this place had basically terminated her lease.  She moved somewhere else in May and I thought all was well.  I received no notifications for late rent/fees/damages or anything.  Until January 2015.  I received a call saying that they had been attempting to contact my ex for several months because we owed damages to the tune of $15,000.  Yes, 15 grand.  I was incredibly scared of this.  So I contacted my ex and she told me she would pay the entire amount after working out a payment plan of 1 payment of $1,000 and 23 payments of $400.  I now realize after receiving this initial call I should have gone straight to a lawyer to see the extent of my liability and find out what could be done.  But because she said she would pay the full amount, I didn't worry about it.  I did sign the payment plan along with her because I figured I had to since I was on the original lease.

The first payment was due 3/1 and, of course, it wasn't paid by her like she said.  The complex gave us until 3/5 to pay and as of today it still wasn't paid.  So I finally asked for a list of all damages and a copy of the original lease and said I was going to talk to a lawyer.  Thankfully, they sent both promptly.  

The list of charges are as follows:
Balance as of March (when it looks like she stopped working there): $772

Rent charges from March until July: $4,350

Skips, abandonments, evictions (rent September 2014-July 2015) (not sure how they can charge us for this or what this is exctly): $1,020

Damage Fees: $7,700 (this includes things such as replacing both beds, new furniture, replacing the carpet, deep cleaning, etc.)

And other miscellaneous late charges and fees for the remainder.

A few points I want to reiterate: 

I did not receive any notices telling me the rent was not being paid.  My ex kept saying everything was fine and that when she moved out in May they terminated the lease.  

I received no notice of these damages or any other fees until January 2015.  The lease was over July 2014.

My ex told me nothing about these fees or late rent or charges.

So today I set up an appointment with a lawyer for this Wednesday (3/11) and gave them the itemized list and original lease.

I will make edits as necessary but am not even sure where to start with asking questions.  What am I actually liable for?  Is there any way to avoid this entire thing?  If it gets sent to collections, how bad will this destroy my credit score?  Please help.  I know the lawyer will help but what should I expect and bring to the meeting?  I want to be fully prepared.  Again, I will answer any questions and make edits as necessary.  Thanks everyone!

Edit for clarity:  It is almost impossible to get in contact with my ex now.  She has blocked me from almost all means of communication and is refusing to answer any of my calls, texts, etc. because I am trying to be responsible and find out the entire situation."
2yh3lh,2,2015-03-09,"Wanting to move out soon, might have to live on savings, scared I'm getting in over my head and need advice.",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2yh3lh/wanting_to_move_out_soon_might_have_to_live_on/,"I'm sorry if anything is confusing or awkwardly worded, I am rather worried and upset about the whole situation and my thoughts are all over the place, so if anyone doesn't understand or is confused, please just ask for clarification. 

My situation: I will be 18 this summer, and am desperately wanting to move out from my parents. I know there are many pros and cons to this situation, and that living with parents rent-free is definitely preferable to moving out to just ""do whatever I want."" However my parents are very strict, conservative, religious, and overbearing. I can elaborate more on this if anyone wants details, but just know that I do have my mind mostly set on leaving, and for me the pros greatly outweigh the cons.

I was supposed to apply for college this year (I am homeschooled) and my parents would not let me apply, so I'm taking a gap year next year, and will have two internships, one will possibly be paid - but it would not be much, and I would also be volunteering, taking a few classes at a local state university/community college, doing music extra curriculars, and possibly a part-time job if I can manage.

My parents are well-off, and have been retired for many years. The topic of money is very hush-hush, and any information I know about our financial situation is what I have over heard or seen on statements/etc.

I know from reading other posts here on /r/personalfinance, that the recommendation is to have 3-6 mos of expenses saved that you don't need to touch to pay for anything. And obviously, a job of some sort. However, with my other plans and school I am afraid that I won't have time for a job, and at the very least a part time job.

My financial details: As I said, my parents do not talk about money very much so I'm sorry the details aren't that coherent. 

I have an account with stocks in it, most of which were purchased by my grandparents back in the 60's and 70's and my mom has always said that selling them would be bad because of capital gain taxes(?)

The stocks are valued around 400,000 and there is around 30,000-45,000 in cash also.

I have an inherited IRA from my grandfather that has about 6-7k, and I don't know if it is just an IRA or a Roth IRA. (Does this matter much?) I know that one you pay taxes before you put money in and the other you pay taxes after you take money out, but in the large scheme of things, does it matter which kind it is?

I also have a money market account with about $1,200-$1,400 and a student checking account with about $600.

My parents forbade me to spend any money because it was for ""buying a house"" and ""the future."" And I have always planned to do that, until my parents became very strict, overbearing, and borderline abusive. Now I just want out. 

Main Questions: Is it irresponsible to move out if I may not have the time for a full or even decent part-time job? I will have college next year, which is going to be very expensive because I want to go into music. 

One bedroom apartments in my city are anywhere from around $400 a month to $600, and I would also need to purchase a decent car, a phone plan with a new phone (I'm not allowed a phone now), car insurance, health insurance, all the accouterments that I would need for a place to live - furniture, dishes, etc. And this seems like a lot of money to spend even if independence is something I am craving. 

Do you all think I can reasonably move out? I can't tell if I am having doubts because of the unknown and my fear of making the wrong choice and going broke, or if my doubts are the rational and logical thoughts and I should pay more attention to them.

I've also read on here about YNAB, and seen some things about how much percent of your income should be used for which expense, but if my ""income"" is all or mostly from previously saved money then where do I start? 

Does the set up of the accounts I have that I listed up there sound okay to everyone? Is there anything you would recommend changing or moving into a different type of account? I'm sorry if the information is vague, I'm trying to educate myself on money terminology here and on Khan academy, but I'm still not perfect! 

My boyfriend of a year and a half is a freshman in college (at my dream school!) about 2 hours away, and is moving out from the dorms next year with a mutual friend into an apartment. He offered to let me live there for at least two or three months rent-free if I need. Is this a viable solution? The distance is definitely a huge con as my activities and things would be cut or not possible for the most part, and my parents hate him because he ""took away their baby girl."" I know moving in with someone is a huge step in a relationship, especially for someone as young as myself and should definitely not be taken lightly as it would be a huge strain if something went wrong, but...free rent. 

Misc Questions:

I read all the posts on here about buying a car, what is the max that I should spend, and should I pay cash? My parents have USAA insurance, how do I go about getting my own insurance and where should I get insurance from? (Same for health insurance?)

I apologize if this isn't the best place for some of my questions, I read all the FAQ and the Wiki and I don't think I asked anything that was on the list, but if I did and someone can direct me to the correct place that would be wonderful.

Thank you for making it this far!

Despite how much they'd like too, they can't offer any fiscal support to me. Probably making between 25-30k a year, tops.
One sibling in their 20s who did not finish college and I'm not sure of the exact number but somewhere between 40-50k debt. Currently working a (probably) $13/HR blue collar job and lives with the parents. The sibling wants to buy a vehicle around 15-25k, somehow, by financing it. Is currently ignoring all debt through deferment. Will not be returning to school.  

I have no other family and if anything were to happen to them (hopefully not) they wouldn't be leaving anything behind.
I'm not sure if any of that is important but I figured I'd include them.

I'm 19, attending a private school in Virginia while my family lives up North. When I graduate in 3.5 years I'll be about 50K-55K in debt with federal student loans (tuition raised by 3% this year so I'm not sure if that will continue). No private loans, but I could possibly take some out instead of more federal.
I have a biweekly income of $150 during the school year and over the summer months I'll be paid a cash stipend of $1,200 in weekly increments. I'll be graduating with a bachelors in IT with concentrations on Cyber Security and/or Computer Science. I'm not planning any immediate higher education after that. I'm hoping to acquire multiple interns/work experience before I graduate as my Uni is in the DC Metro area and has a lot of internship opportunity and recruiting from Government agencies for my field (Which is the main reason I justify private school price). Unlikely to be married or engaged anytime near graduation.

I'm kind of riding on getting a job in the DMV area after school but I have no geographical boundaries, I just want have a decent job/financial plan.

Assuming I continue my $150/biweekly pay from work study (with the possibility of taking on another minimum wage job) and my 1.2k check for the next 3 summers; how should I manage my money? Should I look at investing early with stocks? Should I pay the interest on my student loans? ect.

TL;DR: Financially independent College Freshmen with 50k student loans in future, studying IT, geographically open, with aging parents and brother in a lot of debt."
2yheen,1,2015-03-09,Share your story,ITchick2014,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2yheen/share_your_story/,"Disclaimer: Wall of text ahead!

I think it would be cool if we shared our stories. What we struggle with, how we came to find out we had ADHD, and how we are doing now. I always find reading about other people's experiences encouraging because it reminds me that even though some people may say ADHD doesn't exist, there are others out there who have had a similar experience to mine.

My Story-
Growing up, I always talked excessively...to the point of driving my parents nuts at times. I had a difficult time not talking in class, I was always sketching in my notebook, and I was horrible at studying and taking notes. Yet, I did well throughout K-12 because I was a good auditory and visual learner. It was college where things really started to become apparent.

I started off at university excited about being on my own, making new friends, and experiencing new things. After my first year, I switched majors and schools. I floundered a lot after my first internship (which I was fired from for being late/non-attendance). I switch majors again, but dropped out of school because my parents decided to stop paying my way (I can't blame them). 

I ended up moving home, getting married a few years later, and managed to do alright for a while. I tried going to school again, but only lasted one quarter. Went through job after job and decided to try school yet again. Did well the first term, but once again started to struggle. Around this time, I was struggling with some health issues, which doctors believe is affected by stress levels and anxiety.

So, I started researching anxiety. I subscribed to the subreddit. I didn't suffer from panic attacks, but a lot of things resonated with me. One day, someone posted about having ADHD and the anxiety related to their struggles. I hopped over to the ADHD subreddit and was blown away. Everything I read sounded just like me. Within a week I had an appointment with a psychiatrist and a few weeks later was officially diagnosed ADHD-C.

I broke the news to my husband immediately, but he already knew I had it and I had been talking about the research I was doing, which helped. I told my mom next and we talked about signs of it growing up like me always forgetting my textbook when I needed to study or the one time I forgot my music AND instrument for a band concert! I have since shared it with my dad and older brother and they have been fairly supportive.

I started medication the day after my psychiatrist told me my diagnosis. The first day was amazing, but the good results have quickly faded. I am able to keep a regular sleep schedule overall, which has been helping immensely. I still need to learn how to better control my focus and accomplish the things that are difficult for me to complete (like homework).

At this point, I'm only at the beginning of understanding what my diagnosis means, but this subreddit has been beyond helpful. Several apps have also helped me along the way. EpicWin for iPhone is my to-do list app of choice. It makes my to-dos an RPG game which is awesome. Also, Forest for iPhone helps me force myself to put down my phone for a period of time.

So what is your experience so far? What tools have you found that help you manage life?

TL;DR: I'm very thankful for this subreddit. It is one of the most honest, open, and supportive places I've found. Share your story and coping mechanisms if you would like! "
2yhlyb,0,2015-03-09,Is there temp or internship opportunities for CS?,urfaselol,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yhlyb/is_there_temp_or_internship_opportunities_for_cs/,"Got a question for ya'll.

2yhpwk,76,2015-03-09,I've been without a Mech Eng. job for over a year since graduating due to depression that has finally been treated. How should I explain the length of time I've went without engineering work? What things can I do to improve my chances of getting an interview in my situation?,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2yhpwk/ive_been_without_a_mech_eng_job_for_over_a_year/,"I've tried posting this elsewhere but it was taken down.  I could really use some advice from other engineers and would appreciate it greatly.   I'm NOT looking for resume advice specifically - although that's one of the tangential queries I had.  This is moreso concerning being so long post-graduation and the effect that is going to have on hiring prospects - how I can explain it if I land an interview - and things I can do to improve my chances. I have these anxieties in the back of my mind and would really appreciate some words of wisdom.   Here's a bit more about me:

&amp;nbsp;

I had some crappy things happen after I graduated from a U.C. in NorCal and I spent over a year in a pretty bad depression – It caused me to miss out on an internship experience at a large winery in central california.  I was in a bad mental state, lost all self confidence, and had to get a temp job as a gas station cashier on graveyard shift to make some money to live off of while I searched for mechanical engineering work – but the depression and resulting lack of any confidence in myself meant I wasn’t really looking very much.  The months just flew by burying myself in the internet and before I knew it it’d been over a year and I was still in the same hopeless place. This past November I finally realized that I had to work my butt off to get out of this hole or things were looking pretty dark and I’d never get my life and career going.  I signed up for the A.C.A. and was able to get medical insurance to cover antidepressant medication (which I started taking in college until I graduated and lost the school insurance), and quit the graveyard job which was just making digging out of my depression more difficult .  This along with regular exercise and meditation turned things around immensely and I finally studied and passed the E.I.T. certification test last month and am ready to start my job search.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t have any internship experience – I wasted all my summers in college, something which I regret immensely.  Currently instead of posting my employment history which is full of things like gas station attendant, pizza maker, etc. I’ve opted to instead have a section titled ‘Relevant Experience’ where I list experiences like my Capstone Design project where I worked in a group with the Cal Dept. of Water Resources to develop a prototype UAV soil salinity mapping system.  I garnered a lot of experience there and gained a major interest in control systems design, worked with 3D printing, worked under budgetary and time restraints, and reported to superiors on project progress similar in structure to a business environment.  I figure it's better to list my relevant engineering projects I've worked on rather than irrelevant part time jobs - but I also wonder if it's important to have my employment history just to show that I've at least had a job this past year even if it was as a cashier.  I can't list both or it'll be two pages long - so I'm not sure which is the best course of action.

&amp;nbsp;

To refresh myself I’ve also spent all of my free time since I’ve gotten well brushing up on my CAD skills with all the major CAD programs and FEA suites I can get my hands  on(ProEngineer, Solidworks, AutoCad, COMSOL), and am doing case studies from component design textbooks to keep myself thinking about engineering.    

&amp;nbsp;

While I don’t have any industry experience yet, and academic pursuits are vastly different from industry,   I know I have the capabilities to adapt and learn quickly. I just need that one chance to get my foot in the door that first time so that I can make an impression and I’m confident I will excel. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m full of anxiety about being out of school without engineering employment for such a length of time – a lot of my daily thoughts are about no one giving my resume the time of day once they see that. I’m pushing through that negativity this time though and am not going to let it hold me back.  I’d eventually like to go back to school for my Masters so that I can pursue my life’s goal/passion of working in the space industry – but first I need to get a job anywhere in the field for some years so that I can manage my student loans and get my life moving forward.  I currently live in the East Bay Area so I’m going to be applying to the various oil refineries and power plants in the Martinez area – as well as anywhere else I can find in the rest of the  Bay Area. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading.  I hope this can stay up - I could use any words of wisdom and advice you can give


&amp;nbsp;


Edit:  Thank you so very much to everyone who has taken the time to share their suggestions with me so far. I have a lot more ideas on how to proceed now and most importantly I'm more optimistic and hopeful. And thank you mods for not taking it down - being able to get this advice is helping a lot.

My last job was a part time law firm job that ended in May, so I have quite a gap in employment. For a variety of reasons, at this point I honestly have no desire to be a lawyer.  I have IP law experience, court internships and customer support experience (pre-law school) working for a tech company. 

I am more interested in working as a licensing associate, contracts manager, in policy etc. (basically, jobs in the legal department of companies, but not in an attorney role). One problem I keep running into is that the job postings will specifically state that the job is a non-attorney job (some will even specify that attorneys will not be considered for the role).  

So my question is, would it be appropriate to reach out to a hiring manager directly via email explaining that I am a JD (not technically an attorney, as I haven't passed the bar), but am genuinely interested in a particular non-attorney position?  Would it make sense to attach a copy of the cover letter and resume I submitted, and use the body of the email to explain why I am interested in the particular job?  

Any advice on how to communicate the fact that I am genuinely interested in a position for the long-term, without sounding insincere?  I'm concerned that I come across as ""overqualified"" or at risk of leaving the company because of my JD (and pending bar results), and I'm not sure how I could go about alleviating that concern. 

I'm starting to feel pretty depressed and really feeling the weight of my mistakes.  Any advice would be much appreciated!"

I am a 25 year old female who was oficially diagnosed with aspergers/ASD in january of this year, though have been aware of my status since early teens. I was diagnosed with severe GAD at fourteen and have had troubles with cutting, eating disorders, debilitating panic attacks and periodically extreme agoraphobia for as long as I can remember.

I was just wondering how many of us are completely unable to work in a professional setting?

I never finished any higher education after the age of 15, and barely attended before that though I graduated with above average results. Between the ages of 17 and 23 I tried to finish more school but never lasted more than a semester at a time at the most. When I moved out at 20 I got financial aid from social services and they also helped me to find an appartment. Usually when you recieve such aid you have to be listed as actively job hunting at the unemployment agency (UA), go to meetings every week and provide documentation for every job you apply to. I went to one meeting at UA and was immediately assessed by their therapist and told I was ""unattractive to the job market"", which I must say I understood. I was put on a waiting list for a program that helps people like me to assimilate into a work place and in the mean time my ""occupation"" was going to therapy twice a week.

After two years on the wait list I got to start in the program, coinciding with me getting pregnant with my son. After a few weeks I got an internship that was at first 15 hours/week and then increased to 20 hours/week. I lasted about 6 months before completely shutting down, stopped going to work and then left the program while my doctor put me on sick leave until my son was born.

After my son was born I had a very hard time just staying alive, long story short I was admitted to a psych ward for a few months with a post partum psychosis that still effects me somewhat 2.5 years later.

Before christmas 2014 my doctors ruled me too unstable to work, all the paper work was filed and I was granted a kind of sick pension along with monthly check-ins with my contact person. My ""occupation"" now is meeting my therapist once a week at the stables and riding/caring for the horses while we have our session. It is very unlikely I will ever work.

These are just the major points of my ""professional"" attempts at, well, anything, but there has been a lot of stress, panic and struggles in between. I know that I have been extremely lucky with how things have turned out and I am so grateful every day for living in a place where it is possible to be granted all this help so I can live a life with as little panic and anxiety as possible.

So, if you got this far, are you unable to work? How does that work in the country you live in? If you have to work in spite of not coping, how do you manage to deal with that?"
2yihn3,4,2015-03-09,I keep getting overlooked...,dtwoprod,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2yihn3/i_keep_getting_overlooked/,"Hi family.

Here's the deal. For five years, i've been out of university and I got only ONE job in my field (Radio, TV, and Film). During my time in school, I worked MANY a/v related jobs and internships to get experience (like The System said to do). I graduate, cater my resume to whatever job i'm looking at and I get the same, tired message:

""Thanks for applying. We found someone more suitable for the job. We'll keep your resume on hold, blah blah blah"".

From 2010 till now, i've worked mainly as a substitute teacher and an English teacher in South Korea. While I was in Asia, I did manage to get a few more media related gigs (independent and with companies). I decided to come back to the states in 2013 to try again. 

I got a job in 2014 as a production assistant at a small TV station. They asked me what I expected and I told them that I expect to get a full time gig within six months. In those six months, I tried two times to get a full time gig (one in the newsroom and one in creative services).

I was denied both. 

The newsroom director said my ""...writing was good but it didn't sound like something reporters would say"". The person that got the gig had the same mistakes I did but still got it. The difference between her and I is she was a recent graduate.

The people in creative services decided to use my editing skills on my sixth month there but they refused to put me on full time payroll. ""We need you to help the editors when they're swamped. We have a full plate and we still don't think you're good enough for this spot.""

After the 8th month, I decided to go back to my parents. It's been the same thing prior to the TV gig and i'm getting real sick of this. I maintain a good attitude and do what i'm supposed to do but I feel as though the RTVF field is very clickish in regards to who they want. Going back to South Korea is an option but i'd like to stick around here at home at least and get a FULL time gig. 

TL;DR Why can't I get a job in my field despite having the experience and catering my resume to what they're looking for?!"

NO, its you again from the VFX ama, get out of here!**

Yes, its me. So I just got a text from my friend linking me to the mod ama or whatever they want to call it, and the first question was regarding about leakers, and people with inside info, and how they're not all to trustable. I had no idea of what happened after I deleted my account last week a few minutes in to the Ama. I was leaving for the night, and decided not to risk it, and delete everything.

Im sorry for leaving you guys in such a bad way, and I hear that some are still interested in what I have to say, and some misintepretated stuff. Instead of doing a review for Avengers 2 I will just do a review to avoid dissapointing answers. 

Before I start I will like to clear some stuff up. Here is something that was posted in the mod q &amp; a that I will like to adress: 
&gt;Someone who actually worked for Marvel came to us with a legit ID and debunked that intern guy.

No, I will not be giving any info other than I work in one of the many departments of VFX for this movie, and thats it. Im sorry if thats dissapointing to hear, but its risky just posting this, and will affect everyone that works with me if I do reveal more info. If you think that this si completely BS then I don't blame you. I would also think that if some random guy claimed to have seen a highly anticipated blockbuster, and would not believe him a slight bit. I don't blame you, you'll be able to see if im lying or not when the movie comes out.

**REVIEW:** So, it turns out that I left people thinking that this was going to be a bad movie, and that's not what this is. In my AMA somoeone asked how was teh movie, adn I responded 'dissapointing', and will like to clear things up. Dissapointing? Yes. Bad? NO.

Age of Ultron starts out real strong, and starts out running with a action scene taking place in the snowy forest from the trailer which is probably one of the coolest intros to a movie I have ever seen. After that we get into the story, which I will be refrainign the best from spoiling, and meet Stark who has been working in the Ultron program [SPOILERS... I REPEAT SPOILERS FROM HERE ON!] since Iron Man 3. Yes, some of the Iron Suits we see in the movie are test dummies for Ultron, and without revealing too much, are blueprints. From this point on the movie starts getting a bit wobbly. There is just WAYYYY too much going on, and we have not even assembled the whole team by then. By the time we get to the party scene shown in the trialer theres already several plot lines going on, and some of them do a real bad job at making sense, adn connecting with each other.

The real problems with the movie are two things: Too much going on, and basically feeling like its a remix of the first movie with robots. We have multiple plot lines going on, and not a lot of them connect with each other till the very end, and they do so very forcefully as if they had forgotten to end them till they were in post production. The twins are pretty much the only subplot that did not feel rushed or too much, and its a shame since we do get some nice Civil War build up which by the end gets exhausting.

The other problem is that its really just felt like a filler movie when its supposed to be so much more. I felt like I was watching the first Avengers with robots added in, and a darker tone. Was it better? YES! It was a bit better than the first one, but just didn't feel special anymore, and had more problems than the first one overall making my experience with this one a bit less fun.

**IS IT BAD!?**

No. The movie chews too much for what it can actually swallow, but the upside is that we do get some really interesting plot lines (which if there weren't as many plot lines as there is already would have been even better) like the obvious lead up to Civil War. We got to see some really awesome cameos, and more violent scenes than ever before seen in a Marvel movie. Ultron is badass till the last quarter of the movie where he goes from being a kickass robot to a generic ruler of robot armies.

Overall the movie is good, but the fact that so many of the movies before it were great makes this movie disappointing. Its still a very enjoyable experience if you accept now that the movies have reached peak quality, and that your going to see a summer blockbuster (Another point! The movie almost felt like I was watching Transformers at some points), and you shouldn't really expect the coming of Christ or something. Take your favorite marvel movie, and you'll get just about that. You get loads of good stuff in the movie, but in the end the cons outweigh it just a bit.

This is one of those examples of hype killing a movie, and biting more than you can possibly chew leading you to drop some stuff throughout the way. In those regards it felt a bit like a higher quality situation of The Amazing Spider-Man 2  from last year.

Anyways, sorry if this is written horribly. Im not a reviewer by any means.

Lower your expectations. Go watch the movie. Enjoy it. Sadly I had really high expectations that might have made the difference in whether I liked it or not."
2yipfl,13,2015-03-09,Taking CS courses as a non-major,EggSandwhichKing,UCSantaBarbara,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/2yipfl/taking_cs_courses_as_a_nonmajor/,"Hi all!

My query is in the title. That is, have any of you taken CS courses as a non-major (e.g. higher level than CS16). I am a math student but aim to be a professional software developer. I do a lot of programming in my free time but find that internships tend to put a lot of weight on having taken the actual coursework. As a result, I have decided to take as much CS as I can -- but am unsure of how to go about this considering most of the classes are restricted to me. 

Any suggestions, similar experiences, or horror stories?

Thanks!"

2yiqaf,2,2015-03-09,Need some advice on what to do next,ChainSmokingPanda,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2yiqaf/need_some_advice_on_what_to_do_next/,"I'm currently a senior in high school, and have dealt with very severe depression for the past 4 years. I've been hospitalized twice and have been in therapy for over two years now. Additionally, I've been prescribed probably six different medications at various points over the past two years. Anyway, I just wanted to establish some background about me and my history with depression.

In the past couple of months I've improved significantly and that reached a peak on Friday, but now I'm starting to feel the depression coming back, even if it's just slightly. Currently I'm at a really tough crossroad in my life, and I'm feeling very anxious and slightly depressed because of it. Ironically, the same news that made me feel the happiest I've ever been (or close to it) is what's causing this anxiety and depression.

So the story behind it is that last week a company flew me out to California to interview at their offices for a few days for a summer internship position. I have always loved the area their company is in (the San Francisco Bay Area) and I really love what the company is working on and my experience there for the three days was amazing. The team was super friendly, and I felt like it was a good fit for me.

Well, I got home on Wednesday night, and then Friday night I got a call from one of the co-founders extending me an offer. Apparently the entire engineering team felt like I was a good fit to work there. The offer was far better than I had imagined. $4500 a month for two months, and the option to come on full-time at the end if I feel like it's a good fit for me, at which point compensation would increase. So now here I am, 17 years old, with the potential to be making probably $65,000 salary straight out of high school at what is sort of a dream job for me.

However, I'm already admitted to university and have a decent scholarship for that as well. My parents very much want me to go to college. The problem is that I'd be making more if I take the job offer I have than the average salary for people who graduate with a 4-year degree in the field I want to pursue. In addition, the tech industry puts large emphasis on experience. So 4 years from now, when I would just be graduating with a bachelor's degree, I could already have 4 years industry experience. 

Besides my parents wanting me to go to college, I also kind of want to as well. I think the social aspect of it could be great for me with depression and all and just a more comprehensive education could be good. 

I basically have two good options for how to move forward. Take a high-paying job that I'll most likely love, or do the typical college experience (which will actually cost me money versus making a lot of money), which I also would probably enjoy quite a bit though. The choice is so difficult :( And as I'm trying to decide I can feel myself dropping in mood and I'm worried things will get bad again if I don't just make a decision and feel happy about it. I want to hear other peoples' opinions besides my parents, because I feel like they're close minded to anything that's not traditional, but any input for either side is welcome."

2yj1ny,3,2015-03-10,I dislike my life.,Bronzehawkattack,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2yj1ny/i_dislike_my_life/,"Those of you who dont want to read a teenage boy rant on about how he dislikes his life please move on.

To start off, I dont feel like life is worth living. The things I get enjoyment out of are small things like videogames and anime, and those are two reasons why I dont just let myself die. Its so weird how a large reason I want to continue living is to see the end of an anime I love, or the sequel to a game I want to play. Another reason is that I want to live to a point where technology will be good enough where I can feel like im living in my fantasy worlds that ive dreamed up since I was like 7. It doesnt exactly feel plausible but I have hope. Another reason I dont want to die is my Dad, my Mom and my best friend. I feel like all of them would be sad if I died, I dont want them to feel like I do. This feeling fucking hurts, but as time goes on and the future looks more and more bleak the reasons I want to die start to outweight the bad. Ill try to list of negatives from the most minor to the more serious ones.

- I have horrible acne that wont fucking go awat. My face looks fucked up enough as it is but the acne just makes it worse. This will sound self-entitled as fuck, but I dont want to go through so much effort to stop the acne. Its unfair that everyone else I know doesnt have to worry, they dont have to use face cleaning products and shif. Worst part is, is that recently ive taken my parents advice and started using a face cleanser and the acne seems like its just multiplying if anything.

- Im a fucking loser. Seriously, i look up to and wish to replicate fictional characters. Everything I do is me just trying to be a shitty imitation of fictional characters I respect. I realized this a long time ago though, what I just recently realized though is that ill never be able to be like them. Not even the most realistic characters (Except for fucking Tomoko from Watamote, I seem to be the real life incarnation of her except male), I wished I lived in a fantasy so bad but I just dont. Im always being smacked back to reality by adults, no matter how hard I believe I can be something an adult has to play the reality card on me. Because if theres one thing adults hate, its teenagers who think they're special. I know I wont be able to be amazing at anything I do but fuck, please atleast allow me to think it. I dont care if its a dellusion I just need something to live for. Ive been off topic on this bullet point for awhile so let me go on the next already.

- Im either average or bad at everything I do. I literally go to the WORST school in my county, yet I cant even make the honor roll. Im not even at the top of my class at anything, and if I went to even a decent school I would quickly be the worst in my class as the recent standardized test I took proved. I admit this isnt to no fault of my own, im fucking lazy and cant pay attention to shit. I always find myself daydreaming about how good I am at something or how prepared id be for something a regular person wouldnt be, when in reality id break down like any regular person. Even at the things I take pride in such as videogames, I get my ass handed to me by people on a regular basis. Anyways you get the point by now.

- Theres one basis for everything I wanted to do in life yet im losing faith in. The basis for every decision i make is to help other people, and I take other people into consideration a lot. But im losing faith for multiple reasons that range from bullies in school to the assholes I see on the internet. Ive learned recently that a large amount of people are assholes. I dont feel like elaborating too much on this because we all browse reddit and we all know how awful people are on here.

- Im bullied in school a bit. Fortunately its not as bad as last year because these bullies atleast dont straight up say what they want to say to my face. Last year was the worst because they would make it very clear they were disgusted with my existence, if one of the bullies got paired up with me they would all have to say something. I never even did anything to them either, thats what hurts me the most. I dont have to provoke anyone yet ill still be the enemy of people. Its so unfair, whether im out in the real world where it will be my skin color, or in school where they just hate people as a spirt ill always be unwanted. And teachers see the ways some students treat others and dont say a thing at this school. They dont care about us, why should they when theyre teaching at a shitty school in the first place.

- Even disregarding everything I said earlier, I feel like this last reason is the main reason I want to just die and thats because I feel my future is bleak. Im not in a position headed for success and I feel ill never be. Im ugly, I go to a shitty school, I get shitty grades, my family isnt exactly rolling in money, college costs money and I have none of that, even if I take out debt to put myself through college ill still have the problem of living long enough to find a place to intern at all while trying to sustain myself, then after that getting a real job will be a bitch if I even get to this point, then ill be in my 30s after finally being able to get a job but now im in debt. Yayyyy welcome to the game of life, want to play again? I wont even have time to enjoy shit during all this. After highschool my life will be all down hill. I plan to kill myself after its over for this reason. 

These arent even all my reasons for why I want to die either, but at this point I just want to get to bed so I can get tomorrows schoolday over with.

And thank you ahead of time for anyone who took the time to read that shit and thank you even more if you respond. I just needed a place to rant and get help, thank you."
2yj2ko,30,2015-03-10,I've accepted an offer right after college ends. Now someone else wants to interview me? What is the proper protocol here?,rocketsox,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yj2ko/ive_accepted_an_offer_right_after_college_ends/,"Hello!

So I actually double-majored in computer science and meteorology. I'm currently in my last semester! Yay!
I don't have any internship experience with computer science, but I did do a nice internship with NASA before my senior year started. My current GPA is 4.0.


Last semester, I went to a career fair at my school. There I met with a couple companies, and one of them gave me an interview right after the fair. I was asked for a second interview, and then they offered me a job.

The salary is 55k and the job title is Software Testing Analyst. This offer was given to me in December and I had to two weeks to accept or decline (I thought this odd since I wouldn't be working for them until June). The company is very large and the location I would be at is in the southwest. 

First off, is this a good offer? My boyfriend keeps saying I could do much better, but I think for the southwest this is pretty common? I'm not really sure. I thought it was about 50-60k starting.

Anyways.

I ended up accepting the offer. Many people close to me lost their jobs recently, so I was a bit anxious about just getting a job after college in general. I did research the company a bit and most people seem to enjoy working there. The benefits are great, they have a good amount of paid holidays and vacation time, etc...

Well, I had emailed another company that I met at the career fair shortly after it was over inquiring as to when a good time to apply would be (since I wouldn't be graduating till next semester). They never replied. Until today. I just got a voicemail from them asking if I was still interested.

I was quite interested in them at the career fair. But I've already accepted the offer from this bigger company. My boyfriend and my family keep telling me to try for it. But I'm not sure if that's bad practice. 

Any advice/insight is appreciated :)

TL;DR: Accepted an offer in December for a large company. Don't start till June because I'm graduating this semester. Another company has asked me for an interview recently. What do?"

2yj510,18,2015-03-10,"Someone talk some sense into me before I give up, please!",random1925,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2yj510/someone_talk_some_sense_into_me_before_i_give_up/,"So I graduated college last year (22 years old). I did very well in school, majored in math + economics and minored in a natural science (almost entirely straight a's, typically one of the best students in each class). Since then I have applied to hundreds of jobs... and so far the only ones I have been able to get have been a temp job filing papers and an internship that ended a few months ago. Since graduating I have taught myself enough programming to build an android app and I believe I am also very good at finance. (At least eneough for an entry level position).

Anyways, about trying to attain financial independence... since junior high one of my favorite hobbies has been investing, trading, and speculating. Since junior high I have managed to turn $100 into $100k+. My goal has always been early retirement, or to just become a professional investor, even before reading MMM and reading about FI online.

So now I have about $100k saved, hopefully some of which is for a down payment on a house ""someday"". I have some business ideas I think can be lucrative, other ideas to bring in some income on the side, etc... but only **AFTER I FIND A JOB.**

I am tired of sending out resume after resume to jobs i know I can do and hearing nothing back, going to interviews and feeling like i did great - and then waiting weeks to hear back nothing. I am sick of the look on peoples faces when i tell them no i do not have a full time job yet, trying to explain my life to people in every conversation so they don't blow me off as an unemployed loser, trying as hard as possible socializing and making small-talk when I hate it. It is painful to see my neighbors and extended family slowly losing faith in me, making remarks about how I should have been an engineer or should try to get a phd and become a professor. If i get a masters degree I want it to be after i have some experience, if i ever want a phd it will only be for the knowledge.

But now I am rapidly losing my self-esteem, confidence, etc. and I am worried that my trading - that I have done so well with - will start to go south. I have only allowed myself to swing trade with a small amount (like $3-4k) and this has led me to missing out on thousands of dollars in profits over the last 3-6 months as I was not using about 50-75% of the money I keep for trading. I will not try to trade with more until my confidence is back, and I really want to stop trading altogether after I get a job - I try to explain to employers the trading was just my job during hs/college.

Anyway, in the last couple months I have started thinking more and more about just traveling around the world for some time. I have read so many blogs about how you should travel while your young, how cheap it can be to travel (like $15k a year for a single guy)... I am so tempted to just say screw everything, let me see how far I can stretch $100k traveling throughout my 20's (I also have no student debt). Now I am starting to rationalize it by imagining I come up with some great business idea while gone, or that I will ""break out of my shell"", etc, and I really do not know what to do.

Every day I feel a little bit less sure about myself, a tad bit more insecure, and more confused in general - if you have any advice please let me know! Thank you very much.

**Update:** Thank you very much everyone for your thoughtful responses. I will save this post so I can come back and review what everyone has said from time to time and try to reply to everyone today or tomorrow."
2yj5fq,6,2015-03-10,[support] I can't get time to myself,PoliteMeow,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2yj5fq/support_i_cant_get_time_to_myself/,"I guess I'll start by saying, I'm a very strong introvert. I do well at tasks where I'm alone. I can't be around crowds without warning or for long durations. I suffer from general anxiety and bouts of depression - particularly when I'm feeling over stimulated (socially). 

I moved, with my husband, 500 miles away from home last May. I worked at an internship that was M-F 9-5(or later) and he's a landscaper who's hours are usually M-F 7-3. Throughout the summer, I never got the opportunity to be home, alone, for more than a couple hours. My internship sometimes had me interacting with up to 700 teenagers for 4-7 hours. So, mentally I would get very very worn out. It takes a decent amount of alone time for me to recharge after bigger events like the one I mentioned. During the summer I had a lot of meltdowns because I couldn't stop feeling exhausted. 

Directly following the summer, I started my grad program. I work 9-2 and have classes 4-7.  I fell into a similar issue with having no personal time. Occasionally my husband would go away to a game shop for a couple hours, which helped but I could never count on or schedule any recovery time. 

In December a good friend of mine failed out of college. Her parents are both deceased and she has little funds ($3 to her name) and little experience. My husband and I have offered her our guest bedroom (my office) until she can get on her feet. She's been at our house 24/7 (minus her random Tinder dates on nearly every weekend) and has begun acting entitled. 

This has made me crave time alone as I can feel myself getting bottled up. I try very hard to be kind and compassionate but have a low tolerance when someone abuses my kindness. She frequently complains about the food we have, despite there being variety and selections made exclusively for her. She wants to only eat meat and my other protein sources (the expensive stuff). We buy sides (rice, potatoes, green beans, carrots, pasta, fruit,bread, etc) to try and make what little groceries we have go further. But every week I end up eating exclusively sides because the meat is gone by Wednesday.  The idea being you get a serving of meat, have a couple sides (veggie, starch, and a fruit) and it'll last the week. Every week she's in my expensive protein powders (that were gifts; 3 scoops at a time) and refusing to eat things that she ate just a week before (like hotdogs or turkey). 

It hads't helped that her and my husband have become at odds with each other. They did like one another and now I feel like I have to play middleman at all times (he's 28 and she's 22) to make sure there are no blowups.  

This week she finally started a job, after slacking off of applications because, ""we wouldn't take her to go get some"". I gave her my bus pass, but ""the bus freaks her out"". Her license got suspended because she got a speeding ticket out of state and never paid it. So even if I did want to insure her and let her drive, legally she can't. Secondly, when I did take her application hunting - we went to more than 30 places. Two, yes two, had paper applications. All the rest were online. I get upset because it's easy to look up businesses in the area and their applications. If it's not on Indeed, Monster, or Craigslist she didn't apply. We had a discussion about this and it didn't come back up. 

Her new tick is to expect rides to work, despite being given a bus pass (meaning I can't use my own pass because I am lending it to her). I am on Spring Break, but my GAship has me coming in for two days. She woke me up on Saturday saying she was ready (at 7 in the morning). Didn't ask if I'd take her, just assumed I wanted to cart her ass around. I don't. I want her to be independent and begin learning how to live on her own. Her dumb ass keeps talking about getting a dog and moving out and she barely has three days of work under her belt - at a temporary job, no less. 

I give her advice about making better and more realistic decisions. She keeps thinking she'll be able to leave in 6 weeks and pay for an apartment. No consistent job history, a seasonal temp job, and no savings... I told her what was realistic. She needs to pay off that speeding ticket debt. It's on her credit report. She could get better jobs once that's cleared. She wants them to garnish her wages. So she can buy ""nice food"", new workout pants, and go out. She is trying to avoid the whole discussion we had in December - once she gets a job she's to pay a percentage of the rent (a little less than 1/3. 150 and the full rent is 600) and a third of each utility. I find myself wanting to crawl under a rock. 

I got excited when I thought she would be working all week and I could finally have my coveted day to myself. Her hours got cut - not by any fault of hers. So she doesn't work till Saturday. I feel completely crushed. I can't tell her to go somewhere, she doesn't have anywhere. She can't drive and she has no money. It's up to Tinder guys to pay for her activities.. So they aren't scheduled with any certainty. I regret having invited her now that she's acting like a brat. 

Just last week she ""decided"" she wasn't doing the dishes any more (her one chore) because she wanted my husband to apologize for being blunt (which he won't and shouldn't). I ended up having to do them. There has been a huge influx of issues since February. 

I can't get her to clean anything (we live in a TINY little house, with all wood floors) without getting made to feel like a slave driver. We don't allow guest over unless everything is clean (kitchen, living room, bathsroom). She asks to have random dudes over (assuming she asks) then gets in the shower leaving my husband and I to clean. She doesn't care if the place looks like a pig sty.  We have two cats and two dogs. There is a lot of fur. A lot. And it's been raining. There is a lot of mud. We basically want the couch lysoled (it's vinyl), the floors swept/swiffered, sink clean, and the surfaces wiped off. Nothing excessive. I'm not asking for base boards to be cleaned with toothpicks or something else ridiculous. 

I'm about to lose my mind. I thought I'd get a day alone once this year but it isn't looking good. I have a fellowship this summer where I will have roommates as well. It's starting to feel crushing and overwhelming. I don't really know what's my best solution. I've stopped trying to talk sense into my bratty ""roommate"" - she apparently wants to learn the hard way. Maybe by fall I'll see what being isolated in my own house is like. 

I have gone for walks, gone to the gym, and done activities alone but nothing replaces being home alone with my pets and my thoughts. I get such a mood and mental boost. "

Usually I know it's a lie and usually I'm sure they're just trying not to hurt my feelings so I've never called anyone out on it.

Enter Roa (not her real name). She's a freshman at my university, from Indonesia and she's the kind of beauty that actually makes my heart stop. She's also very sweet and shy and funny, so we hit it off, but she had a boyfriend back in Jakarta. Emphasis on had. So I ask her out to dinner since she's stuck at university over spring break with no one to hang out with and I'll be back in town for an afternoon for an internship interview (I know, ladies. I'm so on top of it).

Anyway, I'm super jazzed about this because this is my first date in a while and I really think we have some chemistry (never been a good judge of that though, I suppose). So she texts me today saying that her dad back in Jakarta ""found out"" about spring break and didn't want her to be alone so he ""bought her a ticket to **New Jersey** to visit some family."" 

She apologized and asked to reschedule for after spring break, and of course I accepted, even though I was and still am a little disappointed.

I don't think she's the kind of girl to play me like that. She's too straightforward to play games. But I've misjudged that before and really been hurt. And in my more naive years I fell for some outrageous lies only to be crushed later. (For example, for homecoming freshman year of high school I asked a girl to the dance, and she told me she wasn't going because she was in the state finals of a *sport shooting league* and I not only believed her, I told her how cool that was and wished her luck. Well guess who I saw at homecoming? It's been a lot of that ever since.)

So as much as I want to believe Rao's story and that she actually does want to go out with me for dinner, I can't shake this doubt and borderline resentment instilled in me by a majority of my advances ending in me being played a fool. I still want to see her, but part of me is betting that she'll postpone for one reason or another again, and again, and again and I'll just keep forgiving her and complying because I don't want to rock the boat. And I really want things to work out with this girl.

So tell me, /r/datingadvice, am I being paranoid and immature? Or are my concerns valid? And either way, what do I do about it? If I realize she's stringing me along how do I handle it? If she isn't how can I rid myself of this pessimism? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.

As an endnote I'd like to add that after reading this over I realize I might come across as a bit contemptuous towards women because of what I've said. Please know that is not the case. I don't hate women but I do have a history of being a bad judge of character. And there are several instances where I was kind of a douche, so I'm no saint or victim here. Just wanted to clear the air on that.

**TL;DR** Girl postponed date. This has happened a lot and usually ends in me being flaked out on. I think this girl is different but I'm not sure. Please help."

2yk7az,3,2015-03-10,Is it possible to automatically link a new table in a new separate tab to an existing overview table in a different tab,[deleted],excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2yk7az/is_it_possible_to_automatically_link_a_new_table/,"I'm currently interning at a company and I have a question.

Every month my department has a specific meeting. One person makes minutes of this meeting (in Word) and I (the intern) have been compiling these minutes of past meetings into one spreadsheet. This is done to get an overview of the topics that are discussed. With pivot tables, we can get an idea of how important certain subjects are.

Now I'm trying to make a template so that (in the future) the person who makes the minutes, can immediately write them in Excel, and immediately see the impact it has on the overview.

How I have everything set up now: one excel file, the first sheet is the overview of all the meetings (in a table) with their topics and such, the following sheets are all the separate meetings. I already linked them so that when I change something in f.e. jan'14, it changes the same cell in the overview table.

My question now is: can I make it so that every time a new month(sheet) is added to the file (so after a new meeting was held), it can automatically add the contents of the new sheet into the overview table (first sheet).

I was also thinking of changing it so that every single month is a separate excel file and there is 1 file with just the overview, but I wasn't sure if I could get them to link properly then?

Any suggestions are great. I just want to make it easy so that the next person doesn't have to copy, paste and link everything every single month, but just has to press a button (or two) and it does it for them.

Or do I have to provide separate tabs for the upcoming months already in advance? That's doesn't sound like the best solution for the future though?"

So I recently graduated with a masters and bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from a decently respected college. During my studies, I've done several internships and am currently on my third. At all of these jobs, I thought that this wasn't what I want to do and have just begun to realize that mechanical engineering in industry is not for me, despite loving the theory I did in school.

I plan on getting a doctorate and while researching topics, I became really interested in computer science, specifically distributive computing and artificial intelligence. I taught myself Java and c++ and have loved every minute of it, but I'm having trouble convincing colleges that I would be a good doctoral candidate as I do not have any computing background. 

Although I would love to go back to college and get a formal undergraduate education in cs, I cannot afford it. Do any of you guys have any advice for me to break into a new industry or make myself more appealing to universities?"

He had an internship there the year before and didn't get to travel much so we went that year to do some touring. 

We were in Xian, the city with the Terracotta Army and were staying at a nice budget hotel, City Hotel, near all the touristy attractions. They gave us a room with two twin beds on the 6th floor for the week we would be there. 

On the 3rd night, Tom and I decided to sleep on one twin bed. I had my leg over him while we snuggled before sleeping. After a half hour of trying to fall asleep, I felt some fingers prod my chest down my stomach to my thigh then it stopped. The prodding was hard but the movement felt like someone trying to play piano. I yelled at Tom, asking him why he did that to me. I turned on the lights and moved to the vacant twin bed. I was mad since we both were tired and I didn't know why he would hurt me or touch me so awkwardly. After 5 minutes, Tom still didn't turn off the lights so I yelled at him to turn them off and fell asleep angry and grouchy. 

The next day, he told me that he didn't touch me and that he felt the prodding too because, after it poked my chest, he felt the prodding along his legs, down his calf to his feet. He thought it was me but when I yelled at him, he knew there was something else in the room, hence why he didn't want to turn off the lights. He stayed up all night in the dark and didn't tell me because he didn't want to scare me. I felt so bad and apologized profusely. 

We were scared now since we still had 3 more days in this hotel and had no explanation for how we got touched. We had food sitting out in the room so if it was a mouse or rat, then they would have gone to the food and we would have heard some rustling. We were on the 6th floor so no one could have gotten in and out of our room...unless they were already in there before we got there, but we also heard nothing else in that room or anyone exiting. For the next 3 days, I did not sleep until we left the city for good. We aren't believers in ghosts but can't explain what it was that touched us. It definitely freaked us out though."

I'm an incoming student who will be studying Economics and Business with Eastern European Studies at UCL starting this September. I have always been interested in consulting, and I want to make the most of my time at university to network and try to decide for certain if consulting is something I want to/am able to make a career out of. So I have a couple questions:

1. Do top consulting firms recruit from UCL? Clearly I'd love to start a career off at companies like MBB, but of course I'm interested in other firms as well. I want to be sure that I do everything possible to make sure I can land a good job out of university.

2. What are some tips for networking and connecting with potential employers? Are there any activities/societies I should involve myself in that will impress a consulting firm? What other consulting-centric things can I do at uni that will help me kickstart a career?

3. Are there any great consulting firms out there that I don't know about, but should keep my eye on? I'm pretty new at this, so basically all I know are the really big ones (McKinley, Bain, Boston).

4. Any other advice, especially related to networking and internships, is VERY much appreciated.

As a side note, I'm also open to working in Eastern Europe, especially Russia or Poland. I speak Russian nearly fluently so language is not an issue. Would consulting firms consider this a plus, or would they not care if I'm bilingual?

Thank you! Once again, I can use all the advice I can get, and any information you can provide is truly a huge help to me. :)"

The recruiter sent me to another recruiter (from a different company).
I found it strange, but figured it wasn't a reason to stop pursuing the job.


It took weeks for him to set up the interview, which he blamed on their end.


I finally got to the interview, I thought it went swimmingly.
We had good chemistry.
In regard to the coding question, they mentioned that the one they usually use would be to easy, which I found very odd. ( it was to write a method that calculates area of a rectangle and prints if it is a square). So in the end I drew out a diagram of of how the rails framework works.


Based on all this, I felt great about the interview. All my instincts told me it went well.
At that point I asked the recruiter for contact info for a thank you note. He said to send it to him, and he would pass it on (not ideal, but fine).


He called me later to say they rejected me due to lack of experience.
I am suspicious, as they had literally said I was too advanced for their usual coding questions.


I asked him for the contact info, no response.
I tried to find the contact info for the people I interviewed with, but to no avail, I an going to try again by going  through the main office HR.


My questions are: would I run into issues by going to a company directly and asking  for feedback (or an internship) because I went through a recruiter first?
Is it crazy to be suspect of the recruiting people involved for the decision in this case?

Any other thoughts or advice would be welcome and appreciated

In november last year, I had a drunk threesome gone wrong whereby I couldnt get it up to integrate with my Gf at the time. She labelled it as cheating and eventually we got back together. Last month she tells me she wanted to make us even...

My ex-girlfriend - H - recently broke up with me whilst I was home from university (We both go to the same uni, same halls of residence) after telling me she had ""got with someone else whilst drunk"", she didn't have the balls to tell me who it was so waited until I returned to uni and waited for him to tell me. Turns out it was a very close friend of mine. I was told it was just a kiss. Her and me had a huge argument that night and she storms round to his. 

The week before we had been together but wasnt labelled as a relationship (I know, it's a get out clause for her - I realise that now) but she would tell me she loved me and we slept together often. She got very annoyed that I claimed we were in a relationship and we had got back together. 

Whilst I go for a cigarette to clear my mind I run into two of her close friends who I also know and tell them whats going on and that she was round at his having sex with him at that moment. When H returns, they confront her about it and the next day she gets arsey with me saying they were just talking and that was it. Completely guilt tripped me for telling her friends a ""lie"". Couple days pass where she had been fine with me, telling me it was just a kiss and nothing else and for me to 'stop overthinking', even hugging me a lot aswell. 

I woke up very early the next day at around 7:30 am and I went to the common room to get some water, when she was coming back to her room, she said she had gone to the canteen to get breakfast (She never did this), I knew she had stayed at his but I wanted to hear it from her, she acted fine with me that day, asking me to drive her to go see her horse and was all smiley, still saying she had slept at her own room and I was wrong.

I confronted my 'close friend' about it where he told me it wasnt just a kiss, they had been sleeping together since the weekend, and that the night she stormed round to his, they slept together. It tore at me deep inside as I had been strung along, told it was all okay so obviously my feelings wouldn't leave for her that week. If I had been told straight up everything, I would instantly have gone no contact and deleted her. I confronted her and she said ""oo am I in trouble"" then after the argument went and told her friends whilst laughing about it. 

This weekend, I told her (all lies) that I was going home for a week from uni to decide whether or not to leave my uni course as I had been accepted to do an internship graduate course at a big company. So I wouldnt see her again. She got very emotional and accepted that me leaving was her fault which it kind of was. Before I left early in the morning, she comes to my door and we have a huge talk where she says she still has feelings for me and she misses me, she kisses me then we had sex and says that she wants to see me again. I know she was trying to get control but I bloody fell for it. 

Today, she puts on her snapchat that ""she had hadnt felt this happy in a long time"" with hearts and shit, then snapchats me saying they're in a relationship, pretty much showing she was naked in the dudes bed.

I'm trying to get over her but I still love her. It's as if shes testing to see how far she can push me so she can show off.

I've deleted her off everything but I'm seriously struggling with the urge to talk to her. I can't stand that she's doing this and playing with my emotions so much, I'm angry that I'm letting myself be played with aswell. I can't go and find another girl as an outlet because I feel theres no-one else.

She put that snapchat out to get my attention. To boast in my face because she knows how shit I will feel over it.

 This was my first serious relationship aswell so I'm not used to feeling this shit after I invest all my love into someone to have it stomped upon like this.

**tl;dr**: Ex-Gf broke up with me says she wasnt ready for a serious relationship then sleeps with my close friend then I find out a week later despite her denying it all that week. She's now in a relationship after stringing me along and then sleeping with me again. How can I get over this?"

I'm currently starting my third unpaid internship working with a non profit start up because it's related to what I'm planning on doing for Grad school.  My previous two internships were a campaign internship (2 months) and a Senate Aide internship with a U.S. Senator (3 months). Neither of these internships offered a paid position during or after completing the internship and were explicitly for experience. Any possibilities for employment would mean relocation and an industry I'm not keen to work in (long hours, high turn over).

I'm desperately trying to find something. I've been applying endlessly to entry level administrative positions. I've joined an employment agency and performed very well on all the testing - proficient in word suite, professional level typing/data entry speed/accuracy.  Although I haven't seen so much as a 1 day offer from the job agency.

Collectively I have 5 months of office experience through my internships working directly with the public doing phone calls, scheduling, data entry,drafting official correspondences, public interface, recruiting/organizing volunteers, research, writing, etc. 

I'm currently working at Macy's as a sales associate. I've stayed purely because I'd like to have a current employer to list on my resume, although I do perform well at my job (top sales/credit performer) and I'm well liked by management. They've been entirely supportive of my plans to move onto better things as well. 

I'm at the point where when interviewing for low paying jobs I encounter a lot of scrutiny and suspicion from employers who assume I can easily find a better jobs. The decent entry level positions I'm applying to are completely unresponsive.

Location is a bit of a challenge. I currently live in a fairly rural area with a small metro area nearby and job prospects are rough. The majority of jobs are medical/insurance related and require special knowledge. I just received another rejection email from a insurance company in the middle of typing this.


I'd love any advice on how to improve my current position/ resume. I'm just at a loss of what to do to improve my chances of landing anything beyond minimum wage.

However, I am not doing well.  I got a 50% for the first midterm, while the average was 75%.  My homework grade is around a 70%.  The course grade is 25% homework and 75% exams.

It seems that the optimistic situation would be 70s for the other two exams.  That would give me a D in the course.

The drop deadline is in a few days, so I can't hold on to see how I do on the second midterm.  I am strongly considering dropping the class because my GPA is already not good (2.95 out of 4).  I know many companies do not ask for GPA/transcript, but there are still many that do.  Either way, I would like an acceptable GPA.  If things go worse than expected, I might fail the class.

However I hesitate dropping because this class is fundamental for CS theory and interviews.  I have done two internships in the past three years of college, one at a well-known company, one not.  I will be returning to the well-known company for another internship this summer.  But the truth is I am weak in technical interviews.  I have not read CTCI and there are many interview areas where I am unfamiliar with and would probably fail.  I had several interviews for this summer but got rejected from all of them, which is why I accepted the return internship at last-year's company.  I know I can study interviewing on my own, but it would be more convenient to do it while taking the algorithms course and get it out of the way.  Also, many sophomores are taking it, so if I dropped and took it next semester as a senior it would make me even more behind.

As to why I am doing poorly, I am taking this along with four other math/CS classes, so I am always tired and stressed.  I go to sleep around 4am most nights and wake up in the afternoon, missing most lectures.  But it has been more than a year that I've had this habit of sleeping late, not going to lecture,s and cramming for homework and exams, and I feel like I don't learn well during lectures anymore (yes I'm not the best student).

So I would appreciate your advice on whether I should drop the class and why.

Summary

Yes drop: probably get D or even fail, bad GPA, some companies care about grades

No drop: material is important for interviews, get required class over with

I was a cocktail waitress on my good weeks and a flat out drunk on my bad weeks. I partied hard, forgot to clean the litter box, and came to school hungover every morning. I was, to put it mildly, a wild child. 

I was in the process of de-tangling myself from a long time boyfriend and trying not to fail out of the very expensive private college my parents sent me to. I'm surprised my husband looked twice at me. 

***

One weekend, my parents were driving six hours away to pick up a loom (my mom picks up habits, drop serious money on them, then moves on--right now it's weaving). They asked me to come home (about two hours away) and watch their ranchette. 

In the process of getting my life in order I'd picked up extra hours at my work study, I was an art model, and I had a steady internship. In order to get all my work done, I wouldn't leave until Friday. My mother was convinced that I would be arriving at their house by noon and had an absolute breakdown when I told her the earliest I would get there was six or seven. 

Keep in mind that they wouldn't even be there. They had left already and refused to stop and see me (even though my college was on the way) because...I don't know. Because. 

But my mother absolutely *freaked.* She started crying, apologizing for not giving me enough money so that I didn't have to work. Like I was punishing her by getting jobs and being independent. It was so weird, and she never got over it. For months she would ask if I needed more money, so I could come and visit them. As if I got jobs specifically to make her feel guilty.

***

*Edited to add another crazy story*

When I graduated college, my parents and my mom's sister were there (along with Husband). I'd confided in my mother that I'd had an...affair? maybe? (It was an inappropriate relationship, at least) with one of my professors. When I'd broken up with him, he made life...difficult. I confided this in my mother as well. 

So here we are, the five of us, at the *Presidential Dinner* and this professor walks up and shakes everyone's hand. I'm clearly uncomfortable and make polite small talk, but turn to leave with my husband and mingle with other people. My mother takes this moment, in front of hundreds of people (students and their family) at a presidential event at a prestigious private school, to start yelling at this professor. She unloads on him, exposing the relationship I had with him and the subsequent troubles we'd had. It was *awful.* I turned and asked her what the hell she thought she was doing. She and my dad pull out their favorite line.

""Since we paid for this, we have every right to do what ever we want.""

So yeah. That's how my parents ruined my college graduation. 

***

Last week, when the infamous fight happened, my mom attacked me for not coming and visiting them more. I see them probably twice a month (they drive up often), but haven't had the time to drive down and see them for quite a while--maybe seven months? Keep in mind that I called my mom *every day.* 

She, and my father, blamed my lack of visiting on my husband. He was clearly abusing me and wouldn't let me see my parents. Obviously they had to get me out. 

They were completely serious. 

I pointed out that I was no longer in college and worked full time. My husband often works Saturdays, so the only day we have together is Sunday. There are *real-life, adult reasons* that I can't come see them every other weekend, but they're convinced it's because my saint of a husband is abusing me. 

What is narcissism about? Weird shit like this. "

2ym2fc,3,2015-03-10,Old lessor trying to charge 15 grand. Help!,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ym2fc/old_lessor_trying_to_charge_15_grand_help/,"So I posted this early yesterday with no response.  I am trying again to see if it gains any traction.

Hi LegalAdvice! So I have a bit of a story and I want to preface it by saying that I should have looked for help sooner but was stupid about it. So I am in grad school right now but last year I was only here for half a year due to graduating early. In order to avoid subletting I joined my girlfriend at her apartment building where she actually worked and lived. In order for me to legally live there they had me sign the lease that she was already on. She worked for her rent basically and told me every month that it was fully paid off. Fast forward a bit and I moved out in December for an internship and because of graduation. (Note, this original lease was for August 2013 to July 2014.)

Towards the end of the school year (May or so) she told me that she was basically forced out of her job and this place had basically terminated her lease. She moved somewhere else in May and I thought all was well. I received no notifications for late rent/fees/damages or anything. Until January 2015. I received a call saying that they had been attempting to contact my ex for several months because we owed damages to the tune of $15,000. Yes, 15 grand. I was incredibly scared of this. So I contacted my ex and she told me she would pay the entire amount after working out a payment plan of 1 payment of $1,000 and 23 payments of $400. I now realize after receiving this initial call I should have gone straight to a lawyer to see the extent of my liability and find out what could be done. But because she said she would pay the full amount, I didn't worry about it. I did sign the payment plan along with her because I figured I had to since I was on the original lease.

The first payment was due 3/1 and, of course, it wasn't paid by her like she said. The complex gave us until 3/5 to pay and as of today it still wasn't paid. So I finally asked for a list of all damages and a copy of the original lease and said I was going to talk to a lawyer. Thankfully, they sent both promptly.

The list of charges are as follows: 

Balance as of March (when it looks like she stopped working there): $772

Rent charges from March until July: $4,350

Skips, abandoments, evictions (rent September 2014-July 2015) (not sure how they can charge us for this or what this is exactly): $1,020

Damage Fees: $7,700 (this includes things such as replacing both beds, new furniture, replacing the carpet, deep cleaning, etc.)

And other miscellaneous late charges and fees for the remainder.

A few points I want to reiterate:

I did not receive any notices telling me the rent was not being paid. My ex kept saying everything was fine and that when she moved out in May they terminated the lease.

I received no notice of these damages or any other fees until January 2015. The lease was over July 2014.

My ex told me nothing about these fees or late rent or charges.
So today I set up an appointment with a lawyer for this Wednesday (3/11) and gave them the itemized list and original lease.

I will make edits as necessary but am not even sure where to start with asking questions. What am I actually liable for? Is there any way to avoid this entire thing? If it gets sent to collections, how bad will this destroy my credit score? Please help. I know the lawyer will help but what should I expect and bring to the meeting? I want to be fully prepared. Again, I will answer any questions and make edits as necessary. Thanks everyone!

It is almost impossible to get in contact with my ex now. She has blocked me from almost all means of communication and is refusing to answer any of my calls, texts, etc. because I am trying to be responsible and find out the entire situation."
2ym4bq,3,2015-03-10,Should I drop out of co-op?,madskillsmonk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ym4bq/should_i_drop_out_of_coop/,"So I am looking for some guidance on my situation, specifically whether or not I should drop out of my schools co-op program.

Background: Second year computer science student, landed a sweet internship last summer with a startup in Toronto (where I am from), 
and without the help of my schools co-op directory/resources I landed an internship with a mid-sized (fairly well known) San Fransisco based startup.  


The reasons I am debating dropping out of co-op and pursuing a regular computer science degree are:
* I can graduate in 4 years instead of 5
* I don't really need the guidance/help finding a job , as it will only get easier having this summers job on my resume 
* I think that when I graduate I will want to go to the startup that I worked at last summer so the earlier I get there the better off it would be (something about getting into a startup earlier rather than later, etc).
* Taking a year/semester to travel after graduating (in 4 years) wouldn't put me too far behind


The reasons I want to stay in co-op:
* Extend my university career an extra year (kind of don't want to join the real world yet)
* I would get an extra 2 work terms before graduating; 2 different work experiences to make me more well rounded
* I want to get one at a big 4 before graduating and if I drop out that would only give me 1 opportunity (Although after accepting my offer for this summer I received an interview/coding test with Amazon, so it's likely that I would be able to get another chance next summer)
* If I land 1 or 2 of these jobs at bigger companies I can make a lot more money (this summer salary is pretty standard for Bay Area, $43/hour USD), whereas the startup paid significantly less (about $18/hour CAD).  I'm not in it for the money but having a decent amount saved up before working for a smaller company with the risk etc would be a good idea I think
* I have to do a mandatory 8-month co-op in my fourth year, so I was thinking about doing it at my previous company, thoughts on this?

So, any advice?"

I graduated college in May of last year with a bachelor's in Marketing. I've been interning in a company for a little over 3 years. I'm now looking to begin my career. I've been applying left and right. 

I interviewed in a marketing agency here in NYC and was notified today that I got the job. Its parent company is well known in the industry. When the company recruiter called me 4 months after I applied, I was caught off guard. He asked me some questions like what I'm doing now and how much I'm looking to make and how much I'm currently making (I know, I know). I annualized my salary for him (rough estimate) but told him that I'm paid hourly and I don't work full time; it is a paid internship. I told him I'm looking for 40-50k, after doing my research. He said they have 35k budgeted. I said I'd like to hear more about the job before dismissing it (it would be stupid to immediately say no). He made it clear though that they're really looking to fill the position asap. 

I had my initial interview, and I was exactly what they were looking for. But for one reason or another, they had me interview at a sister company. That was fine with me because I wasn't thrilled with the interviewer (who would have been my boss). The second and third interviews also went really well (boss and boss's boss). I passed the background check. And I got a call today from the internal recruiter who told me that everything went well and they really like me and want to hire me. He said something like, ""So the salary is $35,000 like we discussed, and we're sending the offer letter in the mail which details the specifics"". I asked if I was going to come in and discuss it further and he said no not really. So I said thanks and I'll call him back tomorrow. 

The thing is, I know that they're low balling me. Checking glassdoor showed me salaries in the same ballpark as what I'm being offered, but I know someone who is a manager in the sister company, and he told me that I'm definitely being low-balled and that I could/should push for at least $5,000 more. 

Now, as someone who is just setting their career and without any negotiating experience, what can I do? I liked the environment; it's friendly and casual, but from both the job description, the company itself (their parent is huge), and what my friend on the inside told me, I know they're low-balling me. 

The recruiter is a friendly guy, only a few years older than me. But I know he has an agenda, being a recruiter and all. I just feel like this whole thing is extremely rushed. On one hand, yes it's a job and I'm desperate for one after searching for so long. On the other hand, it's ridiculous that they haven't even hinted at negotiations. And yes, I know that it's my job to bring it up because they're trying to get cheap labor. But it's like they're pushing me through the doorway. 

Thanks in advance. "

I’m graduating in May and planning on applying for a teaching position as a science teacher in a middle school starting in the fall. In my county, in the state of Florida, the teachers are given a school laptop at the beginning of the year. I’m pretty tech savvy and was wondering if I should invest in my own personal laptop because I’m worried how the IT crowd might restrict what I’m able to do on the school laptop. 


Ideally, I would wait for them to give me the school laptop then wipe everything, after saving the Windows key and Microsoft office etc., then reinstall a fresh copy of windows, but I don’t know if they would allow me to do that or if it’s possible to get away with it (lol).  

I’m usually pretty impulsive when it comes to buying things, so I’m trying to avoid that by asking what teachers already in the field think about this."

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2yn14f,35,2015-03-10,Did really badly at an internship... REALLY worried about putting it on my resume,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yn14f/did_really_badly_at_an_internship_really_worried/,"Last summer I did an internship at a very small startup in California doing web development in Rails. I worked remotely (work from home) in a term of three other interns. There were no full time developers, and not a single line of code was written before I started.

My boss is the CEO and founder of the company. To make a long story short, I wasn't able to accomplish much and screwed up quite a few things on the project. She is PISSED at me and won't respond to my calls, texts, or emails. She also made me sign an Invention Assignments agreement which states that all work I do belongs to her company (it's only enforceable in California).

This internship is the only internship I have, so I want to put it on my resume. I'm a senior and currently still looking for a full time job. However, I'm really worried about putting it on there because:

1) Let's say if I get an offer from a company and then they do a background check, which requires employment verification. So if they call her, she could tell them all kinds of bad things about me, and then they would probably have a bad impression of me and take back the offer.

2) What if employers require a reference from her? She will have nothing good to say about me, and my offer will be revoked.

3) She's not responding to my emails so I can't sign the Termination part of the Inventions Assignment agreement. So again, if my future employer calls her for the background check to verify employment, she could tell him that I am still bound to this agreement and they might revoke my offer for this.

4) Or what if she just doesn't respond to the employment verification background check at all? Like if they call and ask her if I ever worked there, she could just hang up and refuse to talk to them. And I'm pretty sure she would do this considering how much she hates me.


Guys, I'm REALLY worried and would like your advice on how to handle this situation. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"

I faced about 5 technical interviews of about 30-45 minutes during the recruitment, which were mainly about data structures and problem solving using trees, strings and arrays.  

The company is product based (single product)  and mainly develops that product for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, WP8, BB).  

These are my concerns:  
1. The company recruits 1 or 2 students from all the top colleges, and hence has all the kickass people working in it. I'm from a medium college, and though I was the only one chosen from my college, I know that my skills cannot match the people from the top tier colleges (I did an internship sometime back with 2 people from top tier colleges; got my ass kicked).  
2. That being said, and with only 3 months to go, how can I get job ready? I don't want to feel alienated and miserable and worthless (and get fired in the worst case scenario) because people around me are much more smarter.  
3. I'm solving questions from SPOJ and Hackerrank to hone my problem solving skills, and data structures. Is that enough?  
4. I suppose they'd give me an option to choose a platform I want to work on when I choose. Which one should I choose? I never did Android, but developed some for WP8.

Fortunately my employer has granted me permission to take 2 weeks of vacation to visit her.  I'm hoping this subreddit is willing to help me organize the order of the places that we want to visit with the most efficient use of time and money...or at least point me to another resource that can help me figure these things out.

Before I list the proposed order of places that we'd like to visit, it's important to note that we must end the two weeks in Bangkok (she departs for the U.S. there, and I would very much like to be on those same flights back).  It's also highly likely that I'll arrive in Bangkok because I need to book the flights very soon to secure my spot back with her, and I don't have a better idea of where to start my journey.

(1) Where should we meet up? (remember that she's starting in Koh Phangan)
(2) what order and mode of transportation should we have to reach all of these spots?
(3) anything that you'd insist on adding or scratching?

list (we want a good mix of beaches, big cities, hiking areas, touristy spots, and non-touristy spots):

- Bangkok (I arrive; now need to meet up with GF at or near the desired destinations below)
- Krabi region for beaches (we'll probably check out Koh Phi Phi and/or Phuket)
- Chiang Mai (or other areas suited for hiking and seeing or possibly even riding elephants)
- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
- Phu Quoc, Vietnam (or similarly cool beach in Vietnam)
- Bangkok (to head home)

Thanks for any help!

EDIT: you've all pointed out that this is too much to accomplish appropriately in a 2 week adventure, and I sincerely appreciate that input.  Are y'all willing to submit advice on best travel methods for seeing the places in the list above, except with the omission of Vietnam?

So far, I have had interviews with 6 of the companies, feel as if the technical portions go great, &amp; every time I am able to solve the questions relatively quickly (e.g. 45 min coding problem, done in 20 etc.) and then we go on to talk about interests etc. Then, after the technical interview (usually the 2nd-3rd phone interview), I am in limbo. Usually from 2-3 weeks, before I get denied. 

I know they are large companies (vmware, yahoo, dell,  etc.) but is it strange to have an interview go well and then just go into the void? I felt especially with vm (which was specifically a rails position) that I spoke with the hiring manager too early in the process and faded out of memory as he interviewed the last 2 candidates. But outside of that I have 0 idea as to how to improve my internship prospects. 

I have been denied left and right, and have had an internship last summer (through an referral), yet many of my friends with minimal experience and (even miss coding problems) are still able to land internships. Also I am not socially inept, yet it always seems as if me and the recruiter get along great, while the technical people give off a cold disconnect (but still nice). 

However it seems pretty inefficient to apply to jobs with 2000 kids hunting for 2 open positions, so it may be the lottery effect that is killing me. In either case I am not sure how to find positions for more specific work that would fit my skill-set (ideally ruby/rails or java). 

*Excuse any grammatical errors, as this was written quickly. Also note, as an unrelated thing, I am not advanced in my formal coursework because I started my cs degree late after teaching myself while doing biology. But this has never come up, but perhaps some of the ideas such as (searching algorithms etc.) are indirectly questioned without me knowing? 

ANY ideas/help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!

* applied to 80 + jobs
* did not hear from anyone
* confusion due to past work experience, projects, skill set
* how to better select internship positions so I do not keep wasting time?

My mind is scarred right now. Throwaway because reasons... Back story, I am a female in college right now (the female part is relevant) and I needed a new laptop last year so my dad helped me buy a new MacBook.  Fast forward to last summer, at the end of my IT internship, my department gave me an old PC laptop to use since my major uses mostly PC and they were just going to throw it away.  Since I now had 2 laptops and my dad's desktop was way outdated, I left my MacBook with him while I'm away at school since technically he bought it and also it's almost fool proof for him to screw up since all he uses is Safari anyway. Now to my fuck up, which just happened minutes ago.  Like I said my dad doesn't really know how to work the computer, just uses it for internet browsing so he asked me about a pop-up that kept alerting him to a software update.  I told him it would be good to update, but warned him that it would restart the computer when he updated.  So he needs to save his internet tabs because he uses the same Safari window everyday and just adds more tabs when he wants to open a new page. Whatever, one lesson at a time. Well he asked about saving the tabs he has open before he restarts the computer so he doesn't lose them... Actually I think his words were ""oh I should write down those pages so I can come back to them after the restart...  As in he was going to write down each URL by hand so that he could type them back in... *facepalm*  Anyway, I showed him how he could bookmark the pages so he could just come back to them and even gave him a little lesson on the shortcut (⌘-T) to open a new tab. This is where the fuck up happened.  Showed him how to open a new tab and how it automatically has little icons on the new tab page that show his ""Bookmarks"" and ""Recent Pages"".  I'm talking and chatting away and keep using that ⌘-T shortcut to show him how opening a new tab works and not really looking at the screen, but I keep explaining to him how it's got the icons on the new tab and he's trying to cut me short.  It's when I actually have my fingers pointing at the screen that I realize his ""Recent Pages"" includes Pornhub. I quickly try to exit out of the new tabs I've opened, but like I said I opened a handful of tabs to show him how the shortcut works so I'm just clicking the X as fast as I can. I cut my lesson short and fake a yawn and tell him I'm going to sleep, all while trying to pretend I didn't see it as I lean in for the most awkward hug of my life.  We both knew, but will never acknowledge it.  I'm going to go browse /r/interestingasfuck now so I can clear my mind. Oh god ew ew ew"

I graduated in December with my bachelor's in PETE.  I was interviewing with a few service companies and had three internships with a small operator, and all fell through because of the crash.  After 3 months of searching, I am now left with two options, and curious as to what everyone's advice would be.

1-I have a friend that works in Midland with a large chemical company in chemical sales.  He has been in contact with his district manager and has sent my resume along.  Apparently they will be filling this position some time in the next three weeks and, quoting him, with my degree I am more than qualified for this position.  I can see myself doing this for long term, as I am a huge people person and would probably love sales, and when things pick back up, I could possibly switch to some sort of production engineering.


2-My dad has worked at one of the refineries in Houston for 35 years.  He did not attend school and is now an engineer there.  He suggested helping out and gaining experience at the plant for ~2 years, mean while getting a certificate from a community college that, compounded with my degree, would put me in a good position to be hired on as an engineer at the refinery.

What would you do?"

1. Does anyone of you know where I can ""search"" or browse through Animation Internship offers?
2. Which 2D Studios in Europe (UK, Germany, ....) are good and take Internships ?
3. Is it wise to write at everystudio and ask for an 1 to 2 months Internship without a reel ?
4. Since I need to get a room then in this country, how much do they pay for an Internship ? Is an Internship payed ? The last 2 Internships that I had here in my country were not payed at all.

I have to make a AR 'game' for my internship using the metaio SDK for unity.

When the player scans an image, an object appears on it and an animation starts playing. 

So far so good. But this is the part where I'm stuck. 

The object that appeared is larger than the camera view and the player should be able to look up to see the rest of it. (eg: player starts by looking at trunk of tree but can look up to see the rest.)
The problem is that when the player tilts his device, the camera loses sight of the tracking image so it stops tracking and the object disappears. 

I have already fixed it so the object stays, even when tracking is lost, but now the object just stays on a fixed position. (meaning moving the device no longer moves the ingame camera.)

I'm using streamingdata for the tracking (the meatio QR codes for testing)

often on this subreddit i'll read about epi's using programming languages like R and SAS. I was wondering how you all learned and developed those skills? I hope to find an internship/job after undergrad then eventually work my way through an MPH or an MS (what's the difference?) but in the meantime I want to do what I can to get ahead.

I have a few classes I plan on taking in my last year of undergrad that can help me out. So far i've found that my school offers a few classes that I think will be relevant:

couple epi/biostats classes;
a dedicated biostatistics class in which i'll use R (never used it before);
an econ class that uses STATA (also never used);
a math class called intro to probability and statistics for bioinformatics;
a computation for biologists class;
and recently i discovered an introductory class on GIS (which i hear is useful?)

Which of these classes seem most relevant to an aspiring epidemiologist? I hope to get into infectious disease epi if that makes a difference.

also, if anyone knows of any internship experience in socal or the bay area for the summer please let me know :D

thank you all!"

They asked me to go back.

It was three days ago I was picked up tired and hungry on that dock. The captain had found me with a dying flashlight in one hand and a turned-off radio in the other. This time I was the one who didn't say much, I just got out of the boat, drove home in a daze and fell asleep in my bed. I spent a lot of the time since thinking about what I'd experienced on Twain Island, the rest of it applying to jobs who didn't call back. I went back and read what I wrote. It sounds almost ridiculous now, like the ravings of a wild man, especially happening so soon after I woke up. The more I thought about it, the less real it seemed.

As I was applying for other guard jobs, the guy who runs the temp agency called me to tell me the Forensic Anthropology Facility had contacted them to ask about hiring me again. With no hesitation I told him I had no interest in going back to that island. While I was at it, I thanked him for not warning me about the nature of their research. He swore to me he didn't know- I didn't believe him- and told me before I made up my mind that they were willing to raise their rate by almost thirty percent. “I think they’re tired of giving the free tour, if you know what I mean,” he said. 

It's hard to argue with that kind of money when you're unemployed. There was still the whole matter of the disappearing body, and the creepy laughter, and the traces of death in the guard's office, which were three very good reasons to never go back. I couldn't exactly ask him about all that without sounding insane, so I asked him the next best thing. “Did they have any complaints about the last time,” I asked. The way I figured, if a body got up and walked away on my watch, they might think I had something to do with it.

“If they had any complaints,” he said, “I doubt we'd be talking right now.”

He was right, of course. The whole thing was feeling more and more like something I'd dreamed up. About an hour earlier I had checked my bank account, which was getting grim, and now here I was saying no to a cushy paycheck. I thought of Eric's advice, how it was the easiest job in the world so long as you could manage the mental bit. Then I thought of my dad who worked in high-rise construction for thirty years, and once drove himself back to a job site after having his thumb sewn back on so he could finish out the day.

God help me, I went.

A thought occurred to me as the boat captain drove me over to the island: what if the body actually had gone missing and they were luring me back to question me about it, or even catch me in the act of doing it again? What if they'd gone to the cops but didn't have enough evidence to accuse me? My stomach sank, and I looked over at the old guy at the wheel. He looked back at me with a funny look in his eye. Maybe it was something. Maybe it was nothing. It was too late to turn around now.

When I got to the island it was still bright out, which helped get me off the dock and onto land, and I was interested to notice that no one had come to greet me when I arrived. I took it as a good sign and went to track down Eric. It didn't take long- he was at the computer in the guard's office.

“I didn't think I'd see you around here again,” he said with a laugh. Apparently the boat captain told everyone how ready I was to leave when he pulled up the other day. It was a little embarrassing, but to be fair no one had prepared me for the kind of shit I'd shown up for. Eric found it hilarious but I could tell he understood where I was coming from. While we were on the subject, I asked him if he had ever heard anything weird on the island, especially on the night shift. He asked me what kind of weird. “I don't know. Stuff moving. Voices.”

He got a soda from the fridge. “Uh oh. Don't tell me you're the superstitious type. That doesn't really fly here.” As he chugged the soda down I assured him I was a rational person, but he seemed skeptical. According to him, despite Twain Island being an island there were still plenty of animals that lived there. Some swam over, others came over on boats or floating garbage. “We’ve asked Doctor Christianson about animal control but he says it would ruin the balance of nature, which is important for their data or whatever. I think he just doesn't want to pay for it out of his grant money.”

It wasn't the first time I got the vibe no one liked the doctor. After I finished catching up with Eric he threw away his empty can and announced he was going to complete his final rounds before it was time to go home. I think he expected me to hang out in the office, like he would if he could, so it surprised him when I headed out in the opposite direction. I wanted to reacquaint myself with the island and the interns. Based on the look he gave me, he definitely thought I was a crazy person. 

The real reason for my walk was even crazier than he suspected.

No one was working in the main clearing, so I used the privacy to check the cage where the body had disappeared, or where I’d convinced myself it had, at this point I didn’t know what to think. It had been an uneventful return so far and I doubted I would get such a mild reception if they suspected me of something as gross as grave robbing. So as you can imagine, I was especially confused when I found the woman inside the cage. There like she never left. She was less an inflated bag of maggots by now, more skin and bones than the last time I’d seen her. Her rotting body was oddly comforting.

When I turned away from her, Bernard the intern was standing at the other side of the clearing with a clipboard in one hand and a ruler in the other, checking on one of the other bodies. I don’t know how long he’d been there but when I turned to leave he threw me a look too nasty to ignore. Instead of heading back to the office as planned I went his way and struck up a conversation. Something pointless about the weather which he stayed quiet through. When I was done with my bit, he not-so-subtly changed the subject.

He asked me what my interest was in the female specimen, and the way he asked it I understood what he was implying, which by the way is disgusting. I didn't know how to answer him without sounding insane, so I told him I'd heard some sounds out this way the last time, but when I came to inspect the site there was nobody there. But what he said next made my legs go cold.

“Did you move her?”

It took me a second. I said no, no, I definitely didn't, and would have no reason to, and I asked him why he would ask something like that. He didn't want to say at first, but after I asked a few times he told me the photos hadn't matched up from one day to the next. Specifically the position of the body.

I asked him if it was possibly animals, the ones Eric told me lived on the island, the garbage-riders. Like I was a child who'd asked a dumb question in class, he tapped the cage next to him with his foot and looked at me to say, “that's what these are for.” “What about gases,” I asked, all those things that happen when we decompose, couldn't that move a body? With no lack of attitude he assured me he knew which movements were natural and which ones weren't. “She was definitely moved. If it was you, you're better off coming clean.” I could see he wasn't going to bend on this, so I told him it wasn't me, and if he didn't believe me it wasn't my problem, and I went back to the guard's office. But I'd be lying if I said our conversation didn't weigh on me for a long time after that.

By the time Eric got back from his final rounds I was in a dark place. My thoughts were spiralling down and I was angry at myself for coming back to the island. I was giving strong thought to quitting and hitching a ride back on the late boat, and Eric could probably tell, since he was acting especially light and jokey, trying to improve the mood in the guard's office. I suspected it was less for me and more for himself, which he proved when he casually dropped that he had some big plans for the night, which would have been ruined if I hadn't shown up.

At that point Terri popped her head in for a few minutes to say hi and ask Eric a question about the alarm system in the main research building. Before she left she told me it was good to see me again. After she was gone Eric chuckled and said how obvious it was that Terri was into me. I told him that was bullshit. “Why do you think they asked you back,” he asked. 

“You were tired of giving the free tour,” I quoted. 

“There's other guys they could have asked. And she brought your name up like five times in the past three days. Said you have 'kind eyes.' Who else were they gonna bring back?”

I didn't put much faith in what Eric said, but it beat thinking about other things. It didn't hurt that Terri was pretty cute- in a weird, works-with-dead-bodies way. The thought of asking her out distracted me for a while. Soon enough I was alone. The boat came and left and like an idiot I didn't get on it.

I spent the first hour like the first night, on the internet, visiting the usual time-wasters, but after a while I started to think about what Bernard had said. To be honest, it pissed me off. This guy, this bug-looking prick, doesn't even know me, wasn't even there that night, yet he thinks he can throw around disgusting accusations. Pretty soon I wasn't paying attention to the screen- I was thinking about cornering Bernard in one of the more private areas of the woods and giving him something real to accuse me of. I'm not an outwardly violent guy, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of it.

Something by the door caught my attention. Movement. I turned in time to catch a spot of darkness moving past the window, and for the second time that day my legs went cold.
 
The shadow was in the vague shape of a person. I’d like to say that I jumped out of my chair, flung the door open and jumped on the intruder like a damn security guard, but the truth is I stayed as still as I could. I listened to the grass rustle and I didn’t move a muscle until the sound was gone. A minute later I stood at the open door, shining my flashlight into the dark. And even though I didn’t want to, even though I hated to admit it, I found myself surrounded by the very familiar, very strong smell of rotting corpse.

My first instinct- and it would be yours, too- was to step back inside and lock the door, radio the police and shut myself in a broom closet until help arrived. But I also knew that dead bodies don't get up and walk around, that those things don't happen except in movies. I pictured my dad and what he would do in this situation if he was still alive. He would find whoever was screwing with him and jam his reattached thumb into their eye. My undetached one would have to do. 

Due to an overcast night the woods were already black. The way the flashlight's beam pierced the night reminded me of footage of deep-sea divers. I moved quietly between the trees and toward the main clearing and strained to hear even the slightest sound of footsteps or movement in the woods ahead of or around me, but other than the wind and the ocean I couldn't hear a thing. What made me happiest, though, was finding the woman's body in its cage where it belonged- even now that sounds like an unbelievable thing to find relief in- and after a quick check I discovered all of her roommates were in their respective cages, too, at least in this site. Taking courage from that I decided to finally do some proper rounds. There was a mystery on that island, something the employees weren't telling me, and it was time I figured it out.

I moved into the woods at a sharp angle, aiming to reach the shore at a particular spot I'd seen with Eric the other day, a point at the island's heighest where he said you could see a small cave opening at low tide. The point itself didn't matter so long as I had a target, though something about the overcast night got me confused, not being able to use the moon or stars as reference, and after a couple of minutes I found myself turned around. As it turns out, the island is larger than I'd thought at first, and it's very possible to get lost on it. I tried to correct my path using the sound of the ocean- just keep heading toward the waves- but after a minute I came into a clearing and was surprised to find it was the one I had left a few minutes earlier.

If I were a smarter man I would have said screw it and returned to the office, but my decision to find answers had made me too stubborn to take the easy way out. Instead I turned around and headed once again for the same spot on the shore. This time I made an even sharper angle. There was no way I was going to end up back in that clearing.

The good news is, I didn't. The bad news is I became completely disoriented by the night and the tree after tree after identical tree, and it wasn't long before I couldn't even tell which way the ocean was, the sound of waves coming through from all directions. Twice I came across body cages but I didn't stop long enough to get a look at them. It was bad enough putting my back to them in the dark. Thinking about their dead eyes on me put some speed in my step. If you've ever been lost, you know the feeling of frustration and hopelessness it brings, how you kick yourself for being so stupid. You blame yourself for every mistake you've ever made. Whether or not you believe in God, you start making pacts and promises. “If you just get me out of this I promise to be a better person,” even though you fully intend to forget everything you said the moment you're found again. Bottle up that feeling and let it loose on an island of cadavers, and you'll start to understand what went through my head in those woods.

When I got really desperate, I started to notice the smell of rotting meat.

With the breeze blowing so erratically through the trees I couldn't get a bearing on which direction the stink came from. Whether it was following me or I was following it wasn't clear. Only one thing was: it was getting stronger. I didn't know if I should walk slower to keep from stepping in something or run away from someone pursuing me. As much as I wanted to check the trees, my flashlight stayed trained on the ground, and thank God it did. Out of nowhere I came across a body, a pair of purple feet sticking up from a patch of green ivy. It wasn't even marked with a flag, which I thought was extremely dangerous, and if it had been, the flag had fallen and disappeared under the thick vines. The body was muscular, definitely a man, and as I got closer I saw it was missing its head and one of its arms. Flies buzzed on its freshly ruptured skin. Their whining voices got under my own skin, into my eardrums, and nausea bubbled up in my stomach, the taste of acid at the back of my throat.

I threw up behind a tree. Doubled over, wiping my mouth clean, a stick snapped somewhere in the woods under weight, as if someone had stepped on it. I straightened up and aimed my flashlight toward the sound of approaching footsteps, and I called out, “Who's there?” The beam of light found feet, not the corpse's feet but walking feet, feet wearing shoes, feet attached to legs and pants and a gray coat.

“You're contaminating my site,” the bearded man said. I didn't have to ask him for identification- it was Doctor Christianson. “The other guards don’t come this far inland.” 

“To be honest I’m a little lost,” I admitted to him. 

“This isn’t the place to do that,” he said as he walked over. I agreed completely. I told him I thought everyone had gone home by now. “I’m one of those fortunate few who does what he loves,” he said. “I get lost in the work.”

I wasn't sure how the statement made me feel about the doctor. On the one hand I admired his work ethic, but on the other a man who can get lost in this kind of work doesn't exactly make you feel comfortable being around him at night. “You missed the boat,” I told him, but he shrugged it off. “If I call for another, another comes,” he explained. 

“Did you happen to walk past the guard's office a little while ago?”

His face shifted. “Are you keeping track of me?” I shook my head no. “You worry about people trying to get onto the island. I'll worry about what they do while they're here.”

I nodded. There wasn't any arguing with a prick like that. He pointed me in the right direction back to the buildings. I thanked him and went to leave, but at the last second I turned back. There was something I needed to know. “This really doesn’t bother you,” I asked, but his expression told me everything. He was tired of this question, and not just tired of it, above it.

“I find it fascinating, not that I need to. The data I gather here will give police the evidence they need to catch countless criminals.”

“I guess I can’t get over the fact that they used to be people. That guy right there,” I pointed, “do you even know his name?” 

The doctor no longer looked like he wanted to humor me. “By any remote chance, do you know why I asked you back,” he asked. I told him probably because everyone else said no. “Because I don’t like to answer questions. That's why I chose an island for my research in the first place.” 

“They say no man is an island,” I offered, because I couldn't think of what else to say.

“'They' are worried about being popular.”

That certainly wasn't a problem he shared. I thanked him for helping me find my way, but by that time he wasn't paying attention to me anymore, he was studying the headless man and taking down some notes, so I left without another word and headed in the direction he'd said. It was surprisingly easy to find my way back after that. Within twenty minutes I was standing in front of the open door of the guard's office. As I entered the building, I tried to remember for the life of me if I'd left the door open. I tell you, I could have sworn I closed it.
 
I took a quick piss in the cramped bathroom, washed my hands and grabbed a soda from the fridge, downing it in three, long swigs. I threw the can in the garbage pail where it joined Eric’s and a few others. It seemed they were more concerned with recycling people than they were aluminum.
 
There was a big cork-board hung up in the eating area with a bunch of random things tacked to it- health notices, old flyers, a few articles cut out of medical magazines- but it was the photo that caught my attention. It was one of those unflattering pictures people love to take of each other at work. Messy hair and a few extra pounds only matter if it’s a picture of you, right? It seemed like a recent photo, probably taken with one of the digital cameras they use to photograph the bodies and printed out on the office printer, yet I didn’t recognize the guy in it. He was in fairly good shape, arms bulged against the short sleeves of his guard’s uniform. On his right forearm he had a tattoo of a green snake wrapped around a red apple.
 
I thought back to the body in the middle of the woods, where Doctor Christianson and I had talked. No cage, no flag, pretty muscular, missing the head as well as one of the arms.
 
Missing an arm. The right arm. 

Just to be safe, I locked the door.

I know this a super generic and super common problem, and I also know that time heals all things.  However, I need to get this off my chest, and some advice for people who have gone through similiar stuff would really help. 

So anyways, we're both college students.  She's a senior and I'm a junior.  We met at party in sept. when we randomly hooked up (didn't know each other before then), and this escalated to sober sex throughout the week.  We both liked each other, but what we were was unclear.  Initially, I wasn't to interested, and then she challenged me by saying she was the more invested one.  So, I decided to stop hooking up with other people, and just have sex with her.  I thought we were heading to dating.  Anyways, a month or so later I drunkly call her my girlfriend to another person when she's there.  We weren't official or anything, I just didn't know how else to categorize what we had.  The next day we talk, and she says that we're not dating and she's been with other people.  That was fine with me.  I was just a little annoyed that she made it seem like I wasn't committed enough.  Regardless, our thing continued with what we were made explicit.  We spent a lot of time together, and it was really enjoyable.  

We then went on winter break, and we texted throughout the time. It sucked but it wasn't that bad.  Then school started back with a short jan term, and she was doing a teaching internship in California while I was doing a class in India.  Anyways, during this time I guess a combination of the stress of travel, being sick, and being around several people in happy long term things made me want that.  I eventually started getting worried, and once when I was drunk I basically became obsessed with defining what we were.  I guess I just wanted to be exclusive. My outburst wasn't a huge problem I thought. We eventually came back, and at the start of February I was excited to see her.  Well, she finally gets back, and we're hanging out in my room and she acts really weird and won't talk to me or let me kiss her.  She then ran upstairs (she lived in the apartment above me), and texted me she needed to figure something out and she'd talk later.  This stressed me out majorly since I hate uncertainty, and I eventually convinced her to sit down and talk.  She says we can't do this anymore, since she doesn't want to get attached since she's leaving for a job in NYC at the end of the semester (I'm from Georgia).  I was mad and hurt, but I eventually accepted it.  The weekend came along and I went out, and we had break up sex that Friday night.  It was really good sex, but I didn't think anything of it.  I was hurting, but not heart broken.  Anyways, that day she asks to hang out, and we chill and watch Parks and Rec. I then go out that night, and I hook up with someone else.  However, when I wake up I have a series of texts from her basically saying she hated the idea of me with someone else and that I should come upstairs and be with her.  I then went upstairs and snuggled with her.  

At this point we were functionally back together.  Later in the week we agreed to be exclusive, and then by the second week in Feb. we were dating.  Things we good mostly with some bad spots.  She would sometimes freak out about small things and get distant.  Like being from a rural part of the south I hunt, and she got distant one night after finding that out.  She said it was a huge moral difference, and that this wouldn't continue on past her graduation.  I understood the latter part, but I thought the former was silly.  Anyways, she would always be late on the weekends to hang out/have sex. Like she'd say she was coming then she wouldn't for an hour or two.  However, on the bright side we really enjoyed each other a lot of the times.  

Then comes this weekend.  Friday we have a great time during the day.  We go out on a date then come back and have really good sex then chill in bed for the rest of the afternoon.  After we leave to go out, she talks about how much she likes me and all that.  During the day Saturday (DST) we casually text back and forth then that night she did the thing where she said she was coming but didn't.  Eventually she apologizes and says she's sorry and we'll talk in the morning. 

We talk in the morning, and she says she's sorry but we have to break up.  She said she felt like she was having to choose between hanging out with me and going out and having a good senior year, so she felt like she couldn't give me what was fair.  She couldn't invest in it in the same way, and she was leaving.  I told her it didn't bother me if she went out and I didn't see her some nights, and that she didn't have to choose. She basically said she wasn't going to do something halfway.  She also said that she wasn't going to do a long distance relationship because she's never had a good one.  I told her that I was starting to become really attached to her, which she said supported her point Basically the short of it was that we were over. It wasn't a shouting match or anything.  Just a resigned decision. 

It's been since Sunday, and I'm still stressing about this.  I really liked her, and while I recognize that she wasn't perfect for me and she had a lot of flaws, I worry I won't be able to get over her.  Intellectually I know we weren't a perfect couple, and given time we would have fallen apart organically.  What makes it tough is that it ended in a peaceful way before we started not to like each other or fall apart.  Thus, I'm left with mostly good memories with her, and a desire to be back with her.  I know this is impossible and stupid.  However, I'm worried that because of how we ended it without a bang that I'll always want to be with her.  I know that's silly, and I've gotten over girls before; however, I just want to be past this and happy again.  I want to enjoy the memories we had, while not being obsessed with them or not looking forward.  The idea that I'll always be wondering what she's doing or who's she's dating bothers me.  I want to be over her, but I'm afraid she'll always be in my mind since there was no rough break up or falling to make me like her less.  Like I saw her on the stairs yesterday, and it nearly ruined my day just from the flood of emotions.  I keep remembering good times, and good memories.  Little things remind me of her, and I hate it.  I just want to be normal again.  Any advice for me? 
   
**tl;dr**: long term hook up turns into a relationship, I get attached, and then she ends it.  I'm worried I won't be able to get over it.  "

You can argue very easily that they're trying to wither CUPE from within and they don't care about us, but you can just as easily argue that it's for the best for us.

Don't just think about yourselves, think about the upper years who want to graduate on time, think of the schulich students who already have internships laid out for the summer, think of the international (and those who live within Canada) students who probably already have their return tickets booked home, it is extremely important for them to finish on time.

And come on guys, I understand buses don't go into campus during the strike but the weather is nice nowadays and a 10 minute walk won't really hurt anyone, and the buses DO come into campus after 4, so there are not any additional security concerns on top of those that already exist. And ffs, DON'T DRIVE, you can get a refund on your permit and the lot across from the main gate offers parking for less than what York does, and they offer monthly permits as well.

Yeah it's nice to spend some time off, but you're going to regret this when all of your friends are finished exams and you're still doing lectures. And it's been said a million times before that you will be accommodated for the time lost for your assignments and what not. You won't be penalized, and you're being offered a choice whether you wish to cross the lines or not, again WITHOUT penalty, the choice is yours. Odds are if it continues into next month they might allow you to keep the mark you currently have as your final or let you retake the course free of charge.

So come on, let's be logical about this, let's stop getting emotional, York has made poor decisions in the past but I can't blame them for this one..

CUPE acts in their own best interest, come on, are they bargaining for anything for us undergrads? No, not really, maybe indirectly, and I'm not saying what they're doing is bad or that I'm against them..I'm not, but let's think outside the box, and think for us."

Having been created by other interns, some of the code is less than stellar and may have little/no documentation. This has been something of a struggle for me as being relatively new to python (probably got about 1.5~ years experience with python/coding in general), it takes me a long time to get my head around some of the projects I am given.
I also find myself creating less than ideal code that gets the job done but is perhaps not as neat as I feel the same code would be if had been in a project I created myself where I fully understand what has been created before.

I was wondering if you guys had any advice on how to get to grips with projects created by other people quickly and perhaps any steps you would take initially when continuing with someone else’s project?"

I received my passport 10 years ago - and have been hoping/trying to travel abroad ever since.

Unfortunately, I never had enough funds, or if I did, I was working 50+ hours a week and saving and unable to go.

Now I am pursuing my Master of Public Administration and Nonprofit Management in Oregon - my summer is coming up, and I received a partial scholarship/fellowship for interning/volunteering abroad!

I couldn't be more excited - but I still need a bit more funding before I book my flight to cover the entire experience. Right now, I am still about $3000 below the total cost (without accounting for travel outside of my main internship site, Chiang Mai, Thailand)

I have housing secured, and will be volunteering, interning, and working with the Save Elephant Foundation.

Read about my experience here: http://www.gofundme.com/saveelephant

Thank you so much for anything you can contribute! (Every dollar helps)

I am aware that this experience will probably help and shape me more than the good I can possibly do for the people of Chiang Mai and the elephants at Elephant Nature Park - so it feels slightly selfish - but I want to become more cultured and a better steward of the entire world rather than just my life as I know it in the United States.

Thank you so much, and have a great day!"

#### Two Huge Mistakes New Entrepreneurs Make…And If You Should Even Be One.
 
A while back I was able to interview Andy Drish. Andy is a really cool guy who opened my eyes to a side of business that I’d never really dabbled in before — software. He is one of the founders of The Foundation, which is a company that helps people learn to start a software company from scratch inside six months.
 
We talked a bit about what starting a software company looks like, but there was one thing that kept coming up in our conversation that didn’t have anything to do with software, yet fascinated me…the mindset of an entrepreneur.
 
How some people have it, and some don’t.
 
And that’s a good thing! Not everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. Some people would rather plug into an existing model or business and do work that is meaningful and fulfilling, even if it’s not their name on the side of the building.
 
Depending on your personality, you could fit that mold, or you could be someone that wants to create a business and employ people. Either one works, so long as you have that passion and freedom to create value in the world.
 
I’ll let the conversation speak for itself. Check it out below:
 
#### Enter Andy
 
##### Andy’s Early History
 
On The Turning Point Where He Became an Entrepreneur:
 
So a few years ago I went through my first little quarter-life crisis.
 
I broke up with my girlfriend of over five years.
 
I quit my job.
 
I left my puppy and I moved.
 
I did all of this in the span of seven days
 
It was insane. It was the craziest time in my life. I quit my job to start growing my business, and I had this whole plan in place to focus on and succeed in that, but then the break up happened; it was unexpected and it was such a terrible thing.
 
To be honest, I started a period of binge drinking and studying pickup. Lame, right? Pickup is like a whole world of guys learning how to talk to women — that’s pretty much it.
 
I hadn’t been single for five years so the first thing that I wanted to do was learn what the pickup lines are that work. I went straight for the tactics.
 
&gt; When you don’t have what you want in life, you think tactics will get you what you want — but they won’t.
 
It took me about six or seven months to realize that it’s not actually the tactics. You need to learn how to become a man, become confident in your own body, and just comfortable with who you are.
 
Then, none of the words actually matter.
 
##### Andy’s Business History
 
I did all sorts of stuff in college:
 
Sold a course teaching people how to give presentations, sold T-shirts, tried starting a little internship company hiring college students
 
Some of these failed, some of these succeeded. By fail or succeed I mean they may have only made a couple of grand here and there.
 
Eventually, I began blogging a lot and making a lot of friends online and eventually launched a membership website online. We went from having no idea at all to six weeks later, a website generating income.
 
It was generating $6,000 a month in income, then six months later the entire site shut down and fell apart.
 
The reason it failed was because I didn’t have my core mindset right, which is why I’m so passionate about that stuff now.
 
I knew the strategies and tactics to build something profitable, but I couldn’t sustain it because the strategies and tactics stopped working. The strategies and tactics alone wore out, and then the entire business crumbled afterwards.
 
So after all that experience, I built a marketing company to help real estate agents get referrals in their business. That went really well, so well in fact that I sold that business and co-founded The Foundation with my business partner Dane Maxwell. That was just a couple years ago.
 
##### The Most Common Mistakes New Entrepreneurs Make
 
Before we get into the mistakes, there’s an important concept that I want people to understand: the window of entrepreneurship.
 
Peter Shallard in [The Shrink for Entrepreneurs](http://www.petershallard.com/)[1] taught me this. There’s a window of entrepreneurship for every business, and it’s first two to five years of getting started.
 
Whether that window is two years for you or five depends on how quickly you get started and how hard you work. It’s the stage in your business where the only thing that helps you succeed it is how quickly you take action, and the amount of action you take.
 
That’s the number one priority above everything else. You want to keep moving forward, take action as quickly as possible, because the more action that you take the more experience you’ll get and the more lessons you’ll learn early in your business’ life. Sometimes we learn lessons when it’s too late, better to learn them early on.
 
So, what usually happens is that when you start your business, you have a lack of opportunity, you have a lack of ideas, and you have a lack of money.
 
But then, some where in the 2–5 year range something shifts, and all of the sudden you go from lacking all of those things to having your baseline needs covered.
 
Now that your baseline is covered, the decisions that you’re making are not being made out of lack or panic. They can actually be strategic:
 
Which direction are we going to go? What’s the big picture? Where is this company going to end up?
 
To stay in business you really need to start thinking through things a little bit more at this point. When you’re in the beginning stages and you’re just trying to get your product to market, the most important thing is taking massive action as quickly as possible until you can get to that place. Once you’re sustainable, start thinking bigger picture for your company.
 
&gt; When you’re in the beginning stages, the most important thing is taking action as quickly as possible.
 
So that’s the first mistake. New entrepreneurs don’t move quickly enough to shorten the learning curve.
 
The second mistake that I see new entrepreneurs screwing up too often is that they don’t have a connection with their customer at all.
 
All they do is sit around with their ideas. They map them out on their white board and they never actually talk to the people who are going to be paying the money.
 
We have a mindset module in The Foundation called _The Fastest Path to the Cash_. The fastest path is always talking with customers.
 
People ask what it takes. What does it take to actually have a business? It’s not business cards, logos, or an LLC. It’s not even a website up and running.
 
None of that stuff matters.
 
The only thing that really matters is having a customer who will pay you for the problem that you’re solving.
 
The only way you know that your customer is going to write a check is making sure you are giving them what they want, and that comes from communication.
 
##### Are You Even Cut Out To Be An Entrepreneur?
 
There’s a certain element to being an entrepreneur. There are entrepreneurs that start businesses, but there are also some people that just aren’t born to do that. They just ultimately don’t want to do that.
 
I look at our team for example. We have some people on our team who are absolutely incredible and they’re creating tangible value for the company because they’re doing work that provides massive value to the world.
 
They’re not just sitting in a cubicle checking out Facebook and talking about how they hate their lives. They love the work they are doing. So you don’t necessarily have to be an entrepreneur to be massively successful. It’s really doing work that is creative in nature, work that aligns with what you want to create in the world.
 
#### Enter Cole
 
My thoughts to Andy when he shared this idea:
 
Yeah. Totally, it’s fulfilling work. I have those people within my organization too.
 
We call them intrapreneurs.
 
They’re not technically entrepreneurs. But within the organization they work for, within the umbrella, they have their own freedoms even though they’ve got the guidelines of, “Hey, you’re helping with the marketing.”
 
So it’s not that they just show up and pick a new thing to do every day. They’ve got the guidelines of what needs to be done but they get to do it in their own way.
 
Not everyone is born an entrepreneur, not everyone can be or the world wouldn’t work. If every single person owns their own business, then there would be no one to help build those businesses, right?
 
I actually watched a video of Gary Vaynerchuk explain that concept pretty recently. He says:
 
&gt; A penguin cannot become a giraffe, so just be the best penguin you can be.
 
He’s basically saying don’t try to be something you’re not and only become mediocre at it, focus on what you’re good at and be the best.
 
He talks about how within his organization, the top fifteen people who are not entrepreneurs but are helping him are going to be financially set for the rest of their lives.
 
They follow the leadership of Gary and are technically employees, but have the freedom of expressing themselves in a way that is completely fulfilling. And because they’re helping build his brand, monetarily they’ll be rewarded in ways where they never have to worry about income again.
 
##### My Closing Thoughts
 
Some people that might be reading this right now struggle with that.
 
_“I don’t have an idea.”_
 
_” just don’t have the risk tolerance of being an entrepreneur.”_
 
_“I like knowing that if I showed up, I get paid.”_
 
Well then, what’s important is to align yourself with people like Andy, Gary Vaynerchuk, or myself who are holding the flag and moving forward but desperately need people who share the vision, share the passion and just would like the leadership to be set in front of them and then having the creative space of their own to work as well.
 
The world can’t be 100% entrepreneurs, so if you’re thinking it might not be for you, then the concept of intrapreneurship is something you should study.

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I just started diving into the research behind autoimmune disease and Paleo diets, and I'm sold. I have had Alopecia Areata for almost a year now, and going to the doctors and being told there's nothing they can do is getting pretty exhausting. I know things can be worse than your hair falling out, but still...I need to fix this. I'm a 21 year old female, and my weight right now is approx. 179. I am frequently fatigued and I never feel 100%. I'm ALWAYS cold (hands &amp; feet), I usually wake up during the night, and I have 
I had the Gastric Bypass RNY in May 2012, and I want to not regret that decision, but I am. Approximately 2 years post-op (around this time 2014), I started exercising frequently (2-3x/week), eating a relatively balanced diet, and I began taking birth control last January. From January onward, I had pretty frequent occurrences of Hypoglycemia, I went and saw an endocrin and everything was fine. The low-blood sugar stopped happening as frequent, and I just continued on. So May 2014, I noticed my first bald spot and it was right around the time my mother started declining. In August she passed away. So with the increased stress that I'm trying to manage, a full college course load, a part time job and an internship, the only thing that I can control is my diet. As of today (3/11/14) I'm over half bald, and my eyebrow is falling out. 

IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE!

I've started dipping into Paleo over the past few weeks. I haven't had caffeine in 3 weeks, and my water intake is increasing day by day. I'm doing my best to not eat anything processed, but on a college budget it's pretty tough. 

So I guess my questions are:

1. For those of you who have ANY autoimmune disease, how long did it take for you to feel better? Have your symptoms subsided?
2. Are there any college students who recommend how to tackle this while living away from home? (I've started making my meals on the weekend and then bringing them to school with me)

I've tried getting friends &amp; family involved in this, or atleast supportive of my decision to do this, and it's become rather difficult. Many of them don't see this as a recommendation from a doctor, and therefor it's not proven so why do it. Just looking for a little support/tips :)

2yow9y,1,2015-03-11,"I need to choose between working at a prison for lots of money or working IT at a school for a whole lot less money, with the slight possibility of a promotion that will pay as much as the prison.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yow9y/i_need_to_choose_between_working_at_a_prison_for/,"I am 20 years old with a little college, but no degree. I am living with my girlfriend's family, paying really low rent. I am an ""assistant technician"" at a high school, i.e. I am an intern who gets paid minimum wage. Right now, there are a few actual technicians and one network admin and one director (the big boss). The ""network admin"" does literally nothing all day except eat and watch movies on his work computer and the big boss is looking to get him fired, but the network admin is friends with everyone at the district office, who are in charge of whether he gets fired or not. So in short, if he gets fired, a technician will get his job and I will get a technician's job, starting at around 50k.


My close friend works at a prison and makes 150k (including overtime) and if I got a job there (pretty easy to get), I would make 50k initially and it would increase every year, getting to about 100k in just a few years. I would get free health, life, dental, eye insurance and I would have no limit on the overtime I could put in (1.5 times normal pay).
I have 3 options I am considering.


1. Stay with the school and hope the network admin gets fired so I can have a technician's job, making minimum wage while I wait.


2. Go work at the prison (it would take quite a while for the job to start, at least a year from when I apply. I would work my current position until then.)


3. Try to get an IT job somewhere else that is a real job, not a minimum wage ""intern"" job. This would require me to study for and get a few IT certifications, which I wouldn't have to do to get the technician's job at my current workplace. I estimate it would take me at most a year to get the two main certifications and maybe one or two more optional ones. I have also been looking around and there are no open positions for any kind of administrative IT job, network admin, technician anywhere close to me, and I don't want to move.


I want to make money, but I also know that I should work in a job that I enjoy, and not one that is just for money. What should I do?"

-I have a GED, and I have not taken the SATs

-I am only 18, so I cannot claim independence for FAFSA, nor can I take a loan without a co-signer AFAIK

-It will be hard to get a scholarship from FAFSA because my mother's theoretical income is very high. However, she pays a large chunk of her income to loans, which is something the FAFSA doesn't consider.

I took the self administered exam (SAE) calculated a raw score of 76%.

I'm trying to get an idea of how much more time I should prepare. CBMT requires about 2 weeks after the application is submitted before I can register for the exam, and I have 90 days to register at that point. **Should I apply now, and continue to review for these 2 weeks and register for the exam once I'm ready?** (as opposed for applying and waiting 2+ weeks once I believe I am ready.)

Also: I understand that the CBMT exam is scored out of 130 questions. My score of 76% was out of 150 total items from the practice. After some reading on cbmt.org I could not determine the score required to pass. **What is the pass/fail cutoff percentage?**

Finally: It seems that I'm lacking in Music Theory and Professional Development, **what materials would you suggest for brushing up on these sections?**

2yp6z5,3,2015-03-11,This will be tough,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2yp6z5/this_will_be_tough/,"I've been a long time lurker of this thread, which is starting to make me think there's a reason for it. I started smoking freshman year of college and I am currently a junior. I used to only do it every once in a while, but now it's an every day thing. I live in a fraternity house where there is an overabundance of weed all the time, and there will always be a buddy coming up to me trying to smoke. It's so easy and safe to just hit a bowl with my friends because it makes me not care for two hours about whatever work I'm supposed to be doing.

 I feel like this use of weed every day is keeping me from progressing academically, spiritually, and mentally. My conscience has really been bugging me about taking this step. I quit for a few weeks previously this semester, and I had never been so clear headed, and got awesome grades. Mentally I felt stronger and more comfortable with myself. 

The problem for me is that every time I buy weed, I end up smoking it until it's gone. I can't just have an eighth sitting in my drawer and not be smoking it. I wish I could buy an eighth and go for days without even remembering it's still there, but the fact that I can't is showing me that weed has too much influence on my life. There's always that little voice in the back of my head telling me ""You can smoke right now you've got nothing to do for the next two hours"" when in reality there's always some sort of work I should be doing. Even if I truly didn't have any work to do, I'd still be in a haze, going through the motions rather than really trying to focus on class, work, and generally experiencing life. 

Junior year and senior year of college are critical when it comes to grades, internships, and ultimately starting a career. I really don't want to mess things up because I can't quit smoking weed. Drug tests are imminent, and I'd much rather take a drug test without the fear of possibly not passing. 

It will be tough in this environment to not smoke, but I'm determined to get back to how I was at the beginning of the semester when I had never felt so comfortable with my sober self. Thanks for the support."

It is fairly interesting but I am struggling to figure out how I can integrate this with chemical engineering and make myself look marketable to employers. I have been doing this for about six months and am looking for a co-op/internship for the summer. I'm not exactly sure what I would like to do in the end with my degree so I am open to that.
There is also a few possible research positions for undergrad students available at my university though I am not sure how many of them pay/how much they pay. My questions are, what is a good way to market my IT experience to employers and what are some likely applications that this experience could lead me to in my career? How important is an internship? Would doing paid research over the summer be just as good as an internship?

I know that's a lot, but if you have any ideas on even just one of my questions I would really appreciate hearing it. Thanks in advance!


Edit: I guess I should also mention that I need to have some sort of paid position while I am going to school.
Also my GPA is around 3.2-3.3 and my graduation date is May 2016."

A bit of background:

&amp;nbsp;

I started working at an engineering company in 2014 that I had interned at before. During my time interning, I made a couple friends. One of the members of my product team, John*, was fairly young and a good ""buddy"" (the company assigns them so the interns have someone less intimidating to talk to). We got pretty close and were comfortable talking about our hobbies and lives outside of work. At the end of the summer, John* and his girlfriend of ~8 years took some of the interns out for dinner including myself. I lost touch with John over the next 2 years.

 &amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to summer 2014 when I returned to the company for full-time employment. We picked our friendship back up when I was assigned in the same sector of the company as John*. The problems started to arise when John* started acting more than friendly towards me. I donated my hair for cancer survivors, and he told me how beautiful I looked. I found this comment to be strange, but tried to push it out of my mind. Soon after that, John told me that he was getting divorced. One night his wife called me asking if I knew where he was (she had my number from the intern dinner 2 years ago); I had no clue where he was, nor did I know why she decided to call me about it. I didn't ask because she was in a poor state. Around the same time, I had started seeing someone, but I had not mentioned it. A few weeks after the big fight with his soon-to-be ex, my boyfriend had to pick me up from work while my car was being repaired. The next day at work, I found a note on my desk: “I can’t stand seeing you with another man.” At this point, my mind put together all the pieces; I had been clouded by assuming the best from John. I told him that it wasn’t my problem, but the harassment from him didn’t stop there. He started buying me jewelry – bracelets, rings – ranging up to $200 in value. I returned them to him, saying I would not accept them, that he could not buy my feelings. John would tell me that he would take much better care of me than my boyfriend could. He asked me out to dinner, trying to make me go behind my boyfriend’s back, which I promptly refused. Last weekend, he Facebook messaged me saying that he loved me and that he missed me (it seemed to be a drunk message, but I’m not going to assume anything anymore). He keeps stopping by my cube to talk, and I keep having to tell him to get out. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t know what my options are. Going to HR might put me in a bad situation as he could just fire back and say that he misinterpreted my interest in our friendship. His longer employment time and value to the company might sway HR to keep him and fire or reassign me. I just see this backfiring is so many ways. Any advice from someone who went through this would help so much.

I've been interviewing with companies for internships as well as reading CTCI and I'd like to refine my interviewing technique since it might be holding me back a bit.

Occasionally I still rush into solving a problem by beginning to write the code immediately. Nowadays, most times I'll ask the interviewer if they mind that I first just kind of speak to them conceptually about one or multiple ways that I might tackle the problem. This latter way tends to help consolidate my thoughts and help give me a better idea of how to actually write the code. I can also try to think of questions I can ask that may clarify what they're asking for or what the problem requires. This is helpful especially since I have a tendency to be quite nervous and freeze up at the coding portion itself - even when I've solved the problem on my own before just fine in the past.

While I'm sure the type of interviewer also determines which process they'd respect more, I'm trying to figure out if I can just stick to one that's solid.

Is there a good step-by-step process that you would normally use? Obviously no single process can just solve the problem. But at an abstract level is there one that you've seen to be really helpful in guiding you to the solution while also giving the interviewer a nice look at how you problem-solve?

Any tips would be great!

I am currently finishing up a 4 year MIS degree at my university while working for a major consumer packaged goods company on their IT team as a project analyst. I was originally offered this salaried contract position after my internship with the company with fixed hours of 25 hours a week to allow for school with flexibility to work more or less depending on school work. I've clarified this with my director. However, as the project progressed and timelines delayed, I found myself putting in more and more hours due to key dependencies and responsibilities I have with the project. Since taking this part-time job, I have lightened my school work quite a bit and I am about a year behind.


The question and dilemma is should I focus on graduating once my contract expires and return to school full time (I have about 2 and 1/2 semesters left of courses)? Or delay my graduation while continuing to gain experience? I have already received a indefinite verbal extension from my director however I believe that my pay will remain stagnant until graduating.

2ypvh8,11,2015-03-11,[F4M] Fuck The Office Whore!,OfficeWhoreDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2ypvh8/f4m_fuck_the_office_whore/,"Every workplace of any substantial size has at least one official office slut. She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

**Mallock:** ... A little stage fright. *Victor Herrow. We have received your previous message. If you can hear me now, please respond.*

**Mallock:** What is going on? The Connection is online... Auditory Communications are active...

**Casey:** Forgive me again, Dr. Mallock. I must ask. The message - the, uh, the binary - what did it mean?

**Mallock:** What? Oh. It's a semi-colon.

**Casey:** A semi-colon.

**Mallock:** Yeah. *I swear to God, if that fucking intern waltzed in here and touched my computer* -

**Casey:** And this semi-colon... is it... significant?

**Casey:** I just -

**Mallock:**  Is it *significant?!* A dead man's consciousness is inside of this computer. And he spoke to us. This is the most significant semi-colon in the history of goddamn language! Do you comprehend that?

**Casey:** Dr. Mallock. Please. This is not my field. It is a simple question, and I think you can show some respect toward my limited understanding. 

**Mallock:** I'm sorry. There's just been so much doubt in this project up to this point. Yes. This is extremely significant. 

**Casey:** I'm going to ask one question. How do you know this semi-colon was not some sort of a... glitch? A semi-colon. Why?

**Mallock:** Why not? Do you think Victor has any idea *how* to communicate with us in there? His consciousness is code. His psyche - the psyche you spent two years analyzing - is inside of this machine, broken up into billions of lines of code. He has no idea how to exist inside of this computer- but he does. He doesn't know how to speak- but he will. He doesn't know how to write - but he *did*. And he managed to write a semi-colon. Whatever he meant to write is not important. What *is* important is that he successfully accessed Communications. It worked. 

**Casey:** I see.

**Mallock:** Victor Herrow has been dead nearly 5 hours... and he just wrote a semi-colon to me. Significance, Dr. Casey.

Yes, you're hot. You know it. You also know that I can't help but stare when I think you're not looking. You talk to me sometimes at night before going to bed, wearing that half shirt and the too-tight shorts. You come close to get some tea and you don't mind brushing against me. You delight in making me break into a sweat and struggle to maintain my composure. 

The worst was one night when you were flirting outrageously. You kept talking about how you like older men, not younger men. Older guys, you said, knew their way around a young girl. You twirled your hair. You licked your lips. You actually walked up gave me a good night hug and lingered a bit long, pressing your amazing chest into my side. I stayed stock still, sure that my erection was blantantly obvious. It was.

You left to go to your guest house, and within a few seconds I had pulled myself out of my pants and was frantically masturbating, thinking of your young nubile body. I groaned, spurting hot jets of cum into a paper towel. It was such a hard cum I swear I *heard* the splatters.

Slowly I came back to earth, my heart racing, my hand and paper towel covered in my cum.

I am on a YINI sandwich course and after months and months of application forms, cover letters, CV and various interviews, I have managed to land a software engineering job for next year.

However, I am very worried about my ability to actually do the work. The job involves development of embedded systems using languages such as C. I have recently started learning C but am only as far as making relatively basic text-based applications (i.e. taking some form of input and making it output the correct response). The most advanced part about my work is that I am thinking heavily on the memory usage of my programs and using things like malloc - but even this isn't really an advanced skill. I have never worked on embedded systems in my life and have no idea how to go about it. Th employer told me that they do not use an OS 99% of the time and this, once again, is not something I am at all familiar with. It took me a few days to properly set up the C compiler on Windows, I would be completely lost having to go through doing something similar when I don't even have an OS. I will be involved in the development of large safety critical systems and thus any work I do must be absolutely perfect which just adds to the pressure!

So far, this is all feeling well outside my comfort zone. But I don't know whether it is meant to. Will it be acceptable if I turn up and have absolutely no idea how to go about doing any of this or will I simply get fired within a few days for wasting their time? Am I expected to know how to do the job or will I be taught all of these skills on the job? I am worried that the other interns will have far more knowledge than I do and I will be the dummy of the group, holding everyone back. I can imagine people thinking I am slacking off simply because I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

At the moment I have academic experience in java programming, networking, and general operating systems maintenance/administration, and I'm looking to learn as much as possible. However, I have absolutely no professional experience doing any of these things, and, in applying for jobs (and internships), I'm not hearing back at all. That being said, if there are any individuals, companies, or personal recommendations as to how I can achieve some introductory experience into the IT world, I would be very grateful. I have built my own PC, and PC's for friends, set up home network and file sharing for friends and family, but again, nothing in a business setting.

2yqod2,7,2015-03-11,Paralegal Program - Most Lucrative Specialization?,wonder_muffin,paralegal,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/2yqod2/paralegal_program_most_lucrative_specialization/,"Hi all.

I've just been accepted to an ABA-approved paralegal program that offers three specializations. They all have the same basic twelve hour ""core,"" but the remaining 18 hours depend on which track you choose. Also, they do offer internships and from what I can tell, the internships are geared toward this specialization as well.

The possible ""tracks"" are Litigation, Corporate, or Legal Technology. You can combine Corporate and Litigation by taking electives from one or the other. Legal technology focuses on things like e-discovery, data recovery for legal purposes, etc. I'm fairly computer savvy so that sounds interesting to me. They also offer a ""General"" track which is basically research, writing, and civil procedure with a couple of electives.

My issue is this: none of the tracks except the ""general"" track include legal writing as a core class, and that's kind of bugging me. It seems like a great deal of what I'd be doing in Corporate or Litigation is writing, so not including that class is... troubling. Maybe I'll add it on as an elective.

What I would like to know is, in your experience, what are the most lucrative skills that will get me hired after graduation? I will have at least two quarters of internship experience, and I plan on getting my NALA certification after I finish the program as well. I live in the Los Angeles area, also, and am seeing so, so, so many job postings for paralegals that it makes my head spin. I need some direction!

TL;DR: What's going to give me the best shot at a job and experience as a paralegal in LA?"
2yqrc1,2,2015-03-11,At a crossroads and need advice. (Job/More School),[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yqrc1/at_a_crossroads_and_need_advice_jobmore_school/,"Ok I have come to somewhat of a crossroads in life and could use some advice. Some friends suggested looking online to get a wider array of opinions, so here we go. I can clarify anything btw if needed. Sorry for the length, but I feel like the whole story is necessary. 
 
 I graduated college in 2013 with a degree in criminal justice and an internship with a state level criminal justice organization.

Ten months later I was hired at a county level police force. Halfway through the 24 weeks of academy, I realized that I am not cut out to be a police officer. I loved the law and investigative side of it (I was top of my class the whole time), but I couldn't shoot or fight worth anything. I do not thrive in a paramilitary environment. Plus being a cop is a profession where you have to really want it. The only reason I chose it is because it seemed like the logical next step from a criminal justice degree. I made the right decision in leaving. 

After I left the academy I started exploring cyber security. A contact at a major company told me to go get CompTIA Network and Security certifications and then come back and talk to him. I knocked out security right away. I took the network class, but never got around to taking the test. (Subnetting and binary needed more study and it fell to the wayside after I got my part time.)

It is now one year and 70+ applications later since I left the academy. I've been working part time for a family friend. 

At this point, I've considered going back to school for a degree in IT with a focus in systems and security. (Offered through a local county college very close to me) It would take roughly 2 years if I also take summer classes. My parents have graciously offered to help me financially and house me again. However, I would still need to take out loans. I feel like this will give me a better understanding of tech and computers over just doing certifications. 

Here are my choices:

A.) Continue to look for jobs in the criminal justice field. (That hopefully don't require a paramilitary academy.)

B.) Go back to school for IT degree and sacrifice 2 years I could be working, and spend a lot of money to do so. However, this might open more opportunity than just having a crju degree. 

C.)Stretch out my IT education while working part time. (Will this cost more in the long run?)

D.) Focus on getting certifications over an actual IT degree. (I feel like I will need more than just Network+ and Security+ though...) 

Both my family and friends have asked me. ""Well what do YOU WANT to do."" Honestly, I have no clue. There is no magnet pulling me one direction or another. I have absolutely no clue what to do or what I want.  I feel like going back to school would be very beneficial and fun, but I'm still weary of time and money commitments to an ultimately unknown endgame.

Back at the end of the summer of 2014, I graduated college and got a small starter job in my home state of Maryland. At the time I graduated, I had a serious girlfriend whom I adored, a very close family, and aspirations to attend graduate school at some point in the near future. Over the course of a few months, though, I started to feel really depressed, mostly because I felt like my job was a dead-end position (which it was) and because I had significantly less to drive me being out of college. I decided I wanted to try out a new place, so I made plans to take a quick trip to Los Angeles, to see if I wanted to try to fulfill a dream I've had of being a screenwriter. Just before I revealed this plan to my girlfriend, though, she dumped me out of the blue (and I mean really out of the blue - there had been no fights, she hadn't even HINTED that anything might have been wrong, she just called me over the phone and dumped me.). My depression pretty much instantly worsened. I slept all day, barely ate, and since I was living at home, my parents decided to take action. They put me in touch with my aunt and uncle, who live in Los Angeles, and arranged to have me live with them for at least a month while I explored whether or not California was the place for me. 

Because my aunt and uncle live in a pretty good spot of LA, they were able to immediately put me in touch with a producer, who gave me a small internship in his production office. After a few days in the office, though, he and I got to talking about horror movies - a genre I've always been interested in. When I impressed him with my taste/knowledge in the genre, he told me that a director he knew, who was a good friend of his, was working on a horror movie, and would I like to take a look at the script and possibly provide notes? I said I would, and my ideas were met with a lot of enthusiasm. The final shooting script would incorporate a lot of my input, and I was given a day-play job as a production assistant on the set, since it was fairly low-budget and I couldn't be compensated like a big shot. 

Because one of the many things my ex and I had bonded over was horror movies, I texted her to let her know what I had been doing. She had said she wanted to remain friends and that I should keep her updated on my life, so even though I didn't know how I felt about it, I decided to include her. This turned out to be a huge mistake. She called me after reading the text to yell at me for having spent our entire relationship ""lying to her"" to ""pretend as if I was someone that I'm not"" (a plot point which, I later found out, she had stolen directly from Gone Girl). She tried to apologize afterwards, but I wasn't really able to accept it. That was in early October, and I haven't spoken to her since. 

Speaking of not having spoken to certain people since, and backtracking a bit at the same time, she and I were members of the same circle of friends in college. Since she broke up with me, none of those friends have tried to contact me at all. None of them so much as posted a meaningless ""happy birthday"" message on my facebook wall when I turned 23 about a week ago. So much for remaining friends I guess.

Anyway, a few weeks into my work on the horror film, my aunt and uncle started to get...weird. Instead of being the supportive, friendly people I had met when I arrived at first, from the minute I decided that I should stay in LA at the very least until the movie was done they started becoming very controlling, hurtful, and harshly critical of my actions. When I decided to stay for a long-term-ish period of time, I found a part-time job - however, the pay rate is double the CA minimum wage. That, plus the fact that my employers increased my hours per week to 35 instead of 20 because of my performance, gave me enough time to write in my spare time. Of course, to unwind, I play video games. It didn't take long, though, for my aunt and uncle to begin criticizing me for doing so instead of ""looking for more work"". When I spent time on the computer applying to other part time jobs, I got yelled at for not being ""proactive and going up and down the street looking for help wanted signs in windows"". When I spent time on weekends reading and writing, I got passively-aggressively snipped at for not ""taking my time seriously"". When I started looking for other housing arrangements, they attempted to guilt me for ""not being grateful about their sacrifice"". It got to the point where I would go from work straight down to the production office, where I would sit for several hours writing and watching TV to get away. I started drinking more than I probably should, and getting drunk more often than I should have to avoid having to deal with my aunt and uncle. Then, when I finally moved into my own apartment, I still couldn't do that right - my uncle criticized my new living space as ""too small"" and ""too expensive"", and was suspicious of how quickly I was able to find a roommate who wouldn't mind living with me.

In the middle of all of this, my grandfather died. I was very close to him - I credit him with introducing me to hockey, my favorite sport, and video games, my favorite hobby. He died without me being able to say goodbye, and I wasn't able to go to his funeral. I also didn't have anyone to talk to about this, because at the time my parents were taking my aunt and uncle's word for fact (I found out that my aunt and uncle would call my parents nightly and complain about me not doing anything, ever). I had several minor breakdowns because of this - I missed my ex, I hated my ex, I felt guilty about and second-guessed every little thing I did with my aunt and uncle, I missed my parents, my brothers, my dogs, and what few friends I had left, AND, on top of all this, I missed my grandfather and I was very upset that I could not attend his funeral (it would have cost too much to fly back).

I went home for Christmas, and spent all my time releasing these feelings. I spent two weeks with my brothers, my dogs, my parents, my dad's side of the family, and a friend who would come by to hang out with me. I broke down at the end of it, hugging and crying into my dog's shoulder because of a weird mixture of emotions - I wanted to go back to California, but I also didn't want to leave. I wanted to go and work on the movie, but I also just wanted to get my license and tend bar in Columbia, MD, and save up for a new car/grad school. But, my ticket was already bought, so I flew back and got to work on the movie. 

Things started to get wobbly as soon as I arrived. I worked my ass off for the movie and at my job, but I also fought off fits of depression and had several moments of severe suicidal thought. I started journaling in an attempt to get past those thoughts, because I'm worried about a therapist (my parents have had problems dealing with my depression since I was 15), but it only worked for so long. My aunt and uncle continue to be passive-aggressive, talking shit about me and my habits to their friends whenever they get the chance (even at my grandfather's Arlington burial, which I flew home on my own money to attend - like hell I was going to miss that). I came back, and celebrated my 23rd birthday alone in my room - like I spend the majority of my time. I've tried going out with friends and meeting people, but I'm never sure of myself anymore and I can't figure out how to change that.

Anyway, now that all the backstory is done, here's the point (and the TL;DR): I am not happy. I'm lonely, prone to fits of severe depression, and I'm living thousands of miles away from the only family who would care. I keep telling myself that I'm doing this to further my dreams of writing movies, but recently I've just begun to pine after going home and getting an apartment with my brothers, bartending, and going to grad school somewhere else. I want to talk to my parents about this, but I don't know what to do or how to start. I'm worried they'll think I'm giving up, but I'm struggling to be happy with even the smallest things, and I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall. I've started having suicidal thoughts again, and it worries me living pretty much alone like I do. I wish I could afford a therapist, but I'm also worried that no one will be able to give me advice. If there's anything anyone can offer, please do. I'm open to it. 

For anyone who comments, thank you so much for wading through this wall of text. It means more to me than you know."

The problem is that the project is way above my current understanding of CS. My forte and interests in CS is mainly revolving around web applications, but this internship focuses on Objective-C and the [Hidden Markov model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model). It's an interesting project and I'd get to mess around with awesome technologies that I wouldn't have had access to but I'm worried I just won't impress. I'd be the youngest person in the group by 4 years and am sure they have a lot more capabilities than I do. 

Another possible down side is that it's unpaid, and while in the grand schemes of things that isn't too bad, I had another internship last summer and was paid incredibly well, and I feel like chasing the money again this summer."

What do I do for summer?",confusedyoungcoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yr1cj/currently_a_spring_intern_at_a_somewhat_big/,"A bit of background on me: I've had several internships in the past at some startups, all of which were pretty intense and which I've really learned a lot from (probably because of the somewhat stressful nature of startups). I code quite a bit in my free time.

So right now I have an internship for the spring at a pretty big company. I like the people on my team, the pay is decent, and the work-life balance is definitely nice.

However, I feel like I'm not learning that much at all. I'm always asking for work and always seeking out new projects, but given the already established nature of the product my team is working on and the established nature of the company, there's not really much to do. It seems like I'm just making bug fixes and pushing minor features, and I'm pretty sure it'll continue like this for the summer even when I go full-time (I wouldn't be adding that many more hours).

What should I do for summer? I didn't sign a contract or anything yet for summer. Would it doom my career if I didn't intern at my current company for summer and just went to a smaller company (given I get another offer)?"

2yr9au,2,2015-03-11,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2yr9au/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2yrqyk,2,2015-03-12,Using student loans to buy a car?,Thisisnotathrowawaye,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2yrqyk/using_student_loans_to_buy_a_car/,"I've used the search, both here on reddit and Google in general, and the general consensus seems to be that using a student loan, especially a private loan, for a car seems to be a bad idea. That makes sense, I've seen the interest rates Sallie Mae has..

But I can't afford to make a payment on a car loan, and student loans can be deferred until 6 months after I graduate.

I also have basically no cash.

So here's the deal, right now I'm going to a CC, and I'll be transferring to a full University in the fall. At the moment, I've got about 4k in student debt, and by the time I graduate I'll have a little less than 55k in loans. ASSUMING I get the internship this summer, I'll have maybe 2k saved up by the time I transfer. My current car might be worth 1k, but that's a wild guess. 

I do not trust my current car to drive the 500 mile round trip between my house and school. And I'll be making this trip several times per semester. My current car has been in the shop more times than I care to admit, and the only reason it still runs is because my parents ate the vast majority of the charges pushing them even further into debt.

On one hand, I really do not want to go into debt for a car that will hopefully be replaced with a nicer car (assuming I can get a job out of college) within three years.

On the other hand, my current car is a complete POS, and I'm terrified of it conking out on me halfway home or halfway to school.

But it's paid for. I don't owe anything on it.

Should I take out a student loan for a car? If I do, how much should I keep it under?

Should I just try to make it with my current one? If it does give out, a student loan would probably be my only option. Is it still an option that should be considered?

In case you couldn't tell, I tend to stress out a little too much over what should be a simple thing."

2yrrk3,1,2015-03-12,My story. (Very long).,prefontaine123,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2yrrk3/my_story_very_long/,"I find my depression so incongruous with the life that I lead, that sometimes I wonder if I'm faking it. I'm tired of feeling like a fake. I wanted to write this because I don't think I've ever told anyone the full story, because I'm too much of a coward. A lot of this, I don't even expect responses, because I think I'm doing this more for me, just to let things out. It's really long, really really long - as I said, it's for me more than anything, I just wanted the feeling of telling it to someone. 

Around 2 years ago, July 23rd 2013, I tried to kill myself. Except I faked it, except I'm not sure. Let's backtrack.

The summer of 2013, I worked like a dog at this internship I had. I worked so hard that I was sleeping under my desk at work, and it wasn't even because I was made to - I seriously loved what I was doing. I worked so hard, my boss told me to take a break and go home, and I said no. I knew for the first time in my life what I wanted to be - a programmer. I'm an intense guy, so I focused on it - I wasn't the best developer, so I put in twice as many hours as the next guy. I also did it because I was really scared. Really scared of being unemployed the next summer (I'm an international, so being employed was important, otherwise it would have been tough to stay in the country). I left that summer feeling completely burned out. I couldn't focus, I couldn't concentrate on anything. I really missed being in a relationship, which had ended a year before and I'd buried that by sleeping around. But now? I didn't want to do that, I really wanted to feel something, anything. I felt so completely numb. School was killing me - I couldn't read anything for more than 10 minutes, I couldn't feel anything for months and months. Someone I'd known from high school fell off a building, but I told people that she'd been my girlfriend (we'd crushed on each other, but I'd been too scared to do anything), because I wanted to feel even sadness, because I couldn't. I tried so so so hard to feel something. I even went with my best friend and lit a candle in her memory, and I even cried, but it wasn't real. I just couldn't. What was wrong with me? 

From January to March of that year, I tried to so hard to be in a relationship. So so so hard. Because it meant that I could feel again. I went out with this grad student, who didn't want anything serious, and I fell for her hard, but I don't think I did, I think I faked it. I think I said a bunch of shit to her, that made me feel something - that made me feel a rush, because hey a rush was better than being numb.

At the same time, that fall, I'd gotten into this class that was taught by these two other students. I'd only signed up for that class because I'd had a crush on one of the students for like 6 months - I didn't know her, knew very little about her, but she made me feel something, so I'd gone through with it. After that grad student and I broke up, I'd asked this girl to dinner, ostensibly to talk about immigration issues, but really because I wanted to talk to her. We talked and it was amazing. We talked until 3 or 4 in the morning, about everything. It felt like being alive again, like someone had a key that could open the glass room that I was in. It was like being on fire. I didn't kiss her then, because I didn't want to move so fast. 

The next week we went on a date, and we ended up making out, but she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship. I couldn't take that - I needed to be alive again, so I just went with it, hey, at least I could feel alive when I was with her right? 

That relationship turned out to be horrible. I could never trust her, and it drove me crazy. Every week, she changed her mind about me. I felt so so trapped, but it was amazing when I was with her. I would do crazy things - I dropped 200 dollars on a basketball game for us. I would never let her pay for anything (I've NEVER done this - I hate shit like this). Finally, she was ready to be exclusive and I was on top of the world...except a week and a half later, she got really mad at me for something, I got a shit ton of anxiety from that and almost failed all my classes. She told me she didn't want to be with me. I stormed out because I was done being led on. 

Except, I felt bad for being a jerk like that and texted her, saying that we could be friends, two days later, but she said she wanted to be in a relationship. Again, I was on top of the world. I was so so so happy. This was someone I literally texted/talked to for 8 or 9 hours a day (and I'm usually someone who can't be with anyone for more than a few hours). 

But she used to say shit that really bothered me. Things like ""My guy friends and I go out and they think it's a date, and I let them think that"". ""X was hitting on me the other day"". It used to scare me so bad - I usually ran when I was scared - I ran 8 miles every other day for a month that June. But I was still ok. I still liked her. 

Then one day, she said that she couldn't take the fact that we'd have arguments, and she couldn't be with me. I felt terrible. It was about to get worse. 

I held on for two weeks - again, I couldn't feel anything, except now, there was extreme sadness. I felt like I'd lost any chance at humanity, any chance at being a whole person. I felt like I couldn't be loved. That was my shot, and I'd blown it. But I wasn't even sure how. Maybe if I'd hid everything, maybe if I'd pretended to be happy, maybe then everything would have been ok. 

On July 23rd, I got a lukewarm review from my boss. I texted her, highly emotional. I told her that I was shit at my job, just like I was no good for her. That I wanted to kill myself. I felt dizzy, and so I told her that. I lied and said that I was about to take pills, because I just wanted her to talk to me, to see me as someone worth being around. She called the cops. I was now freaking out, things had gone too far. I walked around my office, thought about throwing myself in front of a bus, but I was too damn cowardly to do it. 

I cried all the way until I met the cops. They took me to the hospital. They put me in a psych ward. That first night was so scary. I didn't want to tell my parents, I wanted to wake up and have it be ok. I wanted it to be a bad dream, except it wasn't. I'd told my parents that I was just in an accident and in the hospital. I didn't want them to be ashamed of me. I didn't want them to think I was a failure. Because I was. I'd failed at my job, and I'd failed at my relationship and my grades had slipped. I was completely talentless. 

I woke up the next day, and for some reason I felt fine. All I could think was ""Ok. If I get out of here in 3 days I can go back to work"". I was texting her all day, just trying to have her in my life. She stopped responding. 

I didn't feel depressed. I felt like a normal person. I just felt like I'd faked everything, that I'd done it for attention. I felt like such a loser. Compared to everyone else in the ward I was so different - I was upper middle class, and at a great university, with a great job and a great future. I was confident and well put together and smart. I started to figure out ways to get out as fast as I could. I felt like they'd let me out faster if I could prove to them that I had a support system, so I told my friends and my parents. My parents came as fast as they could.

I got my laptop from work, and I tried to work. But I couldn't cos of something stupid with the internet. I started programming again, I started reading. But nothing felt right. Nothing felt good. My parents didn't know how to react and they tried acting like it was all just a bad dream. 

I got out of the ward. I was exhausted. Completely spent. I texted her, she told me she needed space. That crushed me. I had nothing left. I mailed in the rest of my internship, although I tried working as much as I could. 

To take a break, I went to South Africa for a week, but it didn't really make me feel that great. I just missed her. I missed that feeling, I missed being alive. I went back to school. The first week I was there, I saw her, and I had a panic attack. My head was spinning, it was like my gut had been sucked out, I felt like I wanted to die again. She texted me, asking me how I was. We started to talk again..except within two days, we'd hooked up. This time she seemed really into it. She seemed like she really liked me. I was so so so happy. Things were looking up again. 

But they weren't really. I'd wait for her reply, I'd wonder what other dudes were there, I'd be so scared. I couldn't function, I couldn't do anything. It took me so long to get out of bed. She'd tell me about new male friends that she'd made, how she wanted to do stuff with them. It would kill me, but I'd try and pretend. 

After while of failing to pretend, she said we couldn't be friends. I'd hit rock bottom. I was failing every job interview I'd had (you try doing algorithms when you're sad). Everyone around me was telling me not to worry, but I constantly worried. I snapped at my parents, my best friend. I was so scared of them leaving me too. 

 I cut off contact. It was the hardest thing I'd ever done. Ever. I felt like I couldn't talk to someone who related to me on every level. How stupid. I went home for three weeks for christmas break, connected with my friends from home, came back rejuvenated. That winter I started to put things back together. Life became better, I started working on a startup, doing projects I believed in. But I couldn't push myself, I couldn't achieve every goal. In the middle of all of this, my grandma died of cancer, but even then, I pretended to feel - I didn't have the capacity to be there for my family.

It was March. Everything was finally starting to look up. I knew I'd been intolerable for a long time, and I couldn't imagine what she'd been through with my being in the ward. So I emailed her, telling her I wanted to be friends. I honestly didn't feel anything for her. We started to talk again, started to text again for hours and hours everyday. I started to get dependent again. She started to flirt with me, and I wasn't complaining. I'd say such unreasonable things to her - I'd want to make her feel safe about going abroad that quarter - I'm someone with resources at a young age (I have means and I've travelled a lot for someone who's 21/22, so if stuff goes down I know how to get people out of situations). She went abroad, we started to fight, because she'd tell me about dudes she wanted to do things with abroad. It started to kill me again. She was also crazier. She'd yell at me for tiny things(via whatsapp). When I tried to draw lines by telling her that we couldn't sext, or that she couldn't expect me to say certain things, she got angry and cut me off. I'd feel terrible and apologize so much (I was pathetic). She'd freak out so much about finding a job that summer, and yell at me for not understanding. I'd recently failed 10 interviews, so I thought I could understand. I got her a job at a startup I'd helped launch. Finally, while she was yelling at me, she told me she wanted to hurt me. She told me that she'd slept with her ex while I was in the suicide ward. 

While I was sitting in the dark, completely alone, she was sleeping with someone else. Yes, technically we were broken up, but it hurt so so bad. I cut her off again. I couldn't do it anymore. 

After school ended, she called me and hung up. I decided not to respond. I went to Europe to travel. Stupidly I texted her one day. She told me she'd moved on and then told me she'd cheated on me while we'd been dating. I couldn't take it anymore.

I travelled for two months. Started a new job. I committed to fitness, and got another job researching a field I'm passionate about at my university. I've lost like 16 pounds, am the fittest I've been in years and just got a bonus cheque for 5 grand. I have worked so so so hard on fixing my relationships, on being a better person. Because I know I wasn't the greatest before. I have great friends, loving family, the money to travel, ambition, focus, the ability to do stuff (and apparently the ability to be super humble...). 

Except I still feel like I can't be loved. Every two or three months I still get depressed. I still feel completely unattractive. I feel like this because I remember some of the things she told me (""I can't date you because of your race"", ""You'd be a knockout if you didn't have acne scars on your face""). I feel like this because I feel invisible - like no one could ever look at me, look at my face and think that was a good looking face, or a person worth holding. I get so scared because I'm afraid my friends will leave me (one already has) and I wonder if I should hide everything because no one can take my cyclical depression. 

On the outside I'm really confident(hell I'm a dancer and a fighter and you can't do those things if you aren't confident). But I haven't been on a date in actually years now. I haven't felt interested in anyone for so long. I think it's because I don't believe that anyone could ever actually love me. I don't feel like someone worth anyone's love. I feel like I give and give and give, but I'm never worth being given anything. I wish I could. I'd be pretty decent at it you know? I want to do things for people, I want to cook for people and tell people about me, and listen to them, and fall in love, but I don't feel like I'm worth it. I don't think it's ever going to happen. I think I'm going to be alone for ever. 

This is my story. I'm someone who's depression is bad and has been with me for years, but I still achieve stuff...so no one ever pegs me for it, but there are so many days when I can't do anything. Maybe this is as good as it gets. Maybe this is the ceiling for my life. Maybe my life is just going to be doing a bunch of stuff and feeling totally alone all the time. I don't know if I can handle that. 

I wrote this because I felt that maybe telling the whole story (which I've never told anyone because it's really long and in excruciating detail) would be therapeutic. It has been, but I don't really know how to get better from here. People tell me to wait - but I've been waiting for a long long long time now. Looking back, I am totally pathological and should probably be committed.

I'm just really tired of depression, of this cycle. Of feeling like a shell. In many ways I lie to fill that shell. 

Sorry for the length.

2yrthd,1,2015-03-12,Feeling Bad About Life Decisions and Need Help,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yrthd/feeling_bad_about_life_decisions_and_need_help/,"Hi Reddit,

For the first time in my life I'm feeling lost and could use your help. What I write below will most likely include lots of unimportant details so I will put a tldr at the end. 

To give a little back story, I am a 24 year old male. I moved out to Los Angeles to become an actor at 17, (yes I know it's cliche) and realized that I wasn't truly passionate about the craft, so I quit at 23 with nothing to show for that time. I had been testing out the waters at community college while acting by getting my prerequisites done for a communications degree, but decided after finishing the courses that I wasn't too keen on that path, so i switched to a business marketing degree and managed to get accepted into Pepperdine and a state school last year. After considering the pros and cons, of going to Pepperdine, PROS being that it's a beautiful campus, has a fairly well known name in some circles, and looks good (maybe) transferring to other schools, CONS being; Pepperdine is 60,000 a year, is SUPER religious, an example being it requires 4 spiritual gatherings a month (basically a way to get you to go to church every Sunday), tacks on so many additional general education requirements that it would take three years to graduate even after transferring, that I decided on the state school which is around 6000 a year.  Here are some of the reasons why I feel so behind (besides being a 24 year old still getting my bachelors which makes me feel like a loser). 
1) I still have to complete one general ed course, business calculus, which I am taking at the community college level. I just recieved a 43 on the first test, and must get a C or above in the class to move forward with my education.  The class is a roadblock to my upper division courses and is the only course I am taking right now. You may all wonder how I could do so horribly;  I actually did better than most people in the class, except for the 3 people who are naturally good at math, and he doesn't curve the grades. I don't like laying blame on teachers, but feel powerless in this situation. I'm putting tons of effort into a class I hate, feel screwed by the teacher, and must do well in the class to take upper division courses for my bachelors degree at a state school. Which brings me to number two.
2) I'm not knocking state schools, but I'm wondering if I could make it into a better institution or if it's even worth it at this point. I was considering applying to USC, but the way my Calc class is shaping up, that may not be an option. On top of that, I'm worried that any extra time in the school system is going to be more detrimental than useful.
3) I have been lucky enough to have been helped substantially by my parents up to this point. My education is taken care of, as is my housing, and I even have a trust fund left by my grandpa that pays for groceries etc, while I'm in school. The issue is that this actually makes me feel like more of a loser. I have zero money saved up, and I feel like the least I could have done is saved the money I get each month. The only work experience I have out here is catering and bartending, which isn't a career path I want to go down nor does it do much for my resume. I am currently unemployed to spend (waste) my time trying to do well in the business calculus class, and don't have any internship opportunities lined up.
3) My dad is a lawyer and lost his job for a second time. The first company went under, and the second company hired him and decided they didn't really have a use for him. Watching this process has made me realize that you can fail at something you don't like , so I'm stressed about what to do with my life. I was considering law school, another long stretch of school late in my academic career, but I doubt it would make me happy.
4) What does make me happy? Well as you may have guessed, math isn't my strong suit. I consider myself a decent writer, and am currently working on some children's books and a script. I have an app idea, and two documentary ideas, but that is always my problem.  Lots of ideas, little direction, little follow through, and nothing substantial to show. 
5) I'm mildly depressed.  I realize a lot of the stuff above seems trivial, but it's amplified by a lingering uncertainty of what my future prospects are.

Tldr; I am 24 still in school, have no real work experience,  no money saved up, don't know what career path to take, and am feeling overwhelmed by my lack of direction.

2yrx74,616,2015-03-12,"My father suffers from Alzheimer's disease, but he's never forgotten what he saw.",tjaylea,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2yrx74/my_father_suffers_from_alzheimers_disease_but_hes/,"I just want to preface this by stating that once this story has been told, there will be no followups. I will do my best to answer any questions in the comments but there will be no further updates, no sudden revelations, no continuation of this story. What is done is done and what will happen is unavoidable.

I'm sharing this with you all because if I don't tell someone, anyone that might listen, I might go mad overthinking it. Maybe it will also help me make sense of what has gone on the past few days and come to terms with a lot of skeletons in my closet. I wish this were only about my old man, some things are better left buried and...well...every skeleton has been dug up and plastered on the walls. 

This is one of those very few times where I don't have to alter much at all save for a few personal details. Maybe that's the most disturbing part. 

My father suffered two successive strokes at the tail end of 2010, it was sudden, unexpected and it devastated our family to see him in hospital struggling to write his own name and having severe trouble remembering anyone save for his wife. By the time I had concluded the 3 hour drive from university to visit, he was in better spirits, talking away to himself about his favourite John Wayne film and openly questioning whether he was a fun man to be around, making the nurses and interns chuckle as they tended to him. My dad was the light of any room and we loved him for it. Even with one half of his body numb and undoubtedly terrified out of his mind not knowing anyone, he still wanted to make other people smile. 

My mother stood adjacent to his bed, conferring with the neurologist in a hushed tone, looking over at my father as if staring at a dead man walking. I'll be honest, it was very much like looking at two worlds operating simultaneously within that room. My father seemed completely fine bar the hospital gown and slightly drooped face, my mother looked like she'd already accepted his fate and the neurologist didn't look any better. Maybe I'd just fooled myself into thinking the best of things out of sheer exhaustion. 

Anyone who has ever dealt with a stroke victim knows there's always damage of a collateral nature, often times it manifests itself in the ugliest and most dreaded form; memory loss. 

Initially, it wasn't anything too bad. Occasionally we'd catch him having conversations with people who weren't there or forgetting names, but he was still the same no-nonsense builder he'd been since I was born. Except now he harboured frustrations from not being able to work and keep occupied, so his ramblings became longer and far more laboured. Trying to get a man who worked his whole life to succumb to the monotony of early retirement at 58 can be a trying and upsetting process for anyone involved, let alone the victim of it.  

A year later, we were informed he required invasive brain surgery to remove a grade 4 aneurysm in his frontal lobe, had it been to the left even by a half centimetre, it would've been deemed inoperable. Lucky us. I remember how scared he was the night before the surgery, sitting there in that cold, sterile room. A man pushing 60 surrounded by men 10-20 years his senior in medically induced comas wasn't the most comforting of situations. Up to that point, it was the most terrified I'd ever seen him. I still remember the weak smile he gave before we left him alone in that room. It was the look a man gives you knowing it may be his last, it was a look that screamed to me;

""I'm scared, but I love you both."" 

My father was not a superstitious man, none of us were. But he was always open to what comes after death, remaining doubtful that there was any notion of a deity or afterlife. But the night of his surgery, I saw doubt in his eyes. He told me what to expect if he didn't make it, what to do with the money and to continue my university studies no matter what. He even told us what to do in the event he came out of surgery different or brain damaged, which to put in his own words was:

""Pull the damn plug."" 

We went home that night and didn't sleep, we knew his surgery was early hours of the morning and neither of us could bear waking up to the sound of an early phone-call bearing any kind of news, so we opted to power it out until midday when we'd get the all clear and could come visit him, undoubtedly cheery and making terrible jokes.

We got a call at 7:30 in the morning. 

In between a nervous breakdown and flippantly ignoring the laws of the road we got there in one piece. We were greeted with the specialist giving us a laboured handshake, proceeding to explain that due to the aneurysm bursting during open surgery, he was forced to make a choice: Let my dad die on the operating table or try to save his life with a very, very risky manoeuvre; cut off the blood &amp; oxygen supply to his brain in order to clear away the majority of the aneurysm, patch his skull up and hope he lives through the weekend. 

He essentially allowed my father to meet the reaper and shake hands. I was grateful, don't get me wrong, but in those early stages it was...difficult. 

I will never forget the first time I went into the brain injury clinic in Oxford, where the horror began.

Where I looked down the hall, through a sea of coma patients floating in the sea of purgatory where what was, is and will be permeates the very fabric of time. Expunging the soul from a hollow shell and beckoning it towards the decrepit, emaciated, contorted and ominous looming creature standing at the epicentre of it all, waiting for each soul to slip away from the body...it is there that I stared death in the face. 

And it is there I watched him grin at me. 

I find it hard to describe the sequence of events properly, it's almost like remembering a dream or re-telling an old story alongside a friend and neither of you is 100% certain of which details were right. 

But something within me convinced me that what I saw was a side effect of the grief, because when I blinked a couple of times and allowed my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the morose ward, the figure disappeared and I became completely focused on my destination at the end of the hall. 

Anyone who has ever been to an ICU ward will tell you it's not just the smell that is off-putting, it's the sheer silence save for the automated machines. The awkward, crushing silence. If the sounds of death could be manifested, they would present themselves in the form of steady beeping and forced breathing. 

Not many things prepare you for seeing one of your parents in such a state of incapacitation that they are barely recognisable to you. You're told by the Neurologists and attending nurses that you won't recognise them, but you always scoff and in your head just assume that 20 years of being around your parents every day gives you a warranted sense of assurance that you could never forget the contours of their face, the stress lines in their forehead or the silly way they part their hair. 

Standing there in front of the figure bloated from chemicals and being wired up to machines to such a degree that skin is barely visible through the gown, I felt like all familiarity had been banished from my mind. 

The machines did their job with precision and efficiency, monitoring his heart rate, brain activity and most importantly his blood pressure. If that spiked, it ran a high risk of further complications, so it would send out a loud alarm for the nearest nurse to attend to. It all worked fine, until I started talking to my father. 

It was during the middle of our conversation, assuring him that all his affairs were being attended to and that if he wasn't able to make it, not only would I finish my university degree at the time and that my first born son would be named RJ in his honour that something went wrong. 

The beeping rang out, cutting the unnatural silence like a gunshot. The nurse calmly walked over and adjusted the machines, explaining that his blood levels were elevated as if in response to hearing me. My heart broke at the notion because even at that point, I had resigned myself to the fact he was already gone. 

I said my goodbyes and promised I'd return tomorrow with my mother. It was only when I reached the other end of the hall that I heard his blood level alarm ringing out again, the nurse hurrying over and giving me a pained look as she passed me. 

Something had made his levels spike to dangerous heights; it was lucky she was there. 

I felt a chill as I left the hospital to get in my car; I had a sense of foreboding that didn't leave me until the next time I saw him. 

***

Christmas came and went, no signs of change in his condition despite our silent pleas. Mum stayed awake almost constantly and I blocked out the pain where I could with music, video-games and ironically, by writing. 

Relatives said they'd pray and go to church, friends kept us company. Both gestures were appreciated but neither did any good in the long run. Just a temporary bandage on an ever expanding wound.

It was New Years Day when we got a visit from one of our neighbours, Ray. He was a kind, reserved man who generally didn't go outside unless it was a priority; with him being a few weeks short of 90, I certainly couldn't blame him. Seeing him at our front door that afternoon brought with it an odd semblance of comfort, he offered his sympathies and asked if he could speak to us, my Mother was suffering from a migraine and retired to her bedroom, leaving us to chat. I poured him a glass of Brandy, my dads favourite and asked him what he needed. 

""You know, in my life I've seen an awful lot. Nearly 100 years on this Earth, most of my friends and family now buried, save for my wife &amp; Son. Death has made himself very acquainted with me over the years."" He smiled wistfully into his glass, swirling it as he spoke. ""I still remember the fear on my best friend Bill's face when we stormed the beaches at Normandy. He was only a scrawny lad, ""switch"" we called him. But he was one of our own and we looked after him as we would a little brother. On the boat over there I remember him looking out to shore and muttering under his breath, almost pleading. I put my hand on his shoulder and asked him what he was doing. Not breaking his gaze or even blinking, he replied ""Making a deal with death."" 20 minutes later we hit the beaches and Bill shoved me out of the way before I tripped a land-mine. He lost both his legs and bled to death right there.""

There was an uncomfortable silence, I didn't really know where this was going but maybe he was trying to relate to our situation and I have to admit, it somehow felt comforting, like a grandfather telling you stories as a young boy.

""He was only 19, poor lad. Gave his life for queen and country...and for me."" Ray stared up from his glass; he looked tired. ""He coughed and choked as he spoke to me. Told me to look after his family, watch over his little sister. Then...then he apologised."" Ray's hands began to shake and he stared at the photo of my father and me from a holiday long past, propped up on the mantlepiece. 

""Why would he apologise?"" I asked, hoping I wasn't prying too much into an old mans past.

""Because he saw Death looming over."" Ray replied, his voice cracking as if he could remember that day with infallible recall.

""That's understandable though, given his injuries..."" I trailed off, going into detail made me uneasy.

""No, lad."" Ray said, his hands shaking as he downed the last of his glass, 
""He saw Death looming over **me**."" 

There was an uncomfortable silence. I didn't want to be the one to rationalise the situation, I was far too mentally exhausted for that. Eventually, Ray elaborated. 

""You've seen it, haven't you lad? Something that shouldn't have been there."" He stared at me, unblinking.

""Look, I know what you're saying, but I don't believe in ghosts or supernatural entities.""

""And you think I do?"" He laughed nervously. ""Perish the thought, war took away any notion of demons, ghosts and gods from my mind. Man is the true evil in this world; there is no need for something else to fill that void. But Death, well he's a part of life whether you want to accept that or not."" He poured another glass of Brandy. ""Death has always been shown as a hooded creature with the scythe and the skeletal features, but that's not what most folks see. That's not what I've seen. Judging from the look on your face, that's not what you've seen either. I won't pry any further and I didn't come here to talk you to death. But I did come here to accomplish three things: Offer my sympathies, let you know I understand on many different levels what you're going through and to issue you a warning."" 

""A warning? Why?"" He stood up to leave, shaking my hand and saying nothing as he walked to the door. It was only when he crossed the threshold and turned back that I saw why he was so reluctant to tell me. 

The look. The pained, terrified look on his face when he stared into my eyes.

""Because I've seen him recently, leaning over your father and wailing."" 

He bowed his head and walked down the road, muttering as he did; if it hadn't been so quiet, I may not have picked up on what he said. I wish I had been unable to.

""Pity, he's so young...just like Switch."" 

***

My dad, incredibly, woke up out of his coma on January 8th 2012. He'd had a tracheotomy and was unable to speak while it healed. 
This was more frustrating for him than anything else--not only unable to communicate properly with us, but due to the trauma his brain had received during surgery, he had virtually no memory of us. 

The only times we could get him to communicate were if there was only one person there. He seemed to really struggle to pay attention otherwise, like there was simply too much to focus on. He would never meet our gaze, either. Always looking over our shoulder and nodding, some basic form of acknowledgment that ultimately amounted to nothing. Just simple understanding from a simple man.

It was around this time we saw he wasn't getting better, we ended up sleeping a lot less, fearing the worst.

He saw a neurologist three days after he woke up and they informed us he'd suffered ischemia of the brain, which by proxy was causing something akin to Alzheimer's disease. Slow, but progressive. No timeframe was ever given and we were told he would regain most of his memories over time, but would ultimately lose them over the next few years. First his long term, then his short term. We were devastated; it was heartbreaking to watch him struggle. We made the best of it, and eventually shades of who he once was returned, like light shining through the cracks of a cocoon. He was happier, calmer and more child-like than he once was. 

I often felt when visiting that I was now the parent, the proverbial torch handed over to me despite him having survived the ordeal. The only thing that disturbed me all these years was his reluctance to be left alone anywhere. You have to understand that my Father was by no stretch of the imagination a timid or weak man. He had worked for nearly 40 years as a Plumber and Builder; he was small, but strong and fiercely independent. To see him reduced to a man who would have panic attacks when he was left on his own and not be able to explain why was more troubling than anything else. 

It was only this past weekend that I found out why. 

Virtually every time I make the 300 mile drive home, regardless of what time it is or how exhausted I am, I will sit in my living room with my parents and catch up. I'm an only child and it took them 12 years and the better part of £27,000 (Nearly 60,000 dollars) to have me through IVF and I was doted on, even at 23. 

Once my mother would go to bed, my dad would pour a glass of whiskey and we'd talk about politics, life, love and where it all goes. Sometimes we'd discuss the entirety of his injury, other times we'd discuss where he'll end up. But he would never ask me anything, just sit and listen. 

This particular night, after a hearty laugh over his weight gain due to the medication he was on, he asked me something that still resonates within me. 

""TJ, do you know how many visitors I had while I was in the hospital?"" 

It took me a moment to mentally count them all--I had to include the ones from when he'd been in intensive care and non-responsive.

""12 including me, mum, your siblings, my best friends, my ex and your two childhood friends.""

He gave a weak, grim smile and stared down at his glass, much like Ray had done some years ago. 

""No, son. **13**.""

""Dad, you said visitors. I didn't include your specialist.""

""I don't remember much about the recovery process, but I do remember all the voices and smells of the people who visited me. I couldn't tell you when or most of what was said, but lying in that bed I got to remembering any and every encounter pretty well...and there was always one visitor who set me on edge every single time they visited.""  

""Why? Was it something they said?""

""It was the sounds he made, TJ. The godawful mixture of laughter and soft sobbing coalescing all at once like some horrible chorus of emotions. It got worse when I woke up. Can you imagine what it's like to sit in a hospital bed, throat healing up, unable to speak or scream but fully aware of your surroundings? I knew nobody and understood very little, but I still understood the concept of fear."" He took in a deep breath. ""Lying there in that bed, waiting for my 13th visitor to arrive, long after you'd all said your tearful goodbyes. He cut the air like a razor blade, he moved freely like blood from an open wound, his face...oh god his face TJ...the expression was frozen in anger, fear, joy, loss all at once. He would lean in close, making that horrible fucking sound and stare...just...stare at me, night after night. Unflinching, the sound never ceasing. You never forget a creature like that.""

He paused for a minute, lit a cigarette and took a long drag from it, his shaking hands subsiding with each second he inhaled. Once he'd finished, he stood up and turned away, walking towards the conservatory doors, his frame shaking as he did. But not because one side of his body was weak--he wasn't even using his cane. 

He was sobbing quietly, his back still turned as he tried to hold his composure while talking to me.

""On the last day, before I was transferred to the general hospital, he came back. He crawled into view, each awkward motion of his limbs complimented by the cracking of dislocated joints, as if he were an old-world spider. There was no grace, no swiftness, no finesse in his movements. It was like watching someone with Polio move without their braces. The sounds didn't stop until he reached the foot of my bed. One large snap cut the air and he rose slowly, the black eyes never stopping their incessant stare, not once. His face wasn't a mixture of emotion anymore, it was just rage, the kind of rage where laughter seeps through as a nerve reaction. No other sounds save for his heavy breathing. He got off on my fear, it fed him. It was only after he saw me cowering that he leaned in close to whisper in my ear.""

My dad turned around, his eyes bloodshot and tears streaming down his face. In 23 years I have never seen my father cry--it was unnerving. But not as much as what he asked me, that's something that will haunt me to my very grave:

""Why, TJ? Why didn't you tell me what was wrong? You never had to go through it alone, I would've understood, I would never have wanted you to die alone like that. So afraid, so isolated...so young.""

The floor fell from under me, I felt faint. How could he know? There's nobody who could have told him. Not to mention he has no recollection of my teenage years. 

He put his hand to his mouth, tears flowing freely down his cheeks.

""So much blood, so much pressure. He was waiting there, bathing in the blood. He was waiting on the other side for you, he was there when your heart stopped, he was there when the physician spoke to you...when the skies turned back and no light could be seen...how could you let his happen?!""

I struggled to find words, this was not a conversation I ever wanted to have with my family. This was my past, not my present or my future.  

""Dad, I...""

""How could you let this happen to my boy?! He was innocent!"" 

I froze. Dad was no longer looking at me; his gaze went past my shoulder to something residing behind me.  

I didn't just feel a chill run down my spine in that moment, I gained a sense of dread that I can only describe as the instinct you possess when you feel your life is in imminent danger. Worsened only by the fact that I heard no response from behind me or felt any presence. I also felt an overwhelming sadness. 

I wasn't just worried about some supernatural entity behind me. 

I was watching my fathers mind deteriorate right before my eyes. 

""My boy...my poor boy...he deserved better than this. HE DESERVED BETTER!""

My dad threw his glass at the wall behind me, falling to his knees and sobbing as he did. My feet acted before the rest of my body did and I went straight over to him, pulling him in for a hug as he broke down, repeatedly asking why. My mother walked in alarmed and saw the state he was in. 

""Put him to bed, TJ. We'll talk in the morning. I'll clean up the glass."" My mother sighed. She might as well have been ageing in front of me from the stress that's been put on her the last few years.

I managed to get him to his feet and he silently complied, he passed out as soon as his head hit the pillow. 

""At least he's at peace for now,"" I thought. 

I barely slept that night, my dad's story repeating in my head and the unshakeable image of this creature becoming more vivid in my head. I suppose it's a very atypical reaction to being scared, not wanting to sleep for fear of opening your eyes to something looming over you in your room. 

I was more scared of what my father knew and who had told him. 
Some skeletons are best left in the closet and thrown in a deep hole. But someone told my father where to dig and what he'd find. 

***

I was due to go home the following morning, though truth be told I wasn't sure I wanted to go anywhere until this was resolved. Unfortunately, bills don't wait for anyone and if I still wanted a job to go back to come Monday morning, I had to leave. I gave my mother a hug and told her I'd be down for Mother's day; she smiled weakly and told me to call when I was home. Typical mother stuff, but I could tell she worried and she really needed a holiday. 

I shook my father's hand and he pulled me in for a hug, tighter than usual. 

""I love you son,"" He croaked.

""I know, Dad. I love you too."" I patted his shoulder, this kind of behaviour was somewhat foreign to us despite everything.

""And I'm sorry, I really am."" His voice began to crack.

""It's okay dad, you've been through a lot and you had a bit too much to drink. Happens to the best of us."" I forced a smile, the pit of my stomach still uneasy with the incident fresh in my mind.

""Not for that, TJ. I'm sorry because he's getting closer. I'm sorry because I thought I could reason with him, but he's a force of nature and he does his job perfectly. I'm sorry because he knows.""  

""Knows what...dad?"" 

His grip on me tightened. 

""He knows your time is nearly up...and he never leaves a job unfinished. He just waits. Death is ever patient. He let you go once, he's not going to do it again. I'm so sorry, son."" 

I didn't know what else to say. I patted my father on the shoulder and attempted to recompose myself. 

I finished my goodbyes and got in the car. As I backed out to the sombre wave of my family, I saw my neighbour Ray tending to his garden. He gave me a short nod, took off his hat and bowed his head as I passed.  Even he knew. 

 I put on my iPod and let Pianos Become The Teeth blast through as I screamed on my journey home, unable to do anything else.  

*""Pity, he's so young...just like Switch.""*

On September 24th 2007 I was diagnosed with a brain condition that puts immeasurable stress on the brain to cope with the high amount of information constantly surging through it 24/7. There's still a lot they don't know about the condition.

*""He was there when the physician spoke to you, when the skies turned black and no light could be seen.""*

I was told the pressure would eventually form an aneurysm in my head, one that over time would grow and eventually kill me.

*""So much blood, so much pressure. He was waiting there, bathing in the blood.""* 

There was a timeframe given but for the sake of some of modicum of privacy I will not go into it. On May 18th 2008 I attempted to take my own life; I was unsuccessful in my endeavour and have not relapsed since.

*""He was waiting on the other side for you, he was there when your heart stopped.""*

My mum knew about the suicide attempt; my dad was away on business and while he knew I had a problem, he never thought it'd get that bad. After much begging &amp; pleading, my mum agreed not to tell him. Neither of them know about my illness or what will happen. I still don't know who told my dad or how he could know. 

*""He never left your side, not once.""*

I think the worst part for me as a rational man is the validity of his statements, particularly the last one.

*""He knows your time is up...and he never leaves a job unfinished.""* 

It was only 3 months ago I had my last scan.

The aneurysm has grown

He is always waiting. 

He is getting closer. 

He never leaves a job unfinished. 

*""He deserved better.""*

2ysqgq,4,2015-03-12,Me 23F and my boyfriend 28M have been together 4yrs I want to leave him but I'm in too deep and don't know what to do... Need advice,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ysqgq/me_23f_and_my_boyfriend_28m_have_been_together/,"First some backstory. We bought a house together 8 months ago, both our names are on the mortgage. We have a joint bank account and we file our taxes as married even though we technically aren't. We've lived together for 3yrs. I go to school and he works and makes good money. 


He's a good guy and he's done a lot for me but I just don't love him. I never have. I hoped I would grow to love him but it hasn't happened. I can't talk to him at all. I've been depressed for years and been hiding it from the whole time. He says he just wants me to be happy and I can leave him any time but then he turns around and says he loves me more than anything and I'm all he has and he can't live without me. It kills me inside to think how much it would hurt him for me to leave. 


I feel like a horrible person. I've been lying to him all this time, telling him I love him and I'm happy and I want to be with him when I've known all along it's not true. I just really wanted it to be true. 
I just started an internship and I'm the happiest I've been in a very long time. I know if I stay with him I'll never be happy like this again. I want to be free to experience life and go my own way but I don't know if I can bring myself to do it. I don't want to be a selfish bitch. I just want to be happy. 


I could really use some advice. This has been eating away at me all these years and I've never had the courage to say it out loud. I don't know what to do.




**TL;dr: Been with boyfriend for 4yrs but don't love him. Want to leave him but don't have the heart to do it. Don't even know how to leave him without being an evil bitch. Need advice.**"

2ysvqk,3,2015-03-12,Six years... all for nothing.,throwawaymybeau,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ysvqk/six_years_all_for_nothing/,"Throw away, because I don't like to air my grievances on my other account. Also, I'm sorry for any typos, but this is the hardest I've cried in a very, very long time. And also sorry for the length... but it's been six years, dammit.

We met in middle school, and I got a crush on him after a few months. He was oblivious for years, though we were good friends, and I never seriously dated anyone else.

Then he kissed me at the park when he was a little drunk... and that's how it started. That's how what I thought was my dream became my reality.

The first year was great. I fumbled through and we fell madly in love. Then I went away for college and we made the long-distance thing work for a year while he saved money. After that, we thought nothing would be so challenging.

So he left school, stopped working and followed me halfway across the country. We lived together in the city for my remaining two years of school and for two years after that. That's when things started going downhill.

We stopped having sex. That was my fault. I have a low sex drive, and most sex bores me. I'm not the most affectionate, but I thought I showed my love in other ways--buying things, doing favors, sharing my secrets.

He was never reliable. If he said he was going to do something, there's a 75% chance that it wouldn't happen. This especially goes for anything where he had to wake up early.

Money was tight. I was working an internship and a freelance gig. He finally got a job at a bar... but it was too late by then. We were under water, and had to move back home last July.

I thought removing the stress of money would fix things, that I would magically be more receptive to affection, that he would feel like living up to the bare minimum standards I needed. But it didn't happen. He just stopped trying, and I stopped trying.

He agreed to wake up this morning to go do some work with my folks. His idea, not mine. When I tried waking him, he was grumpy as always. And I was fed up with his empty promises. Even my parents have gotten to the point that they don't believe him when he says he'll do something. It's not cute anymore.

So I told him to leave. And he didn't fight back this time.

And oh god, I've ruined his life. He dropped out of school for me, got into debt for me. He moved his life around me the entire time we were together. But he also used me for money and favors.

I hate myself. He was the only friend I really had left. I'm as bad a friend as I am a girlfriend, and he was the only person I had left that really knew me. It feels like someone has ripped my insides out and replaced them with fire. Like a part a me is gone that I'm never really going to get back.

I know... I'm young. I have my whole life ahead of me to find someone, to be happy, to have a career... but I never imagined myself being with anyone but him. When I thought about my future, he was always in it.

*I fucking hate myself.* I miss him so much. I want him back, and it's only been an hour. I want to be a better person. But deep down, I know that I'd only be drinking poison. There was too much resentment on both sides. I wouldn't even know where to go from here.

I'm so lost without him... I don't even have anyone I can talk to about this. I want his arms around me, to tell me that everything will be okay. I want that more than anything right now...

But I have work to do. I have to go on with my life like nothing happened.

I'm so sorry... I never meant to hurt you. But I guess that's all I ever did.

I don't really care if anyone reads this. I just needed to get it out so I can work. And I don't have anyone else to talk to."
2ysxpo,19,2015-03-12,Is it reasonable for me to look for a Junior-Entry Level Job while completing my Computer Science degree?,gibbons16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ysxpo/is_it_reasonable_for_me_to_look_for_a_juniorentry/,"I'm in college for my Computer Science BS degree and am about to be in my senior year. I have had a total of 8 months in internships where I've had a decent amount of development experience (provided experience with Java, Spring, Struts, Apache Tomcat, IIS, C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, XML, .Net MVC, JIRA, Subversion, and Agile Development). Additionally, school is going well.

I'm thinking about the possibility of finding a junior/entry-level development position before I finish college, but am not really sure if that's feasible to look for (or achieve). As an alternative, I am planning on going for as many full-time internships as possible to optimize my experience before I graduate. Both of these considerations will slow down the completion of my degree; however, I feel it is probably worth it. If you think otherwise, I would highly appreciate your input and reasoning that could potentially make me think differently.

I will value anyone's input. Thanks!"
2yt2ia,1,2015-03-12,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2yt2ia/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I was with my ex for about 2 1/2 years with the last 9 months being full of fights and resentment. He graduated college and decided to not work for almost a year, during which he was battling depression and what his mother believes to be developing bipolar disorder. During this year, I was mostly living with him while finishing my last year of my degree and being hopelessly poor while completing an internship. The problems arose mostly from me being unhappy with how he talked to me and him snapping in moods during which he was uncontrollably angry and nasty. I was at a loss because I didn't want to lose him and would be very emotional, and he hated the attachment that came from my fear of breaking up.

During the last few months together we broke up and made up probably 5 or 6 times. It ended with him accusing me of cheating with a friend that I buy weed from, which I never did and would never even consider it, but no matter what I said he refused to believe me. He called me a cheating cunt and lots of other inappropriate things. So we didn't see each other for about two months after that.

Fast forward two month, I'm going through the worst semester of my life and starting antidepressants and therapy so that maybe I don't fail every class I'm taking. He and I never stopped texting, and eventually he starts asking me to meet up for coffee. I tell him no probably 3 times and then say yes. We meet up and talk and then go home and hang out. We end up kissing and I ask him to get back together and he says no, but we decide to keep hooking up.

We have a sort of friends with benefits situation for about 2 more months and I feel okay with it. I feel like some day I will be loved by someone I deserve but I decide to settle with the one I am comfortable with. I am still incredibly poor and he had since got a new job and was making tons of money, and I had not been buying birth control and he never offered to pay for it, so stupid decisions insue.

So valentines day, I pick him up from a work trip planning on telling him that I may be pregnant ( thank god I ended up not being) but I was scared. He is laying on his bed and I massage his neck telling him I had gotten sick this weekend and he tells me I should go home.  I asked him if he wanted me to home home if I don't feel like having sex. That is when he freaks the fuck out.

He says he can't believe I would say that, that I need to get out of his house before he calls the cops. I apologize and try to explain why I would ask that and he just continues to tell me that I'm a dumb bitch and I need to leave. That is when I start to cry and tell him I'm scared I'm pregnant and that I just want don't want to be alone tonight. He stops and says I'm a lying cunt and that he doesn't believe me. 

I couldn't help it, I just slapped him. Everything just hurt so bad. I slapped him twice. I don't believe in hurting anyone but I couldn't stop myself. I texted him later and apologize for it, but also said that the way he has treated me was unacceptable. That was a month ago, no response.

As far as my relationship, I'm struggling to move on from someone I loved but am doing better. I still feel horrible about the physical violence, and just wanted it off my chest. Any kind words of advice would be great.

TL;DR; slapped my abusive ex, feel bad about it."

I am a Computer Science/Information Security major at John Jay College, currently as an upper level Sophomore.  Part of my coursework for my major will involve a semester long internship as a Senior, but I am looking for something that will give me some real world experience and a better grasp of what I will be doing after graduation before my capstone internship.

I have very basic C++ programming skills and 3 years of basic networking experience from my time as a Time Warner Cable broadband installer, as well as a high level of computer literacy and a Master Certification in Microsoft Office.  I also held a security clearance in the Army and had a high level of knowledge of communication systems.  I also have a strong work ethic and a great ability to quickly learn and adapt to situations.

Essentially, I'm looking to learn as much as I can about the world of computer science, programming, and information security as I can.  I have a lot of school still ahead of me, but would love the opportunity to get some real life experience in any capacity so that I can better put together the pieces while in class and ultimately, beyond.  I am also open to working as an unpaid intern, I really just want to get my feet wet.

If you would be willing or able to help me, please PM me.  

Thank you."

We're 22M and 24M, young professionals, and very laid back.  The room is available through the end of June (3 months and change).

* $800 **including** utilities (electricity, water, trash, street parking, Verizon FiOS internet, heating if it gets cold again, AC (including window unit for the room))
* Radiator heating, dishwasher, washer/dryer, window AC units, trash/recycling services
* Around half a mile from the metro (East Falls Church, Orange and Silver lines aka easy commute to Tyson's if you want and two lines going into DC means you can skip the orange line crowds and hop on señor silver instead). Takes me around 50-60 minutes to commute all the way to Union Station to get to Capitol Hill.
* Very laid back living environment.  We're both young professionals, roomy's a contractor working in DC and I'm working as a tutor.  Spring and summertime are the times for grilling and chilling (featuring the screened in back porch as mvp) or kicking a soccer ball around.  

Room is available immediately, and we can prorate for the rest of March if you move in before April 1st.

Alright, for details, house is 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, close to Harris Teeter/Safeway/BJ's, close to Seven Corners (Target, Gold's Gym, Home Depot, etc.) and is close to 66 if you want to commute (20 min from Dulles which is handy). The house has quite a bit of character and needs some work, but it's a great location for commuting to the DC Metro area for a very reasonable price.  Perfect for recent grads.


Quiet and very very safe neighborhood, mostly retirees and middle aged professionals.  There are a few parks and fields nearby to play catch in or kick a soccer ball around and a great bike/running path half a mile from the house.


The open bedroom is the original master bedroom of the house.  The room has plenty of closet space (two closets) and plenty of space for a desk and a queen bed. Last tenant left a queen bed you can use, but if you want to bring your own bed that's perfectly fine too. We also have a good assortment of tables, lamps, and bureaus if you want to use them.


House has shared bathroom upstairs with shower, large living room with TV and couches, original dining room (currently the study) with a circular table for family dinners and a reading area, fully furnished kitchen, half bath downstairs, screened in back porch, grill outside, and laundry in basement.

We're not looking to have any pets in the house.  I'd love to have a dog but due to forces above my control (aka owners of the house) my black lab companion will have to wait.


The house was built in 1926, back when lots of Arlington was fields.  Much of it was redone in the 70s (thus the throwback kitchen).  The owners are currently in the planning phase on the work that needs to be done for the house.  I'll be honest, the house is showing its age and has some aesthetic issues.  The walls/ceilings are the original plaster, and there are quite a few cracks in the paint/plaster.  It's perfectly safe, but doesn't look great in some areas.  Additionally, the plaster ceiling in the dining room/study had some issues a few years ago (2011 I believe), so it had to come down. So the ceiling doesn't look great, but it's still safe!  I like to think it adds a rustic charm.  It doesn't affect your use of the house, but I wanted to throw it out there in case it is a deal breaker.  If that's too much for you, then this house probably isn't for you.  No hard feelings!  


And finally, a bit about me.  My name is Alex, and I'm originally from Vermont and moved to the DC area from St. Louis after I graduated from college to work on Capitol Hill.  I finished up my third political internship in December and am currently actively searching for Hill work as I work as a tutor part time.  I'm into lifting (separate application required for gym bro, but local Gold's is great), lacrosse, soccer, video games (we have N64 and a 360 with a few games and netflix), learning Spanish, mariachi music (trumpet player needed), drinking coffee and driving in DC traffic.  We can hang out and have a beer while we watch a Nats game or you can do your own thing, no pressure at all, and like I said, summer time is the right time for grilling.


Shoot me a message if you have any questions!  We can arrange a time for you to come check out the house, check out the room, and hang out for a little while to make sure we'd all fit together as roomies.


Thanks!"

I started snusing a few months ago due to getting an internship that requires me to be there from 5am-5pm as well as having a full class schedule (currently in college) pretty much every day and needed a little extra boost to keep me going throughout the day and snus has been incredible in doing just that. I'm in the US though, so all I have access too is General, which is great, but I am looking to expand my horizons! So I am looking to buy online somewhere and have found a few places, but what do you guys like to snus? I am not a huge fan of the original tobacco flavors so I was thinking something fruity maybe?


Also, my parents do see my bank statements so do any of the sites have semi-discreet billing at all? I know it's not a huge deal but would prefer to keep them out of the loop as far as my tobacco use.


Any help would be great! Thanks!"

Edit: was pmed with this, but the user's memory of the event is like a year old, so it may have some inaccuracies 

&gt;I noticed your recent topic today on terrible things Gawker did, and I felt like it was worth adding their contribution to the shaming of Columbia University freshmen: 

&gt;http://gawker.com/this-personal-essay-will-get-you-into-columbia-478217730

&gt;Basically, what happened was that there was a group of incoming freshmen, and they decided to share their essays in a facebook group via Google Drive to help each other along; they shared their essays to getting closer to one another, iirc, so that they would know each other and already have some sense of friendship when they started college (something along those lines, anyway).

&gt;Someone in the group decided to leak the essays to the rest of the internet for personal gain (possibly money related, I don't recall at the moment). I believe Gawker was the first on the line for it, and I only know this because a friend of mine had their essay leaked and primarily talked about Gawker's involvement, and their general refusal to take it down. I talked to them for a bit about it, since I had no idea what was going on. They proceeded to tell me that there was a lot of damage done by Gawker's insensitivity on the matter. Some people had written rather personal essays (fighting abuse, that sort of thing), and they were now being made fun of on the internet for it (not too mention their essay was originally meant to be shared with only a select few, not the whole world). The rest of the internet slowly picked up on the story. Worst of all, Gawker linked directly to the Google drive link so their readers could download them right away.

&gt;The drive was shut down quite quickly afterwards, iirc, but the damage was done, and there was no apology that I know of from Gawker's end (and since the article is still up, you can see the essay's are referred to as ones written by hipsters).
While the main essay that was picked apart was some weird tortoise and hare concept, I didn't think that it was worth exposing freshmen to the ridicule of being made fun of openly on the internet. Thus, I think this is a good example of bullying on Gawker's end.

&gt;(I haven't reread the original article entirely since it's publication, but I assume it's as bad as I remember it.)

Look at all that shit they've done, from posting porn to condoning bullying to god knows what...imagine, if a few hundred if not more collectively messaged Google Ad Sense? We did this for L.L Bean, Save The Children and Keurig and they all pulled out. Why did they pull out? Because the *evidence* is just so strong for Gawker's shit, it really is. There isn't any bad shit they haven't done, and all of it is archived. 

The evidence is in *our* court. Now it's time to let Google know..."
2ytyz8,2,2015-03-12,Is there any hope?,lambdadot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ytyz8/is_there_any_hope/,"I have been looking for a job for the last couple of months yielding in mixed results. I would really like to work in a position that centered around programming day-to-day. To give you some background, I recently graduated from a state university with a BS in CS with a GPA of 3.95. While in school, I avoided doing internships out of fear for being judged for a past transgression. About 8 years ago, as a result of a bar fight, I was convicted of felony assault and served 6 months of jail time. Now, when filling out applications, I am having trouble getting callbacks, or when I do get them, I am rejected after a more formal application is filled out. Specifically, after they ask ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony?""


I guess my question is, does anyone have ideas for a suggested career path for me with this in mind? When deciding to go down this path, I envisioned graduating from school and someone understanding my situation and giving me a chance to work in a normal environment. Now it just seems that things are bleak, and I might have wasted time and money attempting to be something that I cannot."

 I applied to:

Marietta. -accepted.

University of Oklahoma -accepted.

Penn state -accepted.

Colorado School of Mines -accepted.

University of Alaska Fairbanks -accepted.

University of Texas Austin -rejected.

Texas A&amp;M --accepted into school but not Engineering.

USC - haven't heard yet.

Georgia Tech (for Materials Engineering) -will find out Saturday.

I have narrowed my choices down to Penn State, UAF, and Colorado School of Mines.  What do I do now? I understand that Mines has the superior program, but I also believe that UAF has the advantage of being the only Petroleum Engineering school in Alaska (better internship possibilities). Is there anything that might sway me to pick one school over another? 

I have tried looking for statistics on internships and job offers but all I found were old reports from CSM in 2012 (before the industry got hit). 

Finally, if I got accepted into Georgia Tech for MSE would it be wise to pursue that over Petroleum Engineering?

2yu7p2,1,2015-03-12,How to make the best of a somewhat misleading position,vunsr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yu7p2/how_to_make_the_best_of_a_somewhat_misleading/,"I worked as an intern at this large pretty successful company (20k+ employees nationally) as a basic tech support installer setting up computers and software. When I was initially interviewed, I had no idea what position they wanted me to work but didn't care as I needed an internship plus they paid well. I was happy to continue as an intern there, but that area didn't have a need for interns so I couldn't intern there again. I took an internship with another department that worked more on supporting applications in a developer kind of role.

I primarily worked with a vended program, creating forms and working within that program to add new features (no actual coding was involved). After that internship ended, they offered me a position and I accepted figuring it was mostly going to be what I was doing with some additional tasks added. Well, the first month of my actual employment I'm getting directly into a C# MVC application which I had some trouble getting up to speed with, mostly because I haven't actually had a ton of experience writing C# besides a couple classes at college. My degree was designed to give a little knowledge of coding, requirements, business use cases, databases, etc. so I was not like some people who just had 4 years of computer science and lots of time to code and so on.

I started working on some SQL related stuff and found it immensely more enjoyable, I still have some trouble with it since I didn't have any really intense courses on it but I am far more comfortable with it than C#, MVC, or Javascript. Recently I have been assigned more work in the C# space, but again I feel very novice here as I honestly don't like programming that much. When work is over, I generally am done and don't want to deal with coding anymore which I know is different than many who really enjoy it.

With that said, what should I do? I work with wonderful people, the working arrangement is excellent, and the pay is decent but despite writing a few simple C# applications in college I am miserable at it in reality. My manager is a senior developer and has mentioned that I am welcome to ask any questions, but I feel like if I ask some really basic questions they're going to think I'm useless and just get rid of me. Give you an example: I struggle with basic Javascript stuff pretty badly. I only figure it out by just changing a bunch of random parts of it until what I want works, I never really know what I'm doing. I've tried using like Firefox's JS debugger but I have no idea how it works or how to use it. I've never had any complex tasks assigned to me either, so I feel like if they give me one they'll know I'm clueless.

I'd be more content to put in the effort to learn about SQL, databases, and things like that as it seems easier to grasp but I don't really know what role that would be, maybe DBA? I'm generally left to do my tasks so I don't have someone breathing down my neck, but I feel awful when I take way too long to do something I know shouldn't be that hard and I am intimidated to ask questions that I feel are too basic. Are some people just not wired the same way to truly understand coding? I did great in my programming courses but I had specific directions, they were pretty simple, and had very little outside of the core program. I feel like I jumped from those simple programs to advanced level, and because I haven't coded regularly I sometimes don't even remember basic coding concepts without looking them up again (which I think makes me look even worse when I don't know what recursion is off the top of my head).

Advice please? I have worked at this company for over a year, I'd like to keep working here and even with the same people but I think I'd almost need to be spoon fed to learn this programming in a proficient manner which I can't see them doing. How much skill level do most companies expect from a basic developer? I had assumed from the work I had been doing that that was what they considered a developer, since I know that differs from company to company so when the C# stuff came in I was a bit surprised but I did at least have some knowledge of it."
2yuao4,2,2015-03-12,Is it reasonable to be upset that the job I was interviews for and hired on isn't really what I've been assigned to now that I'm working there?,Bladethegreat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yuao4/is_it_reasonable_to_be_upset_that_the_job_i_was/,"Quick background: Recent college grad, after graduating in December managed to get a few offers relatively quickly and started this job at the start of February. The position is a contract to hire for a major corporation and I'm there for 6 months on a contract before they decide whether or not they want to offer me a full-time position, and in turn in which I decide whether or not this is the kind of place I want to work. The way this was sold to me by the recruiter that I spoke to was a position on the development team. Every developer that intereviewed me was on the development team working on new features for this company's software, every question I asked about what kind of projects were being worked on now and what my first few weeks-months would look like were answered by things about working on the development team. 

Cut to my first day, and my manager immediately brings me to the support team and says that I'll start off there for a while in order to get a general idea about the codebase and domain and would be transferred to development a little later on. Met with my manager today to discuss what was expected of me in terms of what I should learn from support and to get a timeframe on moving to development and he answered that due to the scheduling of the releases I wouldn't possibly be moved there until around August, right after my contract ends if I don't stay on full time.

This has kind of upset me as it seems like I'm expected to work here for months as my first real entry into the industry and be judged upon this position that wasn't described to me accurately. Is this kind of thing normal, for developers to expect to switch between support work and development on new features? I feel like I was pretty fortunate to get this job so quickly being so fresh out of college with no internships or big personal projects for my experience, and it seems like quitting after not even two months might reflect poorly upon me, but after today I just feel as though I should look for a new job that will actually have me doing what I'm hired to do."

I was recently made an offer for an industrial placement with Microsoft UK. The programme is divided into three streams, two of which are focused on Bing. I was very enthusiastic about working on the search engine, but was put into MCS (Microsoft Consulting Services). 

While consultancy isn't bad experience and I would still get to code, I believe that it won't be optimal for a year-long internship as a large part of what I do will be client communication. I am fearing I will dread the entire process and won't develop as a professional and person much from it. 

Another issue I find is that I will essentially won't be making too much of a difference in the company. 

Am I underestimating MCS? Or am I being completely unreasonable? How would I go about communicating that to the company?

I'm potentially needing to pick up python fairly quickly, and I'm wondering what the best learning resources are for someone coming from Java.  I have about a year experience with Java and programming in general, no 4 year degree, and was lucky enough to land a paid internship with a good company.  They've been trying to find a spot for me full time since September when I started, and my manager is going to our HR guy tomorrow or Monday with a proposal to get me a spot writing automated test scripts using python, selenium webdriver, and redwoodhq framework.  I had just finished the javascript course at code academy yesterday, and started the python course today (just found this news out a few hours ago), and there is a *ton* of information here in the sidebar and the wiki.  

Just from playing around on my own, I do have some experience with selenium webdriver and cucumber on the java side, and QTP on the vbscript side (much less there though).

That being said:

* What out of the resources here (or elsewhere) do you guys think would get me prepared the quickest in case his proposal goes well (here's hoping!)?  

* Are any resources more popular than others? 

* Would any of them be better suited for people coming from the Java side of things? 

* I was looking up redwoodhq earlier, and I like the interface/built in IDE(kind of?), but what is the most popular IDE for python?



I'll edit this post if I think of anything else.  Thank you guys and girls in advance for any responses, and wish me luck!  If this works out, I'm 31, and I will have successfully exited the job carousel of retail, restaurants, and car dealerships for a career in IT in only 13 months!"

I worked with this company for about 8 months and learned so much about developing projects in different environments, working with servers, and learning new skills (PeopleCode/PeopleSoft) and applying them in practice. (Fortunately and unfortunately) I recently had to quit since my partner got a great job out in SF (SOMA). We just moved early this month to SF from NYC and I've been searching for a job for a while and no luck. I'm stressing out. I've had interviews (with little web dev projects to highlight) and have passed coding challenges, but I am still rejected. And I feel like it's because of my lack of web dev projects and my inability to do white boarding challenges (I panic and freeze). So, I've been looking at schools like HackBright, gSchool, App Academy, etc. to help boost my web dev skill even though I have a CS major (and yes, I understand algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented languages like Java). (Fortunately) I got accepted to one of them which I was super happy about, but some people are telling me I should definitely be fine with my CS degree and I should try harder on my job search...

So what should I do? I was using CodeSchool and Codecademy to get myself up to par with my web dev skills. My biggest block though is not knowing what projects to develop and add to my resume and that's why I'm resorting to these schools because I feel like they have a great web dev/full stack development that may push me in the right direction and guide me with projects.

I have one week left to decide or my spot at the school is given up. I'm being torn in both directions. Any advice?

*****
TL;DR: I graduated last yr as a CS major with an understanding of Java, data structures, and algorithms, but no web development skills. I've been applying to backend, full stack, and software engineering jobs, but no luck. Should I enroll to a web dev/full stack bootcamp to increase my skill-set?

Thanks!

This is in addition to my B.A. in English. For those who don't know, a postgrad is basically like a specialization people do after their B.A. that gives real job training for areas such as HR, Business Admin, Marketing, Advertising, etc. I have some sales, office admin, and graphic design experience as well.

So for the last 2 months I've been applying, getting interviews, doing really well, but then getting overlooked because someone else has more experience. This has happened 3 times. 

Today I had an interview at a small start-up. They really liked me and I am meeting with the boss tomorrow (I met with 2 others today who invited me back tomorrow). They were really friendly people, and the business is growing and making a profit from what they told me (They do audio equipment wholesale to distributors). Thing is, the process was really disorganized and even the job description they gave was general, in that they needed help with basic marketing, graphic design, online content, admin, and sales tasks. I understand that it's a new company and that I'll be required to play many roles, which I don't mind, although it would've been nice if they were a little more professional.

Anyways, so for pay they said that starting would be $14/hour. To put it into perspective, minimum wage in Ontario is $11. Median income for marketing coordinator's is $41,000, which is about $19.7/hour, and MINIMUM is $15.5/hour which only 10% of people make, so vast majority make more (info taken from here http://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Marketing_Coordinator/Salary).

If I get offered this position tomorrow, should I try negotiating at all? In my last position, which was an internship, I made $17/h. This being full-time with a much higher workload I think should at least match my internship. Chances are if they deem my performance adequate I'm hoping I'll get a raise fairly quickly. In the mean time I will still be looking for other jobs. So I most certainly will accept just for the sake of having some income, but I'm just wondering if I should try negotiating higher? I sort of gave the impression today that I was okay with $14/hour as well. If I should, how should I go about negotiating? Thanks."

I've gotten 2 internships so far, but none of them have been with Silicon Valley companies. I feel like Waterloo has a much better reputation and program, and looking back if I knew I wanted to go into CS in high school I would have applied here for undergrad.

I'm only a few semesters away from graduating, so I don't think it's worth it to transfer, but I do want to apply for grad school. Grade-wise I have a 83% overall average and a 79.5% for third year courses. The minimum for the program I want (Systems Design Engineering) is 75%, but what grade range is typically considered competitive? Or are past research terms more important for admission?"

My hands and feet were cold, and I could not make it down the stairs to get in my GF's car to go to the ER without her supporting most of my weight. I got to the ER and they measured a heart rate of 180. They hooked me up to oxygen and brought the crash cart in, and a couple of interns since apparently this was an ""interesting case"". They gave me 3 doses of adenosine that did not slow my heart rate, and finally shocked me with the paddles. Thankfully that worked.

It turns out I had a form of tachycardia that was likely brought on by alcohol withdrawal (had to stay sober for a full day before to go to visit family). It wasn't a life or death situation, but it's frightening. I have been drinking 30 or so drinks a day, morning to night, for the last 6 months. I didn't think withdrawal would be serious for a 21 year old that hasn't been drinking for that long.

How do I stop this? I'm worried that a therapist/psychiatrist won't believe that a person with a short drinking history like me would have these levels of withdrawal, and this will happen again. I'm going to a detox center next week, should I bring the ER paperwork for proof of how bad this is?

Thank you for your help."

Quick bio about me, Computer Engineering Senior graduating in December. One internship under the belt but wasn't technical at all. Major is a specialization in networking but want to code and be a software engineer.

So I'm looking for advice on my situation right now. I accepted an Internship with a major mobile communications company, in more of a QA role, with the opportunity to write some automation code. While not my dream position, i accepted it because I didn't want to end up with nothing. I know that's a bad thing to do but if I didn't take it and ended with nothing I would probably be jobless after school and that was the thought process. I've been intern searching for a more software engineering type role, and have two interviews in the next couple days for an insurance company and a health care side software company. 

My question is, do you think it's a good idea to resign from this QA internship in a big name company, to take a more coding and development based internship? Or would it be better to take it and go through it, keep working on learning and side projects, and try and get a better position when graduating? My main worry is I don't want to get stuck in the QA field because I really don't have a passion for it, and I've heard that you can get stuck pretty easily.

I'm potentially needing to pick up python fairly quickly, and I'm wondering what the best learning resources are for someone coming from Java. I have about a year experience with Java and programming in general, no 4 year degree, and was lucky enough to land a paid internship with a good company. They've been trying to find a spot for me full time since September when I started, and my manager is going to our HR guy tomorrow or Monday with a proposal to get me a spot writing automated test scripts using python, selenium webdriver, and redwoodhq framework. I had just finished the javascript course at code academy yesterday, and started the python course today (just found this news out a few hours ago), and there is a ton of information here in the sidebar and the wiki. 

Just from playing around on my own, I do have some experience with selenium webdriver and cucumber on the java side, and QTP on the vbscript side (much less there though).

That being said:

• What out of the resources here (or elsewhere) do you guys think would get me prepared the quickest in case his proposal goes well (here's hoping!)? 

• Are any resources more popular than others? 

• Would any of them be better suited for people coming from the Java side of things? 

• I was looking up redwoodhq earlier, and I like the interface/built in IDE(kind of?), but what is the most popular IDE for python?

I'll edit this post if I think of anything else. Thank you guys and girls in advance for any responses, and wish me luck! If this works out, I'm 31, and I will have successfully exited the job carousel of retail, restaurants, and car dealerships for a career in IT in only 13 months!"

Went to College &amp; got a Bachelors Degree. Couldn't find a stable from 2007 until this year. &amp; the job isn't amazing but it pays the bills &amp; is within the field of Graphic Design.

Due to always having short term jobs (6 months at a time usually) &amp; then long gaps of unemployment, my finances were never consistent and I fell apart. I had to settle on my credit cards &amp; shut them all down. I still owe my student loans, which all went into default.

I always wanted to work within entertainment, but I only had 1 internship &amp; once that company went bankrupt &amp; I got laid off, I never got a job in that ever again. I tried &amp; still want to Voice Over work, but I never had the finances to support classes with my voice coach. It was just last year when he basically said for me to just focus on getting my life stable first &amp; then dropped me entirely.

My relationships turned out shitty. I was with a girl for 9 years before we finally ended it. Because of a co-sign on the lease, I'm stuck living with her. I did meet a great girl and still dating her but she now lives in another state because she had no where else to go &amp; we couldn't get the finances to move in together in time. Even so, she's emotionally avoiding me so I'll assume she'll break up with me soon.

I'm really at a loss of what to do anymore with my life. I feel like at this point I have no goals or drive. Just work, go home &amp; repeat till I eventually die.

I wanted to make something of my life. I never did drugs, got arrested or other bad things. I hate the life I have now. I literally feel like I can't do ANYTHING. 

My credit is shot, I never can get jobs with a decent salary or jobs in the field I want, my student loans are in default. I'm stuck living with my Ex while my current GF is living in another state emotionally avoiding me.

I'm just so burnt out &amp; feel like such a damn failure. I really had nothing but good intentions but it was always other people who got ahead instead of me.

I don't consider myself to be overweight, but I'm unhappy when I look in the mirror and see my muffin top! I would describe myself as ""skinny fat."" In high school, I was always a twig, but once I went to college I gained maybe ten pounds. Then during my senior year, I travelled two hours, 3 days a week for my internship. I would stop at DD and get two donuts and a latte every commute. I added on another ten pounds this way!

I'm now two years out of college and decided I'm sick of being unhappy when I look in the mirror. I've been going to the gym 3-4 times a week for the past month and a half and I count calories on MFP. I definitely have a bit of cheat meals, but overall I am good about it! I also drink a lot more water than I used to. 

I'm only a little sad because I don't really notice many changes in losing 6 pounds. My clothes don't fit any better and I look the same in the mirror. Unfortunately, I have noticed that I went down a bra size :( 

Anyway, I'm excited to continue getting in shape and seeing where it takes me! "
2yx0sb,2,2015-03-13,Help - Masters Student with Anxiety/Depression/ADHD,ajered,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2yx0sb/help_masters_student_with_anxietydepressionadhd/,"I'm a first year Masters student who would be in their second semester right now, but I elected to take the semester off as I missed five weeks of my first semester to be home and take care of my Dad who was put into hospice and passed away in October. After returning to school five days after the funeral I hit a wall and spiraled into the worst depressive phase I've ever experienced. I also have generalized anxiety disorder. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and have also been (finally) diagnosed with inattentive ADHD/ADD. 

Because of my depression after missing so many weeks of the semester I'm still playing catch up with some of my classes during this leave of absence period. I'm a perfectionist and always worry about what others think of me, teachers and professors in particular. When I returned to campus last fall after my Dad's passing, this one professor in particular had told me (more than once) in a casual way that he wants to work with me on my PhD, and he even told a friend of mine he met at a conference a month later the same thing. I was flattered, but I automatically felt the need to keep up appearances and impress him, which didn't end up fairing so well with major depression and anxiety already plaguing me. 

Nonetheless, I am still finishing up a project in a course he was teaching and when I was getting ready to leave campus at the beginning of February to head home he told me he wanted the project turned in by March 1st. Between the anxiety of starting the project and the impending deadline and lack of energy and wherewithal due to the depression, I started on it later than I wanted to once I returned home and despite working 6/7 hours/day on it for about a week I still wasn't finished by the 1st. I emailed him that day and told him that not having it finished yet certainly wasn't for lack of effort since I was working as hard as I could on it given everything going on (in addition to having to attend a family funeral/having family in town staying at my house the week before the first). I told him I would have it finished as soon as possible.

I never got an email response from him, which feels like a slap in the face and has revved my anxiety up and subsequently flared my depressive symptoms up again because I feel as if he hates me, thinks that I'm a poor student and not the student my 3.9 GPA, three internships, awards, and great recommendations say I am and always have been, and that I'm ruining a potential PhD opportunity/my future. I'm still working hard to get this project completed so I no longer have to worry about it, but it's just been so tough to do with my anxiety/depression having gotten worse. I feel like he thinks I'm just a ball of excuses when it comes to not performing when the going gets tough. I'm not sure what to do at this point. My family/friends keep saying, ""I'm sure he doesn't hate you, he's just probably thinking 'she will get it done when she gets it done'."" They think I'm making a bigger deal out of this than it is, which may be true, but that's what anxiety has pushed me to do my whole life - overanalyze and obsess. 

He's not an idiot so he probably has some idea that mental illness might be an issue given how unmotivated I was to catch up last semester, but I'm wondering if I should defend myself; let him know that this isn't me as a person nor a student and I'm trying to combat mental illnesses right now and those have been making it difficult for me to get things done. However, I worry about the stigma that comes with mental illness, and I don't want admitting that I'm having these issues right now to shoot me in the foot either. I'm sure no advisor wants to work with someone who has a history of severe depression and anxiety.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or can offer me any guidance on how to handle this now? Sorry the post it so long. Thank you for taking the time to read it if you got this far."

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Any college students in the same boat as me?,lnspire,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2yxirg/doing_horribly_in_school_and_feeling_like_a_huge/,"I'm currently a junior at a top-tier private university. Since I was a kid, I was always the ""smart slacker"" type; I never really put in much work but managed to get by on intelligence alone. Obviously, this did NOT do me well going to college, as I am surrounded by kids who were all at the top of their class. 

College was a huge struggle for the first two years, academically and especially socially. I was never really the most sociable of kids, and really had trouble making real friends during my first two years. This year, I worked really hard on pushing myself out of my comfort zone and made a lot more friends as a result. I've become far more confident, learned new hobbies/skills, and overall became a much better person. 

However, now that everyone is getting their summer internships already, I'm finally starting to see how much I've fallen behind. While tons of my friends/peers already have found jobs or research during the summer, I still have no results despite applying to dozens of different positions and interviewing at various companies. To make things worse, my GPA is crap, which is probably a huge reason why I can't find an internship. 

I'm really struggling with school at the moment, despite my work ethic getting a lot better over the years. I feel like I'm still barely scraping by school even though I'm putting in a lot of effort. Graduation is looming only a little over a year away, and I'm fucking terrified of not having any job prospects. I feel like a colossal fucking failure to my parents who grew up in poverty, moved to a foreign country, and worked their asses off so I could go to school and have better opportunities than them -- just for me to waste it all away. I want to talk to them about all this but honestly I feel ashamed of doing so. I'm really good at bottling up my emotions; people always comment on how happy and confident I seem, but in reality the stress is really starting to get to me. I'm wondering if anyone here who's had similar experiences can offer any advice. "

How should I approach this?",cutapacka,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yxje1/graduating_in_may_would_really_love_to_travel/,"Hi all! I'm about to graduate in a few months and head into the uncertainty of post-college life (yahoo!). I should be focusing on job hunting, but, to be honest, I'm more excited about the prospect of taking a trip my brother and I have been planning for the last month. We both feel somewhat deprived in the travel-realm and have a strong urgency to do a backpack-type trip throughout Europe. He's at a crossroads in his career, and I'm at this natural transition point, so we're feeling like this is an opportunity we cannot waste.

Of course, with such a ""carpe diem"" adventure comes reservations, mostly from my end. This trip would most likely be in July and last for over a month, so the question of whether I should attempt to find a job now or wait until I return is a big factor. In spite of my lack of enthusiasm for the job search process, I've been fairly career-focused throughout my 4 years in school. Several internships in the bank, and one I'm currently invested in this semester, I'm a little afraid of losing my momentum if I don't find a position right away. If I get a job now, however, I doubt I'll be able to ask off for that much time right away, and if I wait until after I return, I have this awkward 3 month limbo where I can *maybe* get a part-time job to save up money, or maybe not, considering I won't be able to cover the entire summer. I'd make this whole thing easier and just shift our trip to either May or August, but unfortunately my brother's time-table is a little less flexible. 

 I hear so many regrets from older and wiser folks about not taking advantage of their time when they were young to travel and see the world, I have the travel bug and would hate to shelf my dreams for practicality and have the same regrets down the road. I know this is a common conundrum many young people may have and uncertainty comes with the territory, so any insight or personal experience you may have would be greatly appreciated! "
2yxmws,6,2015-03-13,I hate that I miss them and still love them. I hope one day it won't hurt so much.,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2yxmws/i_hate_that_i_miss_them_and_still_love_them_i/,"I honestly don't remember when all the verbal, emotional, and physical abuse started. Like being called a whore and slut at 13 just because I wanted to talk a walk with my friends and the threats of sending me to live with my biological father who raped me multiple times. 
I was smacked around if my room wasn't clean enough
I was dragged and thrown around by my hair.
And if I started crying she'd hit me or scream until I stopped. 

My Nmom decided when I was in middle school that she wanted to get a different degree so she started taking community college classes. Two years later She left us with her boyfriend (now step dad) and moved to another city so she could attend a university. We saw our mother maybe once every two to three months then she started flying over 2,000 miles to a different state to do summer internships. In this time the only contact I would have with my mother was angry phone calls to remind me why and how I was a fuck up.

So I tried to ran away at 16 but was court ordered to ""work it out"" with my mother. After that my mother had me paying for rent, school supplies, clothes ect. I worked three part time jobs and finished school with a 3.68. I had to give her my signed paychecks so she could deposit them into her bank account. They sold my car and emptied my bank account, logged in onto my Facebook and told all my friends I never wanted to see them again and I was happier in the new city.

 After my biological father found out I was graduating high school he sent me $500. (this is the only time I had ever received anything from him directly. He only paid my mom $200 a month in child support for two kids and I watched her spend that money on herself) A year later my little sister graduates and gets nothing so my mother reaction was to blame me for having a ""special relationship"" with him. I went crying to my sister looking for support and she just played on her phone the whole time and wouldn't look up at me. The only words she said was "" I get it you were raped! so what?""

I cut all ties with them after that. I'm 23 now and married to an amazing man. But to hurt me my mother spreads awful lies and 
rumors about him and me around town and to our extended family so now they don't speak to me. 

Fast forward to earlier this year I get a call from an ex who I haven't seen in years but still talks to my family that my older sister had committed suicide. (My family also didn't feel like I should know the fact that it was later turned into an open homicide and that my ten year old nephew is now missing.) So I get ahold of my mother's number to confirm this nightmare. My little sister answers and starts guilt tripping me saying that I needed to take it easy on our mom. I informed them nothing had changed I still did not want them in my life until I get an apology. They called me heartless but I still don't know what was so hard with saying the words ""I'm sorry""

I hate my birthday, holidays, and any thing having to do with family in general. I want to start a family in a few years but I'm terrified my mother will use it as an excuse to bully her way back into my life.

I've already had my interview and I think I did well. After a few weeks of leaving messages I finally got in contact with the recruiter and was told that they hadn't made any decisions yet and that there will be an open house the week after next.

One of the people that was present during the interview happened to be the the group coordinator, and so I know I'll want to say something to him, but what?

I've been pounding the books and online tutorials on C# and getting used to Visual Studio - doing my homework - but I just want to know if there are any specific things I should go in knowing. I've had interviews before, but never heard of any kind of open house for this sort of thing. Any tips, guys n' gals? "
2yxpnv,3,2015-03-13,"Me [21 F] with my mom [48 F] and dad [50 M],setting myself on fire to keep them warm.",wonderingwhether54,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2yxpnv/me_21_f_with_my_mom_48_f_and_dad_50_msetting/,"So I've lurked on this subrreddit many a time, often posting through a nickname and well, today I decided to make a post because I am pissed with my mom and dad.
Basically, I'm tired of spending my summers babysitting for my parents instead of doing the things I want and well, let me just get into it.

**14 yrs**:My mom had my littlest brother, she was sick and in the hospital for days and my dad also had an accident that day, it was my last year of middle school, so I couldn't do any extracurriculars because my mom couldn't take me. I cried after my graduation because people won awards for being in ""yearbook club"" and I didn't get any. I spent the entire summer at home, watching my siblings and going back and forth between hospital stays.  But it was a crisis time and I understood.


-**16 yrs**- sophomore year of high school
I wanted to try to go off and apply for summer programs, but my grandma, who usually takes care of my siblings and I went back home ( to our home country), we're an immigrant family. Therefore, I spent that summer babysitting my siblings again. My parents and I agreed that it was better me than anyone my siblings never knew and I liked spending time with my siblings, devising games for them and stuff.


-**18 yrs**, home after college,I came home because my father promised to finally take me to visit ""our home country"". He ended up not going. Grandma just happened to leave this summer again and so I was home, crying my eyes out because I felt like I was wasting my life, cooking for my siblings and feeling stifled.

-**19 yrs**, Finally bucked my parents and got to do a summer program ( which helped my resume immensely). Had to argue with my dad so he would let me go, he said, ""My kids always come home for the summer"". I was angry that I even had to argue. I worked two internships to have housing and food and saved money in my account.


-**20 yrs**, told my parents I wouldn't be coming home and went for a research internship in California. My parents decided to travel abroad anyway, leaving my siblings in the care of some dude they knew from church. I was not in favour of this plan and told them furiously why, they ignored me. The guy then proceeded to do nothing, eat almost all the food in the house and left my siblings alone at random times without saying where he was going. My 15 year old brother stepped up to deal with this situation, cooking my siblings food and everything. By the second week, my brother was panicked because the house was running out of food and I was telling my brother to hoard food.  My parents returned just in the nick of time.

-**21 yrs**
I have been having a tough year, my mcats weren't high enough to get me into any decent medical schools,so I chose to take a gap year. I wanted to use my gap year to travel the world and go to different countries. My parents though this was a terrible idea and I would get killed. My father runs a small business and is overswamped with work, he needed  help and mom needed a break. I accepted because I felt family is important and well, I could do some good there. Problem is : it's not going to look good on my medical school application and that bothers me.

Now, I just got a summer internship  in NYC! It doesn't include housing, and the stipend is a bit less than 5,000 dollars for ten weeks so I'll have to take another job with it but I'm so excited! it will look good on my resume and add some patient contact element that I have been missing. I told my mom and she was not happy, she and dad want me to come home because she needs to take a course in June in NYC. My father stated, ""it will not be good if you are not at home"".

r/relationships I am so so so angry. I've already given summers and whatever to my family, my gap year and everything! My little brother is 16, why can't he take care of things for a month? (note: I have three younger siblings, 16, 13, 7)

However, I will point out this.**I have never had to work in college, my father pays for food textbooks and everything, including glasses and health insurance. So maybe I'm obligated? I will also point out that my family is solidly upper middle class.**


What do you think reddit? 
Are my parents wrong? Am I?
Should I drop my internship and go home? What do I do?

**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!
My parents want me to drop my summer internship and babysit for them as I have many times in the past, I want to say no. Who's right?"

2yxrmo,0,2015-03-13,Question about MVC architecture,recheej,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2yxrmo/question_about_mvc_architecture/,"Hello. I'm a graduating Comp. Sci major and I have a question about how I usually design my code. In past projects I've been a part of (have 1 internship), there's always been a database involved. When designing the code we've usually had a database class to handle all the database writing/reading. 

I wonder if this is the right way of doing things (according to MVC). Just to give you a clearer example, say we were storing information about cars in our database. We'd create a Car class. This would just have the properties of the car (model, year, color, etc). It wouldn't have any logic about going to the database and retrieving car information.

The database class is where the retrieval and storing of cars would happen. So in the database class we'd define a method called: getCars(). It would go to the database, retrieve the table information, store them into a Car object, and return the list of cars.

Again, is this the right way of doing MVC? Or would you want to put logic about getting/inserting cars into the Car object? Some clarification would be greatly appreciated."

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

2yy0o5,3,2015-03-13,"Me [25m], with my girlfriend [24f] and her parents [50s m+f]. How to move on after extreme response to living together + physical violence + disowning. 2+ months after the incident.",nocatholicmercy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2yy0o5/me_25m_with_my_girlfriend_24f_and_her_parents_50s/,"Please bear with me, as this is going to be a long one.  I don't talk much about personal issues, so I have a lot to say here.  
  
  
**I'm going to put a marker to where the action starts if you just want to cut to the chase.**
  
To begin, I'd like to give a little bit of background on my girlfriend, her parents, and myself.  For simplicity we'll be using the fake names Abby (girlfriend), Sara (gf mother), and Randy (gf father).
 
  
Abby and I have been together for over 3 years, and have never had any major issues.  We've been together through long-distance internships, a few fights, and battles with her depression.  We're of course very close to each other and we love each other very deeply.  Sara and Randy raised their children under a very strict catholic roof.  Catholicism to them is the final word, and they are very vengeful towards anything that goes against that.  Unfortunately, their faith has a way of becoming unbearable, and they sometimes steer into a dark and violent place.  Her family has been quoted saying that it was ok that Hitler killed people, as long as they were gay (this was said by a child in front of adults and people just laughed).  They watch fox news, think Buddhism is evil, the whole 9 yards of standard over-bearing and hateful religious extremism.
  
  
Abby was raised catholic, but worships with love and peace, and does not subscribe to the same ideals her parents have.  She has honestly come out of her childhood not corrupted, and has the most balance moral compass of anyone I have ever met.  I am without religion, but I am also a big supporter of peace and love, and though I have my flaws I do my best to give everyone a fair shot.  I take issue with bigotry and despise those who hate someone for something they cannot help (sexuality, race, etc).  Abby at first was a little strange about me lacking a religion, but has come to realize that it's possible to be a good person without it.  
  
  
This is all relevant because her family does not respect me or treat me like an adult for this fact.  I think they don't want to believe that their daughter is in a loving and serious relationship because they always pictures her with another catholic.  As such, they talk down to me, ignore that I have a professional life, and just generally treat us like children.  They've never expressed interest in meeting my family, and force me to sleep on the couch when I visit.  They seem to always take small jabs at me when they get a chance to, like offering me something small as a gift and then charging me for it.
  
  
Abby and I graduated, spent a few months figuring out what we were going to do, and moved to the city together.  I work as a software engineer and she is a professional designer.  We make well over our means and have a very stable household.  We're very lucky to be so well off, and I feel very fortunate.  
  
  
Abby had been irrationally scared to tell her parents we were moving in together.  When I say scared I mean REALLY scared.  She would break down in the car outside of the grocery store, or just out of nowhere as we fell asleep.  Abby has been battling depression for a little over a year, so I've learned to deal with her emotions and support her the best I can.  I had figured her depression was winning a few battles, and the blowout of telling her parents we had moved in together would never reach the potential she claimed.
  
  
--**--Action starts here--**--
  
  
Unfortunately, when we told them, their reaction went far and above anything Abby ever thought would happen.  Abby had finally worked up the courage to tell her parents, and with the help of her therapist wrote a letter to Randy explaining our situation, that we were living together, and that we were doing absolutely fine on our own.
  
  
We didn't hear anything all day, but the following day he responded that he was disgusted by us, and that as a punishment he would take away her car.  Sara and Randy gave Abby a car when she went to college, and we had been relying on her car for her work commute.  Eventually they showed up at our home to take her car away.  Abby was terrified and wanted me to meet them since she was an emotional wreck.  I agreed and went outside to meet them and hopefully talk them down on being so angry with their daughter.  Unfortunately the result was her mother Sara screaming at me, calling me a sinner, and as I walked away attempting to hit me several times.  They followed me to my door, and began pounding on it and rattling the door knob trying to get in.  
  
  
Abby came downstairs and cracked the door open with the little protective chain.  Her mother continued to scream obscenities about how we were both going to hell, how we had broken her heart into a million pieces, how I was a rat, my whole family was rats, and how we were going to end up like my parents (they were split up for a time) in hell together.  At this point I slammed the door in their face.  Through our mail slot they shoved a bill for all the gifts they had given us over the last couple years.  A real classy move.
   
  
It's been a little over two months since this happened.  The day of the incident we both blocked their numbers on our phones, and I blocked them on Facebook.  They have not made any attempts whatsoever to contact us since then.  We ended up getting a nice used car for Abby with our savings, and we weren't effected whatsoever financially.  It seems the bill they gave us was just them blowing smoke and trying to hurt us.  My family reacted amazingly and have been there for both of us since.  They have basically adopted Abby and done everything they could to make her feel like part of our family.  I have vowed to cut them out of my life completely, and have no interest in ever speaking with them again.  I admit I had a lot of pent up hatred for them due to their bigoted views, and their threats and insults to my family put me over that edge.
  
  
What I'm concerned about though is Abby's emotional health.  At first it was very hard, and eventually things have gone back to almost normal, but I can tell some nights it's just really killing her what her parents did.  Depression doesn't just go away, and she's still dealing with that day to day.  She'll tell me how she just doesn't understand how someone can treat their daughter like that, and frankly I agree with her.  But I'm just not sure that agreeing is enough, and I would love some advice on how to help, or maybe just a story from someone who went through something similar.
  
  
I love Abby immensely, and I just want to do whatever I can for her.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 3 years' parents had a religion fueled meltdown and disowned her, as well as attempting physical violence against me and attempted to bill us for gifts.  I need some advice or personal anecdotes on ways for me to help my girlfriend through this mess (2 months after the fact)."
2yy1ka,2,2015-03-13,"Summer Sublet 1 br in four br house, Sherman Circle NW Available May-July $600, w/off-street parking.",feck_less,DCforRent,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCforRent/comments/2yy1ka/summer_sublet_1_br_in_four_br_house_sherman/,"Probably jumping the gun on this one but I thought I'd start looking for someone here early before I begin slogging through pages of over-earnest libertarian interns on craigslist.

I'm currently finishing up my graduate program in DC and I'll be moving to Baltimore in early May. My roommates (3 men, 1 woman) will be staying until our lease is up and I'm hoping to find a tenant who can sublet my bedroom in the interim (may thru july). 

The room/house: A spacious row house in a gorgeous neighborhood in NW. FULL DISCLOSURE: the room in question has **no windows**. None, nada. Sorry. I've found this has been beneficial as it encourages me to hang out with my lovely roommates, spend more time either out of the house or downstairs, and spend less time wasting my life on Reddit. The room, then, is used for the two purposes bedrooms were designed for. But if you're the sort of person who for whatever reason needs a lot of daytime sunlight in private, this is definitely not the room for you. The house has central air conditioning, and the room has a fan, so you wouldn't suffocate in the summer.

The house is fully furnished, and the room will be semi-furnished, by which I mean that it will have some basic trappings (dresser, mattress, bookcase, bedside table and lamp), but it's nothing special, and not that pretty either. But it's fairly inexpensive for DC and I have some really lovely roommates: two grad students at Georgetown (25m and 26m respectively), a teacher (25f), and one man who works at an embassy (35m). They're all great people who are really fun to hang out with, cook with, drink beer with, go out with, etc. Our living room is usually full of lively conversation or studious book/laptop reading, but no one's going to be bothered if you're cooking, have friends over, put music on the stereo or whatever. It's a large house with three couches in the living room, and a fourth in the dining room, a big backyard with a barbecue, and a big basement if you want to work out/dance/start a band/befriend cockroaches/whatever. The point is, it's a great, mellow environment. It can be a cool place to be a studious recluse or a social butterfly. We keep it fairly clean, but we're not anal about it either. Plus, when one roommate's girlfriend visits you can rely on him to go full on house-cleaning mode for a day in advance.

There's a parking space in the back that you're welcome to use (I currently use it, and none of my roommates have cars), and a bus stop literally right outside the front door. A short (four-block) walk to Georgia ave, and a ten-minute walk to the Georgia ave metro/the safeway nearby. If you catch the 63 bus, which stops right outside our front door, you'll be at the metro in three minutes. To be perfectly honest, it can be a very convenient place to live depending on where you plan to commute. Though, my roommates and I all currently commute to Georgetown and have no problem. 

Obviously I would like to meet/screen any potential tenants in person or via skype as I don't want my replacement to be someone who won't get along with all of the lovely people who currently live there. We will absolutely not take gender/sexual orientation into consideration when screening, but for those women who are intimidated by the current disparate ratio of men to women, I know that our current female roommate would really love having another woman in the house, but we're all feminists and good people who are open to meeting and befriending anyone who's not racist/sexist/mean. 420 friendly, pet friendly (BUT you'll have to pay a pet deposit and sign a separate contract), and you're welcome to smoke cigarettes outside.


The price is $600 with some additional utilities that usually add up to $60-80/mo., to be payed to myself or one of my roommates via squarecash at the start of every month. If you were to move in later than the first of may, I can prorate your rent for that month. I would also have you sign a semi-formal contract, just so I can sleep at night knowing you're not going to screw me over.


If you're interested and would like more info (I'm sure there's something i neglected to mention here) or photos of the place, PM me and we can communicate via email or set up a skype meeting."
2yy2i8,1,2015-03-13,Job Search/Depression/Life Upgrade,GoBanana42,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2yy2i8/job_searchdepressionlife_upgrade/,"I have worked so freaking hard over the past two and a half years to make my life not suck, and I really am proud of myself about that. After having some major depressive episodes, realizing that my job was sucking the life out of me because I had outgrown it, and that I was living with two incredibly toxic roommates, I made a change. I packed up and moved to a new city to go to grad school (for a degree that really will help my career), got new doctors and new medication, and have focused on healthy relationships. It really wasn't easy and it wasn't all immediate. Especially with my depression. I hit many lows, but rock bottom was probably January 2014 when I was very close to killing myself. I thankfully was helped by family and doctors who care and am on new medication. Every day isn't perfect but I am in a much better place now. I'd even say I feel pretty great on some days. 

It was also very painful realizing that certain friends I had come to really value just didn't seem to value me as much and basically treated me pretty shitty. And since I was in a very mentally and emotionally vulnerable position, the disappointment felt amplified because I needed them to be there for me that much more. And they weren't. And I was totally open with them, too. I didn't just expect them to psychically know I needed more support. I told them how I was feeling, they would yes me to death and then just end up being a huge disappointment. I try not to be bitter about, or even think about them much. Just know better and move on. As for the toxic room mates, they are pretty much out of my life. I'm a little nervous because I'm planning on moving back to that city and run-ins are definitely possible. But I think I can get through that.

As for grad school, it was pretty good. I didn't care for that city, but it wasn't awful. But I loved getting back to school and delving into an industry I love. And I rocked that shit. 3.93 GPA, my professors loved me, my classmates respected me, and I got an awesome internship. I'm done with coursework now and just finished my thesis for the most part. Waiting on final approval from my advisor to pass it on to the program director, but I think it could really help me get attention in my industry. 

But what I REALLY need to get off my chest is the job search. I know, I know. Lots of people are in my situation. It sucks completely.  But I just don't understand how I've only been contacted for two positions. Back in August, I was asked to do a video interview (not face to face, just an automated, recorded one) that went nowhere. But I wasn't worried, I didn't love the position and it was early. Over the next seven months, NOTHING. Then out of the blue I get an interview with an HR recruiter for a good company and great job. I go on four interviews in all and totally crush them. They love me and tell me so, but I'm the first person who has made it past HR and they need to meet with more people. Ok, fine. 

I wait two weeks because I know one woman is away and can't meet with anyone the first week, and I want to give them ample time. I email HR to ask about the job status, and she never answers. I waited several days before getting concerned, but I'm left pretty confused and hurt. I emailed a friend who happens to work for that company and that brand but in a different department to ask what to do. She says their HR sucks, it's pretty messed up they aren't answering me, and to email one of the people I had met with directly to see what's up. But she also said head's up, we've got some major corporate restructuring going on so that could be effecting things (and sent me a news article about it). So I emailed the person who seemed most excited about me, saying how great it was to meet everyone and that I'd love to know if I'm still in consideration for the position because I'm still very interested. I also referenced the corporate issues and how that might effect the position, but that I just would like to get an idea of where I stand. That was on Monday, and I've still heard nothing.

I don't what to do. I don't if there is anything I CAN do. I guess my biggest hang up is that after so many months of not even getting a chance to prove myself, my big opportunity gets yanked away because an old white man might die in the near future (the corporate restructuring is suspected as being part of the majority shareholder's estate planning in case of a sale after his death). I know I'm in a super competitive industry where so much is who you know and name dropping. I've tried using friends/fellow alumni/past co-workers as referrals and contacts and they've mostly been very willing to help. I also have some big industry names on my resume. But that hasn't done shit. I'm not proud, either. I've applied to tons of internships, entry-level and admin jobs that I am very qualified for. I even had one friend who, after forwarding my info to HR about an internship, forwarded me HR's reply. It literally said, ""she's amazing. I'll see who wants her."" Did I hear anything back? Nothing.

The only thing I can think of doing is posting my thesis a few places for attention. Part of it was a survey that I shared with lots of professional networks on LinkedIn and I got tons of positive feedback, profile looks, and people interested in the results. I'm very hopeful it'll help me since it's a pretty hot topic. However, I can't do shit until my advisor approves everything and she is being incredibly slow. I don't want to annoy her because I know its not her top priority (she doesn't even officially teach at my school), but it is really slowing down my progress. 

And to top it all off, after learning that my student loan payments start in April my mother tells me I'm ""not trying hard enough"" to find a job. That really spun me for a loop. Even though I spent at least 12 hours a day for the last two months working on my thesis, searching for jobs, and networking (and she knows it), she thinks I'm not doing enough. (I had been doing all of this for several months before hand, but not for 12 hours a day). My mind exploded. I lost that entire day to a massive headache. My dad, who overheard her said, ""I'm sorry. She's crazy. I don't know what else to say."" When I confronted her that evening about it and how upset I was over it, first she denied saying it. Then she said she was just teasing. Well, I might for a second believe she has a fucked up sense of humor if I didn't already know that that is her standard defense when she knows she has said something horrible and inexcusable. She is probably the person I've depended on most for support and understanding and have completely confided in her. And for her to know everything I've gone through, everything I've done and still say that? To sum it up, I'm not quite over it.

I joined several networking groups but have found that people don't actually want to network. They just use them as way to get free food and drinks with their friends. I'm trying to only reach out to people to help me if I really think I have a shot at the job; I don't want them to feel like I'm abusing their position. And I personalize every cover letter and only apply to jobs that I can actually do.

Giving up isn't an option, I know. And besides that one day where my mom messed me up, I really haven't gotten in a depressive state over this. I'm proud of that. But I'm getting worried it'll come soon, especially now that I'm basically done with my thesis and don't have much to occupy myself with. Boredom has always been my enemy. I'm super crafty in general so I've been using that to take up time. I even made an Etsy store (*eyeroll* I know....) to sell patterns I've made, but its not enough. My store actually has a lot of positive feedback and people seem to like the kind of stuff I make, but it's not really proportionate to sales. (My stuff only costs $4 and they are digital downloads. Really not a big purchase risk, but people are still hesitant.) I know I am capable of so much, and if I was just given the chance to prove myself, I would. But no company is giving me the chance and I don't know what I'm doing wrong, if I am doing anything wrong. I'm still holding on to the idea that my thesis will help me, but I'm just so impatient with my advisor at the moment. 

I don't know. I just feel like I've put in so much work to get my life back on track, and dumb shit is getting in my way. I want to begin living as a productive and happy adult again, and its like I just can't. All because of things that are out of my control. I want my triumphant return to life and it feels like the universe wants to hold me back."

2yy6rg,3,2015-03-13,Your Typical Drug-Test Post,Piss_Throwaway_Acc,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2yy6rg/your_typical_drugtest_post/,"Hi r/Trees. I'm here to let you know of my experience thus far involving the dreaded pre-employment urinalysis drug test I have upcoming for my summer internship. Some information about myself:

My body weight is 160 lbs, I am 6'0'' and fairly muscular with a decent amount of body fat (""skinny fat"" I guess could be the term). I would consider my metabolism to be pretty fast, I can eat what I want when I want, and do so frequently. I am an active runner and decently fit. My mile time is approximately 6 and a half minutes, and I can run 5ks at a decent rate (shorter distances are my preferred races). I am 20 years old.

I had been smoking weed since I was 17, on and off. The earlier years I was either smoking once a week or not at all. (Summers would be off, school year once a week). I took a break freshman fall of college, but started smoking more frequently around freshman spring. Sophomore year I had been smoking much more regularly, and this year currently more than that. The past couple of months I have either smoked every weekend multiple times, with one or two bowls during the weekdays, or not at all (Holiday Break). I am by no means a daly chronic user, but it had become a habit. This is probably the most I've indulged in weed my whole life, given that I have had the time and availability to do so.

I began looking for job opportunities for the summer, and finally nailed one down about early February. In anticipation for the drug test, I toned it down but officially quit weed cold-turkey 2/16, making this my third, going on fourth week without smoking/vaping. My pre-employment drug test will be scheduled a week from today (3/20).

My experience: I sensibly bought a dozen or so THC panel drug tests off Amazon for self-testing. I started running and sweating a lot (approximately 40-50 minutes of Cardio with a Sauna session afterwards) for a week straight. I tested negative with a 'faint' negative line 2/25 with a somewhat diluted urine sample of mine. I decided to take samples from my first void of the day (the dirtiest from what I've heard). These tests before March yielded extremely faint negative lines, which I just took to be positives.

Over the past week I have been testing myself more frequently with my first voids and the negative line has been appearing darker and darker. I had also completely stopped exercising. Today a completely dehydrated-self pissed a faint (not the faintest I've seen though) negative line with a sample that was almost orange. A few hours later I pissed the darkest passing negative I had seen with sample that was distinguishably urine, as in not ""straight water"".

I know the general rule of thumb is ""30 Days and you are good"", but I can't help but remain skeptical, especially with urinalysis done in a lab setting. I wanted to detox my body the old fashion way. I wouldn't be ok with trying to substitute with synthetic urine, plus the break from weed was good for me!

My plan: I intend on giving my sample next week during the afternoon, hopefully with a sample that a hydrated-person would produce without arousing suspicion (if the sample is too diluted, the lab could deem it an automatic fail/positive). I don't plan on using B12 or Creatine to reproduce an unaltered sample, just enough water so it isn't all toxins and metabolites.

What are your thoughts? I know this was a very aggressive wall of text, but I figured some ents could use all the information they could get when wanting to learn as much as possible about other ents' experiences with these sorts of things.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, please comment if you can, I'll see y'all on the other side. : )

2yyar7,4,2015-03-13,Ever feel like two sides of your identity are at odds? [Rant about the gentrification of Seattle],RussetWolf,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/2yyar7/ever_feel_like_two_sides_of_your_identity_are_at/,"I know a lot of you are code monkeys/engineers/technical people, so I feel like this is a great place to talk about this. I'm sure the feeling applies to other groups of people too. 


I'm a computer scientist and a student and recently did an internship in Seattle. Being queer I housed myself on Capitol Hill (historically a working-class neighborhood which moved to an artist-centred and queer neighborhood). Due to the recent expansion of tech companies in the city, gentrification has become an issue and Cap Hill has become both expensive to live in and a more dangerous place as less tolerant people move in. 

Whenever I'm in a queer space or with artsy people, and the topic comes up (or I see an article on it), I feel like I'm being put into a box. Either I'm the queer person who belongs on the Hill and despises the influx of technical people contributing to the gentrification of the space, and my technical side (and the fact that that is literally the only reason I was in Seattle) is ignored or somehow doesn't count due to the queer side taking precedence. Or my queer side is completely ignored and I'm not the type of person certain people want to associate with since ""our values are misaligned"" (I was looking for housing and mentioned my *both*friend in an email, my majors [CS and business]and the reason I was in Seattle. The person assumed I'd typo'd *boy*friend and that I was just another programmer capitalist pig just from those few points).

I understand that the intersection of these two identities isn't a large enough group to generally merit specialized consideration in the gentrification debate, but I still feel like both types of people shut down part of my identity in these types of conversations, and that sucks. I'm proud to be queer. I'm proud to be a woman in tech. I understand that the culture of the city is being lost because of people like me coming in, and I dislike it.

Yes, there are plenty of technical people who are not interested in preserving the city's culture that are moving in, I have worked with them and seen them scoff at the public art exhibitions. I agree that it sucks. I just wish I didn't have to be either completely absolved of responsibility or completely blamed for it. 

/rant

tl;dr: I'm a technical person who lived in Seattle for work, therefore contributing to the gentrification of Cap Hill. I'm also queer and participating in the neighborhood's culture. Everyone involved in the debate puts me in one of the two boxes and ignores the other. 

What are your experiences on feeling torn between two identities/communities?"

2yyl3z,0,2015-03-13,Average wage for a developer with 1 year experience in SF?,csforeigner12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yyl3z/average_wage_for_a_developer_with_1_year/,"I just completed a year internship at a startup in SF and I've made myself valuable enough that the company want to sponsor me for a h1b. We're getting close to the stage where they have to offer me a contract to sign that we need to present as part of the visa application I believe. 

My current visa expires in about a month so I'll be working abroad from home for the next few months until (fingers crossed) I get the h1b and they're more than happy to let me do that.

The company has a great working environment and some really cool people work there - I really enjoy being there but I wasn't on particularly great wages at all for a software internship...some of the internship offers I've seen thrown around here are pretty crazy! I didn't mind though because I was mainly there to learn and I was getting enough to live relatively comfortably. However, the company has a bit of a reputation for 'low balling' offers and I'm a bit worried that they might try that on me based on a couple of things I've seen/heard around the office.

So my question is what would you expect the average wage for an engineer with a year's experience at this stage. I want to point out that I am very grateful to the company for taking a chance on me at the start and they're willing to pay for my h1b to get me back into the country as well as letting me work from home for the next ~6 months. So, while I am extremely grateful, I'm also wary of them trying to 'use that against me' when it comes to the contract offer and offer me something quite low.

My role is data/applications oriented and I'd be considered a pretty key member of the engineering team right now as I'm the only person working on my project and I've been doing it for a year now.

I'm not saying they **will** try to pull something but I what I want to get is an idea of my worth I guess. I'm not looking for a crazy salary but I'd like to get somewhere around the average for a junior dev in the city.

**TL;DR:** Coming up to the end of my internship, company sponsoring h1b...I want to know what the approximate average salary I should be looking for is for a dev with a year's experience in SF."

I'm an intern at Cartoon Network Studios for a year in 2010 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, but it did have some perks beyond education. 
Now, since I worked with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. But, there was a problem with the series 1 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.
 
Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We had recieved a copy of, ""The Power."" and gathered around the screen for us to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, with phony, weird titles such as ""The Green Blob."" instead of, ""Rigby's Body."" When Rigby ate too much junk food, and lost his body. 

Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""The Death of Rigby,"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke. 

Me and one of the interns did a small chuckle at it. 

The shot goes outside with Mordecai's house with Mordecai's friends. Benson says that they have a lot of work to do. Pops and Skips will clean the garage, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost will clean the attic, and Mordecai and Rigby will give Benson a Grilled Cheese Deluxe, since it's not even lunch yet. 

He told everyone to get to work. Mordecai said to Rigby, ""Let's go to Cheezers for a Grilled Cheese Deluxe."" Rigby said OK, then, they both went into the cart. 

The scene flipped to Mordecai and Rigby in line inside the Cheezer's resturaunt. 

Rigby said to the cashier that he will like a Grilled Cheese Deluxe. 

""One Grilled Cheese Deluxe, coming up,"" said the cashier. 

For about 1 minute, the cashier handed them the Grilled Cheese Deluxe that Rigby ordered. 

""Oh, yes!"" Rigby said, excitedly. 

They both went out of the resturaunt, and went into the cart. Mordecai said to Rigby, ""Want to do extreme cartin'?"" 

""Extreme cartin'!"" Rigby said to Mordecai. Then, they both do the ""Whoooooooa!"" catchphrase. 

The scene flipped to Mordecai and Rigby doing cool tricks with the cart. 

After this, they went to the house and started laughing. Sounds like they had a lot of fun, but this is when things began to seem off. 

They went upstairs to Benson's room, and opened Benson's door. 

Benson looked at them. The Grilled Cheese Deluxe bag was burned! Mordecai and Rigby handed Benson the bag, and he wanted to know what happend to his sandwich. 

Rigby said, ""This isn't a sandwich."" 

Benson told Rigby to go get another Grilled Cheese Deluxe. 

Rigby said, No, with a mean look on his face. 

Benson's mad face was zoomed in. Then, it zoomed out quickly. He then grabbed a hyper-realistic chainsaw out of nowhere. 

Rigby gasped when he looked up at the chainsaw, then the scene shot outside Mordecai;s window. 

Rigby started screaming, when the chainsaw pointed at Rigby. Hyper-realistic blood flew onto Mordecai's window. One intern right next to me, vomited on the floor. 

Benson told Rigby to go get another Grilled Cheese Deluxe, AGAIN. 

""No!"" Rigby replied, painfully. 

Benson said, ""I will tear you lint from lint!"" 

""That's-that's what I thought,"" Rigby replied. 

The scene went back inside the house, with blood covering all of the walls, and on the floor. ""Oh no, Rigby!"" Mordecai rushed to Rigby, and hugged him. ""Please don't be dead."" He then, started to cry when the scene cut to black. 

The scene shot to Mordecai, on the couch looking very lonely and sad. For about 14 seconds, he started to cry. 

He didn't want to play any videogames, or watch TV. He went upstairs to go brush his teeth and go to bed. 

The scene cut to black. 

--- 

The scene shots to Mordecai waking up from his bed. He walked downstairs, got out of the house, went into the house, and drove to a cemetery. It was raining there. Mordecai got out of the cart, and went into the cemetery. 

There were a lot of tombstones there. Mordecai went to the end of the cemetery, and stopped. All of his friends were there, staring at a tombstone. 

Mordecai walked by them. 

The scene shot to a tombstone that said, ""Rigby."" on it, written in red. The scene went to Mordecai, with a shock face with full of tears. Everybody walked back to the house, leaving Mordecai behind. 

Mordecai said, ""Rigby, I'll never see you again."" 

After this, he got down to his knees, crying violently. 

Then, the scene cut to the credits with a somber-like scary song, playing, ""Creepy Music Box."" 

After the credits were shown, it went to black. There was no sign of the Cartoon Network Studios logo, nor the Warner Bros, cartoon logo. That's just it. 

The intern right next to me was almost about to cry. 

Just then, the creator of the show, JG Quintel, went into the editing room, looking so furious. He wanted to know what was going on. One of the interns zoomed out of the room at this point, and left me behind. I watched the episode twice with JG Quintel. 

After we watched the episode twice, JG Quintel wanted to know who made it. Well, the only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. 

The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. 

All equipment involved was investigated for foregin software and hardware as well as glitches, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day, nobody does. 

If you guys recognize the episode, let me know.

2yz4z6,1,2015-03-13,What I learned from my Twitter interview where they declined to move forward.,focusandachieve,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yz4z6/what_i_learned_from_my_twitter_interview_where/,"So I applied for a QA Internship with Twitter, and had the interview today.

In the Boston region, there are a lot of tech companies, so I'm not worried about ultimately getting an offer. However, I learned Twitter in particular wants you to be fast. I assume that that was the reason they declined to move forward. 

During the coding part of the interview, she asked if there were optimizations to reduce the solution I had created from O(n^2 )? It took me ~10 min to figure out an optimization, and I stumbled around for a bit, but I ultimately found one closer to O(nlogn).

During that time where I was trying to come up with an optimization, the tone of the conversation changed. It changed from positive on her end to trying to speed this along. By about 5 mins before the scheduled end of the interview, she basically asked me to stop where I was, and asked if I had anymore questions, which was to be expected.

I went ahead and finished the project with the optimization we discussed after the phone call was over, but quickly received an e-mail saying that they didn't want to go forward. 

Sucks. You never actually know the reason I guess. Maybe it was something else that caused it, but it seems pretty clear to me that speed was the reason. Oh well."
2yz9wi,10,2015-03-13,I don't know what to do anymore.,TheWazz,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/2yz9wi/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Hey /r/exjw, I've been searching for someone whom I can share my story and struggles with and who understands what I'm going through for the longest time and happened to stumble across this subreddit. 

I'm 17 years old and still live with my parents who are pretty devoted jdub's. For the last couple of years I've slowly been becoming less and less spiritual as I was denied more and more things that made me happy on the basis that they are ""worldly"". This past year is when it finally hit me that I didn't want to be part of group that was completely against me being myself. I can't hang out with my friends from school, I can barely see my girlfriend outside of school because she's worldly, I can't even listen to certain kinds of music because they're ""bad influences"". Maybe it's just my parents who are this extreme, my aunt allows her daughters to do all of those things, and more, and her husband is an elder! 

I was forced to have two faces, the real me and the one I put on at home and at the kh to get my family and the congregation off my ass about my spirituality. But I can't handle it anymore. I'm tired of this religion, I'm tired of waiting to move out as soon as I can to get away, I'm tired of having it ruin my social life with my friends. I toughed it out through it all until it started affecting my relationship. I had finally met someone who's love and affection were unconditional, someone who accepted me for me and not for what they wanted me to be and I can't even have that completely. I used to excuses for my parents' reasons. Can't go somewhere without an adult/chaperone? Sure, her mom loves me and won't observe my every move so she'll take us places. Mom lives with her boyfriend so that makes her a bad influence? Kinda iffy, but I can see the reasoning. 

But I can't go with her family to the beach because I will be tempted to have sexual relations? WTF?!

I know it may all sound petty but it made me realize that everything about this religion and every one in it is crazy. I want to get out of this place, this situation, but I have no way of doing it and no one besides my girlfriend for support. I've become depressed, I can't think straight anymore, I can barely find happiness in the little things that I do have. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I need help but I can't see any way of getting it and I feel like I'm gonna be driven insane.

 I need your advice, reddit.

Edit: Thank you all for your replies, it really is uplifting to have someone to talk to about all of this. 

To answer some of your questions, no I'm not baptized, thankfully. I do plan on getting a job soon, I'll be applying at some stores and maybe start an internship to work towards my dream job. Until I'm financially able to support myself I'll have to endure this, like you guys said, but it gives me hope for a better future. I really appreciate you guys for the advice, thank you."

My question is, with having my major in Information Technology and having experience working with the federal government through temporary internships.  How much could I possibly be looking at making on the hour once I have graduated in jobs?? My main reason for asking is that I have looked around a little and seen some jobs that are offering $13 an hour which is definitely not what I was expecting to get after college.  So should I use these as a started job, or should I try and look around (possibly further out of state) for a better salary?"

2yzmjd,16,2015-03-14,2015 graduate with job offer - start date deferred by several months. What do do?,_throwaway_1111,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2yzmjd/2015_graduate_with_job_offer_start_date_deferred/,"I hope this is the appropriate subreddit, I'm a long time lurker but think this community could alleviate some concerns I have.

I'm an upcoming May 2015 college graduate that signed on with a company during my Fall'14 semester after interning with them over the summer. Everything's been dandy until today; I had a written offer that was signed and acknowledged back in 2014. I set my start date for mid-June at the beginning of 2015, but I got an email today from HR with a letter explaining that the start date would be deferred to mid-October. The reason given for this was ""a high level of change within the business organization."" I can sort of understand, there was a new and ambitious CEO appointed while I was interning. Still, this is a huge change from my original plans - I was going to just take a month off to spend time with my family after graduation and then start working.

I'm nervous because I have a mountain of school loan debt that I want to be paying off immediately. I'm also concerned with how a late start would affect the start of my career relative to my peers. I've talked to other upcoming grads that are in the same position as me (also hired by the same company and deferred) and we're planning on calling HR on Monday to learn more about what exactly is going on within the company and who made this decision. What kinds of questions should I be asking?

I don't want to be unemployed for like 5 months (and definitely don't want the deferred start date to turn into a rescinded offer)... it seems to me there are a few options:

1. Return home and find interim work there. My hometown is extremely boring and I'm not sure I could get more than a short term gig in retail/food service, so this is not really something I want to do. I would get to spend more time with my family, though.

2. I could also stay on my campus, since I currently work part-time as a lab tech. The pay isn't great, but it's been good enough to cover monthly expenses during college. However, I absolutely love my work and my supervisor. I told my supervisor a while back that I would be graduating and leaving for the new job, but nothing has occurred for my replacement, so I may be able to stick around and continue working there. My current housing lease is good until August (I'll have to pay the rent in any case), and I could probably stay with friends for the remainder of the time until starting with the new company. I like this option more than #1.

3. One of my friends suggested that I try to leverage my position and said that I need to look at other companies, but that seems a bit excessive to me... I don't have any other offers currently and haven't been actively looking because I wasn't expecting any of this.

I really like this company as a whole (starting salary is great and there is plenty of opportunity for advancement), but I'm not sure what to do in this situation. It really sucks... I feel that start date deferment is a pretty big deal to drop on a new graduate who is just trying to start their career. Any advice? Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: Upcoming college graduate, got a sweet job from summer internship, start date was deferred to October instead of June from I previously selected, need to start paying off loans ASAP, need to know what to ask HR and what to do in the interim (see options 1-3).

EDIT: Whoops, title should say ""What to do?"""

2z0374,0,2015-03-14,Part 3: Hae &amp; Adnan: Signs of an abusive relationship?,Adnans_cell,serialpodcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2z0374/part_3_hae_adnan_signs_of_an_abusive_relationship/,"In Part 1, we introduced the basics to recognize domestic abuse in a relationship:

https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2vyisi/hae_adnan_signs_of_an_abusive_relationship/

In Part 2, we highlighted some new evidence that had been released to support the initial post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2yd510/part_2_hae_adnan_signs_of_an_abusive_relationship/

In Part 3, we will look at the Power and Control Wheel and how it applies to Hae and Adnan.

&amp;nbsp;

**CONTROLLING**

Expects you to spend all your time with him, tells you how to dress, calls or pages you a lot to keep track of you, treats you like a servant, etc.

From Debbie

&gt; Hae was upset at Adnan because he was becoming very over protective of her and she felt like she wasn't free in the relationship and she called it off.

From Debbie

&gt; The control issue between the two of them and his possessiveness, his aggressiveness verbally, and him keeping tabs on her all the time, that really irked her and she felt like she wasn't free in the relationship.

From Aisha

&gt; he kinda just always generally annoyed me, because, just the constant paging her if she was out, um, and he’s like, “Well I just wanted to know where you were.” And it’s like, “I told you where I was gonna be.” Um, if she was at my house, and we were having a girls night, he would stop by, like he would walk over and try to come hang out, and its just like, “Have some space!” Um, and it’s one of those things, at first it’s like, “Oh! It’s so cute! Your boyfriend’s dropping by.” But then the tenth time, it’s like, “Really?”

&amp;nbsp;

**ISOLATION**

Not letting you go out with friends or see family, not being able to talk to others of the opposite sex, disapproving of all your friends, etc.

From Debbie

&gt; Adnan was very over protective of Hae. He never made her sustain from seeing her friends but he did suggest she spent more time with him. He wanted to know where she was going, when she was going, who was she with, almost like he was her father.

From Hae's Diary

&gt; The second thing is the possessiveness. Independence (indiscernible). I’m a very independent person. I rarely rely on my parents. Although I love him, it’s not like I need him. I know I’ll be just fine without him, and I need some time for myself and (indiscernible) other than him. How dare he get mad at me for planning to hang with Aisha?

&amp;nbsp;

**EMOTIONAL ABUSE**

Putting you down. Making you feel bad about yourself. Calling you names. Making you think your crazy. Playing mind games. Humiliating you. Making you feel guilty.

From Hae's Diary

&gt; The third thing is the mind play. I’m sure it’s out of jealousy. S#!t, I don’t get jealous. And I think whoever trying [sic] to get me jealous is a fool because you’ll definitely lose me. I prefer a straight relationship that don’t get people mixed in just [sic] he wanted to play mind games.

From Hae's Diary

&gt; He called me a devil a few times. I know he’s only joking but it’s somewhat true. I hate that. It’s like making me choose between me and his religion.

From Adnan's notes with Aisha

&gt; Yeah, [indiscernible] ask her ""are your breast tender?""

&gt; Her clumsy self probably tripped and fell on the way to the clinic and caused an abortion.

&gt; whenever you kiss a guy you probably think you're pregnant, she's scheduled for a sonogram and she's still in denial. Not that bad for me, for her hell yeah.

&amp;nbsp;

**INTIMIDATION**

Making you afraid by using looks, actions, and gestures.

From the school nurse

&gt; I had seen them together, and that was the reference I made where I saw Adnan approach Hae Lee outside the health suite, grab her and put his arm against the wall while he was leaning over talking to her.

From the French teacher

&gt; One morning Hae didn't come to class and she had to internship in the morning, first period. And she called on the telephone -- we have phones inside our school rooms. And Adnan happened to come up in the room and she was waiting for him to come. And when she called she said ""Pretend I'm a teacher."" And I said ""Okay."" And she said, ""Adnan and I got in a fight and I don't want him to know that I'm here. So I won't be coming to you, I'm in Ms. P.'s room if you need me, you come down and get me.""

&amp;nbsp;

**COERCION AND THREATS**

Making and/or carrying out threats to do something to hurt you. Threatening to leave you, commit suicide.

From Hae's note to Adnan

&gt; You know people break up ALL THE TIME! Your life is NOT going to end. You'll move on and I'll move on. But, apparently you don't respect me enough to accept my decision

From Adnan's notes with Aisha

&gt; I'm going to kill

&amp;nbsp;

**MINIMIZING, DENYING, AND BLAMING**

Making light of the abuse and not taking your concerns about it seriously, saying it didn’t happen, shifting responsibility for abusive behavior.

From Adnan during Serial

&gt; But no one could ever come with any type of proof or anecdote or anything to ever say that I was ever mad at her, that I was ever angry with her, that I ever threatened her.

From Adnan during Serial

&gt; I may have said it as a joke you know like man hey “I’m going to hell because I’m dating you,” or something, but I never meant it in the type of way that she took it.

From Adnan during Serial

&gt; I never-- I never really felt as if, you know, man you know Hae is ‘tearing me away from my religion.’

From Adnan during Serial

&gt; Maybe it just seems convenient for me to say that now but the only thing I can say now to kind of-- I won't say prove it in a way is that my behavior didn't change once I stopped smo-- you know once Hae broke up with me, or once you know we broke up or whatever.

From Adnan during Serial

&gt; Each time that we broke up or each time-- let me just say this, each time that she ended the relationship or took a break"

My main goals are to build/help build interesting things, work with smart motivated people and be able to do my work from anywhere with a strong internet connection, so moves in the future won't mean starting all over job-wise.

I have some friends who work at companies that embrace remote working, so I guess I have some contacts. Any advice on if starting out remote work is possible?"

While my boyfriend and I were both still in school, and even after he graduated and started working, we were able to spend at least half of the day together. Now with our new schedules over the last two months, we're lucky to fit in two hours.

We live together and all which makes this a lot easier, but whenever he gets home he's exhausted, and I'm exhausted, and we can barely talk. Usually I can wait until the weekend to get our ""us time"" fix, but this weekend he will be gone with some friends, and next weekend he's going away with his band to do some out of state shows. I really don't mind him taking the weekend to be with his guys, but I realized-even with weekend time together-how much of a toll that this sudden lack of time together in addition to communication issues is taking on our relationship.  

Once I graduate and begin working, our schedules will be the same way that they are now. I am so in love with him and couldn't imagine not being with him forever, but I honestly just keep getting annoyed that when we do see each other at night, he's exhausted and usually not in the best mood. When we do get to spend time on the weekends, he will spend usually half or one full day with me, and the rest with his band or his other friends that he can also barely see. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know if he feels the same way, and I'm truly afraid to ask him. 
   
tl;dr My boyfriend and my schedules have changed, which is impacting our time together, and our communication with each other."

I am good with computer hardware and a little with software in general but i love using/fixing/manage computers so i want to go that way.I started learning programming python and also getting ready to get my Comptia A+ certificate and after that i will go either for CCNA/MCSA or Network+/Security+.The way i think is that by getting those certs i might get a support/helpdesk job in my area so i can start from something relevant.I am not sure what i like most programming/networks/sysadmin yet but i will find out by working in the field of computers.

I know that those certs might not be as glamourous as it was some years before and that my degree is the strong card here but the ideal for me would be to combine those two.So what would suit me better an analyst/business analyst or a more technical IT related job?Could be also some other way getting into the computer field possibly?

2z0v1k,1,2015-03-14,I have anxiety over my boyfriends ex-girlfriend,the_emily_force,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2z0v1k/i_have_anxiety_over_my_boyfriends_exgirlfriend/,"Way back when they were still dating I knew them both but wouldn't consider them as close friends or anything. She seemed cool and we shared similar interests but we just never hit it off. 

Fast forwarding a few months to when they broke up. My boyfriend waited a decent amount of time before asking me out and I said yes not realizing that it would make my life hell for the next year. She went completely postal on both of us. Sending threats and spreading rumors about how I was a home wrecker and that I was a whore. It was just never ending.

Eventually I wound up moving out of state for an internship and though things settled for me (to the best of my knowledge), my boyfriend still continued to be harassed. 

None of it really seemed to hit me until I moved back to be with my boyfriend. When we began our relationship I felt a lot stronger; I wasn't struggling with my depression, I had just graduated college and knew what I wanted in life. When I moved back I just didn't, I felt defeated. Something about being in the same town with her put a strain on our relationship.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now, March 17 is our anniversary. I don't understand how I could possibly still have anxiety towards her after all this time. For the most part things have settled down. The only time I see her is when she comes into my work. But even then she ignores me. [I'm a cashier so she usually just waits until someone else can check her out or has her friends pay for her.] Every time I see her though my chest tightens and my throat feels like there's a huge lump in it. 

I feel like I've done nothing wrong so why do I have so much anxiety that I'm holding on to. 

[Note: I have depression but have never felt that I really had anxiety until this point in my life or maybe I've just been in denial about that.]"
2z0wor,1,2015-03-14,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2z0wor/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I'm in my last semester of college so I'm short on cash (working full time as an unpaid intern at a non-profit...fingers crossed they'll pay me soon!) so I'll most likely unload a couple at a time. I'm not so sure how this works so any advice is welcome :) 

Brands I'll be unloading:

*OPI (I'm only keeping my three favorites for my toes :) )

*Essie

*Ulta (These actually are surprisingly good, I'm just very good at chipping my nails)

*Sally Hanson

*China Glaze

*Revlon

*Maybelline

*Forever 21's Brand (same as the Ulta, not bad for the price! When I did designs on my nails I used these ones)

*A couple other random polishes.


Sorry if this is a long intro--I'm excited to get started! Ask me any questions you have! I know it's St. Paddy's day and everyone in my city has been out drinking for three hours already; I'm not a big fan of drinking/I feel sick today so I'm staying inside all day!!"

I really need a job for the summer, I've applied to numerous internships but haven't gotten interviews (I understand that my GPA of a 2.8 really isn't good enough yet, and juniors/seniors will get preference anyway) but I'm still hopeful I can just get a JOB (not an internship). The only problem is, I'm not sure of where to look. I currently have  lifeguarding/Rita's jobs for the summer as back up (worked there last year), however, I want to find something more related to my major (maybe something involving math/computers?). It doesn't have to be engineering per se, but something more along the lines of what I've learned in school so far. 
So the question is, what kind of jobs (that don't require a bachelor's degree) are a bit more related to my major that I would be eligible for? Are there even any? 

Thanks ahead of time!"

I am good with computer hardware and a little with software in general but i love using/fixing/manage computers so i want to go that way.I started learning programming python and also getting ready to get my Comptia A+ certificate and after that i will go either for CCNA/MCSA or Network+/Security+.The way i think is that by getting those certs i might get a support/helpdesk job in my area so i can start from something relevant.I am not sure what i like most programming/networks/sysadmin yet but i will find out by working in the field of computers.

I know that those certs might not be as glamourous as it was some years before and that my degree is the strong card here but the ideal for me would be to combine those two.So what would suit me better an analyst/business analyst or a more technical IT related job?Could be also some other way getting into the computer field possibly? I am looking for something in UK area since i moved here some days before. What would you recommend me based on my background following next on my career path?"
2z1ho1,6,2015-03-14,Pointers from my job hunt,bonny_peg_o_ramsey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2z1ho1/pointers_from_my_job_hunt/,"I finally received a job offer yesterday. /jobs has been a great source of information and inspiration to me through this exhausting process and I wanted to share some details/opinions about my search in case it helps someone else. First, the statistics:

•Number of resumes submitted: 208.
•Number of phone screens: 17 (8.1% success rate); Number of interviews: 14 (6.7% success rate).
•Elapsed time between submission of 1st resume and offer: 150 days.
•Elapsed time between submission of 1st resume and 1st interview: 37 days.
•Elapsed time between submitting successful resume to the place that made me the offer to the actual date of offer: 51 days.

My situation: Mid-career with lots of experience in finance. I made a career change to non-profit work in 2011 and as a result my network is primarily in finance, not non-profit work. To add to the difficulty of my search, I relocated in autumn after quitting my prior job. As a result I have few relevant contacts in my new state of residence. I lived off of my savings while I looked for work.

Because of my situation I primarily had to rely on sending in resumes and applications in response to ads on Idealist, Indeed, USA Jobs, LinkedIn, HERC, Craig’s List, etc. I did not have contacts in the organizations I was applying to. 

I have a decent resume highlighting a number of tangible accomplishments. However, most of my accomplishments are in finance due to my newness in non-profit work. My hope was that showing my accomplishments in finance would show non-profit organizations that I was generally competent even though I might not have as much specific experience as they would like.

My goal was to have an offer by mid-February (didn’t happen). I had decided to employ the “nuclear option” if I didn’t have an offer by February: pursue returning to my prior career area. I did end up reaching out to my finance network via LinkedIn asking for any finance leads in my state but happily my offer ended up being in non-profit work so I am still on my preferred career path.

My opinions based on my experiences:
•If you do what I did and quit without having another job lined up, make sure you have sufficient living funds. Calculate the amount you will need to cover your living expenses and double (or triple) it. My job search went on longer than I thought it would and to top it off I had some expenses I had not planned on (mainly expensive care repairs). I had the “nuclear option” so I wouldn’t go completely broke before finding a job.
•Some people advocate applying for jobs 8 hours per day but I did not find that possible. I aimed for 4-5 hours per day because after that I was usually completely drained. On some days I would find 10 or more relevant jobs to apply to in that 4-5 hours, but on other days there were only 2-3 worth applying for. I did a lot of weeding before deciding to apply for a specific job. I made sure my skills were applicable and relevant, and that I actually wanted to do the job in question. Then I would tailor the cover letter so it pointed out why I was qualified.
•Applying for jobs from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Day is very difficult. Few places seem to want to hire until the holidays are over and their new budgets go into force. In the 75 days from mid-October through December I had 4 interviews. In the following 75 days I had 10.
•USA Jobs and HERC were a waste of time for me. My lack of success with HERC is explainable because while I was qualified for the jobs I applied for, my job experience is not in an academic setting. USA Jobs was ridiculous. I was qualified for all 34 jobs I applied for but I received zero callbacks. Note that I am a white male and not a veteran, so that may have had something to do with it. My job offer came through a job I applied for on LinkedIn’s job board. I also applied through 5 temp agencies but only one of those provided any leads.
•The three facets of your job hunt need to be airtight: 1. Cover Letter/Resume 2. Phone Screen/Interview 3. References. You do not want a prospective employer to have any doubts about your ability to do the job and if any of these three are weak, you won’t get the job. Focus on fixing the weak link:
•If you are not getting phone screens you need to change your resume/cover letter. Do not be general (“I provided exceptional customer service”) but always give specific metrics whenever possible (“my customer satisfaction rating based on anonymous feedback was in excess of 85 %”). When I changed my cover letter and bullet pointed the top 4-5 requirements of the job I was applying for and how I met those requirements, my number of phone screens went up.
•The more phone screens/interviews you do, the more polished and confident you will be when presenting yourself. My first interview was absolutely terrible. I was nervous and rusty and not surprisingly I did not get an offer. At the end of my current job search I had a polished “spiel” that was focused and to the point. Interviewers could not fluster me. Try to practice with someone before the actual interview so you can tell your story effectively.
•Be absolutely certain your references will give you glowing reviews. Have a friend call them and pretend to be a hiring employer if possible to see what they will say. If a prior supervisor will only give a lukewarm recommendation, do not use them. Instead, use a prior co-worker who you got along with. You want a potential employer to think you are great after they speak to your references. While I can’t be certain, I believe I lost one job offer due to a so-so reference from a prior supervisor (who I removed after that and substituted with a co-worker). 

The hardest part for me was staying positive through this very slow and draining process. I had a high GPA, decent internships, many tangible work accomplishments, good references, and I still did not get offers. The whole ordeal ground me down. Some days the best I could do was to send out one or two resumes. To stay in balance I exercised, tried to get enough sleep, ate a balanced diet, etc. Even after 10+ unsuccessful interviews, I had to go into the next interviews with the attitude that the prior interviewers were wrong about me and I was qualified to be successful at the job in question. Each interview was a brand new experience and had I gone in beaten down I would not have been a good candidate. I faked it when I had to and was confident but not arrogant, tried to be pleasant and humorous, etc. 

I think everyone on /jobs knows that job hunting is tiring and oftentimes arbitrary. Hang in there, keep plugging away, and make necessary changes if any part of your application process is not getting the results it should be. Best wishes to everyone going through this awful process.

I never felt smart enough in school to try hard, I hated math, and writing, and never tried hard because I didn't think I could amount to anything. In high school I had little interest in going to college because I didn't think I could get into a good school, or succeed enough after graduating to justify and pay for the student loans. I didn't even bother to take the SATs. 

I've taken a few classes each semester at a community college, mostly to get a job and that's it. I work full time, but even then I can't afford more than one or two classes at a time. I haven't even thought about graduating because I still feel that it would be pointless. 

In the last year however I got into forensics, and discovered a passion for Latent Print Processing. I recently interviewed for a great position with a sherifs department, but I got rejected because I didn't have a degree or a date for graduation. I refused to get a student loan until I am 100% certain that I will get a job in that specific field I major in. Even then, I'd rather pay for school on my own, out of pocket. I hate loans. 

I really don't want to give up in this field, but financially I just can't afford to get a degree, even from a technical school. No matter how hard I try, I just can't justify taking out a loan for it. I've convinced myself that getting a degree is pointless unless I already have a foot in the door in the field that I will major in. However getting rejected from the internships has caused me to doubt the odds of getting another opportunity, so I am on the edge of giving up on that as well. 

I am completely self-reliant, even to a fault. I don't like asking for help, from my parents or anyone else. I am also not a very optimistic person. "

I used to be an amazing student (4.0 in high school, IB), a disciplined athlete (varsity track &amp; cross-country running), and I enjoyed a lot of hobbies (marching band, Eagle Scout, studying abroad).

I have tried to continue this legacy in college, which has initially worked, but because of some recent immediate successes (MVP for marching band, a sophomore internship, Dean's list for Engineering) I personally don't feel like trying anymore.

It has recently been starting to show; I earned mediocre grades last semester, losing my will to wake up an run like I used to, and have been putting little effort in my leadership roles.

I've explained this to my parents and loved ones, and I know that if I don't change now, It's going to be terrible for me later down the road. I feel as if before, I seemed to naturally be good at everything. I believe that I have used that sort of ""gift"" for too long, and now I need to put the effort. I know that I need to put the hours in. I know that I need to prioritize things. I have goals, but my natural instincts tell me that I'm some ""special case"" and then get demotivated and not work hard for the next achievement.

It makes me feel terrible and I feel like I can stop this rut, but I just don't know how I can bring myself back. I've told myself and have planned my days using multiple tools, but I feel like its too much effort and I go back to messing around and not doing anything productive. I want and need to reach my potential to reach my dreams, but I'm in a mental block and I want to use this natural ability to my advantage. I just don't know how.

**TL:DR: I have a natural ability to do well, but I can't bring myself to put the hours in to go further. What can I do to help break this mental block and reach my potential?**

Send this drafted letter to the Academy!,StannisGrindsTeeth,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/2z2fws/angry_about_recent_kraft_singles_endorsment_send/,"The following is from ""Dietitians For Professional Integrity"", an organization of dietitians fighting for reform in the AND. More about them here: http://www.integritydietitians.org/

After yesterday's developments, we encourage every single dietitian who disapproves of the Kids Eat Right logo appearing on packages of Kraft Singles to email their House of Delegates affiliate (email directory listing HOD affiliates by state and DPG is linked to at the bottom of this post) and other members of AND leadership.
Why HOD affiliates? At the upcoming HOD virtual meeting (May 2 and 3), one of the topics that will be discussed is corporate sponsorships.
Here is a sample letter we have drafted. Feel free to use it ""as is"" or as a starting point. Many thanks to RD Ashley Colpaart for her help in drafting this letter.

""Dear Academy Delegate,
Thank you for representing members at the upcoming House of Delegate meeting. This letter is in response to the core question due to be discussed on May 3:
""How do we evolve our existing sponsorship program to further the mission, vision and goals of the Academy while safeguarding the Academy's reputation and integrity?""
First, I want to express my strong disappointment in the Academy Foundation’s decision to put the first-ever Kid Eat Right seal on packages of Kraft Singles. Despite the Academy's insistence that this seal is not an endorsement or a seal of approval, both dietitians and the public perceive it as such.
I believe that the reason the House of Delegates is addressing Corporate Sponsorship at the spring meeting is precisely because many members feel our reputation is eroding in the eyes of the public and other health professionals as a result of partnerships with Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, and Kellogg's.
This latest development, while specific to the Academy Foundation, is another problematic conflict of interest that highlights the need to make serious reforms. This dependence on controversial corporate partnerships is compromising our ability to promote nutrition and is a betrayal to our hard earned credential.
I believe If we want to be regarded as THE nutrition experts, we need to raise the bar and remain independent from food industry influence. It is time for the Academy to honestly and deliberately address the concerns of dietitians, through real tangible action, not regurgitated old positions and supporting the status quo.
For years, the Academy has said it is listening to its members on this issue, but it is is hard to believe that when the Academy's actions continue to prove otherwise.
I urge the House of Delegates to take a stand once and for all on behalf of the profession we all love. It is time for the Academy leadership to push for a new paradigm of fundraising that does not compromise our professional image nor ask professionals to uncomfortably defend the Academy.
Sincerely,
(Name, Credentials)""

Super long, sorry.",svjeepgurl,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2z2qoz/c_section_birth_story_nontraumatic_super_long/,"Let me just say i was terrified. I see surgery all the time at the vet clinic, but I was still super nervous. I even had a panic attack the night before surgery. I went onto the hospital at 6am for my 8am surgery. I was taken into the prep/recovery room with my husband. I changed into a hospital robe, had some blood taken, and my iv placed. The anesthesiologist came in to get some history from me and to explain on detail what was going to happen during the anesthetic and surgery. He was as really nice, and super awesome through the whole procedure telling me everything that was going on. My OB was late because his car broke down, just my luck. So we were about an hour late getting into surgery. Our neighbour  is a NICU NP and she had made sure she was going to be in the OR to be the one who checked out the baby. It was very reassuring to have a friend in the room. I walked into the surgery room and cried as soon as I saw all the open surgery packs. The anesthesiologist had an intern he was teaching to put on the spinal block. The most painful part was them palpating my spine with just their fingers to find the right spot to put the needle. The were pushing very hard. I was crying onto the nurse who was hugging me to stay in position. She was so kind and supportive. They froze my back, and that was nothing compared to the IV which hurt way more. I didn't feel the spinal needle at all. Then my legs got really hot and heavy feeling, and I couldn't move them. They got me into position, and passed a urinary catheter. I was tested to see of I felt anything, then draped. My husband was brought in, and they made the first cut. Within 5 to 10 minutes the baby was coming out. The anesthesiologist was telling me everything that happened, ""there's a bum, now legs, two arms, and she's out!"". The OB showed the baby to me over the drape and she cried and fluid dripped on my face. And I was crying out of love, and relief. My neighbour  checked out the baby, who scored 9/9 and she tried to get hubby to cut the cord, but he was too squeamish and refused. They brought the baby to my husband and I just stared at her in wonder while I was sutured up. She was so perfect. I felt a little discomfort, but just focused on the baby. My blood pressure dropped at some  point and I felt nauseous, but I was given meds to combat that. I was also given morphine so I felt strange and groggy. Once I was done being sutured they let me hold the baby as I was wheeled into the recovery room. I had the baby latched within 15 minutes. I felt pretty awake, but weird. I was monitored for an hour or so. I can't really say how much time passed. My blood pressure kept dropping. I started feeling pain and they gave me oxycodone. Eventually I was wheeled into the hospital ward. The moving made me nauseous and I vomited soon after in front of my mom, MIL, and hubby. I vomited a few hours later again and was given iv gravol. This made me very sleepy and dopey. My parents and in laws were there right away. It was a bit overwhelming having so many people around, taking pictures. Thankfully they didn't stay long. The baby latched and suckled like a champ. I couldn't move my legs for hours, and I wasn't made to stand for about 16 hours. I had to drink tonnes of water so they would take out my u cath, and iv. It was a bit crazy not being able to move and having to care for a baby right away. My husband was a huge help, even though he was in a wheelchair because he had surgery on his foot a few weeks ago. He had to go get me water, change diapers and basically fetch everything I needed. He was amazing. The hospital was noisy and annoying. Sharing a room with 2 other couples with babies, plus their visitors, plus all the nurses and Drs looking in on moms and babies every 4 hours was exhausting. It was impossible to sleep. Plus one of the husbands was constantly on the phone, and he never lowered his voice. He was super rude. The nurses were all awesome, and very helpful. My hospital was very pro breastfeeding and the nurses helped everyone constantly with this. There is even a daily breastfeeding class for the new moms. All in all it was very surreal but I was always supported and comfortable."
2z2z9x,5,2015-03-14,What should I do this summer to beef up my resume if I cannot get an internship?,Pengdehm,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2z2z9x/what_should_i_do_this_summer_to_beef_up_my_resume/,"For the last few months I have been trying to find a finance/consulting related internship but have had trouble landing interviews (only got 3 interviews so far) let alone offers. At the moment I am starting to worry that I may not actually get any good internship offers for the summer so I'm freaking out a little. 

Here's a little bit about myself:

I'm currently a junior (3rd year) at college at a top 20 university in the United States and am pursuing a  double major in economics/history. My GPA is above 3.5 so its definitely not low and I'm not weak in the extra curriculars either. However, I am not an American Citizen and therefore cannot work in the United States without sponsorship which I assume obviously complicates things a little. I would, however, like to work and remain in the US in the future. 

1) Firstly, I just wanted to ask how crucial it is as a college student to have an internship in the summer between junior and senior year if they are trying to land a job after graduation? Will people still hire a candidate full-time after college if the person didn't really have any work experience the summer before?

2) What can I do instead to beef up my resume in case I actually cannot get any work offers for the summer? (e.g. any courses that you can recommend online) 

Also, could I prepare for level 1 of the CFA over the summer and then take the exam in December? Would that look good on my resume and be an effective use of my time?

2z34tn,23,2015-03-14,I just lost the only good thing in my life.,[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/2z34tn/i_just_lost_the_only_good_thing_in_my_life/,"Two years ago, right before summer, I met a girl at an engagement party for a mutual friend. I was instantly smitten. She went away for the summer for an internship and I spent the entire summer secretly pining for her. 

She came back in the fall and I asked her out on a date. Our first date was perfect. it ended up lasting about 9 hours. Then we met for brunch the next morning and spent the day together. It felt so natural and right, from the very beginning.

Then last spring she graduated, got a job and moved to another city. I was saving money to move there too, when I lost my job. I've been desperately searching for a new job, but the only thing I've been able to find was part-time work. I eventually had to move home, which wasn't ideal but it lowered my living expenses so much that it was the only option. Unfortunately, it also took me away from all of my friends. 

We talked about how distance would be hard, but it was doable. She was always incredibly supportive and helpful with my job search and it was finally turning around. I have some interviews next week I feel good about and some other promising leads. I was ready to get back on track saving, and I felt good about getting to move there relatively soon. 

Tonight, she called and dumped me.

Every part of my short-term and long-term plans involved her. Now I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I'm broke, jobless, living with my mom, (in this city, at least) completely friendless, and now single. I've never felt so lost, so alone, or like such a hopeless loser.

The worst part is that I can't call the one person I want to. The person I've talked to about everything in my life for the past year and a half.

I hate this. I don't know what to. And even if I did, I have no confidence in my ability to do it. "

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I'm really not sure which one would look better on my resume in the future, so I'm looking to you guys for advice. Without giving any specifics, here are a few details:

* Company A: A big, traditional business and financial news organization (think along the lines of NASDAQ, Bloomberg, etc.)
* Company B: A young, quickly growing, shopping-based startup (think like Jackthreads, etc.). 

I would have relatively free reign to work on a project of my choice at either position. I narrowed it down to these two thanks to my positive experience during my time in the environment and my interest in the work. I'm an undergrad, so which one do you guys think would look better on a resume in the future? I've had prior internships at startups, so I'm leaning towards Company A to diversify my experience - but I'm not 100% sure. Thanks (so, so much) in advance!"
2z398l,10,2015-03-14,constantly lonely,lowest_point,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2z398l/constantly_lonely/,"I’m a junior in college and things have gotten to a point where I’m pretty sure I’m depressed and constantly lonely.

I have basically no good friends here. I have some friends who I do homework with, hang out for a couple hours, etc, but we don’t really ever hang out for the sake of hanging out, because they have their own friend groups (I have no “friend group”). though when we do hang out and do work, I have fun, and can feel happy for a while. but we only meet like once or twice a week, so it's not really enough.

I volunteer/work at this place on campus. Everyone there is really nice and chill, but even so I still have social anxiety there. and there’s also this girl there that I like a lot. Unfortunately, anxiety makes me pretty much unable to initiate conversations with or even make eye contact with this girl. I’m awkward as fuck in groups of people when she’s around, and it just makes me feel like an incompetent loser. Originally I thought she was interested in me, and she lingers around me quite a bit, but it’s probably more out of pity or being friendly. And plus, if anything, my actions (barely looking at her, rarely initiating conversation) probably make it look like I don’t like her, when it’s the opposite.

I’m surprisingly ok with talking to her 1 on 1 though. Like we would walk from work to the bus stop for quite a while and can talk a lot. that’s one of the few moments anymore when I actually feel happy and not lonely, but then when she leaves I instantly feel lonely again, and then just depressed because of how hard I’m trying, knowing that it’s all pointless because I’m sure I won’t have courage to ask her out or anything before the semester is over (and she’s graduating early in 2 months, and is from a different country). Also I’m 21 and have never been on a date ever.

meanwhile I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I tried so hard to get a summer internship this summer, but completely failed, and fucked up several final round interviews from anxiety and awkwardness. so I’ll likely be spending the summer at home with parents, and I don’t really have any friends at home either (and last summer was horrible, I basically stayed home the entire summer playing videogames and being depressed). then I’ll come back to school next fall, with no friends, no job prospects, essentially nothing to look forward to.

It’s not even like I have no confidence or anything. I’m studying engineering, so I’m smart and hard working, but I’m also good at art and being creative. but what good are any of these traits if you’re constantly lonely with no friends, and awkward in social situations when trying to make friends? my major just feels like a chore lately (thankfully my GPA is still ok). and none of my hobbies even hold my interest anymore.

I guess a lot of this rant is off topic for an anxiety subreddit, but I really just feel like I’m at my lowest point right now, and anxiety is what caused all of this. And at this point, I don't even see how getting therapy or medications to mitigate social anxiety would even improve things. feels like the damage has already been done. :/"
2z3d2n,14,2015-03-15,Recent Graduate struggling to get Market Research Career off the ground; What am I missing? What can I do to become an irresistible job candidate?,CloudsTasteGeometric,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2z3d2n/recent_graduate_struggling_to_get_market_research/,"This board has be a fantastic source of help and advice to me in the past few months - I'm hoping you might be able to offer me some guidance again, I'm really struggling and beginning to lose hope.

Having graduated last December I've been job hunting for four months now. Its my understanding that Market Research roles often demand a very broad skill set; some people say you need a Marketing degree, others say Social Science, or Statistics, or CompSci, or Psychology - while in reality it seems like employers don't demand one or the other, but all of the above.
I've worked *very* hard to develop the skills, education, and experience to look them in the eye and say that I hit all of the boxes, but 4 months and over 100 applications later I figure I *have* to be missing something. Here's how I stand:

-Graduated with Social Science major, Business Marketing &amp; Philosophy minors, with concentrations in Psychology, Communications, &amp; Statistics.

-Worked throughout my entire college career (not as a professional analyst at a major firm, as employers seem to unrealistically expect of recent graduates, but security and data entry - I know how to ""work"")

-Interned at a nonprofit as a Research Analyst for 1 year (involved primary/secondary research, project planning &amp; presentation, Quant &amp; Qual methods, survey design, leadership, and more)

-Have extensive (for my age) research background in Social Psychology, a solid portfolio of work, have had work formally published before

-Have substantial experience working with research and business statistics (between internship, coursework, projects)

-Experienced in a wide variety of statistical analysis (Excel, SPSS, Minitab) and survey development (Qualtrics, Google Forms) software

-Since graduation have taught myself SAS and SQL, been writing a Blog, and have added work samples to my portfolio

I've been applying to positions in two major Marketing Research cities like crazy; crafting cover letters, making phone calls, and even ""nailing"" a few interviews (only to be later rejected). I realize I don't have those two years firm experience that demanded from fresh graduates, but I've worked hard to develop a full-proof skillset. Being able to offer statistics/data/syntax knowledge alongside a more developed, nuanced  understanding of psychology and social/consumer behavior - boasting qualitative *and* quantitiative strengths across the board, is something I've worked very hard for. I don't feel that I'm lacking in terms of the tools/software/methodology I am familiar with either.

I've been aggressively hunting and leveraging my network where I can, but I still can't find *anything* and face one rejection after another. What am I missing? There must be something that I don't offer, but I don't know what it is? In what ways are my skills/education/competencies lacking? What do I need to do to be a sufficiently skilled candidate?"

23M,23F, 4 years. Basically we are about to graduate from the same university,  and before, we talked about making a decision together about moving to new cities. he just told me yesterday that he accepted a job in NYC, without even asking to discuss it. 

I'm mad, because he went back on our promises to consult each other, and knows that I am less headstrong and ambitious than him and will probably follow him too. And its not like this was the only job he could ever get, there are plenty others he could have chosen. But I don't want to move there, it's expensive and cramped and the field I'm in is ridiculously competitive there,  and I have enough student loans already. I'll admit the city can be amazing in many ways, it just rubs me the wrong way that he jerked me around like this and knows he can get anyway with it. I care for him more and am a LOT more introverted, and it feels like he took advantage of this. 

On the  other hand, he's been trying to sell the idea of moving there really hard, sending me job and internship postings and I find myself relenting a little. He's even trying to get my parents and brother to convince me and now I feel less sure about my preferences.  And now I get confused whether I have valid reasons for not wanting to go or its because i want to sulk and get back at him in a childish way. 

Am I wrong to be resentful? What should i do? 
   
**tl;dr**: SO decided to move to new city without discussing it because he knows I'll end up following him

I wrote a comment below http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2z3dyw/my_so_23m_accepted_a_job_in_nyc_doesnt_care_that/cpfvqho 

Its pasted here :

Hey redditors, Everyone's given me great advice and i appreciate so many diverse opinions and points of view. I just want to clarify a few things because it may change what you think the best advice is:

* I'm okay with us choosing careers over relationships. The thing that made me upset was that we were supposed to come up with a list if possibilities together and then talk it over (whether ldr or not). The fact that he jumped the gun means he's forced to change my plans to now center on job hunting in nyc.

* I fully know that nyc can be awesome. I somewhat suspect that I had objections immediately because i was upset my boyfriend. If we had sat down to talk it would have been a much better outcome.
which is why i suspect I'm sulking more than being rational, and that i should change my plans accordingly. On the other hand.. Is this a bad precedent to set for our new lives together? He is the more decisive one of us but never on something as big as this.

* i would probably find a job there that pays, but I'd be doing a lot more intern grunt work, for a longer time, rather than being able to dk more exciting work in another city right away. Also I had slight preferences to save money and figure myself out completely rather than jumping the gun and making an expensive mistake.

* on the other hand, I'm not a person who loves working all the time. I'm passionate about my field, but I'm not ambitious like the elite students at my school. I'd be happy doing a job that i love without it being the most elite and competitive company, or something. Personal life, like having money and time to travel, friendships and relationships are important to me, and im - more - willing to give up a career opportunity if it meant staying with my boyfriend. I made him sound like an asshole in my post; but he's someone i truly love and trust. (although, a redditor mentioned that im too young to make sacrifices for a boyfriend.... &gt;&lt;)

From the advice everyone's given me, it seems like job hunting in nyc is a better idea, but only having a very serious talk with my SO.

2z3vb7,3,2015-03-15,[Rant] I turn 18 at the end of the month. I might not be an Eagle Scout. Everyone will hate me for it.,LetDownThrowawa,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2z3vb7/rant_i_turn_18_at_the_end_of_the_month_i_might/,"I haven't really enjoyed scouting since I was about 13, maybe the rank of Star, and was a really unstable middle-schooler. My troop was one of those power-troops that pushed kids through the ranks to be Eagles by 13 or 14 and everything we did was structured as such. All our outings were advancement-orianted and everyone followed this tried and true sequence to get everything accomplished and be ready to finish their eagle rank by their first year of high school. So there's really no reason I should be having this issue now, but I can never do anything like the normal kids and here I am, being *that* guy. 

Somehow when I was about thirteen I became totally burnt out and loathed every part of scouting. Every meeting was just a terrible experience and I got stuck doing all the troop's (and my scoutmaster's) dirty work, or at least in my mind. I threatened numerous times to walk out of meeting but my dad just kept me going week after week. It was just putting up with everyone's shit and being the underdog every Monday night. For some reason I also ended up being one of the few senior scouts at every campout, which were all the exact same every single year, down to the daily agenda. Somehow things improved though and I was going to go the the big district leadership camp but broke my foot just a few weeks before. So all my friends go to this important summer camp and come back to be all the senior patrol leaders and whatnot while I'm stuck at some now scout position and not allowed by my scoutmaster to be an SPL or anything senior (which I later found out is against national bylaws). At this point I got totally worn out and basically quit while all my finds went on to get their Eagles with no hassle going through the system just as they were meant to. 

Finally, within the past couple years I got involved in Venturing, the coed teen version of Boy Scouts, and actually started getting back towards my Eagle. At this point all but two of my good friends had gotten theirs and it seemed like as a 15/16 year old I'd find someway to get over my disdain for my troop in plenty of time. Finding an eagle project ended up being harder than it should have been and I didn't end up getting it done until the last week of this summer. But even then I didn't feel good about it. The project I got was way too hard to get scouts to do so I pulled some strings and got help form a construction company to do a project for a non-profit absolutely free. Normally people would feel great to have gotten that done but I felt, and still feel guilty, about it because mine was so radically different from the cut of the mill project. So even though I'm in my senior year and it seemed like something I could easily get done before my birthday this whole ordeal has gone to hell. For a long time the mention of getting this done was a trigger for instant anxiety and with school work getting harder and harder between AP classes and an internship I can never find time to get a lot of work on it. Progress has been slow to say the least and today I hit a brick wall, my anxiety went through the roof, like worse than last semester's finals week bad. Trying to finish up a merit badge I was notified that my troop doesn't have any record of me ever doing it. Even though I only had one requirement left! I've been on the cusp of three different anxiety attacks though the day and started typing this because I couldn't sleep. 

I'll keep trying to get this after I finish my calculus tomorrow but some of it is out of my hands now and there's a chance I could not get my Eagle in the end. My dad got super mad at me today and I haven't had it off my mind for a minute. He makes me feel like I'm a total failure and will get stuck living under a bridge or something if I'm not and Eagle Scout (he was never a scout if that counts for anything). I try to tell myself that's not true and that I'll be fine with the path that I'm on to make myself feel better but the fact that I'd be a total letdown puts me in a really bad mood and has kept me up all night. All the scout leaders do this too and tell me, ""I'll regret nothing more in my life,"" and just guilt trip me endlessly. I don't want to let my family, friends, and leaders down, but I have this aching feeling that I might not be able to get it in the end. I mean, you can be successful without being an Eagle Scout, right? I think even if I did get it I might just keep it a secret for all the grief it's brought me through the years. Besides, I'll have to lie about my religious views since I could technically get kicked out of Boy Scouts for them. 

Thanks for reading this rant if you did. I only posted it here because I trust this community but I kept it off my main account incase it could find a way to come back to bite me... I think now that I got it out of my mind and into text I can get to bed. I could use some support if anyone has some. Thanks a bunch. "

2z4fob,3,2015-03-15,Graduating Soon - Need Advice,redethmoid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2z4fob/graduating_soon_need_advice/,"I'm about to graduate with an Associate's in Medical Coding &amp; Billing.  Previously, I got an Associate's and Bachelor's in Mass Communication, but couldn't find a job in the difficult economy.  I re-trained in what I was told was a more promising career by my father who is a registered nurse.

I trusted his advice, worked hard and am set to receive my third college degree soon.  My parents helped me through school, and they would like me to land a job soon so I can become more self sufficient.

I've had the time to research the field and my prospects, and everything leads me to believe it is a very competitive field, demands experience and certification and is difficult for someone to break into.  My father believes I will find something in the medical billing/coding field before October (when I can take the certification test in ICD-10).

If what I've read about finding a job can be believed, I think it will be difficult, if not impossible to find something by this time.  If I don't find something by October, I don't know how I will explain this to my parents.  My father is an optimist and is sure I will find something.  I don't tell him what my odds are realistically, because I know he would think I'm simply being negative.

I don't want to be accused of not trying hard enough, or criticized.  I've also been told not to look for non-medical related jobs that might be easier for me to get, such as part-time work to put on my resume.  I've been unemployed for a couple of years.

With everything I feel like I'm up against, I don't know how to explain or break it to my parents that I may not be considered until I (hopefully) get certification in the billing field.  If I get a non-medical part time job to gain recent experience, show I'm employable, and possibly get some references, I will annoy my parents by not focusing on the exclusive health industry field.

My only other option is to take an unpaid internship (are there paid ones anymore?).  It's been too long since I've worked, and while I appreciate the value of an internship, I need to start making some income again.

I've read a lot about unemployment, the economy, the real unemployment rate and so forth.  Assuming its all true, and that it isn't part of some political or ideological bias/agenda, I'm less likely to be considered as a long time unemployed person than an ex-convict.

I guess that pretty much covers my scenario.  If anyone can offer me advice, or just show I'm not alone because they're in a similar situation, I would appreciate it.  "

Around three years ago I was almost 20 and met a 28 year old man on Grinder, I'm now 23, he's 31 and I'm on the verge of breaking down for the fifth time, or so. I need some advise, I don't know where else to go as all my friends have made sure I know how stupid I am for this.

**Prelude**:
As I was saying, we met on Grindr, but moved on to texts in a couple of days and kept on talking, he invited me to have dinner at a nice restaurant and after that he hinted me that he wanted to take me to his apartment, I said it was too soon and so we went on for the rest of the date wonderfully, I was swoon. We kept on going and after a while I agreed to have sex with him, it was wonderful, I felt so good... We finished, he left, never knew of him again. He ignored every text, every email, I was devastated thinking I had been so bad that he was just disgusted. I moved on.

Like six months later he texts me, begging for forgiveness and accepting he had been a huge jerk and saying how the sex that day had been fantastic and everything, I didn't think it through and a couple of hours later we were texting like before, I was happy.

Two months later I found out he actually had a partner of 7 years, they were living together, they had businesses together and two pets. When I found out I was devastated again, he brainwashed me into thinking that they were separated but still living together because none had somewhere to go and shitty excuses. I accepted it for a couple of weeks and then left him.

Around six months later we get in touch again and agree to just be friends (until three hours later when he proposed we be friends with benefits, which I agreed to), we lasted around two or three months and stopped talking for his lame lies and excuses again. I would invite him to my birthday or important college events and last minute he would come with some lame excuse. Every.single.time.

**Main Story**:
A year ago I contacted him over something I was working on, after that we exchanged ""how are you""s and then over some sort of catch up, he invited me to become an intern where he was the boss, I agreed. A couple of weeks later I was working with/for him, and after that, another couple of weeks later I was having sex with him. I told him about an ex boyfriend, he told me he would introduce me to someone and that was it, we kept on working together, going out for beers some times and go have sex some other times, all was good, he would treat me like no one ever has and everything nice.

With the time those outings started to become dates, he started to invite me to events from work with him, gatherings with the other employees and stuff, but I still had my insecurities about this man he was living with, and I would usually catch him Sexting with someone or on Grindr or on Hornet, I remained silent and hoped for the best. 

At some point there was an event out of the city that everyone at work was attending for a week and he took me, literally he paid for everything, and that's really when everything supposedly got serious. One of those days we were at a karaoke and I had the biggest meltdown, I was drunk and all my insecurities about him took ahold of me and I left the place in tears, walked to the hotel. locked myself in our room and cried oceans while he was out begging me to let him in. Like 30 minutes later I let him in, we were drunk, we cried, he told me he loved me, we talked  and went to bed. Everything after that was good until we came back home and I found stuff on his FB that confirmed he was still in a relationship with the man he lived with. I confronted him, he said no and ""convinced me"". Everything stayed relatively good but I was still suspicious.

Weeks later he tells me that the man he lives with has HIV, he (Mr. Fox) got tested and he was clean. Months later I got tested, I'm clean. 

Fast forward to my birthday, I throw a party at my house, invite my closest friends, he arrives and the whole time is texting with this man he lives with, prohibits me from tagging him on any pictures of that day and tells me that it's for the sanity of this man, apparently the HIV or something was causing him great instability. 
After that day everything went to hell, he was mad I was doubting him, I was mad he was being a jerk. Everything broke off by itself, we wouldn't talk at work anymore, not even hello, and when I tried to have a talk with him about us, he was always busy or tired and we never got to talk. I ended up leaving the company on September 2014. 

**The Story Today**:
I moved on, supposedly, I was dating other guys and happy with my life.
On January he called me to invite me to work full time for him, no strings attached. I initially agreed but things didn't align and I passed.

These past two weeks I started thinking about him, I have him on FB as a restricted friend to not know anything about him, so like 4 days ago I decided to check what was up with him... Hell opened, he is now apparently happy in a new relationship, tagging his new boyfriend in every photo and love post. My heart broke, I felt like throwing up. It threw me off. I felt worthless.

Yesterday, as I was buying a bus ticket, I turn around and there he is in line to buy a ticket, again I almost throw up, I ran like a rat the other direction literally shaking hoping he wouldn't see me, and hoping he would see me and come for me. Hopefully he didn't see me, I just took the bus I was supposed to take and left. 

I'm starting to lose control again, I'm feeling broken, like I was never worth it, I was always the one hidden from mostly everyone in his circle, we dated for months and he never even tried to make it official and now I find that he has gone full on public with this other guy after a month (I checked). 

I was so in control of my feelings three weeks ago, and all of a sudden I'm starting to break apart once again, blaming me for things and stuff, I can't afford to fall for this. I love the man and probably will always love him, but I need to let go and I don't know how to... 

I need to find a way out before I drown in this sudden misery. 😭😭😭😭😭


I don't know how to make a TL;DR out of this whole thing, I'm sorry, hope you understand.

2z4jab,3,2015-03-15,How to determine where your graduate interests lie?,dreamscapejanitor,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2z4jab/how_to_determine_where_your_graduate_interests_lie/,"Hey everybody,
I've been spending the last two months now researching and researching and researching ideas for graduate school, and I feel like I'm going in and out of rabbit holes with no kind of progress being made. I have been trying to follow the scheme laid out in the following link as to how to find the graduate program that best suits me:
http://www.nextscientist.com/choose-graduate-school-program/

Although the advice laid out in that link matches most closely with advice I have heard from professors and peers already in the graduate system, and I agree with its overall direction, I have one problem with it: I have no idea what I want to study. 

Having majored in biochemistry means that I have a tremendous number of options for which direction I could start going in. And because I sadly didn't get as much research done in undergraduate, I didn't get any individual, invigorating experience that could mold my interests for a particular field. Additionally, I got my Bachelor's in America, but moved back to my family in Europe and am having difficulty having my degree to be recognized enough for an internship or job. They don't really seem to offer post-bachelor classes here either, so I don't know how I can catch up on the few classes I need to better find a job (e.g. some math, some computer science). 

It has been incredibly difficult trying to move forward these last  few months.... I feel like for every one step forward I make, the circumstances push me two steps back. Can anybody recommend me a possible path to take? Although I am open to online classes, I'm unsure how many graduate programs would accept them as valid credits, and additionally, the lack of connection with professors and other staff might hinder my attempts to find new sources for references and/or connections. Although I would prefer to stay in Europe, I would be open to moving back to the states if my American Bachelor's degree only helps me get the classes or internships in America.

Thank you all so much for any advice."

I thought today would be more appropriate (text-posts only on Sun.):

Hi r/Trees. I'm here to let you know of my experience thus far involving the dreaded pre-employment urinalysis drug test I have upcoming for my summer internship. Some information about myself:


My body weight is 160 lbs, I am 6'0'' and fairly muscular with a decent amount of body fat (""skinny fat"" I guess could be the term). I would consider my metabolism to be pretty fast, I can eat what I want when I want, and do so frequently. I am an active runner and decently fit. My mile time is approximately 6 and a half minutes, and I can run 5ks at a decent rate (shorter distances are my preferred races). I am 20 years old.


I had been smoking weed since I was 17, on and off. The earlier years I was either smoking once a week or not at all. (Summers would be off, school year once a week). I took a break freshman fall of college, but started smoking more frequently around freshman spring. Sophomore year I had been smoking much more regularly, and this year currently more than that. The past couple of months I have either smoked every weekend multiple times, with one or two bowls during the weekdays, or not at all (Holiday Break). I am by no means a daly chronic user, but it had become a habit. This is probably the most I've indulged in weed my whole life, given that I have had the time and availability to do so.


I began looking for job opportunities for the summer, and finally nailed one down about early February. In anticipation for the drug test, I toned it down but officially quit weed cold-turkey 2/16, making this my third, going on fourth week without smoking/vaping. My pre-employment drug test will be scheduled a week from today (3/20).


My experience: I sensibly bought a dozen or so THC panel drug tests off Amazon for self-testing. I started running and sweating a lot (approximately 40-50 minutes of Cardio with a Sauna session afterwards) for a week straight. I tested negative with a 'faint' negative line 2/25 with a somewhat diluted urine sample of mine. I decided to take samples from my first void of the day (the dirtiest from what I've heard). These tests before March yielded extremely faint negative lines, which I just took to be positives.


Over the past week I have been testing myself more frequently with my first voids and the negative line has been appearing darker and darker. I had also completely stopped exercising. Today a completely dehydrated-self pissed a faint (not the faintest I've seen though) negative line with a sample that was almost orange. A few hours later I pissed the darkest passing negative I had seen with sample that was distinguishably urine, as in not ""straight water"".


I know the general rule of thumb is ""30 Days and you are good"", but I can't help but remain skeptical, especially with urinalysis done in a lab setting. I wanted to detox my body the old fashion way. I wouldn't be ok with trying to substitute with synthetic urine, plus the break from weed was good for me!


My plan: I intend on giving my sample next week during the afternoon, hopefully with a sample that a hydrated-person would produce without arousing suspicion (if the sample is too diluted, the lab could deem it an automatic fail/positive). I don't plan on using B12 or Creatine to reproduce an unaltered sample, just enough water so it isn't all toxins and metabolites.


What are your thoughts? I know this was a very aggressive wall of text, but I figured some ents could use all the information they could get when wanting to learn as much as possible about other ents' experiences with these sorts of things. My worries are 1) If I will pass 2) If the cutoff levels for the labs are much lower than the at-home tests I have been passing 3) If I trigger a 'confirmation' test.


Thanks for taking the time to read this, please comment if you can, I'll see y'all on the other side. : )"
2z4xqc,2,2015-03-15,Input on the viability of my current programming skills in today's job market.,nutramoil,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2z4xqc/input_on_the_viability_of_my_current_programming/,"I am getting to the point in my career where I am very interested in changing employers because my current employer and very specific line of work is leaving me very unfulfilled.  I am wondering of the viability of my current skills and obvious weaknesses that can help my marketability in the work force.  Any and all input, positive or negative is welcome.

**Short version:**

I do not have much professional programming experience in modern languages but I do have 7+ years of professional engineering experience using a proprietary language.  Is it reasonable to hope that the experience I have can translate into a job that does utilize modern languages?

**Long version:**

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2008.  Got a job with my current employer as an intern my last semester of school.  I transferred departments in 2009.  I have been in my current department since that time starting out in a Tier 1 paygrade, and basically being a code monkey.  I have since received two promotions and am now a Tier 3, which is classified as a Lead.  

We work in the process automation industry.  We use a 20+ year old proprietary programming language.  I write the programs that control manufacturing processes using a DCS, not PLC’s.  Best I can describe our language is it can be similar to Fortran and Basic.  There are GOTO’s and GOSUB’s.  The variable types we use are 16 bit integers, float points, flags, built in timers, and pointers.  We do not have any built in data structures but we do have ways or imitating things like an array or even an object to some degree.  We have standard control with things like IF statements and For loops.  There are many other things in our language that work closely with our DCS.  Over the years we have standardized the way we do things to include abstractions along the lines of Object Oriented, but not objects exactly.

I have experience with other languages such as Python, Java, C++, C#, and a few others.  I personally have found that, in general, if you understand the logic and how to program, that picking up the syntax and tools of most other languages is not overly complicated, but some time is obviously needed.

I have extensive experience in the complete software development cycle.  In that, we are involved in meetings with customers and other involved parties to gather requirements, initial documentation and reviews, programming, testing, customer acceptance testing, installation, startup support, and final “as built” documentation.

I also have extensive experience leading projects, typically on the smaller 1-2 person size.  We work very closely with the customers during the entire life of a project.  Our interactions with customers includes, but not limited to, design meetings with process engineers, regular meetings to address any issues, training of on site personnel including process operators.  It is typical for us to run on site meetings and training sessions for a wide range of people, operators, plant engineers, corporate engineers, etc.

Lastly, I am pushing 40 years old.  I know this should not matter, but I am also not naive and realize companies may go with youth over someone my age if they can low ball a younger person.  I am not looking to break the bank in my salary and given the right situation, I would be willing to accept a bit less than I make now.


Thank you again for taking the time and I appreciate any feedback.

2z4xqy,2,2015-03-15,"A long story, but I need some guidance.",limacharles,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2z4xqy/a_long_story_but_i_need_some_guidance/,"This will be a bit long winded, perhaps, but I'd like to give a full frame of context to the situation before I get advice on it.  

I am a 26 year old male.  When I was 17, I enlisted in the Marine Corps, and remained there for 7 years working in various positions related to system administration for intelligence personnel and executives.  My last duty station had me flying around the world constantly working for the top exec's in the military (think General Petraeus), and was generally a high-adrenaline job with lots of perks balanced with a ridiculous tempo and level of responsibility/anxiety.  

Also, at 18, I proposed to my now wife.  We maintained a long-distance relationship for about 6 years before we were finally married in 2012.  I have always considered her a soulmate, and while things are kind of tough right now (that in a moment), I love her.  A year later we had our daughter, she is now 2.5.  She is wonderful, high-energy, very smart, and makes life better.  However, any parent can understand what having a 2.5 year old is like.

So there's the familial situation.  But, the crux of my problem arises here.

In 2008, before I left for Iraq for a year.  I bought a basic DSLR camera.  That day subsequently changed my life.  I became an avid, talented, and passionate photographer.  By 2011, I had plans to attend a university well known for its photojournalism program.  I was fully invested in this...to say it was a passion would be understating it.  Nothing has given me 'life' the way that this sort of photography did, the capturing of people in these candid struggles or moments of joy.  If you know much about the scene, photojournalism is imploding.  Sports Illustrated just let all of its staff photographers go not too long ago.  For that reason, the fact that I was coming off years of intense weekly travel overseas, and the family which I felt would be relying on me to provide us with income, I gave up my dream.  To some of you, this will sound silly.  Many people have creative passions and need to sacrifice them.  I'm sure many of you have probably gone through the same thing, and maybe it's your advice I'm truly looking for.  The matter of the fact is, 3 years ago, when I made that decision, it severed my soul and nothing has really fixed that since, not even my kiddo.  

I attended a different university, and pursued a degree in Computer Information Systems.  I was excited, because I saw a few facts about the school which made it more competitive in this area.  That said, it wasn't what I really wanted to do or at least I realize that now.  I had to make a decision on what to do for school quickly, because I only had about 4 months remaining before I separated from the military.  I had a really good career in the Marines, won some shit, was well respected, got job offers on the way out, etc.  Now I'm stuck in what turned out to be a really shitty CIS program at a school which doesn't have much else to offer me.  Now that I'm 3 semesters left before graduation, not much I can do about that.  I rely on the GI Bill for both part of my mortgage and my education.

I've been dealing with depression for about a year now.  Just over the last two months I've been going to therapy on campus.  The therapist seems pretty good, but it's my first experience.  Basically I feel like I have nothing in my life to live for other than my wife and child.  I want to escape my situation.  Part of the reason I'm there: both parents are alcoholics, absentees and just narcissistic needy people.  I've had a highly dysfunctional situation with them since about 17.  My father has recovered, but mom is still fucked up.  At Christmas, I got in her face about it when an opportunity presented itself.  I don't ever get really angry at people, but if you've seen August: Osage County, it was like that scene when Julia Roberts takes Meryl Streep's pills.  I reasoned with her as long as I could until the delusion made me see red; I slammed my fist on the table so hard I thought I broke something.  It's the second time we've confronted her about it.  She just left and said she'd call me when she had seen someone.  Of course, she never saw anyone and tells me that the conversation we had was enough to fix her.  I don't believe this at all.  The therapist said it was her way of pinning the problem on me.  My mother is a master manipulator, and the only reason I see through her bullshit is that many times in life I feel I'm the same way.  These flashes of anger, and the inability to walk through my problems logically, along with many other catalysts, are what finally drove me to therapy.

I'm now faced with this situation.  It's hard to describe without all of this language above.  I've internalized all these problems for so long and am just now speaking about them with my wife and someone else.  I feel like I've been on a journey to nothing for the last 7 years.  Seeing my military career in retrospect, while I acknowledge some of its benefits, I doubt that I did anything to make the world a better place...it feels like a waste of time.  Now I've invested 2 more years in another waste of time...the college experience is wonderful, but the program I chose ruins it weekly.  I have an internship with a good company, and this year the internship is something new: program management.  I did really well last year, and they offered me anything I wanted.  I chose this because it gets me away from IT, and it lets me help people with something not computer-related.  I'm considering being a teacher, but that field, too, is imploding in America.

I feel like I'm on a journey to nothing fulfilling in my own life.  Saying this still makes me feel selfish, but part of what therapy has taught me is that all of my ""shoulds"" and ""that's selfish"" have gotten me to where I am now...feeling lifeless.  So, I don't know what I'm asking for, in the end.  I'm hoping that someone out there, someone older, wiser, and with a reasonable head on their shoulders can help me digest this shit.  I realize that my situation is unique, but in some ways typical, at the same time.  I also acknowledge that I am very fortunate to have options in my life for my career, and that there are many people worse off that I am.  Truly, what I'd like to do is help those people who are worse off.  That's why I was drawn to photojournalism's mission, and that's part of why I'm drawn to teaching.  I just don't know.  

I know that's an eternal post, but I don't really have a TL;DR.  I'm just drifting and I'm afraid of where I'll end up.

Thanks.

Once upon a time, Sarahlita j’Zart had truly believed that she knew everything there was to know about law and lawyers - after all, she had worked for a handspan of years in one of the busiest law firms on her planet that dealt regularly with multiple hands of species and cultures all the time. She loved her job and the chances that it gave her to work on contracts and licensing that helped to smooth over the various bumps and detours that would otherwise get in the way of so many species interacting with each other. But to tell the truth, she had become somewhat bored with the day-in and day-out regularity of it and so, when her friends had told her of a months-long sightseeing space cruise that they were booked on and how much fun it would be, she allowed herself to be dragged along with only a token resistance.

And then the accident happened, along with it the rescue resulting in all of the passengers being stranded untold light-years from their home, and Sarahlita j’Zart was exposed to Human law and swiftly realized that she knew absolutely *nothing* at all about what lawyers really did and how wonderfully complex the law could truly be.

Humans had laws for *everything* - laws governing not just trade, but for what the very *concept* of trade could be, covering everything from a tangible widget that went *meep* to the very idea of a thing that didn’t even exist yet. Laws that stipulated how often something could be used, how it could be used, and what would happen if you tried to use it outside of the limits that the contract defined. Rules that helped enforce how money was exchanged between multiple parties and who was entitled to what in case certain conditions were met or not. The Humans even had laws and rules that dictated how families and their assets should be split up should they decide that they no longer could be a cohesive unit, the basic concept of which Sarahlita still could not understand.

Another amazing feature of Human Law was if someone didn’t like how a law was designed or being enforced or just thought it was unfair for some reason, they could actually do something about it and invoke a special action called an *appeal* where an elevated group of lawyers would listen to the reasons brought forth and then might agree to actually *change the law* - there were even laws that specified how *that* could occur. The concept that laws could have laws layered upon each other like thin slices of *pactur* stacked up and waiting to be drizzled with *kilapa* before being consumed was so completely unheard of to Sarahlita that when she finally understood the idea, the implications were nothing short of a religious awakening to the Dulutewae woman.

When the local government had announced that the Department Of Alien Affairs had been formed in order to help with job placement for the dispossessed alien passengers, Sarahlita wasted no time in filling out the required forms and turning them in, much to the confusion of the DOAA clerk who had only been on the job for two days and wasn’t sure what to do with it. Eventually someone figured out what the new government office was supposed to be doing and Sarahlita’s paperwork started to be moved around, finally landing on the desk of someone who knew someone else that *might* just know a good place to put an alien humanoid that fancied herself a lawyer.

---

Marty Mosely looked up at the soft tapping on the open door of her office, the noise being generated by Sarahlita j’Zart, one of the interns. The Dulutewae female was holding a stack of papers and some law books in her arms, and said, “I’m sorry to bother you Marty, but I had some questions about the Robertson case.”

Marty set aside the brief she was reading waved her in. When the DOAA had told her that one of the aliens was interested in learning more about how human law worked and if Marty would consider taking one on as an intern, she had been intrigued, but skeptical, as were the rest of the partners in the firm when she shared the request with them. But to their surprise Sarahlita had quickly shown that her interest wasn’t just some passing fancy and that she had a real passion for learning everything that she could about “Human Law” as she called it. Whenever Sarahlita wasn’t performing whatever duties were asked of her she could be found in the firm’s law library, reading book after book until the office closed up for the night and he was told to go home to get some rest - otherwise she would gladly sleep at the office with a law book as a pillow, often with paperwork from a previous case stacked neatly next to her.

 The alien’s linguistic abilities had also turned out to be an unexpected asset, especially when it came to dealing with cases that had some international component, having already proven to be a key factor in correcting two of them that would have otherwise resulted in serious legal issues down the road for their clients due to translation errors that managed to creep in. Marty knew that during the next office leadership meeting they were going to offer the Dulutewae woman a chance to go to law school on their dime just to have first crack at her when she graduated, certain that she would be at the top of her class and that having her on board full-time would put the firm at the forefront of international business and contract law.

“What do you have, Sarahlita?” Marty asked, clearing a spot on her desk and indicating an empty chair as the female alien stepped over, her footsteps making an unusual noise for a Dulutewae as she did so. Marty looked around her desk to see what was causing it and exclaimed, “are you wearing *shoes*?”

Sarahlita paused in her movement towards Marty’s desk and replied, “yes, they came in today. Aren’t they fantastic? It took me months to find someone who still made shoes by hand instead of being mass-produced in a factory and was willing try to make a custom pair for me. I thought it would be more professional if I had them. I’m still getting used to them, of course.” Suddenly her face shifted and her ears drooped. “Is that ok? Did I do something wrong? You’re not upset with me, are you?” Marty had spent enough time around the woman to realize that Sarahlita seemed concerned that she had offended the human somehow.

Marty considered her words carefully, before replying, “no, not at all. But nobody wants you to be uncomfortable. It just seems like you’re trying to be something you’re not, first with your clothing -” referring to the tailored business wear that Sarahlita was wearing that would not have been out of place on a human woman instead of the smock-like garment the aliens preferred “- and your earrings.” The latter was apparently a big fashion trend among the Dulutewae, as were smartwatches, which the aliens preferred over a traditional phone, using them much in the same manner as the old Dick Tracy comic books did. “And now your shoes.”

Seeing that Sarahlita seemed to be getting upset, Marty hurriedly continued, “and they are very nice by the way. But what I mean is that I hope you don’t think or feel that we expect you to wear Human clothing or do things that make you uncomfortable physically or otherwise, just because you work here.” If she did feel that way, Marty was going to have some very strong words with the rest of her office staff and remind them of the diversity clause in the office rules. The last thing they needed was some sort of intergalactic discrimination lawsuit.

Sarahlita clenched her hands in front of her, the oddly jointless fingers writhing together like a dozen tiny snakes as she blurted out in a rush, “I know that and everyone is so wonderful and I have never felt more like I belonged somewhere than here working with you and everyone else on law that is so complex and fascinating and interesting it’s just that...” Sarahlita trailed off, appearing to run out of steam and unable to articulate what she wanted to say, until she suddenly rattled off what was obviously as phrase in her native tongue that Marty didn’t understand but waited patiently for the alien to continue.

Eventually she did, and Marty got the whole story, which was quite the eye-opener to her.

---

“...so it turns out Sarahlita basically has supplanted the firm as her family-herd unit and has apparently identified with us - as a group - so much that she feels like she needs to emulate our mode of dress and behaviour patterns. I’m worried about her and what she thinks the next step might be to her becoming more ‘human’.” Marty was curled up in the loveseat with Amanda, the two of them looking out the window at the lights of the capital through the large picture window in their living room. Amanda made a *hmm* noise in her throat, which pleasantly vibrated the back of Marty’s head where it was positioned under the taller woman’s chin.

“Both Samuel and Elsa had mentioned how Ruxzcon seemed to get a little gung-ho about ‘being human’ for a while, but it seemed to be short-lived. I’ll ask around, but maybe the simplest solution is just to put her back with her own people.”

Marty shook her head, which had the unpleasant effect of making her hair tickle Amanda’s nose, who had to suppress a sneeze before something ugly and disgusting happened to the top of Marty’s head. “No, I don’t want to do that - it would seem like we’re rejecting her. I just want her to be *herself*, not some alien caricature of what she perceives a human to be based on where she works.”

Amanda shrugged. “So show her what humans are really like, not just a bunch of lawyer bookworms in fancy suits. Ouch.” Marty had poked her rather hard in the leg. “Take her out on the town for a day or three. It’s DC, there’s always something happening, all sorts of cultural events and other entertainment going on somewhere. Flag it through the DOAA and they might even reimburse you in a few years.” Amanda was referring to the new agency's excellent ability at being yet another layer of government bureaucracy: quick to make demands but slow to return the favor.

“That’s a better idea than any I’ve been able to think of. I’ll see what’s available and let the rest of the office know what I’m doing.” Sighing, she squirmed and twisted around until she was looking directly Amanda, and gave her a quick kiss on her nose. “And now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to go upstairs and wait for my very smart spouse to join me before she has to jet off somewhere exotic yet again.”

“Hur är det? How are you?”

“Hurr are deet?” CB repeated. “Hur ar det? Hur ar det?”

“Jag är väl. I am well,” the Swedish language program promoted CB after he tapped the keyboard for the next phrase in the series.

“Jag are vell. Jag ar vell. I guess that’s right.” Tapping the next one, he muttered, “probably sound like a goddamn idiot. Glad nobody’s around to hear me make a fool of m’self.”

“Vill du ha lite-” the program started just an emergency tone sounded that caused CB to grab his headset and jam it on, fumbling for the command that would terminate the teaching program that was still trying to give him instructions in Swedish.

“*Prairie Dog*, *Prairie Dog*, this is a tower control. *Prairie Dog*, please respond immediately,” the demand blared over the speakers and the headset at the same time, making CB’s ears ring.

“Tower, this is *Prarie Dog*. I hears ya, what’s all the fuss about?” CB replied, dialing down the volume a bit before he got permanent hearing loss.

“*Prairie Dog*, STEREO has detected a large CME at 15:30 zulu that will cross your trajectory in 41 hours unless corrective action is taken.” Tower control was referring to Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, a pair of satellites whose primary job was to study the Sun and provide early warning of any Coronal Mass Ejections, eruptions of stellar matter that flung high energy particles towards Earth and typically did nothing more than provide viewers with a pretty Aurora Borealis light show when they impacted the Earth’s protective magnetic field.

However, larger CME events could cause disruptions in the terrestrial power grid and communication systems and, for any space craft that were *not* within the confines of Earth’s magnetic field, serious damage to any electrical equipment not suitably protected against the effects. What was worse, anyone unlucky enough to be aboard any such space craft was in very real danger of getting an up close and personal experience to the kind of damage a large-scale dose of cosmic rays could do to the human body. Unfortunately, the comic books got it wrong and exposure to cosmic rays didn’t give you superpowers - unless you considered being cooked from the inside or going blind if you were lucky a superpower. Typically, CME events were slow-moving beasts and normally took up to a week to make the trip from the Sun to the Earth and even the larger and more energetic variety no faster than four days.

CB swore before he toggled the mic. “Less’n two days? Guess I’d better get a move on and get the hell out of the way then, and tell whoever was asleep at the switch that I’m gonna kick his ass when I get dirtside. Has Mars base been informed?” CB climbed out of his command chair as quick as he could and started putting things away and securing his living quarters, making sure everything was locked down nice and tight.

“Affirmative *Prairie Dog*. Mars base personnel have been informed and will be retreating to the pre-designated safe area during the exposure window.” This was control’s way of telling CB that the scientists and engineers back on the base were going to hide under the main water storage tank, since Mars lacked a proper electromagnetic field like Earth did and thus had no built-in shield against CME events other than the bulk of the planet. One of the things that the still-yet-to-be-completed overall dome structure was designed to do was provide that kind of shielding among other things.

Unfortunately, the *Prairie Dog* had even less shielding than the Mars base, mostly comprised of the steel cargo containers that made up the outside shell of the ship. While perfectly capable of dealing with the standard background radiation that permeated the solar system, they were woefully inadequate when it came to solar flares and other stellar ejecta such as large CME eruptions. While the scientists had figured out how to duplicate the artificial gravity systems from the *Jewel of Paxs’wan’l* that was the key component to the *Prairie Dog*’s ability to get off the ground, they had yet to recreate the ceramic plating that the damaged cruise liner used as shielding for both external high-energy particles and internal exotic ones. Which left CB dashing around preparing the ship for the only option that was currently available: run like hell.

“As for the late warning, prior analysis had the CME decaying to negligible levels which was obviously in error. In any case, we believe that you should be able to make it to safety within the remaining time frame,” Tower control continued in their dry tone of voice, but CB was certain that they were just as worried and upset as he was, and whoever screwed up was already scurrying like rats for whatever cover they could find themselves. 

Once CB was satisfied that nothing loose was going go flying around and crack open his skull, he got back into this chair and fastened his own safety harness and started typing in commands on the control board to adjust his current vector. “Okay dokey tower, message received and understood. *Prairie Dog* performing emergency thrust maneuvers at this time. Let’s see how much stress this bucket of bolts can take.”

---

From the outside the cargo ship appeared to twinkle, tiny thrust vectoring nozzles jetting plasma as the boxy *Prairie Dog* performed a series of rotations that ended up with the craft aimed at a specific spot in space that was currently unoccupied. However, at the end of the projected burn time, that vacant area of space would be where a 7,918 mile diameter blue-white ball of dirt and water was projected to be at, and that is where the MPD engines that suddenly bleached blue plasma pushed the ship towards at an ever-increasing rate.

Inside the control room of the ship, CB was very glad that he had insisted on the extra-cushy command chair when they had last retrofitted the ship. It had been a impulse request and CB had made it primarily so that he could watch NASCAR in comfort, but he was never more glad for the extra padding then he was now. While he wouldn’t admit that he was actually scared, he kept one hand firmly gripped on the chicken switch that would cut off all thrust if he felt that he couldn’t take it any more.

The rotation pattern and burn sequence was all done by computer control, the ship’s software calculating what was needed in terms of directional changes, thrust vectors, and burn patterns in order to cover the needed distances in the desired time frame. Normally, the flight computations were designed to maximize the lifetime of the engine components and the available fuel, which typically meant a quick burn at the start and the end of a flight with a slow cruise in between - but with these limits removed what remained of the equation basically boiled down to how much propellent was currently on board and a desire to not kill the pilot in the process.

 Unfortunately for CB, not killing the pilot simply meant that the flight computer was allowed to abuse the pilot up to a certain point, forcing CB to endure 2.7 g’s of constant thrust for a little over an hour after which the engines throttled back to a more tolerable .85 g’s as the *Prairie Dog* drove towards the turn-over point, after which the entire process was repeated. By the time Earth was in view and CB was on final approach, he had black-and-blue marks where the safety harness had pinched him something terrible and he was madder than a rattlesnake in a hornet’s nest, along with a nasty headache to go with it.

“...I don’t give a good goddamn that anyone is goddamn sorry about any goddamn thing!” CB was yelling at the specialists in charge of tower control who had come out to apologize in person after he had landed. The assembled group were all trying to look elsewhere and fidgeted nervously as the diminutive pilot raged at them from the back of the ambulance that had he had been forced into, the medical technician that was examining CB’s bruising only adding to the Texan’s irritation. 

“Quick poking at me you idjit, you’ll get your turn. You dumb sumbitches had better start paying better attention to what the hell is going on out there and get your shit together, because mark my words, next time y’all fuck up it’s gonna get someone killed! Space is dangerous enough as-”

#***BOOM!***

The ground shook and what sounded like a hail storm rattled and pinged against the front the ambulance as everyone along with CB ducked reflexively, one of the gathered specialists falling to the ground with a cry of pain. Within a second sirens and klaxons started sounding, and everyone started yelling and screaming as dust and the smell of dirt and chemicals filled the air. CB looked stunned for a moment, and then his face went hard as stone as he showed that he still had vast untapped reservoirs of anger he could call upon.

Grabbing his shirt and jumping down from where he had been sitting, he bellowed, “if that was something blowing up because of ya’lls fuckup, I swear to *God* I’m going to stake each and every one of you out on an anthill and invite the coyotes to come and watch!” The attending physician had already left CB and was kneeling on the ground next to the moaning specialist who was bleeding from a wound in his leg. “Quit standing around your morons, get back inside in case something else explodes. What the hell is wrong with you? Never seen blood before? Help the doc, pick Larry up, and get the fuck out of here. Bunch of goddamn pencil-pushing jackholes,” CB ordered, struggling into his shirt, the soreness in his arms and back making it more difficult than he was willing to accept.

Moving around the ambulance which looked like it had been peppered with large-bore buckshot, CB could see that confusion was reigning supreme with people running to and fro, some calling for medical attention while the rest were apparently just wandering around trying to find out what was going on. The loudest calls for help were being answered by approaching sirens, the requests coming from what was the apparent center of the blast - a mangled wreck of what was once a forklift and it’s driver.

“Poor bastard,” CB muttered, crossing himself as he did so. He figured that there was nothing he could do to help and would only get in the way, so he continued onwards towards the *Prairie Dog*, looking for any damage to the outside from the blast, which he assumed was caused by the propane tank - which the forklift used as fuel - exploding for some reason.

Fifteen minutes later he and everyone else were escorted away from the ship by security after being informed that there was a possible bomb threat on board and that they needed to get to a place of safety while the ship was searched from top to bottom, first responders having already determined that the source of the explosion was not the propane tank as first believed, but instead had originated in the cargo from Mars that was being offloaded from the *Prairie Dog,* the detonation triggered by a simple timer.

After being told what had caused the explosion that killed the father of four who was driving the forklift, CB had to be physically restrained from returning to his ship before it was cleared for launch, the short Texan so blinded by rage at this point that he was willing to ignore the risk of flying back through the remains of the CME just to get the bastard who had loaded a bomb on his ship. It wasn’t until the base doctor threaten to bench him indefinitely for medical reasons that he finally calmed down enough to listen to what he was being told, eventually agreeing to wait for whomever it was that the government decided to send with him to perform the actual investigation and arrest. But only until the *Prairie Dog*’s engines were fixed, the bells of the thrust chambers having been damaged by the shrapnel created by the Martian geological sample that had been packed around the explosive device.

“Iffn’ your police-like person isn’t on board by then, I’m leavin’ without’em, and we’re gonna be doing it *my* way,” CB threatened. Short of disconnecting the power supply to the ship or otherwise locking him out which would leave the Mars base stranded, everyone was certain that the Texan would keep his word, so they scrambled to find someone to send with him in time.

The pounding on the door to his rented room woke Chalal d’Nori from an uneasy sleep, vaguely disturbing images turning into tattered wisps that fled as he cranked open his eyes and looked up at the stippled pattern embedded on the ceiling, unable to remember how he had gotten there, but glad that this time he had at least somehow managed to avoid falling asleep in his clothing.

“Com’on Chalal, open the damn door!” The demand was punctuated by the person on the other side rattling the door knob. Chalal rolled himself out of bed and managed to get his feet under him before staggering to the door and unbolting it, almost getting knocked down the in process as it was thrown open.

His manager Adam strode in like he was making some sort of grand entrance and said, in a tone of voice that Chalal felt was far too bright and chipper for this time of day, “about time you got up. Get dressed and packed, we need to get going. Chop chop, time is money.” The human pushed Chalal towards where his clothing was neatly hanging and waiting. As he reached for it, Chalal asked, “what’s going on?”

“Opportunities, Chalal, opportunities. We have an early flight that I don’t want us to miss - I’ve got you booked into the 8pm show at the Riviera, big money room, big chance to step up your game. Speaking of which, get any last night? I saw how those two girls were hanging on you, the redhead and the brunette, hot hot hot,” Adam asked, a predatory grin on his face and a look in his eye Chalal hadn’t seen before and didn’t like very much.

Chalal shook his head. “I don’t recall any such human females, and it would be impossible to consummate such a relationship in any case.” Struggling into the shirt, he had to accept Adam’s assistance to finish the job, the smell of whatever the man was using as a cologne filling Chalal’s nostrils and making him slightly nauseous and his upper stomach going *squish* in agreement.

Straightening Chalal’s shirt and giving it a final pat, Adam said, “well, next time you can’t get it up, send them my way. I’ll take care of that and any other business you need, no problem. Okay, grab your stuff and let’s get out of here.” As Chalal picked up his suitcase and walked towards the door, his gait still a little clumsy, Adam looked around and nodded, satisfied with the state of the room before he made his own exit, the predatory grin still firmly fixed on his perfect face.

2z5m9m,9,2015-03-15,What is the Best time to Start Flirting with an Attractive Woman You Have only Seen in Person a Few Times?,randomaccountblah,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2z5m9m/what_is_the_best_time_to_start_flirting_with_an/,"Hello r/dating_advice

[22M] and [21F]

I don't know if this is the right place for this, but there's this really cute and funny girl that I have noticed at a few of my friend's parties. It was hard for us to find the opportunity to talk to each other directly, so I decided to ask her about her major because we both attend the same university. It turns out there was something that we both had in common, namely that we were both Accounting majors at USF. She told me that she is taking a semester off to focus on her internship. I wanted to know what the internship was like because that is one of my main goals to achieve before I finish my undergraduate degree in the Fall. 

Fast forward a few days and we are texting each other frequently to try and get to know each other better. We made plans to see each other after her internship ends on the 27th because she works every day each week and even some weekends (accounting interns can work up to 60 hrs a week depending on their clients). I respect that she's busy and her drive is one of the factors that makes me admire her. I'm trying to start out slow and get to know her better (her interests, favorite movies, hobbies, etc.) through our texting conversations, which quickly evolved from asking about her internship. We make each other laugh even if the joke is extremely cheesy and we have a few shared interests like a favorite television sitcom and video game series. She seems like a genuinely caring and fun person. The problem is that I have feelings for her and I don't want to rush into things. Do you think it would weird her out if I sent mildly flirty text messages on occasion or should I wait until we see each other in a couple weeks to flirt in person?

Example: The subject of Photoshop came up and that is one of my favorite things to mess around with in my free time along with drawing. She said ""Cool, that looks like a lot of fun."" Would something like ""Although Photoshop can improve many photos, I wouldn't want to change your pretty face"" I don't know, would any girl here find it gag worthy or uncomfortable?


Thank you in advance for any advice!

2z5mvg,3,2015-03-15,I would appreciate some advice. Feeling like an idiot.,feelsbadthrowawayman,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2z5mvg/i_would_appreciate_some_advice_feeling_like_an/,"I am a 22 year old final year civil engineering student.

I’ve completed most of the classes I need to graduate with the exception of some calculus and other math courses. 
My problem however is that I may not be able to finish these courses until well into fall of 2015. I can’t re-sit these exams whenever I want, they’re only given 2 or 3 times per year (depending on the course.) So this means I’ve got a ton of empty space between now and then. 

I’m trying to get a job as an engineers/project managers/ architects assistant or something similar at a construction, architectural, or engineering firm. I do have internship experience, but now for the life of me, I can’t get seem to get anybody interested in hiring me. I’m so bummed out.

I know I can just study for my exams, but it feels like such a huge waste of time to not do anything except study for months without getting any practical experience. I’ve pretty much exhausted my personal network and I’m starting to reach a dead end.

I feel like such a failure, feels bad man.

2z5rcd,2,2015-03-15,Questions about developing skills and help with resume,[deleted],BusinessIntelligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/2z5rcd/questions_about_developing_skills_and_help_with/,"I'll start with a bit of a background. I've been working in a project management office for a large company for almost 2 years. I started as an intern and I got hired full-time last year after graduation. I started off with basic technical skills and I expected to be doing more administrative-type work helping out project managers schedule meetings and taking meeting minutes and stuff like that but I carved myself a little niche as one of the more technical people in the department. 

I picked up MS Access because my boss suggested it. I feel pretty comfortable with VBA / SQL. I'm not an expert that can write code from memory all the time but I'm pretty effective at finding solutions in Google and modifying them to fit my needs (if I need to) or referencing older code. 

There's a lot of red tape involved with justifications and approvals to get new software installed on our laptops so I haven't had the chance to use other BI tools like SQL Server Management Studio, Analysis Services, Cognos, Tableau, etc. So right now I'm limited to mostly using MS Access / Excel / SharePoint. I've installed SQL Server 2012 / Management Studio on my personal laptop but I haven't gone full-on in learning how to be competent with it. 

I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my career but I think I'm starting to see myself as a business intelligence analyst. Can anyone recommend any tools and/or resources that would be useful / critical for me to become a business intelligence analyst? Can I already be considered a business intelligence analyst at this point even though my official job title is ""Project Coordinator""?

Here is my [resume](http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll38/richgunks/BI%20resume_zpsi4c976at.png) for reference. I'm still doing some of the stuff I was doing as an intern like managing SharePoint sites and creating Visio / PowerPoint documents but I focused more on specific projects for my current job title. Also the IT Program Management Office was merged with other Business PMOs to create the Enterprise PMO but I'm still working for the same boss and team for the most part."
2z5tqa,172,2015-03-15,[f] playing a whore for an older [m]an once again.,cruisingalong,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2z5tqa/f_playing_a_whore_for_an_older_man_once_again/,"It's been a little while since I posted about meeting up with an older man from tinder and getting fucked like a whore in his hotel room and figured a follow-up about our christmas-party office fuck might be a worthwhile follow-up.

We'd been seeing each other casually - mostly for sex - for a few months by the time the holidays rolled around and he asked me to go with him. For him, it was a chance to show off the hot young piece of ass he'd been playing with for the past few months. He promised to give me money for a new dress and told me there'd be free champagne. I'm a sucker for free champagne.

He texted me throughout the day, making little demands. He wanted my hair down. He wanted my dress to be bright and short to show of my legs. He wanted it to be backless. He wanted me to keep my makeup light and neutral and to look hot and ""young as fuck"". That's hardly a problem when you've just turned 19 and are half korean.

He sent a cab for me just before the festivities began. It was at a restaurant in the base of their building. When he greeted me at the door he took me by the arm and whispered in my ear asking it was I wearing underwear. I told him just panties and he sent me to the bathroom to take them off and bring them to him. I came back with them clenched in my palm and slid them into his fist. He put them in his pocket.

There was lots of champagne - and other drinks - and he did an excellent job making sure I was never without. I was slowly getting tipsy. As I've said before, I'm the kind of girl who bubbly hits them in the horny spot hard. I get raging wet for cock when I get a little alcohol in me and he was making sure I was well watered.

He was making the rounds, introducing me to different people and chatting with them. As he'd talk he'd stroke my arm or my hair. Just little touches to show I was thoroughly his. When we finally sat down he inched his chair close and stroked my thigh, working the dress up just a smidge. He never made eye contact but just kept hiking the dress up further and further until my pussy was exposed. He fingered me just shallowly but when I got too flustered he stopped. Professional occasion after all. After dinner they cleared the room a little and he was talking about something super boring - golf maybe? - and I peaced off to chat with a few of his coworkers. I should mention that he's very successful in what I'd like to do when I graduate school. I was kind of hoping he'd hook me up with an internship so I figured I'd mingle and network. Two of the coworkers were pretty attractive young men. One of them was pretty blatant in his staring - which was kind of the point of the exercise for my man I guess and the entire reason he brought me along.

I felt my phone buzz in my purse and when I got a chance I snuck a peek. He told me to excuse myself and head to the bathroom. We were in a separate events style area of the restaurant and it had, around the corner, one of those single-cell bathrooms. I think they're used for wheel chair people and new moms or something. This one had a change table in it. I waited for about three minutes before I hear a knock on the door and I open it just a crack. He pushes in and presses me back against the wall, kissing me. He turns me around so I'm pressed chest-first against it and hauls up my dress and slaps my ass hard. He leans in and tells me it's for being a whore - for wanting other men to look at me. He spanks me and I'm dripping. I love how dominant he is. I thought he'd fuck me right there but he didn't. He pulled down the table and set me on top of it, kissing me. My lipstick was smeared beyond repair at this point as he took advantage of my mouth. He's a passionate kisser and very skilled. He pulled away and I tried to haul him back by his tie but he pushed me back and held me hard, telling me to behave myself. The dress was up around my belly at this point. He spread my legs, hunching down a little, and started kissing and licking my pussy. I was wet wet wet and he was spreading my juice around and pumping away at my vagina while his teeth and lips pulled and rubbed and flicked my clit. I was extremely close to coming when he pulled back. He took a shaky step back, smoothed his hair (by this point mussed by my fingers while he pleasured me), wiped off my lipstick and straightened his shirt. He pulled me down - by this point I was like a knock-kneed idiot and started straightening my dress and taming my hair.

I whined. I wanted him to fuck me. I wanted his cum dripping out of my pussy. I needed an orgasm. He shushed me and told me not to be such a needy bitch. He told me I was going to wash my face and then I was going to come back out the party. We were going to stay exactly 7 more minutes and then we were going to leave.

I did as he asked and we mingled just a bit more. I could feel the wet stickyness between my legs at this point. It was a long seven minutes. When we got in the elevator to leave I thought for sure we'd be headed for his car where I could suck him off, get him hard, and we'd have a quick fuck. Instead he hits his office floor and we start to rise. He grinds against my ass and I feel his cock hard against my upper back. I moan and his kisses my neck a little, biting his way down in sexy little nips. He tells me that he's dreamed about fucking me spread on his desk since we met and tonight he's going to live that fantasy.

We get to his office. It's a big glass unit - no doors or walls really. You can see every desk on the floor pretty much. He props me up against the desk and I race to unzip him as we kiss. He yanks my dress down and the strap catches. He gives it a huge tug and my breasts spilled out and do this incredible bounce I'd only ever seen in the porn we watched together. He grinned - it was something I knew made him super hot.

I hike my legs around him, parting them so he can step between and the dress rises around my thighs. I could smell myself that's how wet I was. He fingers my clit ruthlessly and I'm so worked up I come. He slaps my vagina hard - because he didn't mean to let me come and I'm a whore for being so easy. But we both know that just works me up more. I'm all but frantic with the need to be filled and stretched. I'm sensitive still when he enters me, pussy convulsing as he pushes inside. I buck off the desk and his phone topples off and hits the floor. He ignores it and gives me a fucking huge thrust, pushing my legs up to my chest. He's pounding me incredibly deeply - he feels huge inside me. I knew neither of us would last long because of the intense build up all night but even quick it was one of the best fucks I've had. He pushed my hand down between us to finger my clit while he thrust inside me. He was entirely dressed - only his cock was out - and I was spread eagle over his desk, dress pushed into a single band around my stomach. He squeezed and kissed my chest while fucking my pussy. I hugged his cock tight with my inner muscles and I felt him give me one big last thrust before he came deep inside me.

He sat back on his chair, pretty much eye level with my pussy. When I tried to climb off his desk he just laid his hand on my stomach and held me in place. He wanted to watch his cum slide out of me. He pulled out his phone and recorded it. He loved those little mementos.

When I went to get redressed later I found he'd mangled the strap badly. It wouldn't stay up over my tits at all. He had to give me his spare shirt from his desk to wear. When we took the elevator down to get into his car one of the partygoers - one of the other partner's secretaries - got in and they one hundred percent knew what had happened. No possibility they missed my wearing a men's shirt, heels in hand, hair fucked to high heaven or his satisfied smirk."
2z5wbv,1,2015-03-15,"4+ years clean, seeking input as I look into a new direction",[deleted],recoverywithoutAA,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/2z5wbv/4_years_clean_seeking_input_as_i_look_into_a_new/,"Hey all, this is my first post here and I hope this is in the proper subthread. I’m looking to hear about people’s experience without AA and solely focusing on the underlying issues of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, I am curious to see if anyone has had success in recovery without abstinence. I am turning to reddit because I already know the responses my AA peers would give me.

First, a little background on my drinking history if I may bore you. I've always been depressed and anxious long before I started drinking, in fact, I was on antidepressants by the time I was 11 or so.  I started drinking when I was 15 and started to smoke weed the following year and begun to experiment with prescription pills. At 18, I used heroin. I ""dabbled"" for a year or so. In college I began to binge-drink more frequently and black out. That summer I used heroin intravenously for the first time and used it nearly every day for about a month. I detoxed on my own by the time I left for college for fall semester, where I continued to drink heavily. I returned home for winter break where I would smoke heroin every day for the next month, until my family found out I was using. Three days later, I compliantly left for long-term treatment. 

I am approaching my mid-twenties and have been clean/sober for more than 4 years now. I got sober through a long-term treatment program (over a year), which incorporated 12-step philosophy into every aspect of day-to-day life. I got a sponsor, attended daily AA meetings, completed the 12 steps and worked with sponsees. 

However, I have always had difficulty internalizing a belief in a higher power. I have always wanted to believe and accept faith but I simply cannot. I also have had a difficult time truly relating to my sober peers. Many have had a lifetime of behavior problems-- acting out in school, getting suspended/expelled, dropping out, getting arrested, couldn't hold down a job, cheated on girlfriends, and so on. I've never had those issues even at my worst. I was the opposite. Good grades, athlete, had friends, etc. I've always been incredibly self-sufficient, goal-oriented and functional despite my depression and anxious tendencies.

To get to the point: in the last 2 years, I've rarely attended meetings and haven't ""worked a program."" I don't relate and connect with even the people I went through treatment with, we have very different goals, perspectives and worldview. My life is great: I'm in a healthy relationship, my family relationships are strong, I'm close to receiving my bachelor's, I work and achieve internships. But I am still depressed and anxious. Overall, it's clear to me that AA isn't for me and has never really worked for me. On a deeper level, I question whether or not I'm actually an alcoholic and in truth, I want to drink again (AAs would remind me that the disease is cunning, baffling, powerful). However, I am terrified in disappointing my family and letting them down since they have fully subscribed to the 12-step view on recovery (my brother is sober as well). That is the only thing keeping me from drinking along with the fact that my roommate is sober. 

Looking to see if anyone here has successful experience with recovery w/o abstinence and how your family dealt with it. I am curious if anyone else has been in the same predicament (feeling forced to be sober, held hostage by circumstance) and has successfully changed. 

Or, perhaps I am completely delusional, given my history of abuse and family history and my sobriety should be paramount. I am open to your opinions! 

Sorry for the length, thank you for taking the time to read.

Initially I applied for graduate schemes, then decided on doing a masters, and applied for internships. I did not manage to get an internship, and also I am not going to pursue a masters.

I am aware that graduate schemes are not the only way to get a job, however, I am not sure if that is the case in the actuarial industry, since most companies have graduate schemes.

I am also unsure whether or not I can get a job, given that I could not even land a single internship.

I have a few questions

1) How available are jobs outside of a graduate schemes, as an actual trainee?

2) How do I make my self more employable? I have a good degree at a top 5 university, studying physics, I also passed the CT1 exam last September. I was thinking I could learn VBA and really practice applying it. I am also considering learning more python, I have recently got into it (NumPy, SciPy) how useful are these languages for actuarial work?

2z6bu3,76,2015-03-15,Just pulled the trigger on a Chromebook Pixel LS. Planning on using it as a web development machine.,AIDS_Pizza,chromeos,https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/2z6bu3/just_pulled_the_trigger_on_a_chromebook_pixel_ls/,"I am a hard core Linux user and also love ChromeOS.  Last year I bought an Acer C720, upgraded the SSD, and put [Chroagh](https://github.com/drinkcat/chroagh) on it (which is an Arch Linux variant of [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton)) and used this for almost all of 2014 as my do-everything machine (everything from web development at my software internship to writing philosophy papers for my last semester of college this past fall).  Now I am out of school and working full time as a software engineer doing web dev.  I ran into a few issues with Chroagh (predominantly not being able to switch back and forth between ChromeOS and Arch Linux unless I started my window manager as root) so in January I wiped ChromeOS entirely, enabled SeaBIOS, and put Manjaro Linux on it instead.

I decided a while ago that I would upgrade my C720 at some point this year (it only ended up costing me about $300 in total, even with the upgraded SSD).  Lately I have also been doing some very RAM intensive machine learning related stuff so I realized that the C720, with its 4 gigs of RAM, doesn't come anywhere near being powerful enough to do these types of tasks (takes over 20 minutes to search a 5.7 gigabyte model using the [word2vec algorithm](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) for a single target word).

The release of the Chromebook Pixel 2 a few days ago got me to make up my mind really quickly.  The LS version's 16 gigs of RAM and i7 processor make it capable of some very heavy lifting.  At ~$1400 with taxes and an HDMI adapter, it is cheaper than most Macbooks.  This is if you do not subtract the value of 3 years of 1 TB of Google Drive space (currently worth $360, but likely to decrease in price before the 3 years is up).  Below is how I plan on using it:

* With the Chromebook in development mode, install the [dev_install](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/how-tos-and-troubleshooting/install-software-on-base-images) tool set to get access to sshfs natively in ChromeOS.
* [Mount a remote directory using sshfs](http://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/2gvadm/chromeos_sshfsfuse_and_files_app/) to get access to its files in ChromeOS.  The directory will look exactly like any other directory in the Downloads folder in the Files app.  The actual remote directory is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet costing me just $5 a month to keep running.
* Use [Caret](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en) as my native ChromeOS text editor.  This should have no problem editing the files in the SSHFS-mounted directory so long as it is mounted in the proper location and visible to the ChromeOS Files app.  I just tested Caret on my current machine and it opened a 15,000 line file instantly.  Just as snappy as Sublime Text.
* Use [ChromeOS MySQL Admin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-mysql-admin/ndgnpnpakfcdjmpgmcaknimfgcldechn?hl=en) as my SQL tool.  (The above mentioned development droplet has PhpMyAdmin enabled, but our production server does not, so a tool is required to connect to its database).
* Use a [128 GB SD card](http://amzn.com/B008PO5CSI) for some relatively cheap additional storage (if needed).
* Use either Crouton or Chroagh (mentioned above) to install some flavor of Linux to have access to native Linux apps, when needed.  In addition, I will use the xiwi target and the [Crouton Integration extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crouton-integration/gcpneefbbnfalgjniomfjknbcgkbijom) in order to access Linux [inside of a ChromeOS tab](http://liliputing.com/2014/12/crouton-chromebooks-run-ubuntu-browser-tab.html), rather than in a separate window session as has typically been the case.

The result of all of these things coming together should be a very functional laptop that retains the awesomeness of ChromeOS but is fully functional for serious web development.  The key point to note about this plan is that I will not actually running a local server and doing all my development in Linux via Crouton (which this machine is 110% capable of).  I am going to be using ChromeOS apps to do cloud based development.  In theory you could do a lot of what I mentioned above to do all types of development so long as you do not rely on an IDE.

I am making this post because I want people to realize that for a software developer, ChromeOS is a very capable operating system and that one does not need to automatically default to Crouton in order to utilize it for this purpose.  With the right setup and the right developer tools enabled, ChromeOS does the job very well.

I will probably make a followup post to this in a month or two as to how this actually turned out.  If you have any questions about anything, feel free to post below."

2z6i7o,2,2015-03-15,"Me [21 M] with my Girlfriend [21 F] duration 1 year, she has depression and other issues that I don't know how to deal with",silentzib,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2z6i7o/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_duration_1_year/,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my struggles. I am a Middle Eastern Muslim and my girlfriend is an African-American Christian. We have been in a relationship for almost a year now and things have never been quite alright. There's always problems between the two of us coming from cheating, thinking about the future, our background difference and other problems but the main problem that I don't know how to deal with is her depression.


She always tells me about her depression and how it holds her back all the time. She describes it as something that is capable of keeping her in her bed just laying down doing absolutely nothing and if someone tells her to do something about it then she gets anxiety and more depression. She once stayed in the room for an entire week because she thought she is going to get fired from her job for missing too many days. She of course lost the job but not because she was fired but because she never went again to avoid confrontation from her manager. I personally have never really been depressed so I do not understand how it works. I am motivated with school, family, religion, work, friends, sports, video games and many other stuff. But her? She has not motivations. The girl does not do anything for fun except sometimes watching Netflix, she doesn't have any goals in life, she dropped out of school last year, and she is currently unemployed. 


First let me tell you about her family problems to understand where her depression comes from. When she was 11 her step father (the father of her younger brother) raped her and her sister. She loved him before he did that and she says they were living a very happy life before that happened. He went to prison and her mom had to manage on her own because her sister's father was already in jail and her father is still till this day an alcoholic that lives by himself. So as you can see she had a very rough life. She says that she tried committing suicide a couple of times during high school but was never successful. Also, right before we started our relationship she told me that she was going to finally do it but didn't do it because I was so kind to her and that I give her a reason to live. I have never had to deal with anything like this. I've been living a comfortable life with my parents. We did have to flee a war-torn country and it was tough for them and my older siblings but not for me. I was too young and sheltered to deal with anything on my own so I never had to really see anything from war or the horrors of life that she had to live through. I feel very sympathetic towards her in this aspect and I feel very lucky to never having to deal with what she dealt with.


Second I'm going to describe the problems that happened between us over the past year for you to get a clearer understanding of the nature of our relationship. So we met in college over a year ago and we became friends with benefits. She was basically the first girl I had an intimate relationship with. I have never had the opportunity to really like someone and have them like me back. It's either one way or another. I fell in love with some girls in high school that never liked me back and some girls really liked me but I wasn't interested in them. I had sex once before and it was a horrible experience so she was my first happy sex experience. But for her, she says that she used to go to parties all the time and hook up with a lot of guys. That problem between us had always given me trouble because I do not know if it is fair for her to be my second but for me to be like her eleventh it's something that I have to deal with and if you have any tips about that please let me know. I always justified it as I had my parents always project me in the right direction and therefore I never was part of the hook up culture but she had nobody to really tell her what's right and wrong. Anyways, lets go back to our topic of how we met. After two months of us being friends with benefits I found out that she was having sex with this one guy to buy her alcohol because she has a problem to deal with. The problem was that her step father just got out of prison and he was trying to talk to her and she did not know what to do but to drink. She was under 21 so she had to get someone to buy it for her and that was her way. I told her that what she was doing was disgusting and it's a very wrong way to deal with problems. Then she said that she was going to kill herself because she didn't know what else to do. I gave her a lecture about it and threw a bottle of vodka in the trash to show her that it was unimportant. I told she has to really change herself for me to be associated with her.


A month later, she did change. She was different and looked much happier than before so I decided to make her my girlfriend because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. So over the summer she started living with me. I was doing an internship but she was literally just staying home all the time. I would sometimes drive her to her hometown to see friends but her friends were not a great influence so I always told her to stay away from them and she to a certain extent did. Then disaster happened, I knocked her up and we got an abortion. For me in my mind I think it was 100% the right thing to do but she was uncertain. If we weren't going to do the abortion I would have been disowned from my family and my family means everything to me. Of course they do not know I had an abortion. They do not even know I have a girlfriend till this day because in my culture and religion it is prohibited. After the abortion things started to change. She became depressed once again. Even more depressed than before. I then finished my internship two weeks after the abortion and dropped her home and went to visit my family. During that time she was trying to cover her depression and the ways she was dealing with it. Two months later I found out through her facebook messages to one of her friends that she was planning to cheat on me to cover the pain of the abortion. For me that makes no sense. How can you cover the pain of an abortion with more sex? If she really wanted to cover up the pain then she would never have sex again. That's how my logical mind works. But after reading the messages she told me that she never did it. She was never able to cheat on me. I tried really hard to accept that fact but till this day I think tat she did do it.


The reason I think that she did it is because that night when she went out I was feeling odd about her hanging out with this ""new friend."" She told me that she had an old high school friend that she went out with and that it was just the two of them. I told her at the time that she wasn't telling the truth and that she needs to tell me it or otherwise I break up with her. She started crying and promising me that it was the truth so I believed her. Months later when I read the messages, her ""new friend"" did not exist. She went out with a couple of her girlfriends to some party and those friends of hers are really bad people that I know do hard drugs and engage in orgies so it would have been very easy for her to cheat on me but I once again for some reason believed that she couldn't do it and moved on. That point in my life when I was reading the messages was literally the most scary thing I've ever done. My heart rate was never that fast and I stayed in bed for a whole week missing my classes trying to convince myself that she is innocent and that she just didn't know what to do to deal with the abortion.


Anyways things moved on and I forgot about it. I thought even if she did cheat, somehow I will find out at some point then I can break up with her knowing I was doing the right thing but till this day I have my doubts. Fast forward to the end of last year after she lost her job and got kicked out of her house because of bad arguments with her mother. She started living in my room while I was going to school. I would leave for class and come back while she's just sitting there on her phone watching random Youtube videos. I had to do something about it. Her sister recently moved to California so I bought her a plane ticket and sent her there to live with her sister. She was there for about three months doing absolutely nothing. Her sister at first was very kind to her and was trying to help her get a job but then started being mean to her because she was costing her a lot of money. I started sending her sister money just so she could buy her food. She slept on the couch and stayed on it all day long. Finally her sister told her that she is moving out of the apartment and that she was not welcome to come with her. At that point I was just freaking out so I called her mom who called her cousin which is in a different state to see if she could live there. Couple weeks later she flies out to live with her cousin. She has been living there for almost a month just babysitting and still very very much depressed. I cannot talk to her about anything because she tells me it gets her upset. I cannot ask her how different things in her life are going because she doesn't want to be reminded of them. I decided to spend this past week during my spring break to go visit her. I went there and I saw her. She is far more depressed than she used to be. Things are really not going well for her. She calls me every morning crying and complaining about how she's unhappy. I ask her why and she just says everything. When I ask for specifics she just wants to stop talking so she doesn't get remiinded of it. I tell her she has to work on things for them to get better like to get back to school, to do her taxes, to have a plan for the summer but she hates talking about these things because she says they give her anxiety. Today I woke up and I called her to do her tax return but every time I ask her for some information she tells me that this is a waste of time. Then she asked me how long it takes to do it. I said maybe half an hour. She said then screw it that's a waste of time so she told me to stop. These types of things of her refusing to do work has been a repeating pattern over the past year that I've known her and it drives me insane.


Third, Reddit please help me with my struggle. Give me advice and please tell me if I'm doing something wrong. Just don't ignore this or make fun of stuff that I did or said. I'm a software engineer so I don't know how to write well and I'm only 21 so I don't know if my life choices were right or wrong. Just tell me if i'll ever be able to make her happy and fix her life situation or if I should just give up and hope someone else would pick it up from here.


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend has a lot of depressions issues. I have been for an entire year trying to help her through her problems but nothing seems to be working. If anything it seems like I'm making things worse. I would really recommend reading the non-tldr version to get a better understanding. I know its long. Sry."

I'm set to graduate in the fall of 2015 with a B.S. in Statistics (Applied Probability and Statistics concentration) with a lot of financial math/actuary classes (And there subsequent prereqs such as stochastic processes) as well as data mining classes, and my second major is econ/math (the math is mostly upper div linear algebra proof classes) which is a B.A.  I attend the University of California, Santa Barbara my upper division GPA is currently  hovering around a 3.2 for both majors.  Before attending UCSB, I studied at a community college focusing on electrical engineering, so i have a strong science/math background (I was accepted into UCSD/UCD for EE but decided it wasnt for me). I'm looking into entering a masters program to further my learning.  Since I am graduating in the fall, most of the master on-campus master programs only do fall admissions.  This leaves me with about an 8 month window.

1)What GRE scores should I expect to have to get into a program such as Columbia's, stanfords, or Berkeleys?

2) Stories about getting financial aid through teaching assistance? Was it hard?

3) Any references for summer internships or companies looking to hire entry level datascientist /business intelligence?

4) Thoughts on Mu Sigma? They are the only data analytics/science company recruiting at my school.

I grew up in the silicon valley, which is most likely where I'll be heading once I graduate, but im open to other locations.

2z6mas,0,2015-03-15,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2z6mas/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Just some general background about me: 
-I am a Soph at the University of Western Ontario, and will be attending Ivey Business School next year. 3.9 GPA currently. 
-I'm looking to do something technical and business related, so I thought tech consulting was a perfect match for me. 

I have been applying to many internship positions all over Canada, especially big tech companies since December of 2014, and have yet to receive a response from any of them! Needless to say, I am extremely worried that I will not get any useful work experience this summer. I was wondering if someone could help look at my resume and help me improve on what I could do better. 

I know that recruiting doesnt start until my 3rd year, but I have always been told that I need to ""start now"" and get a leg up on as much experience I can in preparation for recruitment. What do you guys think? Should I be worried and feel bad if I don't land any internships this summer? 

Thanks alot for the advice and help. I love you reddit. :)"

I'm planning on taking Data Structures and Databases this summer, so I'll be in those courses during the showcase). I'm not really sure if I'll be ready for an internship at that point, but I feel like it can't hurt to start getting face-to-face time with prospective employers.

(Long)",Rivarz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2z6vrp/31m_my_wife_25f_went_on_a_mission_trip_now_she/,"I’m really unsure of what to do right now. I’m really scared my marriage could be over.

My wife and I have been married for just over a year now. We’ll have been together as a couple for 5 years this July. We have one chihuahua, but no kids. We met working at a fast food restaurant when she was 20 and I was 26. For a little background on her, she’s the 2nd oldest of 6 kids (same parents for all of them) who range in age from 26 to 3. Since she was 10, she has been helping to care for each of the last 3 as they came along. The last two, especially, seem like fashion accessories for her mom. My wife never really got to have a wild streak, and she had to grow up rather quickly to take care of the kids, since her mom lost all interest in raising them properly. 


Our marriage (and relationship) have had their share of issues, but never anything serious. Our worst fights have come from me trying to quit smoking, eventually starting again, and not telling her. This has happened 3 times (I told her the first time, but stupidly I didn’t the other two because I didn’t want her to be mad at me) and outside of that, we’ve only had typical young people problems. These include keeping the house clean (we’re both slobs), money issues (I have my bachelors degree, stuck in a low paying job, and can’t find a job that pays more than $10 an hour in my region, she is in her last spring/summer semester for her bachelors and works a similarly paid position), boredom (we live in rural Indiana), and how we’ll pay bills.


I have 2 friends, one who I never see due to different schedules, and one who lives across the country in Arizona. She has 0 friends. She lost touch with all her college friends when she dropped out of a major university, and our small town doesn’t offer much in the way of other young couples or activities for us to meet people. 


In the fall, she mentioned to me that she saw a flyer for a spring-break mission trip to Ireland. She told me she wanted to go, and I supported her. I thought it would be a nice chance for her to make some friends, and renew her faith. Her family told her they would pay for the trip. They didn’t, and we ended up having to ask my grandma for the money.


She was absolutely terrified to go on the trip. She doesn’t like planes, and she didn’t know anyone else on the trip. I tried to be as reassuring to her as I could be, and encouraged her to go. She ended up going, and that’s when the issues really started.


We set her up on an international phone plan so we could talk. However, after the first day, she would almost refuse to call me because she was busy “hanging” with her new pals. I would ask her if I’d be able to call, and look forward to it all day, and when it would come time she was always busy. She’d end up staying up until 5am every night with her new friends, and tell me couldn’t spare 5 minutes to talk to me because she wouldn’t see them again. 


Meanwhile, I’m going crazy. It’s just the dog and I, and we’re all alone in our big house. At work, I’d stare all day at our wedding photo she got me for our anniversary last month. At home, I’d try to clean, but end up so depressed that I would just sit there lost in thought. I had a lot of dark thoughts, ranging from suicide, to whether she would have been better off if we had never gotten married. It was literally the worst week of my life. 

I ended up getting into an argument with her, because I wanted her to call, and she didn’t, and the whole time something had just felt off emotionally. After that, I drove the 4 hours to the airport to pick her up, and I was a little upset that she didn’t seem happy to see me. There was no big kiss or hug, no relief in her eyes. The ride home from the airport was spent with her texting all her new friends, telling me a few things about her trip, and about 2 hours of silence. 

Here’s where the real trouble starts. I figured she was just tired yesterday from being on the plane, and not sleeping all week, and maybe that’s why she hadn’t been happy to see me. Today, though, she was the same way. She spent more time texting and facetiming her new friends today than she did talking to me all week. I asked her to go on a walk with me, hoping we could talk, but conversation died pretty quickly in favor of texting and just walking in silence. 

When we got back to our house, I started asking more questions, and eventually I got a bunch of answers that I didn’t want to hear. 


* She said they told them not to be on the phone on the trip so they could “better enjoy” the experience. 

* She said they had a special talk about how to deal with their families when they get back because they’ll be on such a high. 

* They told them not to make any big changes or plans for a few weeks.

* She told me that she and another girl had already decided they’re going to go back in just over a year and do a 3 month internship at the church.

* She told me that she wants to go there to do her teaching degree, because “it will only take 1 year there, as opposed to 2 here”
 
* She said she didn’t want to come home.

She said she liked being there. She felt called to be there. It was a week where she didn’t have to worry about grown-up things like bills, money, or working with her mom. She kept telling me how they were going to help her find a church, and all these other things. I asked her if she meant “us”, because I want to go to church together. She said she didn’t know. That lead to her telling me that she isn’t sure if she wants to stay together. She’s apparently considered leaving me several times during the last 5 years, but never told me. She says she doesn’t know if she’s in love with me anymore, though she did say she still loves me. I asked her if she wanted me to leave so she had space to think, and she said she didn’t know. 


I ended up packing a week’s worth of clothes, and she went to bed (it was 8pm). Before I left, she was sobbing about how she’s the most selfish person, and how she always screws things up. I told her she wasn’t selfish, and didn’t screw anything up. I went out to my parents’ house, talked to my dad for a bit, and ended up coming home.

I’m not sure what to do now. Should I stay and fight for my marriage? Should I leave and hope that her new friends don’t influence her to leave/or that reality kicks back in for her? What do I do? Was I wrong to be upset she didn’t seem excited to see me? I asked her about marriage counselling, and all she said was “Do you think it will help?”. I plan to call a pastor that we both know and see if she would be willing to talk to me/us about this on Monday. I also am going to get a recommendation to someone about my depression. Is there anything else I should do? Does anyone have any comforting words or at least good advice they can give me on how to deal with this? I don’t want to lose my wife.

TLDR: My wife went to Ireland on a mission trip. She came back physically, but not emotionally. Now she’s not sure if she wants to stay together. 

**Edit: 3/16/15:** I talked to my wife this morning. After I apologized for forcing this dialogue so quickly after she got back, she told me she's just not sure what to do right now. She loves me, but she just needs to be by herself right now. She's going to stay at her parents' house for a few days. She also said she's confused and lost, ""needs to find out who I am as a follower of God"", and that she wants to ""move away and experience new things, I want to be selfish for once in my life."" I asked her if she could do that with me, and she said ""no, I've been with you for 5 years and I feel like I've never been on my own to enjoy things."" She said we could talk when she comes home from work. 

I ended up taking half a sick-day at work. I also called a pastor I know and trust, and talked to her for about 2 hours this afternoon. She listened, and basically told me that the ball is in her court. I've done about all I can do right now. She wants me to listen to my wife when she comes home, and have her tell me more about her trip. She said that if she wants space to give it to her, and to let her know that while I don't want her to leave, I still love her and will be there for her. She said a few days might clear her head. She said it might take six months. I'm supposed to concentrate on me, doing things for myself, not to get caught up in depression again, and continue to live my life. I'm going to bring up counseling again tonight to her, and see where that goes. I'll try to post another update with how things go after that conversation. 

Thank you to everyone for your thoughts, concerns, and suggestions. This isn't easy, but I appreciate all the help. "
2z6wf7,3,2015-03-15,Canada - University of Toronto and University of Waterloo,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2z6wf7/canada_university_of_toronto_and_university_of/,"Hey everyone

I'm a grade 12 student in Ontario and I'm having a bit of a conflict deciding on which university to go into.  I have been accepted to the CS program at UofT Saint George and the co-op CS program at UofT Scarborough. UW is waiting until may for the bulk of their CS acceptances but I have a decent chance to get in with an average slightly under 90%.

The co-op at UW is very well known and many students intern at SV companies at some point. UofT has their PEY program but it's not as well known. In terms of material, I've heard that UofT is just as good, if not better in some areas such as math. I'm in Toronto so I can commute to both campuses mentioned and that will save a good $8000 + some other fees per year, adding up to approx $50000(?). That's not a small sum of cash for my family. Would it still be worth it to go to UW?

Additionally, can anyone chime in on UofT's PEY? I like the idea but since it's a single term I'm afraid of being placed in tech support for a year due to the lack of experience or knowledge. The co-op program at UofT Scarborough seems more forgiving since there are multiple terms but I've heard that the opportunities aren't that great. Most people say that UofT SG &gt; UofT Scarborough but I'm leaning toward UofT Scarborough due to the shorter commute and the multiple co-op terms mentioned above. Also, UofT Scarborough students can still apply to PEY from what I've read.

My goal is to work at a SV company immediately after graduation or at the latest 1-3 years after graduation. I understand that UW would likely be the best option for me if I want to reach that goal, but I also know that with hard work and good experience I can also reach the same goal by going to UofT. Maybe I'm overthinking it?

Thanks for reading and also thanks in advance for the help!"
2z70r0,0,2015-03-15,"I [21/F] just learned the my bf [20,M] (together for almost 3 years) is not very concerned about job opportunities when he graduates next year. **TLDR AT THE END**",hopeless93,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2z70r0/i_21f_just_learned_the_my_bf_20m_together_for/,"Sorry for all the text, TLDR at the end. 

So my bf just told me today that he is not concerned about job prospects per his degree, etc, etc. He is obtaining a bachelor degree in computer science and a minor in economics. Now he has finally found his first internship this year as a junior in college, and it's paid! He will be working in the summer for 10 weeks and will be paid 8k. Now I am extremely proud of him for getting this internship but honestly this is probably that first time he has worked hard to get something... He was the kind of kid in high school that was naturally smart but college kicked his butt a bit and he slipped under a 3.0 and had to retake a few classes here and there. 

So here comes the issue from the title, I guess we were talking about how this internship will be a good way to open doors and this agency is known for offering permanent positions to interns in the future and that's when he told me that he's not worried about finding a job even if he hadn't taken this internship...... I was kinda in shock... like how can you not be worried? My roommate is finishing up the same degree and has a ton of experience over my bf and has been job hunting since September and has still found nothing... I think my bf underestimates the real world a bit... and what looking for a job is really like. 

He has never had a job before, his parents are well off enough where he can simply focus on school and just pay everything off through them. Now I love him and don't want to offend him but I just feel like he needs a little reality check... Has anyone had an issue like this before? What is the best way to approach it without making him come out to be entitled/spoiled sounding? 

**TLDR: Boyfriend underestimates what the real workforce is like post-graduation and has no worries. P.S. He has never had a job of any kind and just got his first internship in his third year of college. How can I address my concerns about this without sounding awful?** 

**EDIT: I'm not trying to control him or get him to worry, it's simply not on his mind but we have talked about a future, marriage, etc. I'm just trying to keep good, open and honest communication about concerns I have that could impact our future as a couple, as I have agreed to follow him where his career takes him since it is very likely that his career will pay much better than mine. In no way am I trying to control him. I just want to know how to communicate my concerns**"

2z7hnc,7,2015-03-16,Stress in early 20s + feeling left out of gay life?,CelestialBeekeeper,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2z7hnc/stress_in_early_20s_feeling_left_out_of_gay_life/,"Hey, so, background: I'm 22, graduated from college last June. Been feeling really stressed and lousy about my life. Wanted to share, and know if anyone had any thoughts:

I've had one part time minimum wage job since last August (boring work and bad hours); I've been looking at better jobs and internships since then, but nothing's come through. I just took a second part time minimum wage job which gives me even less time now to research and apply for better jobs. 

Ideally what I want is to not live at home, but I live in New York, so even if I get a better paying job that would take a while. 

I also want to get in better shape and, further down the line, lose weight. I do judo, but with my schedule I've had to miss that for a few months. I've been trying to compensate by lifting weights/working out at home, but with this second job that's also getting to be harder since I feel like I'm always busy, exhausted, or hungry.

And I also have a play I've been working on, but the further I get to a final draft, the more I worry it's just going to sit in a drawer for the rest of my life.

I think I'd be able to deal with all of that on its own (I mean, I'm just describing life here) but I also get super disheartened in my sexual, romantic, and homosocial life. Without financial independence, better fitness, more career success, etc. I just feel inadequate. Instead of being more driven towards my goals I feel stressed and ashamed for having not met them. It doesn't help that in my mind I keep contrasting myself with gay people my age who I know or am aware of who are better off than me. I don't like it, but I get jealous kind of easily. 

I figure I would be comfortable with sacrificing some happiness in the present to work towards the future. But right now I feel like I'm doing nothing but working towards the future because the present is worthless. And the near future doesn't seem to be worth much more. And half the time I'm just spinning my wheels.

I guess I don't have a real question here; I'm just wondering if anyone has any thoughts. I know the obvious answer--stop comparing yourself to other people, enjoy what you have, and work hard on your goals. My living situation isn't that bad--if anything, I'm lucky--and as far as I can tell it's common. But I still feel miserable about it. And I keep tying it to my understanding of myself and the choices I make as a gay person (full disclosure: for a while I've had anxieties about not belonging in or being accepted by the gay community, so I'm kind of kicking up those feelings).

Sorry for the long post **(tl;dr: I'm 22 and have two shitty jobs, still live at home, and would to exercise more; this makes me stressed and anxious about dating, sex and meeting other gay people, and I feel bad.)** I know, it makes no sense. Maybe because the most visible positive images of gay life celebrate relative privilege, youth, and beauty, so when my life looks so different I feel like I don't have access to gay life at all?

Anyways, thanks for reading. Any thoughts would help."
2z7hoa,1,2015-03-16,"Geez, where did these "" 'facts' "" come from?",Swordkirby,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2z7hoa/geez_where_did_these_facts_come_from/,"I swear, there is never a time the goes by that my brother doesn't bother me about what I do at home. My brother loves to get mad so easily when I say something simple. I just am not the type to take sarcastic jokes. Especially when they are not good at ""acting"". So if your acting sucks and you try making a sarcastic joke, I might likely think you're legitimately true about what you said. Which is what happened here. I just ask my brother if he did the simple task of buying something from the store while I was at work all day. He makes the joke of saying he didn't and said he ""wasn't aware"". Conversation moves along and I soon find out he was just joking. Calmly, I tell him that I don't like it when he does this ""joking"" kind of thing. He takes that the wrong way and suddenly tries to retort with saying that I have been lazing around while he took the time to help my parents clean one part of the house. I mean, I don't doubt that I didn't do much for cleaning.... but this is related to a simple errand because...?

This kind of thing happens often, and you'd expect me to know how to work around it. But there are things I consider when I speak to him. By this point in his life, he feels he stands above everyone because he is doing really well in school. And I'm impressed, myself. he made the Dean's list, he has an internship, and he is in a major that quite advanced. But his ego is what bothers me to no end. He thinks he is right in every aspect just because he does well in school and and has good grades. Well, then I guess I am wrong in every way to lend him $400 due to a stupid sequence of transactions he's done that could have resulted in a major overdraft. And this was for a tablet that he doesn't use very much at all. And it seems wrong for me to ask for it back because I don't desperately need it at the time of asking. Keeping your money balance in good standing is bad for you. I never knew that!

He's just like our parents. Always picking at something that may not relate to the current problem, but is true in it own right."" Loss of money but it isn't your fault? Should have been more physically fit. Really busy? Well I'm doing better than you in my academics. Your car, which I was driving at the time, got 2 tickets? Well that police officer was an asshole and your paying for it because I wasn't my intention to get such tickets."" But what do I do? I just bite my tongue. This would mean he's taking advantage of my passive nature, but I'm considering what would happen. He would just be stubborn and not do anything for you. This is so annoying. It makes me question more how he even gets a girlfriend at all. Not that I'm aiming to have a partner right now, but there's so many things that stress me out about it.

This is the guy that denied me the chance to see a tour at an art school when I was almost out of high school. I never decided to go because he never wanted to help me with it. Comes back 3 years later, sees me drawing like I have great passion and suddenly asks me if I want to consider going when I'm already 2 years into a different school  and taking out student loans. He's done so much to me. I don't know what to think of him.

PS: That part with the tickets is real. He drove my car out somewhere to get food and gets 2 tickets($56 each) and doesn't pay for any of it at all. Even makes a facebook post about and claims as if he would contribute to the payment. I even made a Reddit post about it, but people that I was desperately trying to get karma. =3=

**TL;DR: My brother is a stubborn bastard**"

2z7qk4,3,2015-03-16,"I think I'm depressed. I won't take medication, thank you. I won't go to therapy. I'm sinking at the worst possible time.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2z7qk4/i_think_im_depressed_i_wont_take_medication_thank/,"I'm 30 and I'm at the lowest I've been since 2007. Why 2007? Because around that time I lost my job and got into couple of nasty fights with my friends back then, and I was still living with my parents. I was staying in my room the entire day and night, barely went out, barely spoke to anyone, my parents kinda let me do it. I did it for almost a year, got my shit together and moved out of the house.

Found a girlfriend, moved to a new town, job was great, money was good, things looked good. And then I lost my job, and things started to go downhill from there.

When I lost my job, I thought I had another one lined up (big mistake) with an acquaintance of mine near my folks house. So I decided that me and my GF move to my folks house until the job starts and I start making money. The job didn't start and after couple of months my GF and me decided to move to another town to start looking for jobs for both of us. But while we were staying at my parents house, my mom didn't like the idea of us living there, but that was not completely our problem.

She also had (still has) a problem with my father, who lives in a room and basically never goes out, because they are basically divorced by all means except legally. So in their house that they built, my father decided to ""crawl"" to his work room with a bed, and my mom uses the rest of the house. Don't ask, it's bizzare and pathetic.

So my GF and me decided to move. Her aunt rented an apartment, so we decided to rent from her. I landed a job in my niche, but they pay really low (half as my previous job). My GF still doesn't know what exactly she wants to do in life so she decided to finish her school internship, even though she doesn't want to work as a teacher.


Her family is extremely passive and victim mentality like. They came to visit couple of days ago and I'm really getting nervous thinking will my GF turn out like her mom one day. It's complaining, but not complaining in a ""entertaining"" way, rather self pity way, sort of ""eh what can you do we don't deserve better"" - for every single thing. It's annoying. I want to respect elders and her family but it's hard listening to someone who lived for 50+ years and has nothing but pity for himself and can't see anything positive anywhere. 

Also, none of them are interested in anything outside the ordinary, and believe me, their ordinary is extreme ordinary. I think if I suggested that we visit a museum they would turn it down making some kind of cringe remark about ""paintings"" and ticket price or whatever.

All of this worries me. I'm with my GF for 5 years. We didn't progress in financial way at all. We didn't get married because I don't want marriage, and my excuse is - my parents. 

I feel stranded and disillusioned with my future. I don't know if I want to be in a relationship like this. Couple of years ago, hell yes I wanted to be. I look back on my damn facebook, I regularly updated my wall with activities my GF and me did, even posted statuses like ""i love my life"".....damn. Nowadays I don't post nothing, I don't want anyone to notice me and I don't want anyone to know what am I doing in life. Because I'm not doing anything. I know money isn't everything...but it kinda is. All of this can be tied to money in some way.

I wake up with ""here we go again"" thoughts, I curse myself when I park my car in front of the company, yet I can't quit the job because I don't have any money to live without this income. I'm trapped, basically. And when you're trapped, you can't help but to think all of these dark thoughts. I want to escape. I want to quit my job and pursue my passion, what does it matter anyway, I've been doing the 9-5 for past 5 years and I didn't achieve anything.

2z7tq9,131,2015-03-16,[M]y Office MIL[F] experience,bignaughty28,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2z7tq9/my_office_milf_experience/,"A little background: I'm 26, tall, decent looking half-Indian guy, who went to college around Philly. I know everyone thinks all the stories here are fake, so I am keeping it as honest and detailed as possible. A few years ago, after my junior year of college, I had an internship in the city. 

There was a pretty hot receptionist/admin lady at this firm, let's call her Rachel, who helped us with our paperwork and general stuff around the office. She was about 28-30, blonde shortish hair, 5'5 or so, with a great ass and big B cups. Not exactly an hourglass figure, but not too far off either, and very friendly. As a 20 year old, I never really thought I had a chance, and though we flirted and talked a little bit, nothing really happened apart from smoking together with other people a couple of times. 

I actually became FWBs with one of the other interns, finished the internship and went back to school. More than a year later, after graduating, I was working at a different place in the city and went out for after-work drinks with a few colleagues. We had knocked back a few cocktails when I see Rachel and a couple of her friends come into the bar. 

It is pretty crowded at this point, and they are waiting for the bar pretty close to our table, so I go over and say Hi to her. She was wearing a black dress that made her look pretty curvy, and we began talking. She recently had quit the place where I had interned, and was working Admin at another place close by. I was drunk and a little over-familiar, asking about colleagues we both knew and so on and asking her to come join our table. 

After getting drinks, they come and start talking to some of us. One of her friends knows a girl from my office and everyone is getting along great. Rachel sat at the other end of the table from me and I tried not to act disappointed, telling myself it was stupid to think she would be interested in a 21 year old. When some other people get up to get drinks, she comes and sits next to me, and we keep talking. 

I am wondering whether she was just friendly or whether I should make a move, and pretty drunk at this point, so when the colleagues close to us are absorbed in the conversation, I decide to go for it. Embarrassingly enough, the best I can think of is 'I don't want to be weird, but I always thought you were so hot', and after drunkenly blurting it out, I am terrified she is going to just get up and walk away. Instead she laughs and says thank you, then brazenly asks why I didn't do anything about it. I look around but nobody at the table is too focused on us, and my tongue is absolutely in knots.

I mumble something incoherent and she puts her hand on my pants and starts stroking through the fabric, all the while staring at me. I guess I must have smiled because she did too, and I put my hand on her thigh and started moving upward, careful to pretend we were still in conversation and make sure nobody saw. After a minute of this, she whispers into my ear saying 'I'm gonna go to the bathroom then walk outside, come out in a minute.' 

So she leaves me sitting there with almost a full hard-on, shocked and  tipsy, wondering if this is some grand prank or dream. I calm myself and make some excuse about a cigarette, literally counting the seconds, then go outside, half expecting her to have changed her mind or disappeared. But there she is outside, and she pulls my hand and gets us to a cab at the corner. She asks if I have a place and I say yes, about 10 blocks away, so I tell the guy where to go. 

In my head I'm a little worried that people maybe chilling with my roommate or at my apartment, but he had planned to go out, and anyway Rachel started kissing me in the cab so I stopped thinking about it. We got to my place and sat down on my bed, kissing furiously. She unbuckled my pants and started stroking through my boxers, while my hands roamed all over her body. 

The boxers came off and she put her mouth around my cock, bobbing up and down then teasing me with her tongue. I thought I was going to come in a micro-second, so after a couple of minutes I pushed her onto the bed, pulled down her panties, pushed up her dress and started eating her out. I could feel her wetness on my tongue, and I kept flicking in and out till her moans got louder and my cock recovered a little. Then I turned around so that my cock was above her face, and she sucked as I went down again, both  of us almost shaking. 

After a couple of minutes of this, she pushes me around and says I want your dick in me. I am lying down now, her hand on my chest, and she turns and climbs on to my hard cock, slipping on a condom I hand her and sliding it inside her easily. She takes off her dress in one smooth motion and then pulls at my shirt and takes it off while slowly riding me. She pushes me down again and goes faster and faster, moaning and getting wetter. I am trying my best not to come instantly, and somehow manage for a few minutes while she rides me till she starts coming. I breathe heavily and tell her I am going to come soon. 

She slides off me, wetter than a water park, then turns and bends over, pulling my cock into her doggy style. I barely last six thrusts and blast inside her, grabbing her ass while my cock shakes uncontrollably. She moans and keeps fucking back after I have come, and I think she came again as I finally pulled out and went soft. 

Already this was amongst the best sex I ever had, and after cleaning up a little and smoking a bowl, I thought she would want to leave, since I remembered she was a single mom with a 2 or 3 year old. Instead she starts kissing me again and says 'I want you without a condom', and we go at it again, fucking twice till I finally dropped her home 3 hours later. We hooked up a couple of times that month, and then I went to New York and we fell out of touch, but it was definitely one of my favourite affairs. "

It was day one at an internship, I was with an mentor and she showed me around at work. The pace was frantic and I felt that I couldn't keep up. 

I have always been shy and introverted, always preferred to spend time in the comfort of a computer. As someone who is ~~a little bit~~ anti-social, I am wondering, what are some social challenges that interns and junior developers should be expected to face? How would this differ in a small vs medium vs large company?

2z88gm,3,2015-03-16,I'm completely unsatisfied with who I am as a person. My life is a joke.,whynoteeeh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2z88gm/im_completely_unsatisfied_with_who_i_am_as_a/,"I'm turning 24 in two days and I'm just reflecting a little. Thought I'd write this up, give you a window into someone's deepest thoughts about themselves, thoughts that never come out.

I never thought this is what my life would be like when I was younger. I've had a bad time during every period of my life so far from my tweens, to teens, and now college and the post-college phase. I feel so unmotivated, without aspirations, and completely apathetic. I'm so undeveloped as a human being and there's so much I'll never be able to do, however what's sad is every aspect of my life is currently unfulfilling and my past is even worse.

**School:**

 3.4 gpa from a mediocre state school coming up on SIX FUCKING YEARS finishing my degree spent wasting time and flipflopping between bullshit. I should have had this degree two years ago and I'm not even done yet. Currently taking too many classes(to finish faster) and having difficulty keeping up.

I'm so incredibly burnt out I just want to quit everything. It's the last stretch but this has been the longest marathon of my life. I can't believe I'm such an idiot that it took me this long to even get this far in my degree. Much stupider people have got their degrees in less time. I could have had a career, an adult life, and a real job and my own apartment in these two years I wasted.

Everyone seems to have a normal life, my life is fucked up in all sorts of ways and I don't know how to fix it.

**Work:**

Sent out 30+ applications for an internship in my field(very competitive) and heard nothing. Got a phone call from one firm and didn't even get past the phone interview.  My future career is likely doomed as I'm not competitive enough to do anything really great in my field and the lack of internship before I graduate will make it very difficult to apply to anything worthwhile.

inner feelings: I have lower inner self esteem, low self confidence, a huge inferiority complex. Constantly lowest on the totem poll social hierarchy. In guy groups guys don't respect me or listen to me. I'm not a leader. I'm not a decider, and people often overlook what I have to say. In social groups I have this feeling that people just don't like me, despite me being social, friendly, and extroverted, well dressed, etc. I'm not sure if this feeling is even true since everyone treats me fine.

I constantly feel this weird existential loneliness, whether I am alone or not. I don't know what will solve it. I'm very unmotivated when it comes to any tasks I have to do and I can't will myself to do things sometimes. I don't like the person that I am but there are things about me I can't change because they've been shaped by my previous experiences. I don't feel like a man. I feel like a boy. I haven't turned into an adult yet and I'm almost 1/3 through my way in life.

I generally can't sleep. I go to school with 24+ hours of no sleep and try to power through it before collapsing in my car.

**Body**

 My height's good, my face is average but I've come to terms with it. One thing I cannot though is, from the neck down my body is that of someone who looks like they do heroine. just incredibly thin and weak. I'm so weak, so frail. I hate my body so much. This doesn't bother me as much as the fact that my ""frame"" is very small, so even when gaining muscle I look tiny compared to REAL men, with broad shoulders, manly hands, huge forearms and wrists. I was one described as narrow. I'm tall but narrow. My shoulders are non existent. 

I hate my body and it's a constant source of issues for me. I never wear t shirts. I don't go swimming. Men don't respect me as much and women think I'm weak, feminine, and not masculine for it. I don't feel like a masculine guy and it makes me sad.

**Social life**

 I'm quite extroverted but have always had trouble making any friends. People think I'm cool, assume I have tons of friends and girls are flirting with me all the time. This is what many people who talk to me believe but I only have two friends and no real social life, and the general join clubs in school advice only gives you more acquaintances, which I have. I don't have anyone that invites me to places or gives me an ""in"" into their group. I usually feel lonley, I don't have any deep connection to anyone in my life. I'm not very close with my family. And the worst one is I'm very distant from one of my siblings.

I've always wanted to be close to my brother and have a ""big bro"" to hang out with and talk about things. Friends can betray you but brothers are forever...and I don't have that unfortunately. It's very lonley because I don't feel I have someone I can confide in. I'm very distant from all my family and spend most of the time alone.

**Love life**

date lots of girls from tinder, 90% of them disappear before we even meet, always repeating the same thing, text someone, be charming and witty, try to set something up with 10 different girls due to the high amount of flaking you will experience. only 1 ends up going through. they constantly waste my time and distract me from important things. i dont even want to have sex, just someone to talk to and hang out with because i'm lonely. it's always the same thing. go on a coffee date, rinse and repeat. 90% of the time I instantly realize I wasted my time due to no physical attraction. i get laid occasionally, generally unsatisfied and very lonely in my love life, don't enjoy the sex and can no longer hookup. Usually it's with people I don't like. With girls I like I've found that if I do not have sex with a girl on the first date she never bothers to see me again so I'm pressured into doing it, it's disappointing. I've yet to find love, or have a real relationship. My love life is frustrating, women constantly flake, it's constantly an uphill effort to go on a date, constantly an uphill effort to keep in touch, constantly an uphill effort to get date two. At the same time I have some women that become obsessed with me, unfortunately we're usually in different places in life and they're not physically my type or have red flag/emotional issues(ha yes ironic but i already have enough inner turmoil to deal with myself don't need someone else's). I have a huge difficulty becoming attracted to people and being enamored and I'm not sure why or what's wrong. with women i feel like a dog chasing a bag caught in an updraft that's going no where.

**money:**

broke as fuck, constantly, at 24 I still live with my parents and this is embarrassing. Money is a huge issue and one of my biggest gripes. I come from a poor background and it's embarrassing. My car is a POS especially when at my age most men have ""got their shit together"" and have nice cars and live alone. On dates women constantly wanna ""come over"" to hang out but I can't because I don't have my own place. I've lost a few girls I might have potentially had relationships with because I didn't have my own place.

**Life experience:**

there's so little life experience I've had compared to people my age. I've never traveled anywhere or most of the things people do in their 20s to have fun(which is too late now). I spent most of my early 20s at home doing nothing because I have no money, friends, or any in my life.

**future:**

 I don't think anything will change much. I will likely graduate, get a very mediocre job, continue to hate my job, and have even LESS of a social life because I no longer go to college. Have no aspirations, no hobbies, and nothing to look forward too. 

I'll probably off myself late 20's or early 30's to be honest.

It's almost time for class and I haven't slept in over 20 hours. No one will read this and it will probably sink faster than a rock. At least I got it off my chest. Night reddit. You're my only friend."

I have been trudging along in the journey of weight loss since December 2014 and I've been doing great so far. Binge sober for 3 months, tracked everything I put in my mouth for 20 days (before I was not very good at counting everything) I went from 260 to 236 as my current weight hoping to get to 150 someday.

My SO is a sweet, hardworking man who has a full time job, full time school, and an unpaid internship. He comes home at the end of the night with pizza and beer and mozzarella sticks. I can skip Pizza and beer but my god do I want those fucking mozzarella sticks. I told him its really hard for me when he brings this stuff in the house, I even cook a full healthy meal when I get home from my two jobs but he insists he needs this food to relieve stress. He is what I like to call ""skinny-fat"" he weighs less than me but he eats horrible food in copious amounts. The first few weeks he was doing this I just went in the bedroom and pretended there was no food but last night I ate 2 sticks... I tracked them but they put me over for the day. I'm angry with myself but I'll get over it.

My question is how do other people handle it when this happens. Should I just go for a walk until he's finished? Should I just distract myself? What else can I do?

Tl;Dr: My willpower is no match for mozzarella sticks, need help with SO"

I'm married with 2 kids and am a full time student who graduates this May. I'm also an intern who can only work up to 19 hours a week. I've blown through more than half of my student loans while lying to my wife about it even though we need it badly for bills right now seeing as her hours have been cut.

This has been my latest problem. I went through a manic period over the last month where I did the following:

* Bought a MacBook Air on craigslist
* Bought a Mac Mini through a local computer  dealer for $100 more than retail.
* Sold both on eBay to get money to buy a MacBook Pro
* Bought MacBook Pro on Amazon to resell on eBay to get advance on money to drive to Memphis in bad weather to get a MacBook Pro.
* Bought MacBook Pro with advance.
* Drove to a Best Buy 2 hours away in a snow storm to return * MacBook Pro towards the highest end MacBook Pro.
* Bought that and an iMac
* Sold the highest end MacBook Pro on eBay with AppleCare while taking a loss in money.
* Bought the newer 13"" Retina Pro released last week.
* Returned iMac

I sold my build pc to begin this journey and lied about how much I sold it for. My wife called me out on all this, and I felt awful after my manic phase went away. Now, I've lost her trust and even my own. What can I do? I'm medicated, but I still screw up all the time.

When I was just an intern here last summer, we visited a few prisons, touring everything from boiler rooms to vacant hospitals to cells.

Something of interest to you guys:  The electric grid in some of the prisons is still being run to a certain extent by old Compaq Desktops with Windows 95.  They are used mainly to direct/observe the older boilers used to heat/cool some of the prisons that haven't been updated or were built in the mid-late 1990's (Kitchens and Maintenance buildings mostly).  They are also used to direct or change the output of some of the old diesel generators that are used for backups.

It was weird (and a little worrisome) to see Windows 95 still being used in the prison system- but hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
2z8isw,15,2015-03-16,"I'm getting close to visiting 100 NP sites this year, and I always take a moment to ask the staff there how they got their jobs....",robster644,ParkRangers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkRangers/comments/2z8isw/im_getting_close_to_visiting_100_np_sites_this/,"Good morning,

Since May of last year, I have been in and out of National Parks, Monuments, and other sites run by the NPS, which has made more curious about working for the NPS. Before I graduated from university in May 2011, I was set on working for the NPS in some fashion (I remember creating a career portfolio for Rangers in one of my classes). Life has taken me on different paths over the last 4 years, and I love the work I do now, but I could still definitely see myself working for the NPS sometime. To better prepare myself in terms of starting a NPS career, I always (ALWAYS) talk to the people working at NPS sites when I visit places, and gauging their own entrances into their NPS careers. The responses are generally unique, but here is what I have found that is most relative to my situation (for reference, I am 25, male, white, non-veteran, BA (History) degree holder, with 6-7 years guiding/interpretation experience):

* I met a woman at Saguaro NP who said she got her job (front desk) by volunteering for a year before being brought on full-time. This was all at Saguaro, as she is a permanent resident of Tucson AZ.

* I met a ranger (interp) at Lassen Volcano who told me he got the position from interning in college and bounced around at different parks for three years before landing a permanent gig in Lassen. He was 30, if I recall.

* I met a fellow at Manzanitas National Monument (Florida) who told me how he worked for Aramark in the Grand Canyon and was able to network his way in as a Ranger working in Interpretation. He was 7 years in the job. No degree, pure networking.

* At Fort Frederica in Georgia, I met an SCA intern who was running the front desk. She was 24 and worked there with her boyfriend, another intern. She was a biology degree holder focused on conservation, and her plan was to (try) get hired full-time by the NPS somewhere.

* At Fort Union in New Mexico, I met a dude my age who also had a History degree who had been working at that location for a year and was waiting for relocation. He was a year younger than me and was hired right out of college. I related most to him in terms of professional backgrounds, but loathed the idea of living and working at Fort Union. This is probably the place Walter White made Meth..... Middle of nowhere New Mexico.....

* Up in Olympia National Park, I met a young woman (28-31 years old?) who worked the front desk of an information center. She was hired on, I believe from what I could tell, because of her ethnic background (she had native blood) and her networking with the people in the area. This led me to believe that Olympia, for one reason or another, might be understaffed, as she seemed to try to describe to me how the job 'fell in her lap'.

* At Sunset Crater NM outside of Flagstaff, I met a young woman who was a History major from California (She told me she was from California at least 10 times) working as an SCA intern. She was working the front desk, collecting fees. Her plans were to work for the NPS full-time in some fashion.

* And lastly, I met a ranger up at the Statue of Liberty who was taking tickets. He got his position by interning in college, and had a degree in Forestry. He was collecting fees.

That's been my experience so far and what I've been able to learn from how people got jobs with the NPS and what their jobs actually are. Personally, I seemed to be attracted more the work involved with the SCA at Frederica  - conservation, preservation, education sort of work.  The other positions were more fee collecting, front desk work, which is fine, but is not work I am necessarily attracted to. Today, I am headed up to Charleston SC to visit Fort Sumter and Charles Pickney NHS. I'll try and learn from the Rangers there what their work is.

I made this post just to illustrate what people have done to start their careers with the NPS. If you have spoken with other NPS people about how they have started their careers, please share here. If you do currently work for the NPS, please share how you got started here. I'd love to hear! 

Thanks all."

Would a team be better off doing X as opposed to Y? anything along these lines) and I'll do my best to answer it. 

Like I said, I'm bored and need a project to do so I see this as a cool way for me to keep writing and you can get some questions answered. I'm a big numbers/stats guy so that's why I prefer the focus of your questions to be based in that idea. 

Also am taking suggestions for a site/blog title for this. I'm thinking ""how to get a number."" Kind of like how to get a hook-up's number at the bar? Idk...

2z8qhb,1,2015-03-16,"How do I ""Weight By..."" (SPSS function) from R?",thisfunnieguy,rstats,https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/2z8qhb/how_do_i_weight_by_spss_function_from_r/,"***SOLVED... kinda***
so, i didn't find an exact function/package to make it right, but I thought about what /u/jeremymiles said about these being frequency numbers.... and so I found a dumber way to get the calculations. I subsetted the data based on the Likert values I needed and then I ran a sum(X)/sum(all) function where X is the subset and all is the sum of all the weights. ... and the numbers checked out.

I'm absolutely aware that this is ugly code... but I get what the weights are doing and I can think about optimizing it with other things I know in R. 

-----------------------------------------------


My boss asked me to help look at some survey data, but they don't have an extra SPSS or STATA license to run on my computer.... so they can't show me how to do this from my setup.

I know in SPSS there's a ""Weight by..."" option, and you choose the column with the weights and *poof* ... then you do all your calculations. 

I'm trying to figure out how to do this from R, and I've been reading the Weights package and Survey package.

The first calculation I need to run is from a Likert scale column and my WEIGHT vector has these large numbers:
121958 
125463  
99638 
125463 
102539 
181061 
126367 
125463  

The only other time I've done this was when I took a stats test as part of the interview process, and they let me use SPSS and then I just applied the weights...I don't remember how, but I feel like the Likert analysis was a lot easier on SPSS too. They want (as a %) Very and Extremely / the total responses....

It's not helping that I'm furious about this internship. My boss made it sound like they were doing me a favor by actually letting me try and do something with the data, but they have no idea how to program in R and they don't have any open seats with SPSS or STATA, which they know how to use... so they can't actually give me any direction about how to accomplish this. 

**EDIT**
I saw this on Stack Overflow, but even while looking at the xtabs help files I can't find a way to apply that to my data file. I'm getting an error; *Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'weight' not found*

&gt;In SPSS I would write

    WEIGHT BY weight. 
&gt;and all procedures after that command will weight the data accordingly.

&gt;In R I can do that with stabs with the command

    xtabs(weight ~ UH6401, data=df)

2z8skq,0,2015-03-16,Career Advice: Prospects/Options for a Cash Accountant,kondoleon,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2z8skq/career_advice_prospectsoptions_for_a_cash/,"Hi all.  I've been a cash accountant at a commodities trading firm for about six months now.  This is my first non-internship position (I have 2 Summer internships under my belt), and this is my first permanent position out of college.  Problem is, I'm not a fan of it and I'm not really seeing any internal opportunities to grow here.

The position exists because one of my coworkers (a senior accountant) is going on maternity leave any day now, and I've been training to take over her responsibilities when she pops while continuing my daily roles of AP/AR clerk stuff, Bank recs, balance confirms, and other monthly closing shenanigans.

I feel like I'm not working towards anything.  This whole maternity leave situation is as if I'm getting a temporary promotion sans pay increase that I've been told will just revert to my usual daily tasks when she gets back in a few months.

More about me: Accounting degree with a minor in Information Systems, poor GPA due to some personal issues in college (2.8 in accounting 3.3 overall, but a 3.7 in IS), no certifications.

I'm looking for some advice on the sorts of things I could be working towards with my background and interests.  I majored in accounting for the job opportunities, minored in IS because it's interesting to me and I'm good at it, and would ideally love to work somewhere where I can be involved in financial markets.  The non-trade devision of a commodities trading firm just isn't doing it for me...

Do you have any advice about jobs to look out for?  Certifications/grad degrees I should think about?  With so many options out there I need a little focus.

Thanks in advance!"
2z8uwv,106,2015-03-16,I [29F] have a coworker [45M]who is so insane at times reporting it actually makes me look insane too.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2z8uwv/i_29f_have_a_coworker_45mwho_is_so_insane_at/,"He has been reported before and I have been told to say if he behaves unprofessionally again but the things I have to report sound so ludicrous I don't think I come off as believable and am sure reporting will make me look like a 'complainer'.


The quality of his work has been unacceptably subpar in the past and it was decided the last time there was an issue with it that appropriate level jobs would be chosen for him and then my boss would sit down and work out with him how to approach them so that he could build up his skills safely without messing up important projects. My boss is in only two days a week and in between those times for awhile he would ask me to pick up some jobs for him when I got my own, this worked good as I could pick out lower level skill ones for when my boss wasn't there to sit down with him and my boss was happy with this too.


Unfortunately my coworker just stopped asking me for jobs a few weeks ago and while I assumed my boss was just assigning him enough for the week and he didn't need jobs from me this is not the case, the case is actually that no one explicitly told him of the plan for someone to always assign work to him and he has just been choosing his own jobs and doing them how he sees fit. I am not his supervisor and it could be he was told to do this, I will mention to my boss but it is an awkward and delicate situation.


In the meantime I did need to tell him that the file which he is using to choose jobs and mark them as done was updated by me last year. I have an electronic form and have not done a hardcopy yet as previously it was only me who was using it. I told him this and that I would give him the new hardcopy and he acted very defensive and basically said 'well you do it your way and I will do it mine'.

This is not an option, there needs to be one file which we choose jobs from and mark them done, obviously if we are going to keep an accurate record.


I waited a few days till he next needed new jobs to give him the new file because he reacted so badly when I first mentioned it (a lot of my job now entails waiting and planning to tackle things in a way that won't antagonize him). 


When I did give it to him he kept asking me aggressively if that meant I thought he did something wrong. I said no, I just worked quite hard to make this system easier and more efficient and it would be a shame if he did not get to benefit from it too. He said 'oh so you say I am shameful?! I see now: I am SO ashamed'.


I was patient with him and ignored his bizarre twisting of words, I went through the filing system with him several times and explained why I had done it several times because he was apparently vehemently apposed to the whole thing. He asked if I would save the old file as he needed it, I said of course and also spent a half hour marking his things into the new file so that there would be no inconvenience to him, I finished and said right, it is all in order, here is the old one and you can continue to use that if you wish but please just tick off jobs you do on the new one. He refused and argued for another 10 minutes about why he shouldn't have to.


I asked why when it will take two seconds and said if he is really not going to then he must tell me and I will continue to make note of the jobs he does and mark them on the new file as I have been doing in the past. He then followed me around the office ranting at me, first that my filing system was wrong or unnecessary, how I was belittling the work of the people who made the previous system (both he and my boss complained the previous system was unworkeable, that is why only I was using it, I spent quite a lot of time making it easier for them and also kept them both updated about what I was doing which he has conveniently forgotten).


When I reminded him of these he changed tack and said I approached him wrong...I spent several days thinking of how to approach him because of his touchy nature, when I did I was extremely careful to be polite...he said I shoved it down his throat and then said that I was offensive and called him ignorant for not using it. That is a flat out lie and even he couldn't keep it up when I said wow! I said THAT?! 


He kept ranting at me and I told him repeatedly that I would like to get back to work now and felt we were not getting anywhere productive with his 'talk'. I said if he had anything further to say he could write me a letter detailing his concerns but I would like to get back to work...he followed me around the office talking at me, in turns ranting and then cajoling about how I was bad and rude to him but if only I was politer he wouldn't have a problem.


I honestly think this guy is trying to gaslight me and emotionally abuse me. I sent an email to my big boss about it as she asked before but she found it hard to follow and told me to meet her on thursday to discuss it. 


He has been like this and worse to work with for two years now with lulling periods in between where is is nice. My big boss has told me not to bother HR but I feel like I should not be asked to work in such an unprofessional environment and the action from my big boss side is not satisfactory. I do not think I need a thicker skin as she advises, my coworker is hugely unprofessional and makes normal work interaction unnecessarily difficult.


Certain things he has said about conflicts he has had with other coworkers and other general things he has said have led me to believe he comes to very odd 'logical' conclusions. 


Such as him telling me a conference we planned to go to was cancelled by work because the hotel would only allow them to get a good price if they booked 20 people. And that they wouldn't fork out the extra money for him because of racial reasons and they don't think he is worth it. I was shocked and outraged by this but when I checked with the secretary she told me the whole conference was going to be cancelled due to no attendees and they  needed 20 attendees to make it worthwhile...he just didn't listen properly and jumped to his own warped conclusions. He also ranted to me recently about government funding internships but how the interns were not guaranteed a job afterwards. I tried to explain that an internship is experience and an opportunity to prove your worth and hope to get hired but he was having none of it.


The guy is on a personal crusade to right what he sees as multiple slights per day but his reasoning is cracked.

I don't know how to stand up for my own rights in this situation in a way that actually makes any change happen at all. help.

tldr: insane coworker makes work impossible and seems to want to feel slighted and create an argument. I think he may just be a dick but don't know how to make the situation better."

2z948q,2,2015-03-16,My love life is weird and sad,squiggly-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2z948q/my_love_life_is_weird_and_sad/,"**Warning: Long post. Tl;dr at the bottom**

Brief background: I am a 22 year old guy. My last relationship was three years ago and lasted for only two months. Since then I've dated a few people but never past the second date. I'm now in my final year of university and as such I don't meet many new people because my social life revolves around the friends I've made in the past three years.

So out of a combination of boredom, loneliness and frustration (and at the suggestion of a couple of friends) I turned to the internet. I made an OKCupid account last summer and gave it my best shot for a couple of months while I was working a summer internship. On the whole I found the experience quite demoralising - as a guy you send out far more messages than you get replies to, and most of the dates I went on were quite bad. Again I never made it past second date with anyone. When I returned to university I decided to deactivate my account and focus on studying (and maybe let any rl relationships just happen naturally).

Well back in January I got bored again and reactivated my account. I didn't send out any messages, just used it to click through profiles on boring evenings. One or two people messaged me, and I even went on a date with one, but my heart wasn't in it.

One fun thing to do on OKCupid (and if you've ever used the website you've probably done this at some point) is to remove all restrictions on location to find out who, in the entire world, is your best match according to the quiz questions (OKC uses hundreds of questions and a complex algorithm to calculate match % between people). So I did this a few days ago out of boredom, and this time also removed all age restrictions too just to see if it made a difference (most of my matches were pretty close to my age or a few years older, so not really).

Anyway the next day I wake up to a message from one of the profiles I'd visited. It wasn't a very special message, just a response to something from my profile, but I replied back and we had a conversation, with a little flirtation. After a while she suggests we move to an IM app and I said yes, and the next day (Friday) we spoke for hours, staying up until dawn talking about all sorts of things. It turns out we had a lot in common and agreed on many issues - proof that the OKC algorithm isn't total bullshit, because we matched 99%. And we flirted some more and talked a lot about sex.

The next day (Saturday) was the same, we spoke for a long time staying up until dawn again. This time the conversation became more personal, we both opened up about some fairly intimate and emotional things. I shared stuff with her that I haven't told a lot of my closest friends. This time there was even more flirtation and conversations about sex, and it was clear we were very attracted to each other both physically and emotionally. Same thing happened again yesterday - up until dawn (even though it was Sunday night and we said we wouldn't). At this point we both admit we're starting to fall for each other.

But here's the thing. We can't easily meet up because she lives 300km away in Brussels (I live in London). Not only that but she's 34 - twelve years older than me. We've spoken about the age gap and on a surface level it doesn't bother us (our parents both have a similar age gap) but we also recognise that it's a potential problem. Of course it's a moot point because of the distance. Neither of us is interested in the other *because* of our age - I don't have an ""older woman"" fetish and the oldest I've dated was only a year older than me. It's just a thing that's happened. This is the closest I've felt to anyone in a very long time, and her unattainability is breaking my heart.

But wait, it gets better. I like to talk to people from around the world - it's interesting to have friends in other countries. As such I occasionally befriend people from the internet. A month or two ago I met an American girl on Omegle and we IM and Skype fairly regularly. We have a decent amount in common and I like her platonically, but she's not really my ""type"".

Anyway she messaged me at 5am (my time) last night - I was still up talking to my Belgian friend, so I replied straight away. There was clearly something on her mind so I encouraged her to tell me, and she admitted to having feelings for me. I told her any guy would be lucky to have her, but I'm too far away to be worth bothering with. I felt like such a hypocrite! Saying that to her, and then myself chasing after another distant foreigner. But I wanted to spare her feelings because I like her, but I don't feel the same way.

Anyway I had to say all of this to the internet because my friends would look at me like I'm crazy. What am I even doing spending my time talking to foreigners on the internet? The most frustrating thing is that I get *none* of this attention from women in real life. I've never had to reject a girl in my life (I did reject a guy once though).

Has anyone else ever had a similar experience? What did you do? Is it crazy for me to think about ways to move to Belgium? How do you tell a girl you don't reciprocate her feelings, and then stay friends with her? This is all new ground to me and it's all happened so suddenly.

**TL;DR: My life is like a virtual sitcom. I (22 year old British guy) have fallen hard for a 34 year old Belgian girl I've never met. I've also had to reject an American girl I've never met. This is a completely new experience and it's messing with my head.**

EDIT: I spoke to the American girl. Seems like we're okay. Time will tell if we can maintain the same friendship as before."

2z9tfq,2,2015-03-16,I need help please,youstay123,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2z9tfq/i_need_help_please/,"I don't have any real friends right now, any real friend I had I let gradually slip out of their life.  I'm only 21, male, but I feel so old.  I'm just so fucking different from everyone around me.  My life views, my life struggles, my life goals, all so fucking different.  This should be interesting if I can word it right (which I can't i'm bad at conveying thoughts in an interesting manner), and it will probably make you feel better about your life.  But I would honestly appreciate some help from someone older than me as to what I should be doing.

Let's start with I have asian flush, if I drink enough to get drunk I'll get a splitting unbearable migraine.  As you might imagine, college is just great, I go to an SEC school but I was never raised on football and the one time I tried tailgating the combination of intense sun and beer got me migraine sick in 20 minutes.  I hardly know anyone on my 20,000 person campus because of it and I prefer drinking alone at my slow rate.

So I miss out on most everything fun my peers are doing, but I'm also smart enough to not give it too much thought, it's just annoying when I try to network when I have literally nothing in common day to day with another person other than the fact that we people on this beautiful planet.  

Life fucked me.  Asian flush is my biggest hatred right now (because college and drinking) but I also have some type of IBS-chrons which helped keep me socially outcast in high school.  After eating (whatever trash the cafeteria served) I usually would get intense cramps and gas which I would hold in because I was embarrassed.  So talking to people was hard because I was concentrating on my bowels.  This also meant I would decline lots of invitations to hang out or w/e because I was cramping.
Lets not stop there though, I also have a prostate problem (at 21 years old..........).   So I don't piss regularly, I don't shit regularly, and I can't fucking drown my sorrows in alcohol.

Life gave me some good tradeoffs (thank the lord)
I am filthy smart (book/logic smart) and I know it, I am typically the first one done on exams that I studied an hour before the test for, I made the highest grade in physics, in the engineering department, in the school, and I just get concepts much quicker than the average in general.  So I understand things are what they are, I can't be upset that I was born with problems and raised with awkwardness, I can't judge others for not understanding without knowing, and most importantly I understand how to enjoy life in my spare time.  

On enjoying life, that's where all my problems lie.  I go through phases of hobbies.  Drawing, reading, piano, guitar, video games, 3d modelling and animation, graphic design, video design, woodcraft, legos, tennis, you name it.  I love doing things, I loveeeeee my hobbies.  Right now I'm putting all my attention towards music but that will change once I finish this project.  

The problem comes in because there are other things I have to do like find an internship and do homework and make friends.  But I want to put all my time into my hobbies.  I hate wasting time, I need to be efficient, I need to spent every second I can working on my craft.  It sucks because I ignore people to work on this shit.  My roommates (only close friends) just smoke all day and watch tv.  The only reason theyre my friends is because I'm terrible at making and keeping friends and I've known them for 8 years.  

I was always socially awkward, I played with legos until I couldn't hide the fact that I played with legos anymore (17 years old), and I always was a step behind in understanding the true nature of the conversation.  I've really grown up a lot but I still fumble my way through conversation.  (and when I'm high I'm basically mute so I know I gotta cut the shit out).  

So I know that was sporadic and all over the place.  I'll try to streamline it right here though, that was all just background info.  This is the tl;dr.  

I graduate in a year, and I havent found a summer internship yet because I was lazy.  I need to start networking but I can't justify spending time away from my hobbies and myself when I know that I'll be working every day in just a year.  I need to start making friends because I don't know anybody and I don't know how to not be awkward, but once again I always am drawn back to my hobbies.  And I can't really relate to people because I am very, very boring (all I do are my hobbies...).  

How do I start justifying making friends and doing things?  I feel like I'm in an endless loop and that I've wasted my college years.  :( mostly I'm just sad a lot of the time when I think of my life and the future.  I really don't want to work, I just want to inherit a lot of money so I can do my own things."

Basically, they determined that they were going to out me to my extended family next week no matter what. 

So this was really the last straw for me. My parents are generally very pleasant but they're toxic when it comes to trans issues. I can't imagine transitioning in that environment. So I left home in the middle of the night to go back to my dorm (I'm a full-time college student). I've decided I want to try to limit my interactions with my parents until they take steps to accept me. 

Here's the issue. I'm very financially dependent on my parents. My college is free because of my scholarship but I have no meal plan. This means I have to spend a pretty significant amount of money on food. 

I have some savings but they won't last for long (few months at most). And the more I use them, the less I can use to spend on transition related things. 

The only option would be to get a part time job. The issue with that is I have terrible anxiety. And it's not just that I worry a lot, I actually have an anxiety disorder. I can barely keep it together just being a student. My therapist has also recommended that I stay away from things like jobs or internships until the semester ends because my anxiety might be too much.

Background: I am currently a 25 year old female finishing up my enlistment in the USAF and my plan is to attend Arizona State University next Fall for Graduate school. I am currently finishing my Bachelors in CIT at Western Kentucky University. I was originally looking at going to ASU for MS in Software Engineering, but due to almost a year's worth of pre-req's on top of my BA, that's a significant amount of time and money. 

I am now planning on attending for a MS in Information Technology (with hopefully a programming focus?). Prior to the military (4 years), I have database administration and programming job experience in the tech industry. I plan on landing an internship (hopefully programming) beginning next summer, before starting school full time in the fall. 

Questions:
1) If I were looking for a programming career after my MS in IT, would that be feasible? (I know software engineering would be ideal, but maybe IT would be more broad?) 

2) Is it worth it to get my Masters before getting my ""Big girl"" job experience versus an Internship (I feel like this would really get my foot in the door and prepare me for better careers down the road)? 

3) With my undergraduate and graduate degree potentially gear toward IT, would it still be difficult to even nab a programming internship? I have browsed the market through military resources and there are so many available , most require a CS or related computer degree. 

I guess my concern is since I have been in the military 4 years, while it has allowed me to achieve my undergraduate degree and my graduate degree debt free....that's 4 years that I am behind the tech experience curve.

There's always been something that needs to be taken care of, some issue at college or at home or with my friends that I have to either help out with and stay focused on or stay ""happy"" for. I can't help but feel that my friends and family are great people, but also busy people. Maybe it's common to think so, but I don't want them to have my problems to deal with as well. I think a lot of this procrastination has to do with the fact that I still don't want to admit to anyone I know that something is actually wrong in my life. The fact still remains that I really need someone to talk to.

What's starting to scare me now is where my thoughts are going. Maybe it's just the morbidity getting to me, but every couple of hours now when I'm alone and just stewing in my thoughts I just happen to think of wanting to die. I'm not a psychologist but I'm at least a little familiar with how depression works, it feels like I can see my whole future stretching out in front of me just descending into this pit that I won't be able to get out of and ending with a cut throat.

I just don't want to drag anyone else down. Everyone just seems to be hitting all of the things they want, and I really don't want to throw them off their game. Add to all this shit the regular stresses of college and internships and jobs. I just really want everything to stop so I can catch my damn breath."

It was really simple repetitive work, but I had to do some programming now and then to get it down (mostly batch scripting). I was fired from this job because I got the job through my mom, who hired me. This wasn't exactly acceptable to HR so they fired me. I doubt I'm elligible for rehire. So should I include that on my resume? It's pretty much the only work experience I have in the tech world."

Seriously, always. I'm holding a letter written from 4th grade me to high school graduate me that says ""I'm going to be an electrical/micanical engenere"". So, I went to high school, founded and administrated a successful robotics team and got into a great college. From there, I worked my ass off, got internships, double overloaded my course schedule and graduated with a decent GPA and a double major. No honors, but a decent GPA.

From there though, I just crashed. I spent almost a year applying to jobs and sending out cover letters and resumes. I must have applied to hundreds of jobs in every city in San Diego county. Spending hours a day every day to get not even rejected, but just wholly ignored, was the most dehumanizing thing I've ever gone through. For some fucking reason, after 8 months I managed to get a phone interview with SpaceX (what the fuck?) but I was so nervous and excited that I blew it. Hard. I mean, I forgot everything I knew. Another two months went by and I managed an interview for a Lab Engineer position at a local company, but I didn't get the job. I eventually took a shitty, underpaid Lab *Technician* job at the same company. I've been here for a year now.

I've had pretty bad depression since graduation day and every time I try to start applying to jobs again the crushing rejection from my unemployed days hits again and I can't fucking get up the motivation to put a fake smile on and start writing a cover letter to spin this technician job as a positive. All of my hobbies have fallen on the backburner and I don't know if I remember how to be passionate about something.

The thing is, though, that I'm *great* at what I do. I've been doing engineering design in some context since I was 14 years old. Every time a weird design challenge gets put in front of me, I end up working nonstop to solve it and I love every second. As far as life goals go, ""sit in a cubicle with Solidworks open"" isn't very goddamn outlandish, but I have no idea how to make what should be an incredibly small leap.

Oh, I also got dumped by my girlfriend of ~3 years. So, that was icing on the cake, even if I can't blame her. I'm not exactly the happy interested nerd that I was in 2011.

I guess that's my rant. I just want to be me again. I miss it."
2zap2y,0,2015-03-16,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2zap2y/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I went to graduate school in math, decided it was not for me, and then went on a job hunt for any job that involves me writing code (I have some experience but no real-world experience). This didn't go well (it was very hard to even get an interview). I got accepted into a MS CS program and I am looking for internships now. I'm not doing this just for a job, but because I am interested in formal verification, programming languages, and homotopy type theory (I may apply to PhD programs). I was just wondering what companies might think of a BS physics / MS compsci guy and whether that will make getting a job as a software engineer easier if (when?) academia doesn't work out."
2zb1vc,0,2015-03-16,Most satisfying day in owning an EA NHL video game.,Ham_theman_44,NHLHUT,https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLHUT/comments/2zb1vc/most_satisfying_day_in_owning_an_ea_nhl_video_game/,"Today marks my most favorite day ever being an idiot owner of an EA sports NHL game. I've been playing the NHL series annually since the first edition on the Sega Genesis in the early 90s. I used to look forward to what innovative ideas they would come out with. I fell in love with EASHL, a bit later than some, NHL11. Thoroughly enjoyed googling player builds and techniques and enjoyed even more the social aspect of getting a group of online buddies together and running draft rooms in otp till we hours of the morning or playing club with guys that actually played as a team and were highly skilled. Then came NHL13...

New physics they say, HA! The skating was bad but hopeful being in its first year of the engine. Body checking was absolutely brutal and near impossible unless you were a Chara sized, useless dump truck. The poke check was finally adjusted to a level to even out the playing field between forwards n defensmen yet the stick lift had little to be desired.

Then came NHL14. The skating was improved, yet so very minutely, but enough to see an improvement of some sort was made. The body checking was finally adjusted to an acceptable level and then they royally fucked up. The had to nerf poke check because all the cry baby bitches on the forums complained they couldn't dangle through the entire team and the tennis ball dump was a supposed accident during a patch they were never able to correct, yeah right. Imo, that was to create more offense and was purposely done.

Now we have NHL15, a disaster among all 4 consoles. The lies n deceit EA brought about to make sales inadvertently had a negative impact. So much so that they lost 26% sales on release date across 4 platforms compared to the 2 platforms of previous year. EASHL on past Gen systems is a disgrace to hockey fans. You get rewarded for playing stupid hockey and the defensive aspects are a total neglect. The poke check is garbage, hitting sliders are totally overpowered and its sad EA programs automatic animations. 

These auto animations completely destroyed this series, there should be nothing automatic in this game, from the dekes, hitting, fighting, poking, shot blocking, etc. Everything should be user controlled. It makes me wonder if EA actually knows their own product considering they can't even give us a detailed explanation of what the attributes actually do. Every year there is a list of useless attributes, or should I say, non important attributes for online play. The attributes descriptions should not correspond between be a pro n eashl. They're 2 different modes n BaP can't be played offline even though you earn boosts for your EASHL pro through the mode. 

Defenders need a fair shake. In the NHL the poke check is a dmans most valuable tool aside from positioning n hockey smarts. Rarely does a man go for the big open ice hit, nor is he unable to consistently pick up loose pucks or intercept passes. 

Back to the point. I never felt better deleting my HUT team today. I paid absolutely 0cents for my team because EA doesn't deserve my money for an unplayable mode that just lags the entire time. I have good internet, ports are opened n I'm connected to the proper server. Next I will be deleting my digital copy of NHL n washing my hands with this shitbag of a franchise that promotes ""simulation hockey"" when this abomination is anything but simulation. Why the hell did they create an enforcer engine with todays NHL cracking down on head injuries and the ""enforcer"" has been all but phased out of hockey since the lock out because they lack the skating ability and hands to keep up with todays NHL players of skill.

I don't understand how these developers n producers still have their positions. Any other job, you would be fired for failing or underperforming. I truly believe we get stuck with sub par programmers because of the revenue NHL generates. Its either programmers that barely passed their classes, can't get jobs in any other major gaming company or interns that only want the college credits. For everything EA has improved in the series, they find a way to screw something else up. For everything the fix they find something to break. EA sports is incompetence at its finest.

To make the perfect hockey game they need to balance the playing field between offense n defense. The puck physics and skating of next Gen, poke check of 13, body checking of 14, fix passing, fix goalies and for love of God, remove all the damn auto animations.


EA Sports NHL series has no resemblance to real NHL hockey whatsoever. Its a gross abortion of an unholy union of a Mighty Ducks and Slapshot movie. "
2zb580,0,2015-03-16,"Me [25M] with my girlfriend [21F] of 3 years, I'm her boss and she's demanding a pay raise. What should I do?",ThrowAwayGFISMADASFU,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zb580/me_25m_with_my_girlfriend_21f_of_3_years_im_her/,"I own a small business and we are taking on a BUNCH of interns this year. Business has been good. I planned to bring on 9 and have filled all the positions, they all make what the going rate for an internship in their field is. The two engineering interns will make $25/hr, the IT intern will make $15.50/hr, the technical writing intern will make $15.50/hr, and the other interns (2 HR interns, 2 PR interns, and one marketing intern) are unpaid. Seems harsh, but that's what internships in their field pay - there's a hundred comparable applicants that will do it for free, unlike engineering or IT. 

Well, my girlfriend is in that last group, and she's not happy she's not being paid. She worked for me last summer and was paid then, but that was because I didn't know unpaid internships were a thing at that time. I'm from an engineering background, and every internship I took paid between $25-$40/hr. But I've learned that the industry standard is unpaid for the less difficult work.

She's been pretty much begging for me to at least give her minimum wage, but I'm not going to play favoritism, and I'm not going to create needless expenses for my company just because I'm dating her. 

She's more than free to either work for me or not work for me. I'm not forcing her into either role, but she just needs to make up her mind quick, so if she decides to work somewhere else, I still have time to find her replacement.
  
But she seems to think I owe her something, and it treating me differently because of it. Like, just because I'm your boyfriend doesn't mean I'm going to play favorites, you know? I was nice enough to offer you an internship. Just take it or reject it. Don't treat me differently because of it.

2zb5fn,31,2015-03-16,"23 year old virgin, new ""fapstronaut"", here's my reasons.",rmarden,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2zb5fn/23_year_old_virgin_new_fapstronaut_heres_my/,"Hi guys, 

I made a reddit account specifically for this post. I don't care if I'm not anonymous. I want my story to be known. 

My name is R. Marden. I am 23 years old. I am a virgin. I still live with mom and dad. Part of the reason why I came to NoFap was for the fact that I heard that it would help change my outlook on life. I can't remember when or where I heard of it. It was some time ago. 

All my life I feel like I've been walking, no wandering in the desert. It seems like that's all I do. I've been looking for so long for an oasis. For a way to crack the code. A way to break out of this life I feel shackled by. All around me, I see people with active social lives. Friends. Girlfriends. Friends With Benefits. People who have abundance. Yet here I am, thirsting for a drop. Just begging......  Please. 

All my life, I have been stepped on, thrown aside, and torn asunder. I have often felt like I wanted to end it all. Throw myself off a cliff or something. I obviously haven't done it. 

I'm still a virgin at this age due to several factors. 1. My lack of confidence in myself due to getting it beaten out of me emotionally when I was young. 2. I believed that I was too ugly for the girls I wanted to be with (not super hot girls). 3. I went to an all boy's school for high school. It really fucked me up for college. 

I've taken massive steps to shed my skin so to speak and to be the person I've always wanted to be. I've been working out (and gained a lot of muscle), I've been reading books, etc. It's not like I've been complacent. 

But today, there was just a spark that set me on fire. 

I'm still an intern at this job I'm working at. I know, I know. You're thinking ""intern at 23 going on 24? Cmon dude."" I had some really bad external circumstances happen to me. I almost lost my life several months after college which prevented me from really looking for a job. 

Anyway, I'm still an intern at this place. I'm treated alright but I can clearly see some favoritism. My seat was taken by someone who works there and the manager had to force them to move. They took the monitor I was working with. Before, the manager offered me a full time position. He told me to think about it. I did and I told him I wanted to do it. He said he would get back to me. He keeps putting it off and putting it off and I keep reminding him and he says he's busy and we'll catch up. I feel he's trying to extract from me all the juices I have for the least amount of money. 

Doesn't he know I have school loans to pay? Food to buy? A car to pay for? He doesn't care. I'm a lowest common priority, right? You enjoy your salaried job with benefits while I'm scraping by trying to make ends meet, trying to establish myself in the world, trying my damned hardest to make a mark. Would he leave his girlfriend hanging like this? He wouldn't be getting any pussy if he did. 

Then, something inside of me snapped. I started seeing red. Here I am at 23, trying my damned hardest to etch an existence and the pencil keeps getting slapped from my hand. I thought of all the times I've been rejected. I've been denied of my humanity I felt uncomfortably frustrated. I saw blood red. The rage felt good. 

I now realize that I need to stop bullshitting. I need to make my own path as a damn man. Not sucking someone else's dick to get a paycheck. Listening to people who don't even have their own shit together. Who don't even give a damn about me I might add. I'm planning on quitting soon. 

What does this have to do with NoFap? I tried before to do it but I had no inner fire to do so. I had no motivation. I kept looking up ""why no fap is bullshit"" on Google just to prove that it doesn't work. So I can keep the truth at bay. Now here I am on a hard reset on the hardest of hard modes. I am driven by straight up rage, disillusionment, and contempt I've never felt before. I feel it surging through my veins. 

Wish me luck and thanks for reading. 

TLDR: Doormat virgin gets incredibly mad and goes on NoFap to radically change his life and crack the code.

Andrews: The in-ring action is heating up, but it looks like the return of the RWF is keeping the old video screen pretty busy as well.

Slam: You said it, man. Winters, now Blade and Black? Those two sound serious. Or, serious for them, anyway.

Andrews: We’re no strangers to that around here, with this tournament and the upcoming RWF Championship match!

Slam: Our next contest could very well take a turn for the silly, though, because we’ve got The Foiler taking on a mystery opponent! Care to wager on who it could be, John?

Andrews: I know better than to gamble with you, Rodney, but I had heard some whispers that Drew Hardway might be making an in-ring appearance.

Slam: That desk jockey? Nah.

*[The arena lights go out (again, I know), and the building is silent for a moment. Cutting through the gloom is the sound of a ghostly steam whistle, and the collective gasp of the crowd is nearly drowned out as ‘Another Body Murdered’ by Faith No More and Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. hits the PA like a Stan Hansen lariat. The lights come up slowly, a deathly purple haze filling the venue, and a plume of mist drifts down the rampway and into the ring. There’s a bright flash, and as the glare fades we see The Foiler standing in the ring, cackling to himself. He (it?) heads to the corner and leans back against the turnbuckle, facing the entranceway, and makes a lazy ‘come on’ gesture with one hand]*

Andrews: The Foiler makes his way to the arena. He opponent remains a mystery. One thing is for sure, whoever his opponent is, they will sure be in a world of pain. 

Slam: You betcha. Andrews: Always a man of many words. 

Slam: Are you kidding me, the mystery guy will be made out to be a joke. Probably some guy in a clown suit. In fact it would be the greatest thing in the world to see several clowns come out and watch Foiler just destroy them all. 

*Resist and Bite comes across the system. The lights dim and camera bulbs flash. The Foiler stands in the center of the ring as he stares at the ramp.*

 Andrews: Here we go, his mystery opponent is…. 

Slam: MUPPETS! 

Andrews: No, those are called little people and they are dressed in clown suits all running towards the ring. 

Slam: Hey, is that Sky Low Low out there? And that one looks like the Haiti Kid!

Andrews: Come on, Rodney, there’s… wait, I think that one is Little Beaver! Anyway, I’m doubting this could be sanctioned as a real tournament match. It seems somebody is trying to get one over on The Foiler!

Slam: Maybe not a smart move, eh?

*As the ring is filled with little people, The Foiler starts to toss them out of the ring. One by one they keep coming and he keeps tossing. At one point, he is briefly overwhelmed but he stands up throwing little people everywhere, and also that bug-eyed cat from Trigun, because that motherfucker is everywhere.*

Slam: That was great! A waterfall of muppets! 

Andrews: Little people. And the ref is just letting it go. I have counted 50 little people so far and there is several more running down the ramp. 

*The lights go out and Resist and Bite comes back on the system. The cameras flash and The Foiler is left standing in the middle of the ring by himself* 

Andrews: There is movement down the ramp. I can’t tell who it is, but he appears to have a limp. 

Slam: He’s limp, he’s limp he’s in Foilers head. Andrews: What is the matter with you? 

Slam: Five months sober will do strange things to people.

*The lights come back on and we see a man in a suit and a mask* 

Andrews: That smell, that’s a rich man’s smell. 

Slam: OH MY GOD! IT’S FIRESTONE!! 

*The mask comes off and the cane ends up over the head of Foiler. The Foiler just laughs as it splinters. Roy Firestone stands there face to face with The Foiler*

Andrews: The Billionaire is back! And Foiler is not waiting around for a mic, he is already attacking Firestone!

*DINGDINGDING*

The splinters have yet to all hit the mat when The Foiler grabs Firestone by the shoulder and levels him with a headbutt! Firestone falls backward but uses his momentum to roll through and comes up on his feet, charging The Foiler! Roy staggers the purple goliath with an overhead axehandle, then fires away with lefts and rights.

Andrews: Roy Firestone is hot out of the gate!

Slam: Which is well on the way to being a house on fire!

Andrews: Shut up, Rodney.

Roy lands 2, 3, 4, shots in a row, driving The Foiler towards the ropes, but finally The Foiler blocks a punch and, with a characteristic ‘Ahaha!’, wraps up the arm. He does the same to the other arm as Roy tries to punch himself loose, and nails the Battling Billionaire with a big Al Snow headbutt! Firestone shakes free, but The Foiler grabs him by the wrist and sends him to the far ropes with an Irish Whip. Firestone rebounds, and is sent to the mat by a standing shoulder block from The Foiler.

Andrews: Hard shoulder block, but Firestone is back on his feet!

Charging, Roy ducks a clothesline and hits the ropes, getting some air on the rebound and dropping The Foiler with a flying forearm smash. Both grapplers are quick to their feet, and Firsetone gets in close for a quick hip toss. The Foiler blocks and plants his feet, attempting a hip toss of his own, and Firestone reverses as well!

Slam: Nice little exchange from these two, After their countless previous encounters, I’d expect a slugfest on both sides!

Firestone whips The Foiler across the ring and drops down as The Foiler rebounds. The running continues, and The Foiler charges low, but Firestone leapfrogs! The Foiler comes back a third time, and Firestone has him scouted perfectly, jumping for a high back elbow that sends The Foiler end-over-end to the mat.  Not skipping a beat, Roy starts putting the boots to his opponent as he struggles to get up.

Andrews: More offense from Roy Firestone, and he looks to be in great condition! I guess al those personal trainers paid off!

Slam: Don’t underestimate the tenacity of Roy Firestone, John. Not on the air, anyway. You might need a job sometime in the future.

Fending off Roy from all fours, The Foiler manages to catch a boot and shoves Firestone away, off-balance, buying himself time to get back to a vertical base. Firestone comes charging in again, but this time The Foiler is quicker and scoops him for a nasty Powerslam. He hits the ropes as Roy gets to one knee, planting a foot on it and driving a boot across the face! Firestone goes down in a heap, and The Foiler takes his time rising.

Slam: Nailed him with the Shining Black!

Andrews: The momentum shifted in favor of The Foiler. Let’s see if he can capitalize!

The Foiler grabs the prostrate Firestone by the head and drags him up, applying a loose headlock and shoving him back-first against the turnbuckles. The Foiler steps back to mid-ring and rushes the corner, taking to the air for a Foiler Splash! He comes at Roy like a meteor strike…

Andrews: Firestone bails! The Foiler, chest-first into the turnbuckle, and Roy ducked out through the ropes!

Slam: That’s a Fortune 500 move right there!

Andrews: God, how I hate you!

With The Foiler dazed, Firestone comes at him from behind with a high knee to the back, sending him towards the corner. He takes a deep breath, feeling the effects of the match, and grabs The Foiler’s head from behind. He steps forward and drives The Foiler’s vicious visage into the turnbuckle pad! The audience cheers, and Roy motions them to count along!

1! 2! 3!

The Foiler’s head bounces off the corner again and again.

7! 8! 9!

As Roy smirks and goes for #10, The Foiler grabs the ropes and stops his movement. He jams an elbow into Roy’s ribs and puts his own boot up on the top rope, toe-spike a-gleamin’,  and reaches back for the head of Roy Firestone. With an audible cackle, he drives Roy’s head into the toes of his boot!

Andrews: Brutal! This match just took a turn for the mean!

Firestone yelps and flails himself free, clutching his face. The Foiler stalks him, low chuckle rumbling like a coming thunderstorm, and Roy finds himself walking right into that very same toe spike, this one to the gut. Firestone doubles over and The Foiler hefts him up in a gutwrench, lifting him to his shoulder and then driving him unsupported to the mat on his neck!

Andrews: Ladies and gents, I do believe we have just witnessed the return of The Last Laugh, The Foiler’s personal Gutwrench Ganso Bomb, and it’s every bit as nasty as you heard!

Slam: That move retires guys who are still in developmental, miles away.

The Foiler gets down and hooks a leg, draping his back over Roy Firestone to add leverage to the pinning combination, and the ref makes the count.

1!

2!

3!

*DINGDINGDING*

Laurie: Here is your winner, Theeeeee Foooiiiilleerrrrr!

Andrews: The Foiler topples his mystery opponent, revealed to be the returning Roy Firestone, and advances in the International Championship Tournament! He’ll be facing his former intern James Lafontaine, who just won a big match against the very accomplished Mikko Paatalo, in the championship 3-way before tonight’s much-anticipated RWF Championship match! The third man in that contest? We’ll have to wait just a little longer to find out!

Slam: Christopher Steel and RJ Supernova will square off in just a moment’s time to determine that very thing, John, and this one is hard to handicap. Steel is a 2-time former champ, a powerful grappler with some speed and agility who knows what it takes to be a champion. RJ Supernova, the California Kid, the Suntan Superman, the Whatever Other Stuff, is a speed guy. He can brawl, and he can stretch, and he can hit a Suplex with the best of ‘em, but hisgame is based on his quickness, his reflexes, and his impressive vertical leap.

Andrews: That’s… really insightful, unbiased journalism, Rodney. Weird. And correct! This is the kind of ‘clash of styles’ bout that puts asses in seats, and then relegates said asses to either a) the edge of the seat, or b) the air.

Slam: You, uh, you said it. Geez, I should call you Tron Andrews.

Andrews: Melt him with what?

*[We cut to a backstage camera]*

Troy: Roy.

Roy: We have unfinished business. 

Troy: We do? 

Roy: Yes. We do. 

Jim: What do you have for me Roy? 

Roy: Here is a set of keys to a brand new car I promised you. Go enjoy it. 

*Roy tosses a set of keys to Jim and he runs off jumping and laughing.*

Troy: And now us. 

*Roy reaches out his hand. Troy scoffs for a moment and then reaches over and gives Roy a big hug.*

Troy: Glad to have you back. 

Roy: Glad to be back. You have a big match tonight. 

Troy: I do. 

Roy: There is only one thing left to do. 

Troy: What’s that? 

*Roy reaches into his satchel and pulls out a green bottle. The room steward comes over with two glasses and Roy pours into them.*

Roy: Win the f(beep)ing match. 

Troy: Amen brotha! 

*Roy and Troy hit the glasses together and slam the liquor. Jim comes running back in with a photo of his new car.*

Jim: ROY! IT’S A YUGO!!!!! I love it! 

Andrews: That man and his taste for cars. 

Slam: You would think that he would have a better taste since he is the richest in the world. 

Andrews: I don’t know what to say to you. 

Slam: I will have what they are having. 

Andrews: Onto our next match.

Missing canine tooth and about to lose my lateral incisor.,[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/2zbb55/need_advice_missing_canine_tooth_and_about_to/,"I am in a bit of a dilemma. My parents rarely took me to the dentist, so I never got to tackle the problem. Now I'm 23 and stuck.
My adult canine never came out and I was stuck with a baby tooth for the longest. I'm not sure how to explain it, but my canine tooth is stuck on top of my lateral incisor. The canine has been eating away at the root of the lateral incisor.

I am away from home at the moment because I'm doing an internship in another state. I went to see a dentist here, but I didn't know that it was going to be a lengthy process. Unfortunately, I can't continue treatment with the dentist because I'm going back home in May.
I was sent to an orthodontist and oral surgeon. Normally, they could just bring down my canine tooth but because the roots of my front teeth are short, it would cause more damage than good. The oral surgeon also told me that I was going to lose my lateral incisor. He said that an implant was an option, but I don't have enough space for two implants. 

I'm including x-rays in hopes that I can get a second opinion. I don't know how I'm going to pay for this, but it needs to be done. I don't need a perfect smile, but I don't want any gaping holes. I feel so self-conscious. 
What are my options here?
Is an implant the best option?

I'm worried that company will have unreal high expectation from me. Should I be worried?

Background: I did really well in the interview so the company really wanted me. The company initially offered me 6.5k/month, but I got an offer from a big 4 company, so the company offered me 9.5k/month. I did well on the interview, since they asked basic algorithm questions but I'm not sure how I'll be able to perform at the company.

I personally don't think I'm exceptional or a programming guru, but rather a person that has just gotten into CS (I had no CS experience prior to university). I'm worried that company will have too high expectation for me, and I won't perform up to their expectation."
2zbdia,19,2015-03-17,What kind of things should I know before I start applying for an internship?,Jakeunderscore,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zbdia/what_kind_of_things_should_i_know_before_i_start/,"So i've changed majors to computer science from mechanical engineering about 3 semesters ago and have only taken a handful of actual computer science related classes. For instance my first ever programming class was java and this was before I knew anything about what programming was and how it worked. Now i've taken a class on C and am in a class for C++ and am most comfortable and have the most practice using C++. Now when I say comfortable, i'm being very general here because i'm still learning pointers (although I have a really good grasp on classes and using separate files to organize them...if that means anything). I've taken classes on computer organization and architecture and discrete math but that's it. 

I'm supposed to be graduating in like a year and a summer but feel like I know so little. I knew practically nothing going into this major and have come a long way but feel so far behind the rest of my peers, but I am very happy with computer science and enjoy it a lot. I know I need to get an internship for experience but I honestly don't feel qualified just from reading some of the things on here. I've only used an IDE like Xcode and a little bit of Visual Studio (just to compile and run my programs) and have starting messing with the command line interface and using a text editor (sublime). I learned how to use makefile to compile multiple files that a program uses and can run it through terminal but thats it. I know a few commands from reading things online and the rest of my knowledge of using the CLI is from my own readings and online, nothing from my courses.

My classes havnt really prepared me for an intership or real world experience, just teach me the basics of these languages and that's it. **Basically i'm just trying to describe the extent of my knowledge and asking what is to be expected when applying for internships and what I should look for, work on and keep in mind** because I don't know how much I don't know, and I get the feeling its a lot just from coming across this subreddit. It's kinda stressful and i'm worried graduation will be get too close before I feel somewhat qualified for an internship and then it'll be too late."
2zbiie,1,2015-03-17,"Me [23 M] with my Ex-Girlfriend [21 F] 4.5 years, broke up with me 2 weeks ago, citing she feels too dependent on me and needs to grow into a stronger person.",radfrac_frat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zbiie/me_23_m_with_my_exgirlfriend_21_f_45_years_broke/,"So we've been dating for the past 4.5 years, and study at the same university and in the same program. 

Right now we're doing internships in different cities and i went to see her 3 weeks ago. We met up and she told me that she would like for this relationship to end because she feels that she's becoming too dependent on me for things like school and just life in general. 

She insisted this was very hard for her, but she feels this is the best time for her to take this decision since we're both apart and won't have to constantly see each other.  This was out of the blue since our relationship was going fine, to the extent where she told me she was looking forward to seeing me the day before i met her and that she loved me a lot. 

She has done this before, 2 years ago, again when we were in different places for internships, citing some of the same reasons. However, last time I did make mistakes and there were constant fights between us, and i had seen it coming. We got back together when we got back to school 4 months later.  This time around however, she made it clear it wasn't me or that she wanted to date other people. She insisted on this sternly, trying to make it clear that her breakup was for her to be alone and learn to ""make her own decisions and be a stronger person"" 

After the breakup, i cut contact, though she kept trying to call me and talk to me to ""find out how i was doing"". I resisted contact till last Tuesday when we skyped and she said that she misses me and that i still meant a lot to her and promised she ""would be with another man"" and said she would hate to see me with another person too, but felt it was important for her as a person to be single for the last year at university.She did however mention that we ""maybe together in the future""  and that there ""wouldn't be another guy if not me"" 

She went on to say that she fears that with me her life is ""already planned out and set"" and that she didn't want that and wanted to build a career and ""personality and identity"" for herself. I feel that i was extremely supportive of her decisions and never particularly influenced her decisions in any way. 

I'm kind of still in a confused state as to what happened, and my friends have told me that she did talk to them and asked if i was doing fine, also mentioning to them that it wasn't easy for her and that she needed to be alone for a some time. She also told them she isn't ready for settling down in the near future. Which is weird since i never talked about marriage ever to her, since it's something i wouldn't consider my self ready for, latest for the next 6-7 years. 

I've been told by friends and family that i should move on, since she's done this for the second time and that it could be a recurring thing. 

What troubles me, is that she insists that this relationship meant a lot to her, but she just decided to throw it away for some sort of personal growth and independence that she feels she will find and it will help her be a better person. 

I sure am heartbroken, though i'm taking it way better than the first time she broke up, part of me thinking its probably better to move on now? Though i still really care for her and at times wish we could be together. 




   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4.5 years broke up with me citing she feels she's overdependent on me and insists she feels it'll help her be a better, stronger person, and not because she wanted to date other people. This is the second time she's done this, not sure if i should move on or wait like last time and chance getting back together. "
2zbnbq,6,2015-03-17,How do I renege on an internship offer I've already accepted?,reversecs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zbnbq/how_do_i_renege_on_an_internship_offer_ive/,"I decided to accept an internship with a very large bank a couple of months ago. I was really not super excited about the company or what I would be doing but it paid well, I was able to commute from home, and it was the only offer I had. So I decided to accept. 

The entire recruitment process was very off putting. They only gave me two behavioral interviews, and they were really just why do you want to work for a bank/ in finance. Note this is not some investment banking job, it was just a regular technology analyst position in chicago, paying $33/hr. I had previously been in contact interviewing with all of the big 4 tech companies but was outright rejected from 3 and placed in limbo for another, effectively I thought I was rejected from all of them and was rejected from the biggest finance companies like Jane Street, etc.. I was just contacted by one of the big four last week for another interview and received an offer today. I really really want to take this internship over the one I've accepted. They treat their employees so much better, the financial benefits are so much better, and I would have a huge name on my resume. The experience would be invaluable and I think I would learn much more. This is a company that I would seriously consider working for full time whereas I would not consider the bank unless it was my last option.

I'm not sure how to go about reneging on this offer but I know for sure I want to do it. I would not be able to live it down if I didn't take this new offer. How do I go about turning my back on this offer  gracefully? I have 0 interest in coming back to this company ever again, or even into the financial industry in general. I just want to do my best to be as polite as possible and make to make the conversation as least awkward as it can be. I also came in contact with this company through my universities career fair so I don't want to get banned from that for my senior year (im a junior).

TL;DR :

I have company A which I accepted an internship offer for only because I thought I had no more options, and I suddenly got an offer from company B which I would much much rather take. I WILL be reneging on company A but I would like to know how to go about doing that gracefully."

First of all let me introduce myself, I am just regular mid 20 year old girl from Thailand  who has always wanted to work full time in big city … I was former intern at a law firm in Sydney Australia. I applied for this job and I got interviewed early January 2015 and they accepted me to work as an intern Monday to Friday 9:00 – 18:00 (but when I was working there I actually had to work overtime everyday and they never paid me one cent for overtime work)  I signed a 3 month internship contract with them, on the date I signed they said to me as an employee I have to give them notice a month in advance if i should resign . However I was there as an intern so I thought this rule would not be applied for me.

I started working with them on 27th January 2015, I worked very hard every day and did many hours overtime every day.  As an intern they never trained me properly one on one or even provided me step by step guidelines on the tasks i was required to do. They assigned me many tasks to do each day, and the only feedback i got from them was negative. It was hard believe me …

Until one day I felt that I couldn’t work for them anymore when one of the lawyers asked me to find a training institute that could “BACKDATE RECEIPT of training course” believe me I had felt sick in my stomach the whole day when I was told I needed to do something illegal and it’s really wrong.  So after I finished my work that day … on the 18th February 2015  I got back to my place and sent them my resignation letter straight away. (I know I didn’t give them any notice. And they should know that they should not ask me to do illegal thing…. )  And I had waited for them to contact me but they didn’t do anything so they didn’t want me back and I thought I didn’t cause them any inconvenience. (if I did cause them any inconvenience they would call me to go back to the office to discuss the situation but they didn’t .)  So on the 9th March 2015 I emailed them to ask them to pay me my remaining salary

But they sent this back to me on the 16th March 2015.

2zboyz,7,2015-03-17,I feel like I'm about to break...,tacosprinkles,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2zboyz/i_feel_like_im_about_to_break/,"So, I don't have any strong memories of being transgender as a kid. All I really remember is that I played Barbies with my brother (I identified him as my sister at the time) at a very young age and being frustrated that my Barbies wouldn't fit in my Hot Wheels. I had one good male friend at that age, and that was because he was a kid of our parents' friends and he happened to be cool and we got along. Come second grade, I went to a public school after being homeschooled. I tried hanging out with the guys, but I hardly got on with them. So almost all of my friends were girls and I liked it and never really questioned it, and I would be excited when a girl was a new student because that meant a new possible friend.

I had some signs that might not really be signs. I always imitated the aforementioned brother's voice on the phone and went higher because it was natural to me. Still do it. I hated my name and it felt awkward, and I tried to change it to an acceptable name (however, all the names I picked were male and I was never satisfied, so I gave up) I usually went by Alexander because it was longer and that seemed cooler to me than Alex, which I saw as also a boy's name, but I was obsessed with the Lion King at one point and wanted to be named Leon or Lionel because I read it in a dictionary once.

But apparently my parents and the people around me said I was some sort of ladykiller. They were probably right since I think some asked me if I liked girls at that age, and I didn't want to admit that I had a crush on a few. Needless to say, that's not the point. I liked having girls as friends at that age, more so than boys.

But here's the thing. I had pretty strong social deficits as a kid, having a high functioning form of autism. I could have just made lots of female friends because it was easy. Girls were nicer to me than boys.

Now, anyone who knows me knows this isn't true currently since I like to avoid relationships, and I've pretty much distanced myself from women altogether.

So, as a teen, my brother once made a joke that he was a lesbian trapped in a man's body, and part of me felt that that was me, so I took on that joke. So I said that in high school, and someone asked me if that was how I sincerely felt, and I brushed it off because I didn't really think of myself as one of those crossdressing males, for lack of a better term. I thought of myself as metrosexual at one point, though, because I knew I was effeminate.

So, I started learning to sing in high school and my teacher found my range to be baritone, and I realized I hated it. I wanted to be higher. I once asked her if I could train to be countertenor, because something inside of me wanted to have a high voice. 

I said to someone else that I felt like I should have been a girl, because I felt I would do better with body image. I think that was just me thinking I was unattractice in general, realizing I had effeminate features, and thinking that I would have been better off as a girl with those features. I kept pushing it, though and said I had a lot of feminine features, and they pointed out my nose. Hypothetically, that shoud make me feel better, but it doesn't. I hate my nose now.

I remember telling my dad that I think I'm pretty effeminate, and he told me he didn't really see it. I think he said that because he believed I would feel better, but I felt worse because I didn't feel feminine. When my brother presented as a lesbian, I asked him if I looked butch whenever I got a haircut. I remember wanting  look like Justin Bieber because people said he looked like a girl.

My first and only girlfriend was a relationship that was very one-sided. Every time I did something schoolgirly, which is natural to me when I like someone, she would think it was too clingy, even if I had ignored her for like, three days straight. I would always wrap my legs around her when we kissed, because it felt natural, but she said that was something the girl did to stop me. When we had sexual contact, I resisted at first based on instinct, but told her that I wanted her to because I wanted to feel loved. I don't feel comfortable showing other people my sexual noises or orgasm because it feels unnatural. I didn't even really want my nether regions stimulated. She made an effort, but I really wasn't feeling it much. I ate her out, but the only way I could get turned on during the start was if I imagined myself with lady bits. I kept going and really started loving the whole process in the middle and it was amazing. A+++ would do it again.

The mirror has always been something to fixate me. I look in there too long. I don't particularly like what I see, but I try to force myself to like it. Right now, I look like a college male and I want to look like a woman. I constantly have thought whether or not I could pass in the mirror. It's now the only thing I think when I look at a mirror, for about 6 years, as far as I can clearly remember. I look for feminine features and sometimes I want to cry because it's getting harder to see.

Out of my parents, I always had a stronger relationship with my mother, and identified with her more. I wanted to be exactly like her, but I always fell short. I would be lazy, lose my temper, avoid people, be socially awkward... I hated that I couldn't live up to that, because she was a great woman and I wanted to achieve a fraction of what she was, and I tried to be as good as I could in order to do so. But I wish I could be. I'm training to be a social worker, but I feel I'm a step behind everyone else. I'm shy around clients, I mess things up on a constant basis as an intern, I have a hard time conversing with clients mostly because I'm shy and the fact that I'm not naturally social. Many of the social skills I learned were specifically to push people away in the nicest way possible.

There's only one exception to that rule. Whenever I identify as a woman and believe it with all my heart. I feel happy, my anxiety lowers, I'm eager to converse with people and learn more about them, and I feel alive. I can feel other people's emotions more intensely, and the world feels real. The sadness I experience feels more real, but fleeting and manageable, and the happiness feels real, the world feels real. I think in less black and white, and I can think of alternatives. I don't feel dead when I'm a woman. But it's hard to muster that energy. I mean, I look like a man. People call me a man.

But the doubts and insecurities always like to set in the worst way possible. What if I'm really just obsessing about this because of my autism? What if I'm depressed and looking for some random excuse? What if I'm just looking for friends, and am taking advantage of the transgender people I know because I'm needy? I mean, I'm already pansexual, why shoot for more on the LGBT thing?

I talked to a counselor about it, and she got me to say that I'm a woman, but what if I'm making a big mistake?

I fear I'm putting myself into a situation I can't get out of. I don't even know the first thing about being a woman. Every time I put on makeup or women's clothing, I look like some awful crossdresser, and I hate seeing that. It makes me want to get back to my regular clothing and forget this thought ever happened. Because at least I can pretend I would look feminine otherwise. I tweezed my eyebrows tonight, and I made them too far apart just to fix the damned unibrow and neaten them up. They're an improvement in neatness, but I'll need to pencil them in because I really suck at this girl thing and stupid me thought that I would be happy and not screw things up if I started picking up androgyny. I still didn't look right.

I can't stop this dizzy feeling, I want to get off this ride. I don't know how much longer I can do it until I break. Something's going to give, and I don't know what. Everything is closing in on me.

And to top it off, I'm in the South. It's scary to be transgender here. Women get harassed for wanting to pee. They get fired from their jobs. Many are homeless. If I am transgender and transition, I don't know if I'd be strong enough to make it.

I don't know how to escape this thing, or where the heck I'm going to end up. I just want to scream for it all to be over.

So, I don't know why I said all of that... I'm just looking for answers, I guess. How do I keep myself from going insane with doubt and anxiety, and how do I know I'm not a desperate, crazy, selfish, and troubled person coopting the experience of others in order to make themselves feel better and framing things in a way that supports my delusional narrative?"
2zbqol,7,2015-03-17,Career: Will I get stuck in software?,greentastic,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2zbqol/career_will_i_get_stuck_in_software/,"Hi everyone. I'm graduating at the end of the year with a BE in EE, where I've focused on computing, DSP and embedded systems. I still really enjoy hardware and low-level stuff.

I may soon have a very compelling offer from a well-known software company. It would be very difficult to turn down, but I'm worried that starting my career in software will prevent me working in hardware, signal processing or electronics further on in my career. 

Does anyone have any related experience or anecdotes? Did anyone start their career in this way? Will ""software engineer"" confine my resume to the bin for future hardware jobs?

More info: I'm in Australia. I have pretty good marks, a year of internship experience doing firmware/electronics, and am a pretty active electronics hobbyist.

Thanks!"
2zc3l2,4,2015-03-17,I am frustrated,RustikTie,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/2zc3l2/i_am_frustrated/,"TL;DR: Lack of communication at work, got told to improve in certain areas and they'd improve communication. They didn't, I did. My work is ignored. Frustration. I'll probably get fired. 

I got this job on September last year, it’s my first actual job and at the time the manager of the place was a friend of my mother who had previously given me an internship and decided to keep me. She was ill and sadly died in November, it hit really close home and everyone at work was devastated too, the e-marketing guy got promoted to replace her and everything started going crazy. I was minding my own business and trying to do something useful there but communication between us was awful even though we were a small team of 4.

 

Months passed and from the HQ (our team is set up in a different country) they fired one of my coworkers. She was incredibly hard working, had been working there since day 1 and she got fired without a previous notice. I feel the need to add I found out about this when she came back the next Monday to pick her things up. My manager and my other colleague knew that from a week before.


Next day I got called into the manager’s office, as I said, communication was awful, so I knew it wasn’t good news. I was told the HQ ordered to fire me too, but he believed I could still be important there and he wanted to discuss that with the HQ that evening, but some things should improve from my part.

 

We had a long talk and agreed that I would be on time everyday, a new dress code was going to be applied, I'd have more initiative and take on things on my own without asking permission and send a weekly report to him with call logs and anything of importance that’d happened during the week. From their part they’d try to be more communicative and helpful. We’d try that for a month and if it worked I’d stay.

 

I’ve been arriving everyday 10’ early, they still come in 10-30’ late. I’ve been taking care of things on my own but they’ve been ignored. I’ve been sending weekly reports with important info and they haven’t been read. I feel they’re even more uncommunicative than before and I’ve been dressing with my mum’s clothes as being a 20yo with no experience I didn’t have any ""work clothes"" and don’t want to risk speding my money if I’m not staying there because I have a rent and studies to pay for.

 

Since my coworker was fired they hired 4-5 new girls to work part time and I wasn’t even introduced to most of them.

 

I was decided to keep my job if things took a turn, I need it if I want to keep living on my own, I hate depending on my parents and they really can’t afford much now, but after all this I don’t even think they’re considering keeping me. It's incredibly frustrating. 


I’ve already started writing my CV but was also wondering how can I address my first job experience if it comes afloat on an interview? I’ve actually learned a lot about what not to do customer service-wise and on the administrative side but don’t think ranting about my first job is a good idea in front of a potential employer.

 

Also, is my experience normal? I don’t want to work an office job for the rest of my life but it’s an option while I’m still studying, I don’t think I’m overreacting but I'd love some input. 

Sorry if I made any awful mistakes, English is not my mother tongue."
2zc47j,3,2015-03-17,Two job offers from companies which couldn't be more different,crazy_rat_lady,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zc47j/two_job_offers_from_companies_which_couldnt_be/,"I'm in the UK, graduating this year and have been undergoing the application process for software development roles. Last week I was offered a position on a graduate scheme operated by one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world, which is very exciting. Then the company I interned with last year for the summer found out, and apparently really wanted to hire me - so offered me a job on the spot. And now I'm completely torn.

I loved that internship, it was fulfilling and I learned so much and produced actual projects which they are using now. I liked the people and the work. Commuting-wise, it would probably be better for my partner and me, since I'll have to spend a lot and travel a lot (roughly 1-2 hours both ways) for the telecom job, but I had already accepted that and been figuring out the best way to do it.

The internship company is tiny due to having a very niche product, but it's by no means unsuccessful. In fact I'm told they're growing, slowly but steadily, and there would be plenty of work available for me. Of course I would also have plenty to do at the telecom, so those cancel out. I have a better idea of the sort of projects I would be undertaking at the smaller company due to having been there before, but don't really know at the telecom, but I don't mind too much - I'm just interested in solving problems, I'm not experienced enough to have any real preference as to what kind. I think both positions would be fulfilling in that regard.

The money is similar enough (especially given that it will cost me more to travel to the telecom job) that it's not really a factor. Both are generous salaries.

I think it has to come down to what is better long-term. My problem is that I really don't know which side of the fence I'm leaning on, I could convince myself either way. I'm so flattered that the boss of the small company wants me to work there so much, but I'm a people-pleaser and I know that a good part of me wants to accept it just because doing otherwise feels like disrespecting the offer (and it's a really good offer, giving me some modicum of special treatment due to how well I performed during the internship. So it's not like I don't totally deserve it but... it still feels handed to me.)

On the other hand, it'll be harder to get the opportunity on the scale of the telecom again, whereas I could apply to a position from the other company in the future. I think that I know I would enjoy the small company and it feels like the safe option. It's not a bad option, but it is safe. And I'm concerned that I would be choosing it for the wrong reasons.

I suppose I'm writing all this to clear my head and ask other people - both currently working and currently applying - what their instinct would be? I've talked to family and friends and most say go for the telecom, but a close friend who works at the small company spoke to me at length yesterday and I'm back on the fence. It's a lovely problem to have, I know, but not an easy one to resolve! Thank you."

Very confused of what to do.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zcmew/cannot_get_interviews_in_intended_profession/,"I graduated  Dec 31 from a good technical university. I dual majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. I know I should have applied to jobs sooner than I did starting two months ago, but I was  swamped with class last semester and I didnt even have a break for a loooong time. Generally, I would get interviews from almost any company I ask during the school year but now I don't get any and I have sent far more applications.

Here is where I also messed up majorly.
I am an EE and CE grad, but I have mostly been heavily invested in software development since sophomore/junior year. My skills in software development far eclipse my other skills. I messed up because my resume is so scattered in terms of profession concentration so it doesn't make it very clear that I am a software developer rather than  an embedded software developer/electrical Engineer. This is due to me feeling out my career path and sometimes just attaining what internship I could get in the time I had available.

you can see how one would be confused from my most recent work experiences are:

1 Electrical Engineering internship

1 Software Engineering CO-Op

2 Embedded Software internships

I had used programming in every work experience I had to great deal and my class/elective path was almost strictly software engineering electives wherever I could in addition to the EE/CE classes. I took pretty much every Computer Science course that a normal Comp Sci Major would take (there is a lot of overlap and I didnt take some more theoretical as opposed to engineering/development courses) but I don't have the named Computer Science degree.

I'm passionate about software development, and I am not really passionate about Electrical Engineering or embedded software development. I have been getting offers for embedded software development as someone who sees my resume would think I am very qualified in that, but it is a career path I do not enjoy as much. I feel like I am taking too much time right now in my search and it is obviously a big red flag to recruiters about me searching for 3 months from such a prestigious school and in-demand major. I feel like if I accept offers for another embedded software engineering job, it will cast me as an embedded software developer concretely instead of the software developer I am. 
I honestly still do not know why I am getting very few interview offers in spite of what I have said. Even considering this, due to the demand of software developers, I should atleast have some sort of response because I am still very qualified in software development in terms of having a past 5-6 month co-op and related internship and being in a directly related field with experience and knowledge of various programming languages. I have also placed well in programming competitions and judging from my peers in compsci classes, I am amongst the better coders.

I would like some advice, and ask if I should be concerned about my situations and what practical approaches I should be taking.
I am currently living with my parents. I don't have debt and have considerable leftover internship/Co-op money. I would be willing to share my resume by email (send me a pm) if that would help, but I would not like to post it to the public. I have been searching specifically in the states Of MA and NY which is where I would like to work. sorry for the long post.

This is my first post ever on reddit, so bear with me please. 

I don't even know if this is the right place to post this, but I need some thoughts/advise in this matter. 

I am and always have been really shy but I feel like I have improved a lot over the last few years. As a teenager I was very self-conscious and always felt like an outsider. People always considered me as arrogant because I didn't talk much and was distant. 

It is better now and I enjoy getting to know new people, but I have a lot of problems fitting in a group of people who already know each other well. 
I don't like talking in front of a bunch of people and I hate being the center of attention. I still am shy and that will never change. 

So I have been an intern at this agency since January and the people are really nice. But I feel like I have missed my opportunity to fit in because I feel so self-conscious again! It is like high school all over again with me being the strange kid that sits in the corner silently wishing to fit in. 

Now the problem is that everyone seems to have come to think I am the strange silent kid who doesn't want to fit in. But thats not the case, I just feel like all the people know each other very well and I kind of am left behind because of that. 

I thought I am over this but it is so hard breaking out of the image that every one has become to see you in. I am the shy girl that doesn't say anything so they do not try to talk to me anymore, kind of. 
But I am not that kind of girl, I actually are very outgoing and funny once I overcome my shyness. 

So...I hope I made my situation clear, it kind of is very hard to explain. I feel a little bit pushed into a situation I don't like but I don't know how to change it. I feel really anxious as if the awkward old teenage-me is coming back. 

TLDR: I am labelled as the shy awkward new girl at work and do not know how to change that.  "

Ye want me story, eh? Ye wants ta know what happened tha’ fateful night, tha night the HFY Irish Pub came inta our system? Gather ‘round, ye drunken bastards, and I’ll tell ye a story o’ magnificent proportions.
 
There I was, walkin’ down tha’ old alley behind Myad’s place, ye know, tha’ dimly lit, rat-infested pit ‘e calls a Restaurant. Serves a good homebrew, there don’ ’e? Tha’s beside the point. Point is, I was comin’ back from me regular Tuesday morn drinkin’s session wit’ tah boys a tad sloshed. I could still set me feet, so I was no too drunk.
 
I ‘member that alley well, ‘cuz it was there I met tha’ Human, one by tha name o’ Lord Fuzzy. ‘e was skinny fer a human, short too. Though, I ain’t exactly one ta talk. Three feet from crown to ground. Shut tha’ cesspit ye call a mouth Kers, I’m reg’lar size fer me species.
 
‘E  was wanderin’ down tha’ alley wit’ a respect’ble beard on ‘is chin, good proper length fer a man I say, an’ ‘e spots me mindin’ me own business. Stops dead in ‘s tracks an’ jest stands there, starin’. So I asks him, “Whatchu starin’ at, boy?”
 
‘E points at me, an’ ‘e says, I’ll nevah forget how ‘e said it, ‘e says, “You’re, you’re a Leprechaun.”
 
Now, I ain’t got no bloody clue what tha ‘ell a damned “Leprechaun” is, an’ I tell ‘im so. ‘e just waves ‘is ‘and at me and says, “You know, the little fairies who dress in green suits, and have bright red hair.”
 
Now, it’s true I got me some mighty fine ‘air, and me muther done stitched me good clothes, but tha ain’t no reason to call a Leath Bhrogan what ‘e ain’t. I was about ta let ‘im ‘ave it, when ‘e asks me, “You want a drink?”
 
Now, any self respectin’ Leath Bhrogan ain’t gonna turn down free drink. “O’ course,” I said ta ‘im. “Where abouts do we find it?”
 
“Up there,” ‘e says, pointin’ ta tha sky. “I’m a rather prominent member of the HFY Irish Pub.”
 
Soon as those words left ‘is mouth, I froze, standing motionless. ‘e was from THE HFY Pub. Not a drinker in tha universe ain’t heard o’ tha’ Pub. Waterin’ ‘ole for the best o’ the best, where tha drink flows free an’ the women ain’t much less. “Hell yes,” I says.
 
Tha Fuzzy man looked a’ me an’ grinned wide. “Wait til they see I’ve found a Leprechaun.”
 
---
 
When we got ta tha’ Pub, ‘twas everything I had imagined. Glorious. Tha drink flowed free, joy was rampant an’ there was much carousing.  Fuzzy led me inside and shouted, “Hey everyone! Look what I found, just in time for St. Patty’s!”
 
When everyone ‘ad looked over, due ta tha fact Fuzzy ‘ad one o’ tha loudest voices tha’ ‘ad ever punched me ears, he shouted, “It’s a damned Leprechaun!”
 
“Is it now?” asked a deep, rumblin’ voice. Upon findin’ tha source o’ tha’ ocean o’ a voice, I was greeted by tha sight o’ the largest man I’ve ever laid eyes on. Fecker damned near touched the ceiling wit’ ‘is ‘ead an’ ‘e was wider than a feckin’ cargo ship. Tha metal *groaned* when ‘e walked over.
 
I looked up an’ up an’ up tha’ bastard’s body ‘fore findin’ ‘is big, grinnin’ face. “An’ who might you be?” I asked the moving mountain.
 
“Oh, my name’s Max Findale. But you can call me Max.” ‘is face split in a grin tha’ looked like a mountain cracked in ‘alf.
 
“And if you’re on good terms with him, you can call him Cocksmash!” Tha second voice came from another large human. This one smacked ‘is hand down, up rather, on Max’s shoulder and grinned down at me.
 
“Fer fuck’s sake, Clint, don’t you be spreadin’ that around!” Max growled a’ tha other man. For his credit, Clint did na’ seem too concerned tha’ ‘e had pissed off a mountain.
 
“But it’s so much fun to see you squirm, Maxie.” Clint’s face was split in a great smile, tha smile one gets when fuckin’ wit’ a good friend. Tha’ ‘splained why ‘e was na’ afeared o’ tha giant.
 
Max shook ‘is great ‘ead. “We’ve got a pool game to finish, anyhow.”
 
Tha two men wandered off, arms around each other. I could not see well, but it seemed tha’ they were tryin’ ta knock each other over while they walked.
 
Fuzzy tapped me shoulder. “Don’t mind them, they’re a little strange. Overly friendly and touchy. Though t’ be honest, Max is like that with most everyone he likes...”
 
“Are they partners?” I asked tha Fuzz. ‘Twas a logical question. I ‘ad nothing ‘gainst that stuff, I just did na want them ta get too far ina their drinks and come find me. I am a very attractive fellow, as ye know.
 
“No! Well, maybe. I don’t know. I don’t even know if they know.”

“I heard that,” Tha mountain rumbled ‘cross tha bar, eyes on tha pool table.
 
I nodded me ‘ead. Made no sense ta me, but it ‘twas best to agree with someone who is providin’ free drink. Speakin’ o’ tha’, soon as I thought tha’ Fuzzy said to me, “Now, why don’t we get you a drink.”
 
Now, tha’ was right up me alley. Fuzzy guided me through tha chaos tha’ was the main floor an’ got me ta tha bar. Damned thing was too high, so I grabbed a stool an’ sat me arse on it. Tha Barkeep looked up an’ nodded a’ Fuzzy. “Afternoon, Fuzzy. What’ll it be today?”
 
“I’ll have the usual.”
 
“Aye, one Fuzzy, comin’ right up. And for the little one?”
 
“Who are ye callin’ little, short stuff?” I growled at the man. It was true. ‘e was small fer a human, even shorter than Fuzzy. ‘e did ‘ave a respectable gut, though, the mark o’ all good Barkeeps.
 
“Hmm, he’s a feisty one,” said the Barkeep. “Perhaps he needs a Ted, make him feel like a grown up.”
 
Fuzzy chuckled a’ tha’. “Adult Kool-Aid ain’t ever made anyone feel grown up.”
 
“I AIN’T NO DAMNED ADULT KOOL-AID!” shouted a young lookin’ human man a’ tha end o’ tha bar.
 
“Sure you aren’t, Ted, sure you aren’t,” responded the Barkeep. ‘e turned back to us. “Them young whippersnappers don’t know anything.”
 
“Who was tha’?” I asked Fuzzy.
 
“Ah, that’s just some guy named Ted. He’s not much to worry about.”
 
‘e did na look like much. I decided ta skip the “Adult Kool-Aid”. “What else ye got?”
 
The Barkeep pointed ta tha back o’ tha bar. [A long list ‘ung there, filled wit’ a great amount o’ drinks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2y4y05/hfy_irish_pub/) I pondered fer a moment.
 
“What, exactly, would a Vulva be?”
 
Fuzzy choked on ‘is drink. “Well, that would be a- You mean a Vulza.”
 
“Is tha not what I said?”
 
He gave me a strange look an’ said no more.
 
“One Vulza,” said tha Barkeep, slidin’ a drink across tha counter. I recoiled. It was on FIRE.
 
“What tha ‘ell!” I shouted. Those with earshot all looked o’er a’ me, but I did na care. They was burnin’ the damned drink!
 
“A Vulza’s a dragon, there, Leath. So we set the drink on fire, for symbolic purposes.”
 
“Yer all mad,” I muttered.
 
“Of course we are, mate. HFY is a madhouse, full of crazies!” An arm reached around me and snagged tha burnin’ drink. “If you aren’t gonna…” the owner o’ tha arm said, tossing back the drink in one smooth motion. This time it was a big man, though not as big as Max. This one ‘ad a right crazy look ‘bout ‘im. It was somethin’ in tha eyes.
 
“Adrian, what did I tell you about taking others’ drinks?” asked tha Barkeep.
 
“Sorry, Kepping. But he wasn’t gonna finish it, was he?” The man wandered off before anything else could be said.
 
“Right,” said Fuzzy, “just get Leath here a Pancake.”
 
“Aren’t you married, Fuzzy? Wouldn’t want the wife to get jealous, now would we.”
 
I glanced behind me, tryin’ ta find the source o’ tha’ comment. Nobody left a man ta drink in peace around ‘ere. Tha kind o’ place I liked.
 
“Damn it, CT, that wasn’t funny the first ten times you said it.”
 
A large bearded man laughed, deep from tha belly, which ‘e ‘ad in ample supply. “You bet your Fuzzy ass it was.”
 
Tha newcomer looked a’ me an’ smiled. “This one looks like he could do with a C12, Barkeep.”
 
“We want to get him drunk, not kill him, CT.”
 
Tha man looked thoughtful. “I guess you’re right.”
 
“Why is it so damned ‘ard ta get me a drink!” I ‘alf-shouted. I glanced up a’ tha list an’ said, “Gimme a Wolfie.”
 
Beer sounded good an’ I wanted somethin’ in me stomach. Not two seconds later an’ a mug topped off wit’ glorious golden beer slid in front o’ me. Tha Barkeep was damn good a’ ‘is job.
 
I took a long swallow ‘fore comin’ up for air. Now, let me tell ye. Ye think ye’ve ‘ad good beer. Tha’ may be true. Ye may ‘ave ‘ad great beer. Perhaps. But what I ‘eld in me ‘and tha’ night was true, honest ta gold, godly beer. It ‘it all tha right notes, tha flavor was perfect, and best o’ all, it got me buzzed from me ‘ead to me toes.
 
“Whoa!” I said. “Tha’s damned good stuff. Where ‘bouts it from?”
 
“Brewed right in the back,” said tha Barkeep, jabbing ‘is thumb over ‘is shoulder.
 
“Reminder: the Goat Dance will start in five minutes in the back room.” A loud voice called out over tha sound system. A lone man cheered in tha corner. ‘E ‘ad a very patchy beard an’ looked very shifty.
 
Fuzzy musta noticed me lookin’ an’ ‘e said, “That’s Patchy. He has an unhealthy obsession with goats. Best to stay away from him.”
 
I nodded. Sounded like good advice. “Right,” said Fuzzy, clapping me on tha back. “It’s no fun here at the bar. Time to join the crowd.”
 
“Hold on,” said tha Barkeep. “You’ll need these.”
 
‘e set a line o’ four shots down in front o’ me an’ another in front o’ Fuzzy. “A Stone. Just what the doctor ordered.”
 
Fuzzy grinned. “You’re right. What’s a party without head trauma?”
 
‘Fore I could ask what ‘e meant by ‘ead trauma, Fuzzy downed all o’ ‘is shots an’ smashed ‘is ‘ead on tha counter. It was a respectable ‘it, I felt tha counter vibrate under me fingers. Fuzzy looked up a’ me, slightly cross-eyed an’ smilin’ wider than tha’ Max character. “Your turn, Leprechaun.”
 
I decided I liked this strange Fuzzy man who I had just randomly met in an alley. ‘E knew how ta ‘ave a fun time. I grinned back an’ downed me own shot line. It stung something good goin’ down. Rearing me ‘ead back, I swung down wit’ all me strength a’ tha counter. We Leath Bhrogan ‘ave very ‘ard ‘eads an’ I gave it all I ‘ad.
 
Tha sound tha’ came from tha counter turned all o’ tha ‘eads in tha place. I slipped of me stool an’ on ta tha ground. Me vision flickered an’ a spike o’ pain drove in ta me skull. After a moment, tha shots drove tha’ away an’ I stood on me feet.
 
“Jesus, Leath,” said Fuzzy, “I haven’t seen anyone hit the counter that hard since Olaf. He damn near cracked the thing in two, though. You just dented the thing.”
 
“Don’t worry about it though,” CT said. ‘E waved ‘is ‘and over tha counter an’ tha dent vanished.
 
I could na believe me eyes. ‘E just did magic! “How-how’d-”
 
“Ah, ain’t nothing but a little Handwavium™ combined with ModPowers+3.”
 
I musta looked very confused, an’ do na get me wrong, I *was* very confused, ‘cause Fuzzy just looked at me an’ said, “Just let it go. It’ll be easier that way.”
 
I shrugged. “Get me another drink an’ you got a deal!”
 
After getting’ a drink o’ unidentified alcohol, somethin’ tha Mountain called a Triple Max, I was ready ta join the madhouse tha’ was tha main floor. I wandered in, Fuzzy by me side. These humans sure knew how ta throw a party! Never a dull moment in there, an’ tha whole place was full o’ excitement an’ raw energy. At one point, everyone stopped an’ cleared tha center o’ tha floor.
 
Tha Pub grew silent ‘cept for a single speaker, from which came strange noises.
 
♫It’s close to miiiidnight.♫
 
I felt my feet tappin’ ta tha beat, even though I didn’t know why. A man stepped out in ta the center o’ the floor an’ started ta dance ta the music, movin’ in ways I never thought a man could move.
 
♫You know it’s thriiiiller. ♫
 
Tha man danced ta tha song, perfectly in motion wit’ tha beat. It was a rare spectacle, one I am not sure I shall see again in this life. Tha song trailed off in ta raspy laughter an’ tha man took a bow. Applause erupted all around an’ I joined in. Such strange beings, these humans.
 
Fuzzy grabbed me an’ we wove through tha rejoined crowd ta get ta the dancing man.
 
“Hey there, Billy-Bob.”
 
The man looked up. A grin split ‘is face. These humans an’ their grinnin’. It’s enough ta drive ye mad. “Fuzzy! It’s been too long. And who’s this?”
 
“He’s a Leprechaun! Just in time for St. Patty’s too!”
 
“Did you kidnap him like you kidnapped that baby Loardphuzi?”
 
Fuzzy looked ashamed ‘bout something. I do na know what. “No! Anyway, I put the Loardphuzi back. It’s not like I was going to keep it.”
 
“You were gonna keep it until Hex made you put it back.”
 
“That’s beside the point.”
 
Suddenly, I was grabbed from behind an’ lifted high in ta tha air! “OI! What tha ‘ell are ye doin’!?!”
 
I looked down ta see tha’ it was Max holdin’ me in ‘is massive tree trunk arms. “What are ye doin’, ye big brute?”
 
“Clint bet me I couldn’t throw you like a football.”
 
Oh, if tha’ was it, there was no prob- Me heart nearly touched me brain as I was violently an’ quickly launched across tha room. I spun through tha air, people an’ furnishings flashin’ past my eyes in a blur. I was stopped suddenly by Clint snaggin’ me out o’ tha air, just ‘fore I’d a hit tha wall.
 
“Nice throw, Max!”
 
I struggled to force me thoughts in ta an organized form in me brain, after havin’ them mushed ta bits. “Now wait a-”
 
“Catch!” I found myself flyin’ back ‘cross tha room, ‘fore getting caught by Max. I felt ‘im pull back fer another throw but I was mercifully rescued by another large human. ‘E set me on me feet, an’ I promptly fell over, due ta tha fact I ‘ad just been thrown across a Pub by two giant humans an’ I ‘ad copious amounts o’ drink in me.
 
“Olaf! I thought you couldn’t make it tonight?” shouted Fuzzy from across the floor.
 
“Aye! As did I! But it seems I managed to deal with those damned Xenobots quickly.” I looked up ta see tha wildest lookin’ man I ‘ave ever seen. Long, unkempt hair covered ‘is ‘ead an’ a wild look filled ‘is eyes. I did na think fer a second tha’ ‘e was not capable of makin’ my insides, my outsides.
 
I picked meself up an’ made me way ta tha bar. Pullin’ meself on ta a stool, I slumped over the counter. I ‘ad ‘ad a great amount ta drink, an’ I was very drunk. I felt a ‘and on me shoulder an’ I forced me ‘ead up. I was greeted by the sight o’ a young human holding two mugs o’ tha’ godly beer.
 
“An’ who might ye be?” I asked. Fuzzy ‘ad na introduced me ta this one.
 
“I’m KineticNerd,” ‘e said, “but you can call me KNerd if you like.”
 
“Or intern!” shouted a human from the floor. I took a double look. Was tha’ a cyborg? ‘e was gone too fast fer me ta tell.
 
“Knerd’s good fer me,” I told ‘im. “Why might ye be here, rather than out there, wit’ the rest o’ ye mad bunch?”
 
“Ah, I’m just taking a break. You know-”
 
“WATCH OUT! THEY’RE LOOSE!”
 
“Wait, what? What’s loose?” Knerd twisted in ‘is seat, scanning tha area in a panic. I say movement along the floor an’ pointed it out.
 
“There! It’s tha…little rodent thin’?” I could see what appeared ta be a small ball of fur an’ fluff. It kinda bounced across tha floor, an’ did na do anythin’.
 
“Oh, it’s just a Dizi rat,” Knerd sighed. “I thought it’d be something a bit more terrifying and murder-happy.”
 
A low rumble filled tha air. “Oh no,” he said, eyes widenin’. “I didn’t mean it, I DIDN’T MEAN IT.”
 
From around tha end o’ tha bar came a veritable flood of Dizi rats, thousands o’ tha little buggers. They got closer an’ I got ta see a glimpse o’ evil. Ye might say tha’ there ain’t no such thing, tha’ good an’ evil is a construct o’ our moral minds, but I swear upon all tha gold in tha Universe, tha’ I saw pure, undistilled, evil incarnate in those tiny creatures.
 
They swept closer, an’ reached me stool. I was prepared ta fight ta tha death against ‘em but they ignored me. They passed me an’ launched themselves a’ Knerd. A brief scream, a spurt o’ red, an’ tha deed was done. Tha mass o’ ravenous Dizi rats disappeared, leavin’ behind naught but a pile o’ bones, picked clean.
 
“Uh, yeah, that was my bad, guys.”
 
I turned ta see another human emergin’ from tha back o’ the bar, wearing a lab coat an’ wringin’ ‘is ‘ands together. “Who might you be?”
 
“I’m Dude.”
 
“Dude! Vhat ze hell man?” asked a lanky human I ‘ad na seen ‘fore.
 
“Sorry, Wolfie, they just got away from me.”
 
“Vhat vere you doing vith them, anyvay? You know zis ist a pet free zone.”
 
“I was just trying to make carnivorous Dizi rats. I thought they might taste better.”
 
Wolfie sighed. “Vell, now I must clean all of zis and I must make a new intern. Zhat ist *hours* of verk, Dude. Hours!”
 
“Wolfie, Wolfie, you must learn to relax!” A human dressed in a large slab o’ meat stepped up ta tha other human an’ said ta tha Barkeep, “A round of C12’s for everyone to lighten the mood!”
 
Things got really hazy after tha’. I do na actually remember anything after that. I do na know what they put in a C12, but it made all o’ us crazy. Turns out we decided tha’ 1) we should set fire ta the pool tables an’ dance on ‘em, 2) it was a great idea ta play cards wit’ an exploding deck an’ 3) we should overthrow tha government o’ this planet an’ instill me as King.
 
Seems ta ‘ave worked well, do na ye think? Tha’s what ‘appens when tha HFY Irish Pub comes ta tha system."

However, we have yet to complete very many projects and now, my artist can not contribute at all. My primary goal for creating my own independent games has been to build skills and experience towards a career in the industry. Therefore, I am now looking for a team to work with that will be able to stay motivated and finish a project.

Game design is my passion. I love programming also, but I learned it so that I would have a tangible skill to contribute with beyond design. The perfect project would be already planned and underway, yet open to potential design input. I am available to meet in person in the Raleigh, NC area or work remotely.

I am willing to work for a profit share from the game if that is the only form of compensation a small team could offer (I have been there myself). I am also open to an entry-level hourly rate or even an internship with the right company.

You can check out my previous endeavors at [Detour Games](http://www.detour-games.com/home.html). I also host most of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/amplify91) if you would like to take a look. I have even taught programming to 8-10 year old children in the form of a week-long Minecraft modding camp. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amplify91) for more information about me.

If you have a small project already under way and are looking for another programmer to help finish completing, PM me with details about the project and the team and maybe we can work together. If you are looking for something else, PM me anyways and I may consider it. Thanks for your consideration!

You can reply in this thread, PM me, or email me at amplify91@gmail.com."

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

2zdlp0,1,2015-03-17,"Best strategy for paying off student loans (26/m, around 74k in loans, 55k/yr income)",cyonic,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zdlp0/best_strategy_for_paying_off_student_loans_26m/,"Hey PF! Was hoping to get some advice on some student loan matters. My loans have recently entered repayment and I'm working on getting them paid off. Here are my current loans:


19,758.27 @ 6.8%

4506.55 @ 4.5%

12,938.36 @ 3.86%

9058.49 @ 3.4%


These loans are all lumped into one total of 46,358.39 at Great Lakes Borrowing, and I currently pay 330.64/month on them.


In addition, I have a cosigned loan with my mother through Navient for 3520.83 @ 9.25% (YOUCH! Would not have taken this loan out if I had know better back then).


Lastly, my mother has taken 2 parent plus loans out for me totalling 24,560.37 @ 7.9% interest (Also ouch), that she expects me to repay, which I'm okay with.

So my total comes out to $74439.59.



I really want to get rid of that cosigned loan because it is so small and such a high interest rate, I think the minimum payment is around $70, and almost half of it is going to interest.



I will be renegotiating my salary in 2 months, and will be asking for a significant raise. I started as an intern at my company and have been there for a year and a half. Was started off about 10k lower than my ask because I was in a panic to secure income as my preferred job offer fell through.

Currently I am just making minimum payments on everything, which totals up to almost 600/month. I'd like to be smart about paying these off, and I'm just not sure how best to go about it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

If you don't understand this I get it.",93pfo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2zdm8l/dont_know_what_to_do_this_is_long_thank_you_if/,"I have been depressed for 5 of the past 6 years and just want to vent. My depression started my sophomore year of high school. I played football on a nationally ranked powerhouse and I was bullied by seniors on the team for being to small and being weak strength wise. I was a lineman and played with passion and heart, I loved football but in the end I was to small. The bullying caused me to start drinking which then led me to be suicidal. I tried to stab myself with a knife but then my dog came in my room and started to lick me and comfort me, it was like he knew. The school found out about it and it was horrible. I was treated like a school shooter not someone who just wanted help. I told them about the bullying and alcohol use and they swept it under the rug cause it was the football team and they own the school. After talking to them they took me to the hospital. But the police officer took me to his cop car during the middle of passing period. I was humiliated. I was crying uncontrollably and everyone saw. I wanted to grab his gun and blow my brains out right there. Everyone thought I had been arrested. A couple of months after that I met my ex girlfriend. She made me very happy and I loved her. She had been raped and abused by her previous boy friend so I spent the night at her house often and talked to her on the phone for hours to help her with her ptsd. She was older then me and we dated til my senior year. My junior year of high school was great but senior year was horrible. At the beginning my gpa died, then my dog who saved me earlier died, and I found out that my ex cheated on me when she went to school. It was all a huge blow to me. Especially my ex after all I did for her I can't believe she back stabbed me. Despite all of this I had wrestling to look forward to though. Wrestling was my life and my foundation. I trained year round, went to national tournaments etc. More then anything I wanted to win state. I dreamed about it and thought about it all the time. I was ranked high going into post season and then I got incredibly ill. I wrestled anyways cause it was my senior year and dgaf but I wrestled poorly and didn't even make it to state. That was when I hit rock bottom I took my shoes off and threw them in the trash. I couldn't believe that was how my career ended, it destroyed me. I went to the state tournament to cheer on my teammates cause I was a captain but I left cause I started crying just watching it knowing I would never have the chance again and seeing guys I had beat in previous matches place at state. After that and losing my ex, dog and gpa I indulged myself in booze and one night stands. I started drinking when I was 12 to deal with emotional abuse from my dad who was also my wrestling coach. I hated high school besides wrestling and thought college would be better. I accepted a wrestling scholarship to a school far away from home. I was optimistic and happy to be starting over. It sucked. I was home sick and lost all passion for wrestling, my coach was an asshole, I didn't do good in school and I got addicted to drugs. Alcohol, cocaine, adderal, pot whatever got me fucked up. Two years later I moved back to a school in state where I am at this moment and it hasn't been much different a little happier but overall not much has changed. During my senior year and my first two years of college I started to question things. This society all of it and how insane it is. I took the red pill if you know the matrix reference. The truth set me free in a lot of ways but has added to my depression. I don't want a corporate job, I don't want to be a debt slave, I don't want an internship. I just want a self sustaining farm, a wife and kids and to live a rewarding life helping others and filled with adventure. I am afraid to tell my parents the truth about myself cause I am afraid of my dad and view them more as authority figures then people who want to help me cause in the end they only want to help me if I am willing to be a mold of who they want me to be. My dad uses intimidation and yelling to get me to stay in line but I can't take it anymore. He gets mad at me for lying to him but I lie cause I don't want to get yelled at. For example the other day he was asking me how school was and he started yelling at me. I freeze up when he starts yelling at me and then he said ""you don't like getting yelled at right"" and I said yes and then he said ""well then start talking cause I want to drive over there and punch you in the face"". Shit like that has driven to the edge. I sleep around a lot not to orgasm but to be touched, kissed and to feel loved. I have no idea how many women I slept with at this point. Today I hit rock bottom. I am failing two classes and dropped another. I have spent a good amount of money to feed my addiction and have to confront my dad. He and my mom stress college and my whole family does. I can't do it anymore though. I don't want to participate in this corrupt fascist society. I just want to live free and be happy. I am afraid my family will abandon me though if I choose a non traditional path and that they will just view me as a ""junkie"" or something instead of someone who just wants help and a more comforting environment to live in. I don't talk to anyone about my problems cause I don't feel like they understand especially my views on society. Right now I am looking at multiple options for what to do next with my life which is still an on going process but I have stopped the drugs and have gone through the first staged of withdrawal with insomnia and appetite lose. We will see what happens but thanks for reading. I am not suicidal right now in case you are wondering."

If you can't tell from the username, I'm from not too far away in Southwest Ohio.


I'm wondering what your favorite, current recommendations are for:
+ Places for interns coming to Columbus for the summer to go 
+ Things for interns to do over the summer in Columbus
+ Groups for interns to join to meet others in Columbus over the summer (i.e. Columbus YPs, etc)
+ Can't miss restaurants, stores, hiking trails, architecture, etc.
+ Good places to go within an easy drive (i.e. what's fun to do in Brown Co. and Bloomington?)
+ Anything else you would like to add about Columbus.

In the meantime I'll be reading through some older threads on Columbus as I have time. I realize these questions have been asked before, but I'm hoping to gain the freshest, most current perspective possible. I'm also looking forward to having the opportunity to talk with anyone in the know about the city.

If you need clarification on any of these points, please ask. Mainly I'm looking to have a good dialogue with you all about the city.

So please, help me out if you don't mind doing so! I would greatly appreciate any input you all could offer."

I have a 6 month old corgi, and since I've had him my girlfriend who is in college has been able to hang out with him and take him out during the day while I'm at work. Occasionally he's had to spend a full day in the crate but that's pretty rare. He is pretty well crate trained goes right in and gladly hangs out in there when he's tired. However, my girlfriend is looking to take an internship in another state in May and he'll be about 8 months then, so I am trying to plan ahead to start letting him out of the crate so he's not stuck in there all day during the week. At home he is house broken, knows to go to the back door when he needs to go out, rarely ever has accidents, and has never had an accident in his crate. He does need to go a lot when I'm home though like every 90 mins or so. However, when I have taken him to another house (parents, family, friends) he's had several accidents in their homes and completely regresses his house training. I have a pretty big basement so I was thinking about getting a play pen and some puppy pads and letting him have that area to roam around in instead of his crate. I am worried that the pads might make him think it's ok to pee in the house. Any advice or general thoughts is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I've recently decided to take the plunge and do counselling after some denial that I needed it. I go to uni and they have on-campus counselling services, according to the website they are all registered psychologists with specialised post-graduate training in counselling. 

I called up to book an appointment and they offered for me to see an intern rather than an experienced counsellor, I told them I would prefer one with experience in a specific issue and they said they are all generally experienced in all areas. I was asking around and wondering if interns are generally a hit and miss and my friend said it depends on how serious the problem is and how often you see them.

I would say I have multiple issues, none of which I would consider serious like verging into mental illness territory and I wouldn't mind giving an intern some much needed experience if that's the case. I ended up saying that I didn't want an intern but since it is next week I was wondering if I should change it or is it no big deal?

This is going to be poorly written and straight to the point because of how much I hate myself at the moment.

PROLOGUE
I recently graduated from college in December at the ripe age of 25. It took me this long because I'm useless and far behind where I should be at this age. I don't have a job and currently intern at a company in my area of study. I live with my mom and step-dad. We're really tight on cash at the moment.

MAIN STORY
Today, I went to go see my bio-dad for his birthday celebration in a city about an hour from where I live. Everything went great and I was on my way back home until I got into an auto accident about a mile from my house. Now, I'm completely fucked. These are the current complications:

1. The accident was my fault.
2. I have no way of getting to my internship tomorrow.
3. I got into the accident in large part because I didn't have enough money to pick up my ADHD medication the other day, which means I'm not as focused when I drive. I went to my dad's specifically to beg for money for this even though I told him it was for something else.
4. I didn't have my depression medication in me either because I was in such a rush to get my dad because he has no patience whatsoever that I skipped it so I could to get to him on time.
5. There's a good chance that my car has such cosmetic damage that I might as well scrap it and get a new one. That's going to cost a shitload of money.
6. My parents (mom, step-dad, and bio-dad) are all going to take their turn telling me how it's my fault. I know I'm a complete letdown to all three.

In a nutshell, I'm a 25 year old, unemployed, underachieving, unfulfilled, and worthless sack of shit that should have been killed in the womb. I'm nowhere close to the person I should be at my age and despite their insistence to the contrary, I can tell I'm a disappointment to my parents. I fucked up big time and it's going to cost them financially. Shit like this should be costing me financially, not them. That's how much I suck.

I don't even know if this is the right board, I don't care, I just needed to bitch."
2ze0hx,4,2015-03-17,"Me [28 F] with my BF [27 M] of over 2 years of a strong and healthy relationship, broke up last Sunday when he suddenly claimed not to love me anymore",visari_01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ze0hx/me_28_f_with_my_bf_27_m_of_over_2_years_of_a/,"Over the course of the relationship we have maintained healthy and honest communication.  We have been supportive, loving, considerate, tolerant, and just about everything that a healthy couple needs to be to make it in this world.  We didn't deliberately hurt each other and when we fought we were rational.  We told each other we loved each other often, and said that we felt lucky to be together or that we were looking forward to a future together often as well.

We had an open relationship to minimize jealousy and dishonesty issues, but he never actually took advantage of it.  I did twice, widely spaced and there was no serious effects from the instances.

In January his parents' religious views got to him and he thought the right course of action was to break ties since I do not follow the same faith.  He immediately recalled his decision and spent the better part of the next week as well as multiple occasions over the following weeks ensuring me he had made a mistake, and that he wanted to be with me and loved me.

So now for the current issue.  About two weeks ago he started getting hot and heavy with a girl from one of his classes.  I encouraged it so he could have the new experience and I trusted him.  He realized then that his place--neighbor to mine, where he has been living since the beginning almost, needed tidying.  Then, he decided to sleep there.

Break here for two things.  First being this stunt is exactly what I did when I broke up with my last boyfriend.  Being Bipolar and in a manic state, I panicked hard.  Second, he has been juggling work, school, an internship, a coaching job, and home life.  He didn't tell me that moving to his place was to relieve stress.  Hysteria ensued.  Once I calmed down, he explained that he was worried about us moving in together later this year (what?).  Leaving me was not on his mind.  He stayed in his place though and kept to himself for the next few days.

His grandfather passed away.  He spent more time alone and did not ask for my support.

Two days ago he came over (9 days after it all started), and told me that his feelings toward me have changed.  He does not love me any more.  He gathered the last of his things, we closed the gate between our backyard and split our dogs up.  We thoroughly discussed the consequences of his choice, and he acknowledged them.  He left.

TL,DR--After over two years of a strong, supportive, loving relationship, boyfriend moves out to clear his head claiming fear of living together, then says he doesn't love me anymore.

My question--I am not ready to give up.  I know that love can change and even fade away, but ours was strong and nurtured, and disappeared way too fast for reason.  How do I give him the chance to rediscover it?"

I also had a summer internship where I developed a software that was previously written in VB where I translated it to C#, wrote backend and frontend code, and designed the GUI. I wrote SQL tables, stored procedures, and triggers. I've also spent another semester designing a Dorm Packaging System and then another semester making through ASP.NET/Visual studios.

A novel by Toefirefire

 

Rachel looked at her class calendar in disgust. She thought for sure it was next week;now she has to cancel her burrito plans just to visit a mill in order to write her term paper, even though she considered faking the whole thing.  Grudgingly, she went down to Cartwright Street where she found the fading red brick façade of the Cabot Lowell Mill. Inside she met with operations manager Paul Moody who would give her a tour and explain the history of the mill.   

The front-end of the mill seemed dull: a small office, a break room, a locker room. As she went deeper, she felt an overwhelming power looming about the place,something ethereal but immense. Turning the corner she saw what was behind it—a massive power loom! It sparkled with precision movements; its shuttle screamed back and forth as the loom Shed, Picked, and Battened hundreds of times a minute. Rachel was flooded with a cyclone of thoughts and emotions. The raw intensity, the pure power, the uncontaminated rhythm were more than she could bear.  “And this particular loom was purchased in1979, and as you can see it is still running. It can be used to create 50 different stitch patterns” Paul kept talking but Rachel could only pay attention to the masterful workings of the loom and the growing pile of cloth neatly folded in its wake. “Oh how lucky that cloth is” thought Rachel.

 

Weeks passed and the semester ended. Rachel now looked forward to graduating with a 3.9 GPA, buoyed up by her passionate term paper. As her friends talked about internships and summers abroad and all the other adventures they excitedly planned for, Rachel was happy for them but she couldn’t commit to anything, turning down invites for week long beach vacations and a parent’s friend’s house in Brussels. Days passed in a fog; indecision and apathy enveloped her. Of the several plans she made, none seemed to generate any enthusiasm.  “Yeah, so starting in July I’ll be interning at the Cummins plant in Columbus, I just like working with the diesel engines they are so massive and really useful,” her friend pratted on at a party, ignorantly glorifying his future. He was unaware of how much more profound the workings of a power loom are, and how much people have benefited from the billions of square feet of fabric that have been almost effortlessly created. It was then that Rachel realized she could never be happy unless she was weaving. 

 

Two weeks later, at her interview, Rachel’s heart pounded. She was so close to entering a world that she had just recently discovered.  She always knew that industrialized cloth manufacturing took place, but it was just an exotic thing that people talked and giggled about, maybe weaving a little for fun. Now she was on the edge of this world where hundreds of people spent hours, their whole lives dedicated to weaving, to working in perfect harmony with a power loom.  The edge of the cliff was falling away and approaching her at an alarming rate.  “Please take a look at this labor contract, sorry it’s kind of long,” Paul gurgled as he pushed a thick stack of paper towards her.

 

The contract was incredibly strict, and outlined explicitly her rules for employment: breaks were 30 minutes, can’t call in sick more than 6 times per year, progressive discipline, non-disclosure agreements, non-competearticles.  It was almost too much to bear. Rachel had never seen a contract like this before. She felt overwhelmed by the reality of the contract—her head fluttered like a typhoon. If she agreed, she would be spending 40 hours a week doing nothing but weaving, and there was even a possibility of mandatory overtime. If she refused, would never get to work on the power loom. While Paul continued talking about training programs, uniforms, and Christmas parties, Rachel grabbed the pen from his hand and starting signing page after page of the contract, initialing some lines. With every signature, she felt lighter and by the end she soared with excitement. “So when can I start?” she asked excitedly.

 

She arrived early her first day. She put on her denim apron and tied her hair into a tight bun. Her training began, she eagerly jotted down notes on safety and power loom operations, paying particular attention to loading and detecting broken picks -- learning everything the loom tells have to say.  Next she practiced repairing broken picks, a challenging and strenuous task that required all her concentration. It left her exhausted after several practice knots, but she had no time to rest before practicing again and again for hours until she had it perfect. She never imagined the training would be so grueling and intense. She even thought of quitting but understood this was the price to pay to make the broadcloth that an entire civilization would benefit from, clothes and blankets and a million other things. The historical significance was not lost on her either.  For hundreds of years powerloom mills had been the driving force of the economy of England and New England, and they had far reaching effects, wars happened over cotton and cloth tariffs and trade.  Slavery dominated much of America to feed cotton into the loom; unions and massive protests erupted over children working power looms; 146 garment workers would die in the triangle shirt waist factory because of the cheap cloth that came out of powerlooms, very much like the ones humming so nearby.  For Rachel the call of the loom was too much for her and she would follow in the footsteps of so many others and ecstatically work the loom.

 

Soon, she was working her own loom hour after amazing hour. Electricity thundered through her like a herd of buffalo each time she completed a bolt of cloth with the loom. The creamy white band pushed out and neatly wrapped around a wooden pin for her to nip and loop the other end around a new pin. The sensations she experienced from combining 50 strands of thread into a continuous sheet of cloth was so satisfying and so new.  She felt dirty,the power looms constant shaking and clattering having stirred up a great deal of dust which clouded the room no matter how often she cleaned it.

After several months, she learned how fickle and high stakes her new world could be.  After several hours of overtime, she was admiring the quick rigid movements of the cloth advancing while checking the tells, when suddenly her hand was pinched with tremendous force by the swift shuttle. She screamed out in pain and her world blurred. She remembered seeing blood ruin the beautiful cloth and workers rushing to bring her to the hospital. 

The physical injury ended up not being severe. No broken bones, just some deep lacerations. But she didn’t know if she could ever work a power loom again. She had become complacent and hadn’t kept up with the tremendous speed and ferocity of the loom. As a result she now lay in bed a broken woman. She would need to look for some lesser line of work. It would never fulfill her the same way, but at least it would be safe. Even while looking for jobs, her thoughts lingered on how she had flown so high, and experienced things few others would ever understand. She had flown too close to the sun, and put her hands too close to the shuttlecock, but maybe it was all worth it. 

 

Ring Ring

 

“Listen Rachel, I hope you’re doing better. All the guys at the mill all wish you the best, and you should be getting a gift basket soon. It’s got some soaps and stuff and this cool thermos thing.”  Paul went on and on about trivialities but just hearing a voice from that other world had a profound impact on Rachel, her heart started racing.  “And finally I was speaking with HR and we were hoping to hear back from you with a date you could start again. Do you have a doctor’s note or anything?” Thoughts and emotions ricocheted inside of her like a geometric screen saver. This was her chance to leave this weaving world forever, or she could go back and redouble her efforts, triumphant in her devotion to cloth productions.  “I’ll do it Paul!! I’ll be back in tomorrow.” “Well we don’t mean right away, you would need a doctor’s note and to clear it through HR first.” Paul kept blabbing about irrelevances, but it didn’t matter. Rachel made up her mind. She would go back, maybe even that very day and start making spool after spool of cloth, maybe until she was 65. And even after, maybe she would work part time or something.

To post something like this is very out of character for me, but I really need some perspective.

I have been with my BF for 3 years. We were together for only 6 months when we decided to move together to another state. It was, perhaps, a rash decision, based more on romantic assumptions and a mutual need to get out of a town that had turned sour for both of us. The following is obviously only my perspective, but I will tell it with as much objectivity as possible.

There were red flags that I ignored with stolid determination. We established a pattern after only a few months. I would do something that upset him and he would let me know his displeasure through explosive temper tantrums followed by the cold shoulder. At one point he even explicitly stated that he was not texting me so that I would know that I was being disciplined for my actions. My actions nearly always involved me doing something without thought: washing his roommates dishes because he was grumpy with her and I wanted him to be happy. That was presumptuous and disrespectful. When I had the flu, I shrugged my shoulders when he asked how he could make me feel better. He accused me of being impossible to please. I once fell asleep while the oven was preheating for our dinner. When I woke up 2 hours later, the dinner had not been made because I didn't care enough to stay awake and make sure that it got taken care of. 

Then, we moved to a new state. The first night in our new place he threatened to move out because I had to go to my new job before the moving truck was fully unpacked. I knew I would have to leave, which was why I had three friends there to help BF after I left for work. I quit that job less than three weeks later because BF didn't like the amount of time the commute added to my day. We fought because my Dad came to town unannounced and knocked on our door. We fought again when my mom did the same thing.

We fight because I am too independent. As he puts it, our relationship should be a Venn diagram that meets in the middle but all I want is to be an independent circle. He uses the phrase ""I will just have to take care of myself"" when I have failed to meet his expectations. 

I now have very sporadic employment, on an on-call basis. Often, I am given less than a week's notice that I will have work. The nature of my job means that I have no set schedule and sometimes no idea when I will be off for the night. He constantly said that was unacceptable and that I should answer his texts within minutes. I am often working more than 70 feet in the air. Sometimes I can't text back right away.

I started graduate school six months ago. I have been accepted to a 4 week cultural exchange in South Africa. I told him about every step of the process but I did not ask permission. I am very careful not to ask permission anymore. He is angry that I didn't make him a part of the decision process. I asked what part of the process was missing beyond him giving his blessing, which I am not comfortable asking for. 

He says I have made my education trump everything. He says I'm not a good partner. He says I can't be trusted. When I finally made the decision to break up, he said he had a revelation and realized all he had done wrong and that he was willing to change. Against my better judgment, I am still here. But every issue still seems to revolove around my ""need to be independent"" and how that leaves him feeling like he doesn't have a partner. 

We can't even decide how to eat anymore. I am trying to be healthier. My blood pressure is crazy high. I want to save money and cook at home. He wants convenience and variety. Any problems with deciding what to eat are my problems that I create. When I suggest we eat what we want when we want instead of always arguing, he says that prospect would make him very disappointed in me. 

I am overwhelmed with grad school obligations, an internship, getting in paid work when my employer can offer me some. He feels like he is not my first priority. I feel like I am fighting a losing battle of constant guilt and anxiety trying to prioritize him. When I am at home, he sighs and won't look me in the eye when we talk. When I spend the day on campus, I dread coming home to his expectations that I can never meet.

I am no longer very respectful of him. I am at times passive aggressive and other times overtly resentful. One of us is always sad.

He says he will never give up on us. I have to ""make a choice"". When I tentatively suggest that maybe we are not a good match, he is crushed. His entire body sags with sadness. And I feel horrified that I have hurt him again and again. 

This has been our cycle for 3 years. I know I am an independent person, but do I not get how to be in this relationship? My dad hates him, my friends avoid him. My counselor says i will continue to have health problems as long as I am with him. I love him so much it hurts. Someone please help me.

First time poster here, I did a quick read of the FAQ and found a similar question to the one I have, but not entirely the same.

My issue is, I'm currently in college, I applied for a summer internship position with Bank of America, as a credit analyst. First round interviews were conducted at my schools campus, and though I was fairly nervous (2 senior vps conducting interview), I felt the interview went very well. Last Thursday (March 12th), I received an email from a hiring manager regarding another interview to be conducted by phone with a higher level employee. The email asked for my contact number and availability, and I responded the next day, (Friday March 13th), with a quick thank you, my contact number and my availability for the week of March 16th. As of now it's currently been 5 days and I have not yet received a response to my email, and I am simply wondering the best way to approach the situation. The hiring manager provided her contact information, should I call her or perhaps send another email? Should I wait another day or so and see if I am contacted? I am not sure how soon they are looking to fill this position, as the internship does not begin until May, however, she did specify my availability for this week. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!"

Never posted anything over the past 6 months while looking for an internship this summer because there is already so many posts in here with the information that I needed. That said, I'm excited to say that this subreddit is one of the biggest reasons why I now have an internship this summer.

For those wondering, I'm a junior at a college in Washington that received offers at both Amazon and Concur. Ended up going with Concur because of the people that I would be working with as well as a comparable pay.

In all honesty I pursued CS mainly because I didn't want to spend so much money on college and end up jobless, I had no inherent interest in CS. Outside of class, I never program or code and I hadn't really put much thought into becoming a software engineer as I only consider myself an average programmer. I planned on going into IT (help desk type stuff) but was having a hard time finding a job and finally decided to interview with Lockheed. I did well in the interview because they asked only basic questions about data structures (array vs. linked list), difference between high level  language and low level and asked about my class assignments  and coursework dealing with Java. (I had no internship experience). They pretty much told me that day I will be getting an offer and sure enough I got my offer letter the next day. I am only considering it for the relatively high salary (64k) and the good experience for my resume (lockheed is a large and reputable company) and then after a year or two finish up an MBA and go into consulting or something. The company also seems like a really really cool place to work; the location I am working at has a younger more diverse employee base than what I saw at other places and the hours are pretty flexible. the benefits are also above average. 

However, like I said, I don't really code. I neither like nor dislike it. I only coded when I had to for assignments. I don't have a github. I only know Java and some C/C++. Overall I am a good problem solver and resourceful esp. w/ asking questions and others for help and looking up problems online. 

Does anyone have any experience with Lockheed? How is a typical work day like? Will I be overwhelmed in a software engineering role given my weak programming background? thanks"

I'll try to keep this short, I just really need outside advice.


Backstory:

We started dating in 2012 and a month after we got together I went back to school 1,000 miles away, and since then we've seen each other for a weekend to three weeks at a time, except for last summer when I moved in with him for 3 months so we could actually be together.


I moved in with him after we had been together a year, and all of a sudden things were extremely different. Suddenly I was being treated like a roommate and not a girlfriend, and wasn't getting the love and attention I needed. We fought a lot over the summer and honestly it was one of the worst summers of my life. I had just decided to move back to our home state and completely change my career path, so already there was a lot of transitions going on. But regardless of this I still loved him, and we still had fun and it was amazing to get to sleep next to him every night.


At the end of the summer I moved to where my new college would be, which was 9 hours away (believe it or not, still in the same state). That was hard, but his college didn't have the program I needed, and the college I chose is the only one in our state that has a Veterinary School. That fall was again really difficult because I was at a community college, didn't have friends, and had an abusive boss. There were a lot of other things going on that made it hard, and he was also struggling because he was finally realizing he didn't want to be an engineer, and he was failing classes. At that point I still thought we were going strong and everything was fine, we were both just struggling and in transition. I


In December I get a call from a friend to let me know that my boyfriend had asked my friend's girlfriend if she wanted to hook up. (they were all living in the same house at the time with 3 other people).


Obviously I was just completely taken aback. We were this amazing couple who'd survived so much, and he had tried to cheat on me. It took a lot of sobbing and talking, but I wanted to give him a second chance because I believe in second chances, and I didnt want to give up on us so quickly.


So fast forward to now. We're still struggling. Getting over infidelity is really rough. I'm extremely self-conscious now, because he doesn't give me the affection I need and now there's the added stress of the infidelity.


We had previously discussed that since I lived with him last summer, he should come live with me this summer since he doesn't have any summer classes to take and we're both still college students. He lives in the middle of nowhere, and I live near his family and my family. We need to work through our problems and be together if this is going to be able to progress and I think the only way to do that is to be in the same city. He has nothing keeping him where he currently lives other than his job as a shift manager at a fast food restaurant. I haven't been getting love I need, and I feel like there was a pretty clear line of when he got lazy in our relationship.


Is it reasonable for him to say he doesn't want to move in with me for the summer because he ""likes it here"" and doesn't want to deal with any inconveniences? We had agreed that he would try to get an internship to get some work experience in his field, but he hasn't looked and has informed me he doesn't want to come down.


Am I the crazy one? Am I being unreasonable?

I'm currently a freshman university student majoring in computer science. At my school, the computer science curriculum requires literally zero math courses. I could potentially graduate with my highest level of math being high school calculus.

I'd rather not leave my math skills at that level, so my question is this: should I major in math alongside computer science or just minor in math? 

If I minor, I'll have more time for internships over the summer and during senior year. So I guess this is more of a question of whether or not a math major + less internships is better than a math minor + more internships.

Thanks in advance for the help!"

I do not know how to decide between the two of them and would like to gain some perspective from some others.

I really like both projects, and honestly feel so lucky to have the opportunity to work at either company. I know this is ultimately a question that only I can answer but I want to know if there is anything that I'm missing. Since the work is the same there are really only a couple of considerations that I would like to get clarified. 

NOTE: I am not really concerned with my internship as much as I am looking forward to possibly taking a full time offer after the internship.

1. How do these two companies compete in compensation for software engineers full time?

2. How do work life cultures compare?

3. Is there a significant difference in the name of Google on my resume vs Apple? (I assume Google will hold more weight but is it significant?)

4. Apple is in California and Google is in Kirkland. I feel like this plays a huge factor since the costs of living are pretty different. I would prefer the sunny state but honestly if my financial situation is significantly better I could really get used to the Washington area. I love to ski and I love to play tennis.

5. Intern conversion rates. It is my understanding that as a Google intern I am filling a position that will become a full time position when the internship is over so I think there would be a high conversion rate. I'm not sure what Apple is like. This is important to me as I would like to hold a steady job going into my senior of college.

6. Any other sentiments that you might have about either company. I am really lost in this decision and any guidance would be greatly appreciated. I am just trying to make a decision that will prevent me from kicking myself later down the road. 

Compensation is important to me since I will have some hefty loans to pay off upon graduation so I am factoring that heavily into my decision. I understand that I shouldn't base my decision on this however I really have no preference on the projects. The location is also a big factor as one is clearly less expensive than the other but then again California has pretty awesome weather.

Thoughts? Even minor comments would be really appreciated. I won't take any of the advice on this thread to seriously. 

TL;DR 

Picking Google internship vs Apple internship what would you do any why?"

I graduated in 2012 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering.  Was unemployed until May 2014 and have been a helper / paint disposal guy / trash collector at a warehouse.  I've been working there since while applying for jobs and working on engineering projects in the interim, but nothing has come up.

Recently, I made a decision not to apply for a 1 year Masters program at the college I went to.  Reasoning is that it was heavily coursework based (a lot of it can be learned through online articles or youtube lectures) and I'd rather pursue research programs and possibly write a thesis in a lab working on a subject I'm excited about.  Furthermore, I needed 2 references, and I didn't want to ask them to support me behind a decision I wasn't 100% committed to.

However, for practical reasons, I don't want to work at this warehouse anymore: it's 26 miles from home, my wrists / knees are often covered with paint when I'm done (which gets all over my car), paint and thinner ruin clothes under my uniform, some negativity from coworkers, a lot of the time there isn't much to do (which is time I could be spending looking for engineering work or working on projects), physical exhaustion when I get home, and that I just don't like driving forklifts (everyone needs those lifts so they're hard to find, random shut-offs, etc.).  I've stuck with it because I need the money and that I've heard from multiple sources that it's easier to find a job while employed.

Right now though, I'm hitting a breaking point and looking for other things.  Of course, I've been looking for intern / entry level engineering work this entire time, but right now, I'm thinking I could do something closer to home and part-time so that I can dedicate more time to engineering projects and studies while I wait for that engineering opportunity.  

The question I've got is that is this a bad strategic job hunting maneuver from a recruiter's / HR's perspective: changing a full-time job where I've only got 10 months in to a part-time job?  I'll have more time to work on stuff (i.e. apps, the wind tunnel model I've got a BOM for, turbulence modeling, design a GB emulator, figure out how to 3D print titanium or whatever I want to build.), but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot from getting internships or entry level engineering positions.  Is it more important to have a more stable work history, or having more personal engineering projects on my resume?

Thank you for any help you can provide."

I am a sophomore ECE student and I recently got offered EE internships from 2 different companies. One is a large defense contractor(think Lockheed Martin,Northrop Grumman ...) and the other is a smaller defense contractor that is more focused on R&amp;D involving GPS-denied positioning technology.

The first internship at the large company would be in Southern California. I would work in a Space systems division possibly designing small circuits or maybe just documenting things. I would have to relocate as I come from Virginia and finding housing/transportation might be an issue. However, I really like the location and I do want to be in California in the future  The pay is around 22/hr + 2k for relocation. 

The second contractor is very close to where I live in Virginia and the work that I would do would be guaranteed to be technical, I might be doing DSP or FPGA related development and testing. The pay is similar to the other company however there is no relocation obviously. The team I would be on is very small just 10 people so I would get plenty of interaction with the engineers and managers. The work here seems pretty cool but i'm not sure if I want to go in that area or into circuit design.   

Overall, my future goals are to work for a company like SpaceX or Jet Propulsion Lab or at least intern there next summer. I feel like either internship would give me a technical background and make for a good internship. The big company may give some name recognition but I am not sure how important that is.

What do you guys think I should pick?

tl/dr: Deciding between two companies, one is large in California with name recognition possibly doing less technical or challenging work, other is small and not well known doing some interesting DSP/RF/Hardware work very near where I live."

So here's the deal. I'm a 24 yr old male with a undergrad in business management and going for my MBA.

I feel like I screwed up big time because of my undergrad degree choice and going to grad school (luckily my employer is paying for most of it)

Right now I'm making $40k as a personal banker. That was about the best job I could find in Cleveland after I graduated.

I really want to move to San Fran because I loved it out there when I visited. The problem is San Fran cost of living is sky high compared to Cleveland. I know a 40k salary won't cut it in San Fran even with roommates. 

I'm not the smartest guy, but I am a hard worker. I tried my best in getting a degree in computer science, but I couldn't do it. I have taken a few accounting classes, but I'm no expert in it so it would be pointless in me going for my CPA.

What kind of job could I apply for in San Fran to live comfortable? How do you all feel where I stand in the market?

Here's a quick history of my:

Been doing internships in marketing and finance since 18 at Cle Airport.
 
Worked as a personal banker for one year

Graduated with a business management degree (too stupid to get a computer sci degree and my school didn't offer any IT degrees)

I bring up computer science degrees because I saw another thread on here recently where those guys were pulling in 90k at my age and were talking how they were living in San Fran.

Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I feel like I've wasted my entire high school and half of my college time just being lazy because I always have that mindset to fall back on. 

I have this dream of transferring, going to a better college with smarter professors, building projects that can beef up my resume and get a good internship and a well paying job but then I just get discouraged by the fact that this all seems like a fantasy and then I just want to sit in my dorm room and do nothing. 

So I guess I don't know why I'm posting here, I just wanted to get it off my chest. To anyone on the other side it probably seems like I'm just a lazy kid that isn't doing anything to help himself. I just want to know if you guys here have any advice.

2zffkf,3,2015-03-17,"My [27F] close friend from university [28F] is fading away from me, and it breaks my heart. Should I rip the Band-Aid?",GreatAnotherKate,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zffkf/my_27f_close_friend_from_university_28f_is_fading/,"During my first year of university, I became really good friends with a girl named Felicity (not her real name). We shared a lot of the same values such as being introverts, liking the same music, and growing up near the same city, so we developed a really strong friendship. We hung out often, talked for hours, shared each other's secrets, the whole nine. We eventually found an apartment together during the first year of school, and decided to live together until graduation. Unbeknownst to me, Felicity was put on academic probation after our third year of university, and I didn't find out that she was not allowed on campus until about two weeks before our senior year! Shocked, I called Felicity on the phone that night, and she claimed that she didn't realize that she wouldn't be able to return to school. I was upset because I didn't believe that Felicity was being honest with me, but I didn't make a big deal about it. In hindsight, I don’t think our friendship was ever the same after that.


I went back to school senior year, failed miserably at making new friends, and in general, had a dreadful year. I gained weight because of my stress eating and lack of exercise. The economy crashed that September, and despite my good credentials and experience, I didn't graduate with a job offer. Felicity and I still stayed in constant contact, however.
 

I couldn’t find a full-time job by graduation, so I had to move back home for a while. Luckily, my hometown is near my industry, so I swallowed my pride and found a retail job at the mall in addition to  working two unpaid internships and freelance gigs to keep my resume fresh. It was a very difficult time in my life, so I decided to withdraw from friends and partying to focus on my goals. Felicity knew that, but despite my busy schedule, I made an effort to call her regularly and stay in contact. University let her return the next year, so she was able to graduate in 2010. 


Eventually, I lost the weight and found a full-time job in my field. But as time went by, I noticed that I was the only friend making effort to maintain the friendship. I would call her, and she wouldn’t answer. I would try to make plans, but she pretended that her phone was malfunctioning or whatever. We still were able to communicate, but I felt funny about that. Another year later, I was finally able to move out of my parents’ place. I unintentionally found an apartment 30 minutes away from her, so I figured that Felicity would be a bigger part of my life. I guess not. We would occasionally hang, but only when I made a grand mal effort and initiated things. 


I didn’t push things because I knew that Felicity was depressed. But after all these years, she’s working a dead-end job and still living at home. I, on the other hand, have received multiple promotions and have a more financially comfortable lifestyle as a result. But I never cared about that stuff – she supported me during sad periods in my life, and she’s such a marvelous person. I miss her friendship, and it hurts that she doesn’t seem to value my presence. Most recently, she was there to listen to me cry when my ex dumped me. I just would like a chance to be there for her – I would be more than happy to hang at less expensive places, or cover the bill occasionally. I’ve been in her position before, so I know how hard it is.


I don’t really have any friends in the same town now – my best friend got married years ago and moved out of the country. My other close friend just got engaged, and I know that she’s leaving me soon. But Felicity hangs out with her best friend all the time. I’m trying to make new friends, but it’s so hard!


At this point, I’m unsure whether I should continue pursuing this friendship. I get the sense that she’s intentionally fading away, and I don’t know why. We’re both very prideful people, and I don’t know how to address this issue. What should I do?

   
**TL;DR**: I became very good friends with a girl I met in university. We stayed in touch during hard times and I value her friendship. But almost ten years later, I am doing much better than her financially. I regularly call her to talk, invite her to visit or do low-cost things, but she always has an excuse not to. We have never had an argument, and I don’t know how I could’ve slighted her in any way. Is this friendship worth saving, or should I cut my losses and move on?

I hardly talk to her, and every once in a while she will move back home for a few days saying that she's going to leave her piece of shit boyfriend, and yet she always goes back to him. I would do something about it, but I don't want to go to jail. I have a younger sister, and my parents to look after.

To add to the stress I have no close friends, no social life, I am buried in work. I'm not trying to complain, and I know some people have it worse than me.

2zfqhv,6,2015-03-18,I need help. I feel like I am at the end of a road with no more options left but to die.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zfqhv/i_need_help_i_feel_like_i_am_at_the_end_of_a_road/,"I know the title sounds dramatic but I seriously feel like the only way out of the hell I am in is to die. I am in a extremely toxic job, no savings, have a moderate amount of credit card debt, in school, paying a mortgage, married, and I'm only 23. I don't even know where to start.

My current life summed up: 

* Married, wife is substitute teacher, works a 2nd job for supplement income. Just graduated with about 35k in student loan debt. She pulls in around 30k before taxes. 
* I work as an intern for a relatively obscure tech company. I have been employed full time for around 3 years and make around 30k before taxes. 

* I am still in school. I have this semester to finish up, and one more year after that. My degree is a focus in software engineering. By the time I graduate I will have accumulated around 40k in student loan debt.
* I have around 5k in credit card debt with my wife, primarily for things that we needed to get to fix up the house and to supplement my education (laptops, books, etc). 
* I have a car payment (paying around 170 a month on that)
* I have a mortgage payment (Bought the house last year for around 58k, paying around 500 a month on that). The reason for buying the house was it was actually much cheaper for us to do this than pay $800 a month on rent that we wouldnt see a return on investment on. Rent isnt really cheap around here, but we got  lucky with the cost of the home, its actually a really nice place. 

The job I have is the most toxic work environments I have ever experienced in my life. I can't sleep at night, I am constantly stressed out, I have anxiety attacks on a daily basis from the horrible work conditions (safe but just so toxic). Every day I wake up to go to work I want to just drive my car into a river and die. It has negatively impacted my health, I constantly gain and lose large amounts of weight from my eating and sleep being so messed up, my mental health is at an all time low, my attitude towards my wife and friends has been abysmal as well. I am withdrawn and bitter to everyone. 

I cant quit my job because I have to keep paying bills. I dont have any money saved up because there always seems to be something to pay for. Car repairs, tuition fees, weddings, birthdays, gas, etc. I cant get another job that pays as well as this one either because I am not a graduate and I would not be able to afford to take a job that pays less than $12 an hour. I cant take something that is not 3rd shift because my current employer allows me to leave and go to class in the middle of the day (one of the only nice things about working there) .

The other issue with my job is that it requires me to work 40+ hours a week (sometimes reaching 60 or more) due to the nature of my work and this takes away my focus from school which should be my main focus obviously, but its like I cant stay in school if I dont make any money and I cant get a better job unless I go to school. I feel like my education is being diminished by my need to focus on work. I want to come out of this program being the best I can be so my chances for a good job are as high as they can be, yet I dont feel like I know or am able to do as much as I should. I barely have enough time to do my homework and go to class. (I actually have had to skip class several times for work). 

I dont even know what to say this probably all seems really disconnected and messy but my brain is completely burnt out and I cant formulate what I need to say properly. 


EDIT: I am trying not to give too much detail about my life as my employer will probably fire me if they found this.
EDIT2: I should also note that I have tried to go to counseling for my mental health and adult ADD (a whole other problem Im trying to deal with) but I dont even have time to schedule appointments for this.  
EDIT3: I realize that I am incredibly lucky to be where I am now, I am very very thankful for that. I am also aware that my situation is not as bad as many others but from my perspective, in my head, I *need* to leave my current job or my physical and mental health will continue to deteriorate. I am looking for any advice on how to work around school and be able to support my wife and I on the budget I have, if I quit my job ( and I have received great advice so far, thank you guys!)"
2zfr2n,21,2015-03-18,"Received employment offer with little/unrelated internship experience, have hope!",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2zfr2n/received_employment_offer_with_littleunrelated/,"I just wanted to share my experience and hopefully give reassurance to my peers that have no internship experience, or unrelated experience.

I had a 10 week internship the summer between my freshman and sophomore year (which I obtained through family connections) dealing with nuclear security technology. While it gave me the opportunity to interact with engineering professionals, I gained zero engineering experience. I was in way over my head the entire time and learned very little. After my freshmen year I had only just tipped my toes in engineering, with my only applicable classes being calculus and physics. Overall, the only valuable aspect of the internship is I'm able to say I had an internship; I can't even say my experience was relevant.

The next two summers I failed to get any internships (or even interviews for them). This was entirely due to laziness and a dropping GPA. However, despite this, I have received a job offer doing exactly what I want to do, with a competitive salary. I'm graduating in May with a BSME; my current GPA is 3.1. More importantly (perhaps?), no connections helped me get this job. I literally just submitted a resume and cover letter to an opening listed on their website. About three weeks later I received a call to come interview. While I listed my internship on my resume (only three lines of text), it did not even come up during the phone or in-person interview. I can't say for sure if it had any impact at all, but considering they never asked about it, I don't think it did.

Do not lose hope! Keep at it! Internships are valuable experience, but they are not end-all-be-all. What's important is perseverance."

I'm pursuing a second BS in CS which will take me 2 years to complete. Unfortunately, this gives me only 1 summer to obtain an internship. I'm really worried that one internship isn't significant enough to land a first strong job. I'm inclined to work for a big 4 company (I know) post-graduation. Is there anyway that I can take up a part-time or a full-time internship during either the Fall or Spring semester? Perhaps take a semester off to work as an intern and delay my graduation? Is this something that's possible? Thank you!"

I am a long time lurker of /r/tifu subreddit and recently discovered this forum.. So firstly, I'm really great to know that there is a place to share my feelings and get response from understanding people, that are dealing with same or similar issues as mine. It's my first post here so please don't flame me if I do anything wrong.

I hope my story will encourage other people to fight for their life without Nparents and also I hope to get some advices, because I'm not fully through my struggle.

So back in the childhood my mom was the real N, it was until I decided to move out and study in University in another city, which later appeared to be one of my biggest mistakes, but it is not relevant at this point of story. She has never supported me, controlled me all the time, verbal abuses were so terrible I can't even quote it because my brain erased them, they varied from insulting my mental capacity, to my looks. My confidence as an teenager was around level 6 foot under ground. After I graduated my bachelor degree (3 years studies in another city, living separately from my parents and finally being able to breath like a human being) due to some circumstances which led me to taking a loan and struggling through the last semester I decided to go back to my hometown and join 2 year major in University in my city. 

Because of loan I had to take a job, my Ndad (Edad in childhood) offered me a job in his company, for money that let me pay the loan and live normally, of course at this point he didn't know about my debt. 

Working was just... just terrible, he has never taken me seriously, all my ideas were stupid when I came up with them, but after approx. 1 month he heard them he started to present to me mine ideas as his own and saying ""its brilliant isnt it? Why didnt you come up with this?"" I was doing everything wrong in his eyes and my confidence was just shrinking and shrinking, I felt like total failure, living day by day, started to smoke weed to feel better, didnt pay attention to my looks, ate everything I wanted, what lead me to total mental mess and depression and obesity.

One day I promised myself I have to change it, I cant live like that anymore, Im killing myself and people that should try to get me out of my troubles were just helping me to dig my own grave. My father discovered that I have a loan, he started to control me financially what, as you can imagine, just made everything worse. I was able to explain to myself that I cant do anything now, if I stop working for him I wont be able to pay the loan. My Edad was using it as a leverage to keep me under total control (I can see it now, couldnt see it before). He made me a co-owner, didnt accept that I want to change job, used to say that I cant do it, I cant pay me debts if I change it. And I believed that, he destroyed my self-confidence so much that I believed that. 

I forced myself to start working out my obesity, I lost 25kg in 6 months, I could feel some confidence flowing in me. After this I decided to make a new promise to myself, that I will not let them get to my mind anymore, and maybe because of my financial situation Im not able to go NC now, but this day will come. I worked in my Ndad company, did what I was told to do, shut my mind to myself, I was erasing everything that was insulting me. I focused on my gym workouts, on my studies and when I felt confident enough I started to search for an escape route. 

My University is offering some international internships, I scrolled through last minute offers and found one, that suits my major and most importantly the internship is taking place in a country that is 10 000km from my hometown, moreover coming to this country- China- was always my dream.

I gave it a shot. I sent my application, in total secret. I started saving money for ticket. After 2 months  I received their acceptance. I freaked out, I started to panic that I wont manage (my self confidence issues I guess). I felt that its the last moment to do something that will keep me on my route before i totally loose it, maybe it wasnt wise, but it worked for me- I tattooed myself a reminder, a symbol of changes (not important what it is, for more curious ppl please contact me), so everytime I thought about dropping my idea I looked on it and recalled the moment that made me do it. It gave me strength. I didnt tell anything to my parents until 1 month from departure. I have to say, I really enjoyed their facial expressions, my mom was even slightly prod, my dad however.. oh how pissed off he was. I know it's wrong, but I really like to recall that moment.

And now here I am. 10000km away, doing things that I love, enjoying every single day of my internship, weed free for 3 months. I even managed to extend it to 6 months instead of 3. I barely contact my parents, and when I do, for example to tell them that my projects are going to be produced and its kind of a big deal, that im successful here all my mom say is ""thats good, thats great"" and my father didnt fucking compliment me single time. Not even once, but fuck it, I dont care anymore and I just cherish every moment I have here, without all the shit that they used to pour on my head. I pay my loan, its not easy because Im not earning a lot during internship, but its ok, I know new opportunities will come after it and I can live normally. 

Every single person that is reading it and has similar issues- stop justifying your parents. There is not a single reason they can act like this. They may say they do it because they love you and its better for you. Well IT IS NOT. You dont deserve it. If someone truly loves somebody he isnt throwing shit at him while he is already drowning in it. Make a plan, keep your mind shut from them, struggle, fight your demons and win, nothing comes easy but trust me, the relief you will feel and the boost to self-confidence is just... unimaginable. Do it to prove them who was right, but MOST IMPORTANTLY to prove yourself that you are a worthy human being, because you are. 

And...
Well as great as I am feeling now and as much as I enjoy this time I start to worry about my comeback. In 2 and a half month I have to come back to my hometown, I have to finish my degree, continue paying off my loan and escape once again. I dont have much savings at this point, so probably I will have to live with them again. Damn, I feel terrible when I think about it. Redditors what you think? I have several ideas, but Im not sure what to do. Im thinking about having a serious conversation with my father about work and telling them that he has to ""unmake"" me the co-owner of company, that i do not want to work for him and I quit. I want to move out at the same time, because I really don't think that living together is a good idea, but... I have to finish my major ASAP so I can come back to China, or to any other place in the World and continue my path, I have only to write my final thesis and present it, but I think I will be stuck in my hometown at least until September at least (3 months). I can do it the easy way- work with father and write thesis while doing it, live with them and just survive the 3 months somehow, or the hard way- find a new job, move out to my friends apartment and fucking struggle the 3 months financially, but keep my mental health in good shape. Or maybe you have some ideas? 

At the end I would like to say sorry, I know that this post is totally messed up but I get really emotional when I think about all that happened to me, and that is going to happen, so I hope you understood the most important things. Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR: My Nparents destroyed my mentally, was able to get through it, change my life and moved out 10000km away, now Im affraid of coming back"

I am a University of Central Florida senior graduating in May. I am looking to leave behind Florida and begin my next chapter in Colorado, developing and challenging my software development skills.

I have had an internship at Siemens developing software for Rail software (software that orchestrates interlockings, detects movement of the trains, and also controls pedestrian crossings at light rail intersections).

After my internship I developed time-saving software that automated a manual task required for documenting rail software. I went back and presented it to Siemens, showed them how it will save them valuable hours for their Engineers, and then transferred the source code and software to them and trained their employees in its use. I believe this experience demonstrates my self-motivation and desire to solve problems.

Please visit [this link](http://i.imgur.com/25fWctR.png) for my full (anonimized) resume.

I am very passionate about moving to Colorado and am determined to start the next chapter of my life in your beautiful state. I am mainly looking at Denver or Boulder and any of the surrounding L cities. 

Thanks for your time!"
2zfw0g,0,2015-03-18,I [22/M] cheated on my girlfriend (21/F) of 5 years. I'm confused.,KaptainEgo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zfw0g/i_22m_cheated_on_my_girlfriend_21f_of_5_years_im/,"I promise I am not a horrible person


Backstory. I have been dating this girl since I was 17 in high school. She is my first real adult relationship. She took my virginity and is the only person I have had sex with. She was with me when my father passed away 6 days after my birthday when I was 18. We both go to the same college together. 3 years ago she broke up with me for 4 months randomly. It destroyed me. In those 4 months she got another boyfriend and had sex with him. I joined a fraternity and made a lot of friends but did not have sex with anyone else. She ended up coming back and begged for me to give her another chance. I did.


Since then we have been pretty good. Argument every now and then but nothing serious. There was one night for my friends birthday I went downtown with them and got SUPER drunk and made out with another girl. I do not remember the incident I was told about it. I did not tell her. I also stopped drinking for a little. This happened about 1.5 years ago.


Then spring break happened last week. I was going on my last spring break with 2 of my buddies before we graduate. My girlfriend was going to come but she is going to school to be a teacher and did not have the same spring break as us. We have been living long distance for about 6 months due to her internship semeseter being about an hour and a half away she moved over there. Things had been a little rocky with her becoming more insecure and demanding of me to be more clingy. This had never been a problem before.


Right before we board the ship she has one of these fights with me. She says that I do not talk about our future enough and it makes her think I do not want it and makes her feel bad talking about it. I tell her no its fine I just need to focus on other things now like graduating and finding a job/internship. I should also add that she has been hinting at wanting to get proposed to for a while. She says we do not have to get married but she wants a ring.


So the cruise is going well for the first 6 nights. My two buddies and I are getting sufficiently drunk and making new friends but I am not crossing any boundaries at all. Then the last night comes. We meet these 2 girls who are in their last year of law school. We met them earlier in the week but only talked to them for about 15 minutes before we ran off to some show. Well we proceed to talk more and then we start drinking together. One of the girl's favorite drinks is tennesse honey whiskey. That happens to be mine as well so we bond over that and start hanging out. We then spend the rest of the night together just talking and enjoying ourselves. I was having more fun then I had had in years. She was smart, cute, interesting and seemed interested in me. We then start making out and spend the rest of the night together counting down til we have to get off the ship. We do not have sex. 


We then go our seperate ways. I did not get this girls number or information which I am not sure if I regret yet or not. One of my friends got the other girls number that he was hanging out with. We get off the ship and now I have been home for 3 days. I saw my girlfriend for about an hour when I first got back but she had something else to do and I was still nauseous from not yet being adjusted to the land again. I now am not sure what I should do. I am so hot and cold with thinking about leaving her. I have never really been without her except those 4 months. She is so important to me and I really do love her. I just feel like I am not being fair to her in this relationship. I'm not sure what to think really.


TL;DR I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years. Feelings have been weird. Cheated. Feel like horrible person. Dont know what to do."

This is my 2nd internship and I do have one other offer (comparable to my current offer). 

Do I have room to negotiate here? If so, how do I go about doing this? Do I email HR who sent me the offer letter or my manager or both? Also, is it wise to ask for an extension on the offer reply? I have a few more interviews and offers that I'm waiting to hear back from."

2zg2c0,10,2015-03-18,Girlfriend does not want me traveling for dream internship,Dreamadreamkid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2zg2c0/girlfriend_does_not_want_me_traveling_for_dream/,"Where to begin...

I'm graduating in May with two degrees in a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Art. Recently, I've received news that I landed an internship (8-10 weeks) at one of my dream companies. While I may not be necessarily performing the job I desire, it's still an amazing opportunity that interests me. Well, I brought it up to my girlfriend tonight and she was upset to say the least.

First, the internship is on the West Coast and we both go to school on the East Coast. Even though I'm stoked for the internship, this part somewhat scares me--being alone across country and all. Next, it happens to conflict with one of her relatives because they are highly interested in the same subject and will view this as a showboating move. Likewise, her entire family will most likely have some sort of anger towards the entire situation. To be honest, this wouldn't be the first time either--there's a history of said relative taking everything competitively and it's kind of put a small, but noticeable wedge between me and her entire family. Third, she isn't thrilled that the summer will not be spent physically near each other. Honestly, I feel her pain on this. We're best friends, and the thought of being away for this amount of time sickens me too.

I've explained to her that it's temporary being an internship and all. She's more than compable to understand that it's a dream spot of mine. However, despite every method of trying to align, she's set on yielding our 5+ year relationship if I leave.

I'm baffled and unsure. I can't sleep. I need help. I love her, but I so badly want this internship.

EDIT: I should add that we spend nearly every day together. In a way, it's taken us away from our social life. We have friends that we see often, but we definitely spend more time together alone than we do with other people. 

UPDATE: Going to try and get some sleep. Will update in the morning when I tell her that I'm definitely going to take it. I can't see it going well at all... Thanks for the advice to those that sent it, I'll answer any other ones tomorrow morning.

UPDATE 2: Morning everyone. Just want to say that I appreciate all the feedback. Also, wanted to clarify a few more things. 1) I wouldn't leave for the internship until June. 2) My girlfriend and I had plans to go away right before the internship on a getaway, but of course with this coming up she no longer sees that as a viable option. 3) We definitely love each other. It might sound skewed in the posting, but I think what attracts her most to me (other than her personality and beauty) is her consistent loyal to me and the relationship. As for her relatives, I love them too and basically grew up with them caring for me because I'm always at their house.

With all this in mind, I'm most likely to tell her that I'm taking the internship. She made it clear yesterday that she'll need space until I can give her an answer, so I'm sure it's over if I tell her today. Though, I have to work all day, and I might only be able to tell her via text while she's at work. Should I do that or is that a bad idea?"

This calls all existing world-religions extremely into question.

Quote of /u/politicaldan's [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/2zeq8b/do_you_not_believe_that_the_quran_is_the_word_of/cpijj5n):

&gt; In my junior year of college, my esteemed roommate Joe Boo (weed be upon him) and I made our own religion to pass the time in our Philosophy of Religion class. At first, it was a joke. Boo (WBUH) would write down ideas and laws, and I, being the more creative one, would turn them into ""scripture."" Boo said it started when he got a revelation from the Coke machine that ""since Joseph Smith invented his religion, and his name was Joseph too, he could invent his own religion too.""

&gt; I was his first prophet and everyday, he came to class with a new ""inspiration"" and I had several ""prophetic voices."" We ended up filling an entire notebook, because it was fun, we were bored, and the teacher was 180 and never gave tests except the midterm or final.

&gt; Soon, we had people coming to class just to hear what the new revelations were. So we decided to put it all on a blog, and brought in a third prophet to make some really cool artwork for it and make the blog look professional and serious. We never thought anyone would take it seriously, as farting at night under the covers was considered an act of worship.

&gt; Much to our surprise, after about six months, we had a membership of about 100 people. These people were actually discussing our ""doctrine"". I had no idea who about half of them were.

&gt; The next summer, a little under a year from when we started, there were over two thousand people from ten different countries. Someone translated the doctrine pages into Russian and Korean.

&gt; Sometime during that semester, as we were dealing with hosting issues due to bandwidth, there was the start of schism. Boo (WBUH) had long since quit caring about the religion, so I, nerd that I was, was pretty much de facto spiritual head of a burgeoning new movement. The schism was over some crazy doctrinal matter, like do priests automatically go to Origami 7 (the highest form of heaven) or do they need to serve ten thousand days in a lower origami? People were actually legitimately and seriously arguing this. It became a matter of why be a follower when if you can be a priest you can go straight to heaven? (Although, the rites for priesthood were....interesting. It involved indian sitar music, axe deodorant, a lighter and us losing our security deposit and the high priest having to explain a serious burn to the emergency room). These disputes went on for some time. Both boo and I graduated and began to do other things. Every once in a while, I would check in on ""my"" religion.

&gt; Long story short, the Pro-Priestly Rights people threatened to break away and form their own group. It was at this moment, I realized this wasn't funny anymore. I gave a Sacred and Royal Order of the Nation Decree that this was all a joke. Two college students invented this. One of them was married and had kids. Another was praying to anyone but his roommate that he could land an internship.

&gt; A lot of people left. A lot of people stayed.

&gt; ""To you it might be a joke. But it's real. It's meaningful. The Elder Josephus was on to something. He received a revelation but didn't quite know how to interpret it. It was passed on to us.""

&gt; I deleted the forums and the blog and everything in it. I'm convinced if I hadn't, in another thousand years, it would have been a legitimate mainstream religion and former followers of Boocephasism would be on reddit glad they left, but still worried about going to Sudoku in the afterlife while their parents urged them to come back to the Elder Josephus and follow his words and break the night wind with all the other faithful."

I don't exactly know how to start this. It's been almost a year since my younger brother committed suicide which accidentally lead to the death of my father. I always knew he was often sad, maybe depressed but since going to college, I didn't contact him much so the event was a shot in the gut.

I am currently a junior in college at a ""top tier"" university. Throughout high school, I struggled with depression inwardly. I never had any close friends/still don't. I have friends who are generally all very positive, intelligent and for the most part happy with life. 

Regardless of the university, I'm currently struggling to get an internship for the summer (which contributes significantly to this I believe?). The friends I've mentioned have all secured their internships with some extremely prestigious companies. (I honestly don't know if/why they associate with me.)

I mentioned that I've struggled with depression for a long time. I always attributed to my lack of a significant other/lack of career opportunities. In high school, the former led me to thoughts of suicide but I managed to overcome it by almost suppressing the urge. In college, the urge remained dormant until this year, the trigger being my friends getting SO's and internships. 

After hearing what happened, I honestly just suppressed the emotions because I knew I couldn't handle facing it mentally. (I still don't think I've truly opened up that Pandora's Box.) 

I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm sad that I can't hug anyone when I feel like dying. I'm sad that I'm an idiot who can't get an internship. I'm sad that I've wasted these years of college being depressed and antisocial. I'm sad every time I see a couple. I'm sad every time I get a rejection letter. 

In front of others, I always maintain some semblance of  happiness. Though I think some of my friends know of the tragedies, I have not talked to anyone about it. 

I don't know what to do anymore. If I don't get an internship for the summer, I'm fucked. I already wasted my college years so I'm fucked socially. As a person, I'm probably extremely generic and mundane to talk to. I just don't know why I exist as a person anymore. "
2zgsk3,1,2015-03-18,"Looking for a dev job, getting only offers for mixed profiles.",Neuromante,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zgsk3/looking_for_a_dev_job_getting_only_offers_for/,"I'm going to summarize the story so far:

* Got a CS degree out of interest on making videogames/programming.
* Started working on personal projects with some friends as soon as I got the degree. Loved to code.
* Every single games company in my country asked for previous experience (i.e. two games already in google play).
* Accepted an internship on a multinational, on an IT position, most for the name that for the chances of interesting job.
* Did not really liked the job. Managed to pull some development, left after the internship ended as no development positions were open.
* Ended the internship, landed a job for a contractor developing in Java.
* Job turns out to be progressively more and more ""ops"" and less and less ""dev"".
* Got laid off after talking to my boss about me being more interested in development that the current direction our team was heading.
* Looking for job in Java, everywhere asks for experience with Spring, Struts and Hibernate.
* Went back to the writing table at home while unemployed, making a game in Unity.

So, I like to code. I like to make games, I know that the industry right now is terrible (specially in my country) and that going indie is the best way to not get enough money to pay the rent. Thus, I'm using the time between jobs to finish the game and ""see what happens"", but reality keeps knocking on my door.

I've done several interviews. Most are asking for someone junior who knows java, mysql, html, javascript, css and a list of derived technologies so long is laughable, and I'm talking about the interviewer asking me for knowledge on several technologies I've used few times over the last years. I've used the card of ""I'm interested in learning this stuff"" so many times that it seems an automated answer, and I've ended up angry after interviews in which the interviewer was asking me how did I accessed through Java to a mysql database 2 and half years ago.

On the other side, devops positions, the closest I got to an actual offer (Even ended up rejecting one). You got to ""touch metal"", got to travel (yeah, work travel! /s) a lot, earn few money and spend the majority of your time messing with configuration files. Then, from time to time, you get to code a bit.

The last one is a QA position that has some development thrown around as it seems some of the tools used are internal. Is the first interview in which I've heard ""yeah, you can learn hibernate here, as the tool uses it"", but I'm worried about ending up running jUnit tests, filling reports and not getting code written. Both the contractor (here in my country is everything about contractors) and the client had told me that the position will become more development-centered in a while and a lot of good stuff about the position that to me sounded like corporate bullshit.

So... now I'm wondering, on one side, if there is any chance on getting a simple, java, C# or even C++ development position without having to get to the operative/implantation level, and on the other side, if a mostly QA position with some (undefined) coding tasks and with a (closed source) framework using an interesting technology could be good for my career towards learning and getting better in Java or in coding in general.

I know that I can keep making my small game and publish it. Even if no one gives a dime for it, I have something done to show, and something to learn from (and that's what I've been doing since I got laid off, recovering the illusion for coding), and I don't really want to get (again) into a position that will leave me in a year without anything cool to say in my cv about technologies I used or stuff I coded.

Right now money ""is not a problem"", given I have savings and enough to sustain me for a decent amount of time, but I know that each day that I don't get to work in a ""real"" company, damage is being done. So... I'm basically puzzled on what to do. Any suggestions?"

So initially I was working on a personal idea which is prototyped and functional, I applied to some accelerators and didn't get anything back, although they didn't tell me what happened, I think the main issue was lack of a founding team and how much I would be able to execute on my own which is not enough, so I thought to look for people with ideas to together help their dream company to move forward.
    
I found this guy employee of a company that I have joined as an intern and we have been talking for a while about entrepreneurship and after mentioning my project to him, he brought up an Idea (great and tangible) that he had worked on for a while and that he wanted to get it going but life got in the way, so after many talks I came to him and ask if he would like to work on that Idea, and that we would together give a time to get more expertise to build the idea and that we will have equal vote but at the end of the day he would have the final say as to sell the company or not. He accepted!

So we started working and his life is very busy with wife and kids and work, where I don't think he has enough time to give to the project, he misses goals and timelines that we establish and once in a while I feel that he is really trying but it seems that he has way too much on his plate even though he wants to make it work. 
  
I prefer to think that things are very hard for him to manage but sometimes it strikes the feeling that he might have tried to work on this project for so many times that today he is a little laid back about making this work.

To disclose on my side I must say that I am very passionate about whatever I do and I also cannot avoid the fact that I expect equal devotion from my partners and I thought that by joining someone else Idea I would find the drive, the passion on them. How can I trigger that on my partner and bring him back to believe on the success of his own dream which now is my dream as well?

Anyone who was in the same situation before?"

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Pretty much exclusively gaming biggest thing is that I want to be able to play project cars on 1080p and at least 60fps with as close to ultra settings as possible as well as other racing games. I know that Pcars isn't out yet but this is the goal

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Absolute maximum is $1000 but would prefer to stick around $800

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Would like to build when I have a parts list but if I should wait for a new product (hearing a lot about the AMD 300 series) then I can do that as I make more money in the summer anyway and I currently have a ps4 to keep me occupied 

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

I wouldn't need an OS monitor keyboard or mouse right away as I have an OS and I can use my TV for now as well as my keyboard and mouse as I will most likely be using a controller for games anyway.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Pennsylvania Microcenter about 2 hours away but might be heading that way anyway in a week or so

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Reusing a wireless keyboard an mouse for now as well as an element 720p 60hz tv for now

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Know little of OCing but have heard its not too hard would be something I might be interested in if it gets me the most bang for my buck

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I hear SSDs are very convenient for at least an OS and favorite game

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Not really but I will be moving in the next couple months so something durable 

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

No

I am currently an undergrad student with a great paying internship and plan on pursuing grad school and would like a machine that can play at least Pcars better than what my ps4 will be able to do. Wouldn't mind spending a little extra on a MOBO in order to crossfiring/sli in the future to potentially save money to gain performance. Also I should note that I am planning on purchasing everything through prime unless massive savings can be had going to the microcenter"

So I'm currently in my second year here studying computer science. I started off with high hopes of learning a lot of programming, and in some sense I have! However, this semester I'm beginning to have my doubts in this program. I find myself scrambling to pass an exam rather than take the time to actually learn and gain a quality education. I’m learning more from the internet than from my actual professor, which makes me question why I’m paying money to take these classes when I could learn it for free. Also, I’ve not found the time to get involved in any organizations or work on any outside coding projects. Part of that may be due to lack of self motivation to do these things, but I do know that being drowned in schoolwork does not help either. What ever the case I know, I know I’m missing out on a lot of opportunities that this university offers.

I’m at a point where I think I need to make a really important choice in what I want to study. If I stay in computer science I’ll be taking digital logic over the summer and take data structures, numerical analysis and start my electives in the fall. If I go this route, by the end of the fall semester, I think I’ll be too deep in computer science that I might as well finish it. Or I could start working on a new major. The one that grabs my eye the most is the BA in Information systems.

Luckily for me I have all my gen eds done, some critical tracking classes completed, and with a little bit of shifting, some classes from comp. science will count towards a ISOM degree. So with all that in consideration, if I take some summer classes, I think I’ll have roughly half a degree done. Now heres the part where I ask questions. Feel free to answer whatever question you can best answer.

The classes I plan on taking over the summer are: macroeconomics (summer B), financial accounting (summer A), and managerial accounting (summer B). Thoughts and suggestions on taking these in a 6 week period and online? I’ve never taken any business class here, so I don’t know much about which classes are hard or which professors to look out for (good and bad
For grads: What is the job market like after graduation? I know for computer science, a degree in this field almost guarantees a good starting job. I’ve done some research and it seems like a lot of jobs that would be geared towards ISOM graduates say they require a comp sci. degree. If this is the case, does this make it harder for a an ISOM graduate to get a job if they are competing with comp sci majors?
I still want to keep programming a possible career path. Despite my struggles in computer science, I still believe that I can learn a lot on my own by working on projects outside of school and getting internships in the field. I think that it is possible to build your resume that showcases your programming skills despite not pursuing a computer science degree. Is it common for ISOM majors to pursue programming jobs after graduation?  Or is it vital to have a computer science degree to get a job in the field.

Sorry for the semi rant at the beginning, but any info is greatly appreciated."

2. For grads: What is the job market like after graduation? I know for computer science, a degree in this field almost guarantees a good starting job. I’ve done some research and it seems like a lot of jobs that would be geared towards ISOM graduates say they require a comp sci. degree. If this is the case, does this make it harder for a an ISOM graduate to get a job if they are competing with comp sci majors?

3. I still want to keep programming a possible career path. Despite my struggles in computer science, I still believe that I can learn a lot on my own by working on projects outside of school and getting internships in the field. I think that it is possible to build your resume that showcases your programming skills despite not pursuing a computer science degree. Is it common for ISOM majors to pursue programming jobs after graduation?  Or is it vital to have a computer science degree to get a job in the field.

Sorry for the semi rant at the beginning, but any info is greatly appreciated."

Looking for the solution and entrance into fund families",DTon772,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2zh3b8/econ_grad_low_gpa_weak_experience_looking_for_the/,"So basically my first two years of college were spent without the slightest regard to my academic success or plans for a future career and as such my GPA went lower and lower and I never seeked out any internships. I grew up one day, and for the past year and a half have a 3.5, and iv managed to get A's in classes such as Mathmatical economics and econometrics. When I graduate my GPA will most likely be about a 2.7, and my school is not considered prestigious outside of my state (Florida state university). I know I have no real chance of breaking into finance with my current resume, and I'm hoping you all can shed some light as to the best path to take to correct my past mistakes that are dragging me down. The only offers iv recieved are from shady looking firms where I would probably be manning phones all day and pushing shitty products down everyone's  throat.. 

 First off I'm most likely going to intern with a large insurance company, who would sponsor me for my series exams to broker various mutual funds and ETFs in the fall if I make it through the summer(selling life insurance to family, friends, and anything with a pulse). ALTERNATIVELY I could maybe intern at a family friends boutique firm that focuses on quant trading, as they trust my intelligence is above that which my GPA indicates. Also I have a first round interview as a corporate actions analyst at Franklin, but I dont trust my resume to survive HR. Which would you suggest I pursue?

Second, I have been looking into going straight into grad school, as there are several programs that base admissions on your last 60 hours gpa, which is the only way I could get in to an even semi respectable program. What iv read is that going for an MSF is basically hitting the reset button, but I believe my case is bad enough that it's neccesary. Thoughts on that?

Lastly: the CFA. Do I go for it? Or will it not help with a GPA as low as mine.. I plan on doing it right now, as I feel I need all the help I can get, but any thoughts in that would be appreciated.

I'm very driven and focused on breaking into finance, I am willing to do whatever it takes but have become concerned that I may do the wrong things and waste my time and money while getting no closer to employment. I am currently most interested in emerging markets, but my exposure to the way all the various departments work is minimal and based on what I read i can't truly make an educated decision about where exactly I'd like to end up.

What would you suggest I do from here!"

* *Poison Fruit* by Jacqueline Carey
* *Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe* by Fannie Flagg

I feel like most of the books I've read this year have only been okay.

My **favorite fiction book was *White Teeth*.** I really enjoyed the ""hysterical realism"" style, because it both felt real to me and made me laugh out loud at the absurdity of everything. It was a very well written book that told an engaging story with multiple plotlines following a variety of zany-yet-convincing characters.

It's harder to say what my **favorite non-fiction** was, but it's probably ***In Cold Blood***. It's a book that launched a whole new genre. It's written in evocative language; Capote captures the feel of the small town Midwest. It's suspenseful and engaging. Runners-up in nonfiction are *Five Days at Memorial* and *The Path to Power*.

The **worst novel I read was *Poison Fruit* by Jacqueline Carey**. It was a huge disappointment, because her Kushiel series is one of my favorite fantasy series of all time. But this book was just badly written. It was full of out-of-place, forced pop-culture references. One of the characters spoke in what was one of the most badly written Southern accents I have ever come across (it consisted of changing ""you"" to ""yuh"" and ""maybe"" to ""mebbe"". Yes, that's it. No, that's not how people from the South talk). It read like a failed genre parody with some serious bits spliced in. Hopefully, her next book will be better, because I know she can do better than this. :-/

The **worst non-fiction book was *Terror in the Balance* by Posner &amp; Vermeule**. It was a panegyric to presidential powers that was clearly written as a justification of the actions taken by the Bush administration in the war on terror. It passes for scholarship, but I certainly wouldn't hold it up as an example of *rigorous* scholarship. The most frustrating thing was their refusal to consider history, brushing it off as totally unknowable when it suits them yet also using it to cherry-pick examples of their own. At one point they literally say they can't judge the decision to intern Japanese Americans because we can't know what the people in charge were thinking... There are literally entire library shelves of books about exactly who was thinking and doing what, how this decision was made, how racism distorted people's thinking, how difficult this made the lives of Japanese Americans, the legal questions involved, and so on. But no, you're just going to go with ""we don't know, we can't judge""???

2zh7k1,0,2015-03-18,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2zh7k1/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

I was wondering if there'd be any HCI graduate students on here available to discuss the program. Anything from admission to actual course content etc. 

Based on previous (self-taught) experience, I was recruited into the product design studio of a Fortune 500 company at the start of my freshman year, where I still work now as a junior. Will likely continue working here until I graduate. Did freelance UI design before that and have an internship offer from a well-known Silicon Valley firm for this summer. While the interfaces I design are fine, I feel like I am missing a lot of the core HCI knowledge to properly support my design decisions. I believe this is something where the HCI program at CMU could be very valuable to me. 

I've done one related HCI research project and assisted in teaching the HCI course taught at my university. Other than that I've done quite a few (self-initiated) side-projects involving both design and programming. My programming skills are at the level where they are good enough to hack something together, not good enough to be qualified as a solid programmer.  

My GPA is hovering between 3.6 - 3.8, with two B's and one C which I feel would really kill me in the admission process. Rest is all A's. Studying at an average European university. 

I'm on the fence between HCI at CMU and Artificial Intelligence here in Europe (where I have a guaranteed admission). I don't feel like AI is a 100% fit since I am not a hardcore beta student. 

Any recommendations, tips regarding admission, information on how HCI @ CMU would supplement or not supplement my current skills would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! "

I was exploratory for the first year in college, and then through some research, panic, and pressure, I switched into Food science and then Dietetics as a major; I'm currently in my sophomore year. 
I find nutrition/nutrition-related classes interesting, and I recently got offered a 2 year internship under a RD at a nearby hospital AND should be beginning volunteer time with another RD at my school. So were I to continue on this path, I seem to have it pretty good. 

However, I'm noticing that I don't really eat healthy myself: I enjoy eating out way too much, I eat sweets and snacks a lot and seem to not really control it much. Although I do incorporate fruits/vegetables/low fat dairies/whole grains into my diet, I feel i don't eat an overall healthy diet (probably on the unhealthy side more) even with my awareness of ""healthy"" foods.
I think I chose Dietetics out of necessity at first, then the prospect of a variety of jobs being open for me. I also have no clue what other major I would go into or career would be right for me if I didn't do this. It just seems like everything would point to me being a dietitian EXCEPT my own personal eating habits. 
I've told family/friends this and they keep saying its fine, there are plenty of doctors who smoke and athletic trainers who are unfit. But I can't help but feel bad, like I don't deserve this career path and couldn't advise others when I can't fix myself. 

I am currently lost and going back and forth everyday from being super excited for my career and completely dreading it or feeling guilty. I'm an emotional wreck from deciding on a major: changing my major would be really hard to catch up on classes and would be a huge missed opportunity to have a great intern experience(getting to see how it all applies in real life), but staying on this path just makes me feel horrible for every eating decision I make. 

 How can I keep my sanity, and would you say that working towards getting an RD license doesn't require you to change your lifestyle, at least in certain career paths (I know there are many ways you can use an RD license outside of clinical use)?

Also, this is like my first reddit post, so please excuse me if I'm being unclear, I just needed to get this out somewhere. "

I'm very good at math. I have a bachelors in Actuarial Science as well as four exams and an internship (This basically means I could become a professional actuary). For nearly my entire life I assumed I would do something with my quantitative skills as my primary occupation, because I've been told how good I am with anything quantitative for as long as I can remember (Example: I skipped most of Calc 2 because the professor would call on me over and over again and still got an A. When I went for the final he pulled me aside, invited me to his symposium, and told me I had a rare talent for mathematics. I didn't go)

I'm not just saying this to stroke myself off, it's pretty important to the story. The reason is that I really couldn't give a rats ass about math. I enjoy programming and using excel, but I almost never choose to use them in my spare time, only when it's necessary for something I'm trying to do (For example I made a database to game the odds on an online gambling site recently to make some money). I can't remember ever picking up a math textbook out of personal interest in my entire life. I had thought it was important to use my abilities (Since they are, statistically at least, quite exceptional), but I've been out of school for two years and haven't found a full-time job as an actuary, and I'm starting to think the main reason is because I don't care at all about being one, or being a mathematician in general. (And to give some context and dispel the notion that I'm some kind of genius, I dropped out of college five times and semi-intentionally destroyed my gpa. Natural talent is not success)

Remember all the skipped classes (I intentionally registered for classes that required the least number of attended days, and generally only attended the tests)? A lot of that time I was in the two university libraries reading psychology books. Initially I took an interest through screenwriting (I've written four feature-length screenplays and been employed mostly as a writer since graduation), but after awhile I came to enjoy the research more than the writing itself. I can remember sitting in the library for entire days until it closed, then checking out eight different books so I could make sure my character's personality models made sense. Slowly I stopped caring about writing, but I'd guess I've read more academic psychology books than your average graduate student (Almost the complete works of Jung and Maslow, a good chunk of Freud, Eysenck, and Skinner, as well as a number of books on anything that interested me, especially the psychology of personality and emotion, as well as dissociative/psychotic disorders and any disorder that seemed psychosomatic).

I read a lot, and almost everything I read is either academic psychology or Buddhism, and the side of Buddhism I enjoy is basically psychology. I find that I naturally engender peoples trust; most of my friends and some of my acquaintances seem to come to me first with their troubles, and I have a relationship with ~4 people that is almost exactly that of a therapist-client, where 100% of our conversations involve their problems and my advice. I end up talking about psychology when it's totally irrelevant to what's going on. About a month ago I talked to a woman on an online dating website who had been in graduate school for psychiatry, and we just talked about industrial issues, psychology and academia for quite awhile. She eventually told me that she was seeing someone and wasn't replying to most messages, but she had to reply to mine because she so rarely gets to discuss those topics.

I have a friend who experiences both panic attacks and psychotic episodes. She's known me for twelve years and trusts me more than her psychologists. Most of the time I tell her what to bring up in sessions or things to mention, but if she has an attack she calls me immediately and I'm pretty sure my success rate in calming her down is 100%, I've talked her down from genuine psychosis to reality in about ten minutes over the phone. If I recall correctly I've talked five different people down from panic attacks, one of which I barely knew.

Despite the fact that I've spent my entire adult life moving towards a career in mathematics, all of my free time indicates an interest in a career in psychology, and my personality and natural demeanor seem naturally suited to work in therapy or something of the sort.

I would make this shorter, but I need to be at work soon, my apologies. To anyone with some sort of a background in academic/applied psychology, I have a few questions:

1) (Not joking) Do I sound like the kind of person who should pursue a career in psychology? I first gave this notion serious consideration today, and I don't know everything about myself or the industry, so I may be missing some key information.

2) If I choose to pursue a graduate degree in psychology, what can I best do to prepare for an application? If I remember correctly I wasn't even allowed to take 3000-level psych classes, but despite no academic record in psychology I could easily explain my interest/relative competence in an essay. For what it's worth I could get an acceptable score on the GRE (Perfect math, 75th~percentile verbal), and my father is the associate dean of his college, so I may have some academic advice/connections, although it wouldn't be anything to do with psychology. (He's in agribusiness)

3) What's your favorite psychology book? I always need new stuff to read, mine's Motivation and Personality by Maslow. His chapter on love in self-actualizing people is a beautiful intersection of psychology, art, and theology.

4) Is there anything I should know beyond what I will obviously find out doing google research? I haven't done this yet (Work soon...), but it'll be the first thing I do when I get home. Any things people often don't think about or know that should be mentioned?

5) How restrictive are the codes guiding the conduct of professional therapists? Not misconduct, but rather how free are you to determine your own methods to treat patients? I have a pretty astounding success rate using guided meditation to talk people down from panic attacks for example, but if I remember correctly it's not common practice (Or at least it wasn't, most of the books I read were from the 80's~90's and before). Even if that specific example is totally fine, how restricted are your treatment methods in general? Liberal (Don't do anything that you believe would likely cause harm to the patient) or Restrictive (You can use Therapy A or Therapy B, maybe Therapy C pending council review, or send them to a psychiatrist)?

6) How's the job market for therapists, and are there any other jobs I may not know about that resemble individual therapy that I may be interested? (I doubt I'd be interested in becoming a professional academic or working in psychological research)

I'm sure that was too long and poorly edited, but thank you to anyone who reads this and responds. "
2zhwwe,1,2015-03-18,Summer Internship - Accenture or National Lab,zs2212221,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zhwwe/summer_internship_accenture_or_national_lab/,"I'm graduating in December 2015, so I was able to qualify for summer internships and somehow got a few. In both places where I might intern, they extend full offers some of the interns, so I'd like to choose a place where I'd want to work full time soon.

I have currently two internships offers and I would like other's opinions on which one I should pick. I have family I need to take care of, so I plan on staying local, around the Central Valley (Sacramento-Modesto area) or Bay Area in California.

1) Accenture - The location is in Sacramento and I'd be doing consulting work. I'm not too excited about this, but I feel like I'd have a lot of opportunity to advance in my career. But being a consultant, I'd have to travel a lot, something which I'd prefer not to do, but I would if I can advance my career further. I'd might want to be a manager some day.

2) Lawerence Livermore National Labs - They have a really good intern program with lots of learning opportunities and the pay (both as an intern and full time) is better. I'm leaning heavily on this one. My only concern is that I won't be able to advance my career that much as a worker here. I fear that after working here for 4-5 years, I'll be at a disadvantage over others and be forced to stay here. I'd eventually want to go to the Bay Area.

Thanks again."
2zi0l3,1,2015-03-18,I'm taking a very different path than most people in my class and I'm not sure whether I'm excited or nervous,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2zi0l3/im_taking_a_very_different_path_than_most_people/,"I graduated recently from a program out of high school that is kind of a fixed career pathway (most students have the same knowledge/end up working in the same jobs). I actually never was truly sure if this is what I wanted to do all my life. I've been interested in so many random things since I was a young kid: crafting, creating an, instead of reading story books, I'd pick up the kid's almanac or an atlas and learn about the world or the science behind things like the weather lol. I actually loved geography so much, I knew almost every world capital, language spoken, currency in every country at age 7. I just loved learning about science and about people. When I was older, I'd take extra biology classes because I could seriously learn anatomy and physiology all day. At the same time, I started writing about about my experiences with people, so I became involved with editing school newspapers. As you can probably tell, I'm probably a person who has too many interests than one specific interest area. Currently, my hobbies are in: art, comedy, writing, music/poetry alongside health and medical sciences. Like a lot of 17 year olds, I wanted to do pre-med because I thought this would be the best way to couple my interests with life science and people, but seeing how many of my family members started as pre-meds and went on to do something else, I was flexible to the idea of letting my college courses help me figure out my true interests, perhaps in a completely different field. However, I got into this program shortly afterward, which was a professional career pathway, financially sound as it was offered at my local in-state school and a STEM field with a good pay that seemed to have many job openings at any geographical area. My parents were far more excited than I was and I felt guilty and naive for having these crazy ideals about my future career, knowing that in reality there's no such job that doesn't get boring or mundane after a while and that I would have to raise a family eventually. At the same time, I wasn't way too excited about what I was going to learn in my major. Nonetheless, I thought that as I have an indecisive and flexible personality, I might find something I enjoy in it or at the least have a good job to back me up in case I'm still trying to figure out what I truly want to do. 

Unfortunately, while I was in school, a lot of changes happened and the job market has become terrible as there are just far too many new schools opening than there are jobs. I had trouble in school finding an internship position that was supposed to give me the experience as a student to be competent in my field when I would become a professional. Being a healthcare professional means more to me than prestige or status, but it seemed like most of my friends were just interested in the title they'd get than the actual work we'd do. Nobody seemed to have wanted to do anything more than just what our professional scope offered, except I knew some kids who were interested in finance, business and real estate. Overall, I think a lot of peers in my class were very money oriented (which I completely understand and am cool with people doing their thing), but since my focus was more on some very nuanced areas of the healthcare aspect and was the only person I knew in my class thinking in these terms, I felt sort of stupid for looking at specialty areas that were potentially lower paying but offered greater options to do research with population health or something. I became really depressed while in school due to uncertainty with my major and other problems, had my grades fall, started seeing a therapist. But eventually I pulled through and did okay (could have done way better tho).

After graduating, I've tried to look for jobs in every area of my field but it is incredibly tough, especially since it's a very specific role and I never found intern experience that made my peers who had jobs during school not only confident in their knowledge base, but also got them the experience they needed to find a job. At the same time, things are becoming crazy and kids are leaving their jobs or doing something else after 2-3 years. My intention was to find a job specific to my major and do the same, but since it's becoming bad, I'm even started to look for jobs outside of specific title and maybe eventually go back to school.  I've had some interviews for these alternative positions which seemed to have gone well, but people tend to wonder why I'm choosing a very alternative route, if I'm planning to do a career switch, or look at my resume and see how much I've been involved in outside of my major and sound surprised that my interest areas are in so many different areas. I can't tell if that's necessarily seen as a good thing or bad thing. I'm the only person from my class considering the alternative route I'm choosing &amp; just doing something different than most and not having anybody to relate to is making me nervous. But at the same time, in the back of my mind, I'm excited as I think it goes in line with my personality. However, I'd love to hear feedback from people who have done the unusual compared to your peers, some tips and insights you can offer. My preference is to talk over PM as I'd elaborate better, but comments are cool too."

2zi2rs,3,2015-03-18,"Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] for 4 years, she travels across world for school for 5 months, wrote to male friend on fb she's single",throwy123123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zi2rs/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_20_f_for_4_years_she/,"She and I had lived together for 1 year when she decides she wants to travel across the world for an internship(duration: 5 months) because she wants to experience the world(she enjoys traveling very much).



I support her decision and decide to move home to my family in the mean time to save money - besides the apartment was time controlled, had to move out soon after anyway.


Before her leaving I had serious doubts of whether or not I would actually want to be with her - we had a ton of issues and lots of screaming matches in the middle nights and so forth.

I expressed this to her shortly before us moving out and she was very sad, crying(and so was I) and basically said she couldn't handle that kind of talk right now since she had a ton of stress from preparing for her exams, moving out and arranging a trip across the world and asked us to postpone it. I respected that and I also wanted us to end our relationship in a respectable maner because I still like her(just not as a partner).

From this point it was a month before she had to fly and we moved out in the mean time but never really had our ""talk"". We decide that I should visit her two months after her flying and I decide that I would bring it up then because I would like to do it in person. We even kiss goodbye when she leaves for the plane and our FB status is still ""in relationship"".

During these two months I have been acting like we were still in a relationship - meaning not flirting or doing anything I might not do otherwise. I actually used this period to think real hard about whether or not it was the right decision to break up(I had been pretty bad at expressing my needs in the relationship for one).

Now I'm not gonna lie and say I ""stumbled"" upon her logged in facebook account on my PC(although I have) but I was interested in how she handled things so I logged into her account to snoop around.(reading a lot of /r/relationships posts can make you paranoid..)

What I found at first was nothing out the usual at first, she talks to a lot of her friends and she has always shared a lot about them. If she makes a new friend I know it because she talks about them. But then I stumbled upon a conversation with someone named ""Thomas"" and I had never even heard about him before. What surprised me most was how they have been writing together for the last 2 weeks practically everyday and even one day where they wrote together constantly from 3 pm to 2 AM - in the meantime I have had radio silence.. Although I admit I have been bad a writing to her aswell I didn't exactly think that she was just writing to someone else instead. 

I went to the beginning of the conversation which seemed really odd because it started two weeks ago yet it seemed like you entered in the middle of a conversation(like she deleted the conversation regularly?) They where talking about christmass and then I found this snippet:

&gt;Him: Are you not gonna ask me what I want for a gift?

&gt;Her: Okay, what do you want?

&gt;Him: Do you have any single friends? ;)

&gt;Her: Perhaps, do you have any for me? :P

Later they wrote:

&gt;Him: Excuse me for asking but are you single? Because from this convo seems weird if you arn't :P

&gt;Her: Yeah, I am. We weren't on the same page about this trip :P

I can't really describe my feelings when seeing this. Even though I had wanted(and still did I guess) to end things this really hit my heart hard.

I just payed 1.000 USD for a plane ticket to see her in two weeks and I just feel so betrayed from seeing this. The worst part is I don't even know if I have the right to be mad / upset about it given what I had said to her. 

I mean, to hear that you apparently are single now from snooping through your supposed girlfriends text messages.

What is your guys/gals take on this? I don't know how to proceed..

I just feel like cancelling the trip and getting my 1.000 USD returned(have looked, not possible). 

I feel betrayed especially when she said that ""we broke up because we weren't on the same page about her trip"" which I had actually supported.

I feel like confronting her by asking ""Are we still together?"" but I am almost certainly sure she would answer ""Yes"". But then what - the only way to proceed is to acknowledge that I have disrespected her and have been snooping through her messages and found out she was chatting up some guy.

Do I escalate and perhaps ruin a trip or do I bite the bullet and stay silent...
   
**tl;dr**:
I(23m) suggest breaking up but me and my girlfriend(20f) never explicitly break up. She travels for internship and I decide to finish our talk when I come to visit her - thinking we could do it with respect for each other. I snoop and find out she has been texting another guy non stop for two weeks and even saying she was single to him. My heart hurts even though I had decided to break up. Am in doubt about how I should feel and how I should proceed.

Thanks for reading.

edit: Can't even decide whether this thread needs the ""Break ups"" flair or the ""Infidelity""...

Edit 2:
My issues isn't about whether or not I want to continue being in a relationship with her(because I wont regardless) but whether or not I can continue being a friend with her.

Does her actions constitute a betrayal in you guys minds or doesn't it? I that truely is the case(and that is how I am feeling right now) then I just don't think I can be able(or even want) to visit her.

2zi74o,1,2015-03-18,Disappointing Internship,MorihausG,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zi74o/disappointing_internship/,"Hi everyone, I've seen some amazing and informative posts here and I'm hoping someone has been in a similar situation before. 

I'm in the final term of my bachelor's degree in software development and I landed my first internship a few months ago. The working environment is enjoyable and the pay is quite good for what I was expecting, but I've become increasingly frustrated by the situation lately. 

I was hoping for an internship where I would be working under people that know a lot more than me and could teach me new concepts and critique my methods as we work on a project. Instead I've been working exclusively on one project with another intern where our progress relies on communication from a far off site group of sales staff. They've been quite disrespectful and slow to get back to us which delays our work.

Not trying to sound like an ass but the other intern has produced terrible code and has no regard for best practices. I usually spend a lot of my days refactoring what he writes and making it fit in to some semblance of logical structure. 

I don't feel as though I'm growing as a developer anymore and I feel like I will be under prepared to find a full time position once I graduate this spring. I was hoping to get a job offer from this company once I have my degree but with the nonexistent oversight and lack of performance reviews I just feel like we're being thrown at a project that no one else wanted to take on.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What was your course of action and how did it turn out? I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my last couple classes and my capstone project has me very stressed out with tight deadlines. I feel like I'm stagnating in the internship already and it's not going to be much more than a bullet point on my resume when all is said and done."
2zi9td,12,2015-03-18,I recently attended a technical interview for IBM and feel a bit defeated. Am I incompetent as a programmer or was the interview hard?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zi9td/i_recently_attended_a_technical_interview_for_ibm/,"Disclaimer: Long read but the TLDR is asking if I'm prepared to work as a developer for a big company. 

I am 19 years old and a second year CS  student. The position was a Java/DB2 Internship at a IBM R&amp;D center. It was my first interview for a large technological giant and I'm asking this question to see if I'm not ready or 'good enough' to work for big companies as a developer. I'm also going to list the questions they gave me and my answers so if anyone can give some feedback on how poor/well I did. 

It was an hour long interview composed of technical questions. The personality part was done separately. 


________________________________________
Here were the questions:


&gt; * What is Garbage Collection? 

I said it restored the memory space of objects after a java program executed.

&gt; * What is the difference between an abstract class and interface in Java?

No answer. I skipped this.

&gt; * On this whiteboard give in any SQL language you know a command to make a user table and fill it with a users name and phone number. 

I put MySQL syntax but forgot putting the data type infront of each variable.

&gt; * Write a function that determines if a string is a palindrome

I got the logic fully wrong but I explained how I would run a stack trace and monitor each step during the execution to solve the logic. (Tried to cover)

&gt; * Write the regex of finding a phone number. 

I wrote: [0-9]*9 which was wrong

&gt; * Here is a Java program. Find the problem that will occur during runtime. 

I found the problem but couldn't rewrite the program to solve it.

&gt; * How can you fix a deadlock?

I responded by using sephamores and proper mutual exclusion as well as signaling techniques. 


________________________________________

Before the interview ended I asked ""Who is your ideal candidate and what important traits would he/she have? Is technical knowledge, communication skills or desire to learn more important?""

As figured since it was the technical portion of the interview technical knowledge was high. However I was upset for an internship desire to learn was low.

Interesting experience but are these questions expected for most programming jobs and am I incompetent as a programmer?"
2zicqw,6,2015-03-18,I [27F] am struggling with my friend [29 M]'s crippling depression after several years of friendship,anunymouss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zicqw/i_27f_am_struggling_with_my_friend_29_ms/,"I've been friends with Jim since 2009 but a few years ago I took a job overseas, so the majority of our communication these days is online. When I'm back in the US I still try to visit him when possible because he's cool as hell and I miss hanging out with him.

Jim is in a situation that a lot of people his age are in: he graduated with two expensive degrees and in the years I've known him still hasn't been able to find a decent job in his field. He hasn't been above taking retail jobs or production assistant jobs on films and whatnot but the last three jobs he's had have all laid him off due to staff shrinkage. 

Even before his employment situation, Jim had been diagnosed with clinical depression, but when he was in school he managed it well because his university had a great mental health program for students--he had counseling, access to cheaper meds, etc. but since he's no longer a student he no longer has access to any of that. 

After he was laid off from his last job he moved back in with his parents, hoping to get a new job and save up enough money to facilitate a move elsewhere in the USA where jobs might be easier to find or he could get an unpaid internship in his field (civil engineering).

Unfortunately since moving back in with his folks, Jim's depression has gotten so bad that I feel like I can't even talk to him anymore. I've done everything I can think of to try to be a good friend, mostly just listening to him when he needs to vent. (I suffered through a family member's murder a few years ago and I remember being so grateful to him for just listening to me, so I wanted to return the favour)

The problem is, it's gotten to the point of where he's been various degrees of severely depressed without treatment for four years now and the last two years, I can't hold a conversation with him without it devolving into him telling me he's worthless, never going to get a job, never going to stop disappointing his family. He'll go on like this for hours.

I noticed it's been starting to affect the way I interact with other people in about the last year: I was feeling reluctant to talk about my successes to our mutual friends because I didn't want it to get back to Jim and make him feel worse. I stopped posting photos of fun stuff I did on Facebook because when I did, it seemed to trigger depressive episodes or he'd start comparing his life to mine as proof that he's not fit to live.

I've gently tried to encourage him back toward the path of professional help, but he has no money and his parents will only pay for a religious counselor. He was desperate enough to try that, but he hated it because while he's religious, he knows that the problems in his brain are brain chemistry related and he's not devout enough to benefit from it too much.

I feel like an awful friend because I've started talking to him less and less, mostly because I noticed his unhappiness was rubbing off on my emotional well being. I felt drained and sad every time I talked to him. I felt like a bad friend for not being able to help him in some way, even though I know that's silly as I live on the other side of the planet.

There are other issues contributing to his depression that I've snipped here for the sake of brevity (mentally ill family member who has to live with him, he was bullied pretty severely in school, etc) so he's not just some whiny brat who's sad because he can't get a job, I hope you guys can see that.

When I do manage to make it over to the US and we hang out like old times, I still have a blast with him. He's funny, smart as hell, has the quickest wit of anyone I know, and is the sort of guy who just lights up a room when he walks into it, when we can manage to get him out and socialising with other people. 
   
**tl;dr**: Friend has suffered from severe depression for years and I've done my best to be there for him. I miss my friend and I desperately wish he could be happy again, but am I wrong for feeling kind of smothered by his depression? It makes me feel like an asshole to even ask this question. :/"

2zier3,1,2015-03-18,"Am I crazy for wanting to completely change my major to something more ""normal""?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2zier3/am_i_crazy_for_wanting_to_completely_change_my/,"TL;DR: I want to give up studying fashion design and move somewhere else in pursuit of a degree in finance/economics/entrepreneurship. 

Hello everyone.  I'll try to sum up my situation as quickly and concisely as possible.

I'm a 20 year old guy from the US.  I'm currently working on an undergraduate degree in Fashion Design in Italy.  I've been here for a year and a half and while it has been a fantastic learning experience and I've had a lot of fun, this just isn't what I want to study anymore.  

**I don't want to go down this current path anymore because of a few reasons.  They are listen in the next few points:**

* I'm really interested in fashion design and I took the advice and tried to ""follow my dream"", but the truth is that I can't see myself doing this for a living.  The school is very independent and we work 7 days a week drawing, sketching, sewing, and producing a collection.  The pressure is very intense because the deadlines are insane and the school is very competitive.  If you don't perform, you get shamed by all of the teachers during revision and the critiques are very subjective.  Basically, I'm not an artist.  I slumped into a depression through this winter because of the pressure and how absolutely suffocated I felt.  I've since pulled out of it, however.

* I have friends that are working fashion ""dream"" internships in some of the most expensive cities in the world for free or maximum 1,000 Euros per month.  The career path is to do this for a couple of years until you get hired by a design studio, and even at that point, wages are still poor.  I don't want my father to pay for me to go intern for two years after having helped me along the way through four years of school. I just don't feel that entitled.

* I came to Italy because the tuition was cheaper than studying fashion in New York, which was my original plan.  My school costs about $10,000 per year, and since I've gotten here to Italy, I've realized that while this is inexpensive compared to current American tuition rates, I could study something for much cheaper in other European countries.  

* I'm tired of living in Italy.  I have a great girlfriend here (we've been together for almost a year), the wine and food are great, and the culture is very rich, but I can't see myself living here long-term.  This country can be headache-inducing due to the amount of inefficiency and functionality with certain systems.  Also, the job market is very poor, salaries are low, and taxes are very high compared to the standard of living.  It's a great place to stay for a while, but not a good place to set up a life and career.

**What I'm considering next:**

I've realized through my time here that I'm motivated by money and it's an important factor to me (which makes me a bad fit for fashion).  Over the last six months or so, I've found myself quite interested in aspects of business and economics which I was never interested in before.  I enjoy the real world effect that can be seen in these, and I'm also attracted to the idea of learning something that can make me employable to a wider range of jobs.  I've never been a ""numbers person"", but I have always wanted to own my own business at some point down the line.

So my plan right now is to move home (which I really miss) this summer and go to community college for a few semesters to see if I really enjoy the course work and new structure.  Then from there I want to transfer into a 4 year college and get my Undergrad in something along the lines of business/finance/entrepreneurship.

Am I crazy for wanting to turn my back on my passion to have a career or some sort?  Should I approach this situation differently?

Also, anyone who is currently studying or in the finance world- what are some downsides that I should be aware of?

Thanks."

My SAT scores are: reading-640 Math-560 (i plan on bringing that up much higher though) Writing-610. I've taken nearly all honors/AP classes throughout high school and I was on my school's crew team for 3 years, formed my own club and am a member of several clubs.

I've done decently in my CS classes, but atrociously in math or other classes - some of those being requirements.

I do personal projects, I consider myself a solid developer, and I've had two internships at well known companies where my managers have given me excellent reviews and offered recommendations.

If I drop out, am I in trouble? What if I'm kicked out for having under a 2.0?

It seems kind of ridiculous to me. My employers think I'm a great developer but my grades really don't reflect that. And if I fail out that will *really* not look good.

Plus, because I've failed some of these core classes, I have to retake them, extending the amount of time I'd be in college.

Hello,
Im about to tell you all about an event that happened to me that forever changed the way I live and interact with people. Hopefully it will help teach at least one person out there to always be careful and to keep your guard up at all times.

It all started, so I thought, when I accepted an internship with a law firm in New York City. I was studying for my BAR exam and was hopeful that this position would give me a leg up in my studies, thus convincing me to move from my spacious Atlanta town home to my small, one bedroom apartment in East Side of Manhattan. 
I worked hard and played hard while studying in New York. Some of my girl friends would fly up to visit and I would become their tourist-tour guide of all the best bars and clubs in Manhattan. I also became regular drinking buddies with many of my colleagues and fellow interns at the office. My life basically became busting my ass to barley afford my shoe box apartment and a few drinks after work and studying. 
One night, upon completing almost a 12 hour straight study session with two of my closer colleagues, Kirstin and Heather, the three of us decided to head out for some drinks at a place none of us had tried yet. 

The night continued in typical fashion, talking about cute guys in our firm and our hopes and dreams of one day being able to afford to stay in this beloved city of ours. Everything felt completely normal, except for one thing. I started to feel much too buzzed for only having my first glass of wine. I started to feel very hot in the face and woozy and drowsy. I then began to feel very nauseous so I excused myself and went to the restroom. Over the last several months I had developed a good tolerance to wine and pretty much knew the exact amount it took before I had too much. “It must be from stress and lack of sleep”, I thought to myself, “also I have barley eaten anything all day”. 

I told my friends I was going to call it an early night and call a cab to take me home as I wasn't feeling well. They insisted on coming with me but I refused, not wanting to embarrass myself If I vomited off one glass of wine. “You don’t look good” Kristin stated. I called a cab from my cell phone and he was there in about five minutes, but in that short amount of time I had become extremely dizzy and objects around me where flowing with motion. I walked to the cab and noticed the city was quite and less busy than usual. A faint mist blended with the neon lights creating an eerie aura surrounding even the tallest of sky scrapers.I rattled off my address to the driver and then promptly blacked out.

I awoke to the driver poking me with his index finger. “Excuse me. Excuse me! We’re here that will be $12.35”. Confused and embarrassed, I paid the man and got out of the car. An immense light headiness filled my conscious. I struggled to pull the large double doors open to my complex. Confused, even though this was a place I finished and began every day at. The last thing I remember about that night was walking up my stair case, almost reaching my door before blacking out again. 

“Ping,Ping,Ping”. My eye lids felt like they weighed a pound each. I tried my hardest to lift them open. “Ping,Ping,Ping”. Water droplets falling from the ceiling to the ground around me, a few hitting my face. I managed to fully open my eyes and take a look around. At first I wasn’t even startled, In a daze in which nothing phased me. But then my mind began to collect the facts that I wasn't in my home. “Where am I?” I finally realized I was in a place which was foreign to me. I found myself tied by my hands, to a small twin sized bed on an old rusty metal frame. 
 
Very confused and alarmed at this moment, I mustered up what little I had in me to use my teeth to take the knot out of the rope which constrained my hands. I quickly sat up. The room which contained me looked like someone had very scarcely tried to make an old, dilapidated room look a little more inviting. Paintings of the beach and old houses were used to cover up the old blue wallpaper that had begun to peel away in the corners. The smell of mold and garbage filled the air. There were no windows and the question of what time it must be plagued my dull mind. I began to recollect the events that lead up to me calling a cab after being out with friends but everything after that, my mind drew blanks. There was a small night stand next to me which I immediately ransacked for any information about the strange place I found myself in. The only contents I found where a bible and a photograph of an old barn. 

I slammed the drawers shut and stood and walked towards the door. Still very much under the effects of whatever I was under (at this point I was certain it wasn’t the wine), I took a step forward but fell backwards into the bed. “C’mon! You've got to get up!” I said to myself. Then a thought, a notion, slammed into my hazy mind like a speeding bullet. I reached for the drawers of the night stand again and ripped them open. I found the photograph and took a second look. Just as I thought the barn in the picture became recognizable to me as one I spent a lot of time at as a teenager in Georgia. I turned the photo around and someone had scrawled “ROSE CREEK PLANTATION  1701 Watson Springs road, Oconee Ga”, the exact name and address of the land the barn was located on. I was horrified and baffled at the same time. “This cant be coincidence, and If I happen to know these people, or person, why would they keep me contained and tied like that?”, I thought. Everything in my instinct told me to bolt for the door and run out of the place as fast as possible. But I didn't know who, or what I was up against. So I crept, as slowly and silently as my body would allow to the door and pressed my ear against it. The only thing I could hear was an exterior fan running, assumably in hopes to cool off the extremely hot and humid building. I placed my hand on the door knob and slowly twisted it with the delicacy and precision of a surgeon making his first cut. I peered out the door and saw a kitchen and a living area, another door and a half opened window which led to a fire escape. I noticed a digital clock that read “6:20am”. My heart skipped a beat. I thought I remembered it being 11:30 pm around the time I started feeling ill. I fully exited my room of captivity and began to creep slowly towards what I assumed was the front door. 


The place, wherever I was, was an absolute disgusting mess. Old plates of food, trash, beer and wine bottles and random files of paper littered the floors and counter tops of the place like a fresh blanket of snow. The smell was putrid. I noticed that in one particular corner, Red Bull energy drink cans were amassed in a sloppy pile. As I continued to tip toe towards the front of the place, a blue glow coming from the living area caught my eye It was a lap top  that was left open with a Facebook profile loaded. My Facebook profile.Next to it laid my cell phone. My heart pounded like  drum. I took a closer look and noticed there were open messages with several of my friends. Someone, who pretended to be me, was having full conversations with Kristin and Heather who messaged me in concern for leaving them in such a hurry. The fake me, assured them I was fine and I had just needed some rest and a meal. There was even a status update that read: “I think I may have over done it, tonight! Oh well; Nothing worth having comes easy!”. A quote I had used before. Fear shocked me like electric ice. I wanted to scream and run but couldn't move a muscle. 


I grabbed my phone and looked to my left and noticed something which sky rocketed my fear into unknown heights. There was notes and paper work and pictures organized like an FBI crime trail board. Pictures of places I had known all my life, every house I had ever lived in, people that used to be my best friends 5 years ago, my family, my dog where I spent my spring break my senior year of high school, my car and license plate, all the places Ive worked at, all the places my family and friends worked at. The most shocking of pictures were the ones taken of me from a distance in hundreds of different locations. Driving down the road, at my friends birthday, shopping at the mall, taking my dog for a walk. One picture was taken from a very eerily short distance from me at my high school when I was about 17. There were photos as old as ten years and as new as 24 hours. Someone was stalking me, but this wasn't stalking, this was an insane obsession. It seemed as if this person dedicated their entire life to me, watching and noting my every move. There were hundreds of pictures chronicling my life events. The photographs were like a story of my life from about the age of 14 to my current age of 25. I briefly scanned some of the paperwork but what I found only heightened my growing terror. Names of almost everyone I ever said two words to, their address and places of business, all of my family and their locations, the place where I go to get my nails done at home in Georgia even the name of one of my college professors. 

Everything I had ever done. There wasn’t a single sign of anyones else's personal life in this place except for my own. There had to have been thousands of more notes that I didn't even bother looking at.  A feeling I had never experienced started at my spine and crept up my neck, extreme paranoia and dismay gripping me. I whipped my head around fully expecting someone to be behind me. There was only the piles of trash. I stood up and took a few steps towards the door, noticing the waste that plagued the small apartment was in fact, my own. A this point, my newest discovery did not even phase me or keep me hesitating to fully bolt for the door. 

Just as I reached the door, I heard the faint jingle of keys coming from outside. The sound of one key being inserted into the lock was all it took for me to sprint to the window on instinct and jump out onto the fire escape. Just as I began climbing down the ladder, I heard the door to the apartment fling open and foot steps start pounding behind me. I let out the first scream I could muster of this very bizarre night. When I got a safe distance down, I let go of the ladder and landed in an old alley way. I didn’t look up or back as I sprinted out onto the street. I half noticed I was in a part of town I was only fairly familiar with. This didn't stop my full on sprint towards any direction away from where I had just come from. As I was running, I used my phone to call the police and explain to them what I had been through in between breaths and heart poundings. 

I was picked up and brought to the police station. In my frantic escape from the place I was held captive, I didn't manage to recall any details of where I might have been. I gave a general description of the place and the area of town I thought it was in. The security tapes from the restaurant I was at and outside my apartment building were reviewed but nothing strange was found. This person had been planning what they did for a very long time and knew exactly what they were doing. DNA samples and finger prints were examined, I was tested for rape, which fortunately came up negative. The police told me they would keep in touch and had me stay with a friend in the mean time. In my mind I knew that wouldn't help, because this person seemed to know exactly where I was and who I was with at ALL times, always. I mean they've been tracking me since I was a child and followed me all the way from Georgia to New York… I stayed with Kristin but the next day quit my internship, put my place up for sale and got on the next flight back home. 

The next several months turned up no new leads with the police but instead very deep psychological trauma with me. For one, I developed one of the most severe cases of insomnia my therapist had ever seen. Since the event, which happened 4 months ago at this time, I had only gotten 6 hours of drug induced sleep. And when I did sleep, nightmares even worse than my reality haunted my mind. This began to take a severe toll on my health, both mental and physical. I also gained a permanent sense of fear and paranoia. The feeling that this creep was always just one step behind me led me to have to be accompanied by someone at all times when I left my room. That was the scariest part about it. Not knowing. Not knowing who it was that did this to me, not knowing where they could be, what they had planned on doing If I hadn't escaped, if they will return to try again some day. Judging by the evidence I had found, I concluded that it could literally be anyone, known or unknown to me. That took a deep toll on my mentality. I started to question everyone and lose trust in people most dear to me. I remember just a few weeks ago, a man approached me at the grocery store and simply asked me what time it was. This sent me into a panicked rage that took everything my mom had to calm me down. 

People think I’m crazy, and I probably am, but who wouldn't be? It is mental torture, day in and day out. I wouldn't even feel safe in a padded room in a maximum security facility because by all means, the nurse or warden could be this mystery person. Part of me wishes who ever it is would just do something so I can stop living in fear and wondering if today will be the day. I know they're still out there, now angered that their plan was foiled. Until their next move, I am just waiting. Waiting for someone to walk in my room as I type this. Waiting for the chef at the next restaurant I eat at to drug my meal and kidnap me. Waiting for a police officer to abuse their power and detain me in order to posses me. Waiting on the clerk at the store to ask me for my information in order to join their rewards club and use that information to stalk me. Waiting for my own family or friends to turn on me and admit it was them this whole time.  
I guess you really never know people."

I'm currently a Computer Science and Cognitive Science Major at UVA about to graduate. I've returning to an internship this Summer that I had last summer, in which they have already offered me a job when I graduate. 

UVA would cost about half as much as Georgia Tech, and I'd already have a place lined up to live next year.

Georgia Tech on the other hand is ranked much better in Computer Science than UVA.

I'm lost and I need help, please.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zisdk/200_job_applications_in_a_scientific_field_2/,"Hi everyone. I am a 2014 college grad that is still struggling to find a position within my scientific field.  Since last May, I have applied to over 200 positions. Every position came with a tailored resume and cover letter and hours of research about the company. I've interviewed for two positions, and have been turned down for both. My last interview was in November, and I'm honestly lost.  

I'm currently interning in my field with a top company in the field. Even with this experience, I'm still not getting calls for anything. Experience and education wise, there is nothing else I can do to prove that I can do great work in this field.

I think that my main issue is that this field requires connections and major networking. I came from a small school where professors, as great as they were at teaching, lacked the connections that one would expect for help in finding a job. Even with this internship, no one knows of anyone that has an opening, or that may be looking for someone within the next year. The only solution that I can think of is to email experienced people within my field that I have no connections with, and ask them if they know of anyone that is looking to hire, or ask them for guidance. Is this the right thing to do?

I guess I'm just trying to get this off of my chest. I've worked so hard for so many years, I've sacrificed nearly all of my free time in college, and I still can't manage to gain employment. I'm more than lost, I don't know where to go from here anymore. I've applied to jobs outside of my field, and I've been unable to land interviews for those as well. I just don't know anymore."
2zivsv,4,2015-03-18,Feeling trapped in my [20/M] relationship because his [24/M] family is taking me on vacation with them.,cosmic_serendipity,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2zivsv/feeling_trapped_in_my_20m_relationship_because/,"So I feel like this whole thing is a little bit complicated. Or maybe it's not, hell if I know, that's why I'm here. but anyways, here's the situation: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months as of yesterday (3/17) and relationship has been a little bumpy. Or maybe very bumpy. So I'm still very good friends with my ex. He and I parted on really good terms, his family loved me, we saw no reason we couldn't be friends, even though our relationship didn't work out. Well my current bf never really understood my friendship with my ex as he has never maintained any sort of contact with his previous relationships.

But anyways, the part where things get complicated is that we have a lot of trust issues (he with me, I trust him 110%) but those are all my fault. I've lied to him several times (each time pertaining to situations with my ex i.e. I told him I'd say one thing but said another) because I didn't want him to get angry with me for talking with my ex. But the point I'm trying to make is that there isn't a whole lot of trust right now and that's a big problem that I am working towards fixing. Now comes the next problem, his parents have invited me along on a very nice and rather pricey vacation right after the school year ends and after that, he begins clinical rotations for the next year (pharmacy school) while I will most likely be abroad for an internship. 

So the part that's making me feel trapped is that, I'm not sure that we are even going to last the summer because I don't know if he and I will be able to handle the distance + the trust issues but it would just look like I used him for the vacation if I broke up with him (by the way, the vacation has already been booked and everything and there's no way to do anything about that)
Any advice??

tl;dr: bf doesn't trust me, kinda think we should break up, being taken on vacation, don't wanna use him.

Both are similarly ranked and recruited. The big difference is Cornell's program is done in 1 academic year (no time for internship), whereas Illinois is done in 3 semesters (with an internship opportunity that summer).

I will have worked as a software developer for 3 years when I attend this fall, and have internships in undergrad too so I have some professional work experience. I would love to graduate as fast as possible and get back to the real world, but I'm considering the benefits of doing an internship. It's probably far easier to get an internship at a Google or Microsoft and then land a full time job there then to try to apply full time right away.

I don't particularly want to work at a big famous company like Google or Microsoft, but I also wouldn't want to miss out on some opportunities because I didn't take the time in grad school to have an internship.

2zj7d3,2,2015-03-18,"No degree but many years experience, how do I market myself more effectively?",cs-job,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zj7d3/no_degree_but_many_years_experience_how_do_i/,"I'm currently looking for a job in web development but feel like I'm not being taken seriously by a lot of the people I've spoken to.

A brief history of how I got into this mess:
&gt; I left highschool at 17 to stay at home full time and take care of my parent, I have been programming seriously since I was 14 (I am now 22). As a person I am very tech focused and programming comes naturally to me. At 19 my parent passed away but because I had not finished highschool, university was not an option. I've been living independently since I was 19. From 19 to 22 I attended community college studying Computer Science at a level way way below mine and got the maximum grade on every assignment for the duration, far far too easy but I persevere because I assume it will get better.

&gt;At year 3 we finally begin Java OOP and extremely basic CSS - I was doing Java OOP at 14 and CSS at 15. I struggled paycheck to paycheck for 3 years attending this college meanwhile at home I am completing hobby projects magnitudes more sophisticated because I just love to program. With 4 more years until I can even apply for an entry level job I did not see the value at all - I am wasting my time and not developing new skills. In December I chose to leave and look for something more challenging.

The bottom line here is that I am a very talented programmer, proven, but I am finding it very hard to market myself effectively with no paid roles even though I am absolutely capable of filling one right now.

On my resume I begin referencing my experience from age 16 (my age is not mentioned), I only reference positions where I worked with other people and it goes along the lines of this:

&gt; 2009-2012(16-19 years old): ~3 years working full time at home on a couple of different large emulator projects; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C, Java, Lua, SQL
&gt; 
&gt; Early 2013(@college): 1 month internship at large IT firm; HTML, CSS, Javascript, XML, JSON, Twitter API - Because of my questionable experience my tasks are small in scope but still good review, they are very impressed
&gt; 
&gt; Mid 2013 - 2014(@college): 6 months unpaid on game development project, I work in the evenings; Lua (and other non-IT skills)
&gt; 
&gt; 2014(@college): 1 month internship at large IT firm, assigned as programming leader on a big client project and knock it out of the park; HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, Wordpress, GIT - Stellar review, they are blown away and I complete an entire project for them for free in 3 weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; mid 2014(@college): 3 month temporary unpaid position at marketing start-up as javascript developer, I work at night(a friend asked for help, why not it's experience and fun); went well, I got a lot of valuable javascript experience, will provide me with a good reference; HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, huge list of JS graphing libraries
&gt; 
&gt; 2015: 1 week completing an online course re: Angular.
&gt; 
&gt; 2015: 4 weeks developing personal website to demonstrate skills and help market myself, add something to my portfolio; HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS

I have constantly improved and at 22 I'm building websites equivalent in terms of quality and complexity to any popular website you visit. I have tried to gather experience with popular frameworks and libraries to make myself more attractive in addition to building on my programming language skills, but I feel like I'm getting a vibe from people that it's no good because I wasn't paid for it. I just want an entry level job!

How do I market myself as a professional without paid experience? Truthfully I am new to this whole process of applying to companies and dealing with recruitment agencies but I am skilled and capable.

No love for skilled hobbyists?

Long distance is hard as they say. My willingness to do it was great at first when I thought she'd come home after graduating. But now we've learned that she's going to do an internship far away. She also doesn't want to settle in the same region as I do. If she did it, she'd be sacrificing a lot. If I moved, I'd be sacrificing a lot. At this point in our careers in this tough, tough job market, neither of us want to sacrifice our own futures. We love each other, but we both understand this decision.

She said she wants to still be together in long distance, but I have made it clear that I don't want to continue long distance, that it was my hope that it would be over, not extended. There is no end date of our distance. So, she said we would do what I want to do.

What I want to do I made clear: I want to take a break while she is away. But there are a few months between now and then, including a big vacation I planned for us before we knew any of this was happening.

I'm caught between two states: one is here and now with my girlfriend, loving her as I always have. The other is in the future, preparing myself mentally for waking up from the dream I've been living in and being single again. And honestly I've never been more terrified. 

I don't know how to live now and I don't know how I'll live then. We were very lucky to have found each other. But it can't keep going as it is for my sake. I need quality time. And at the same time I was never good at dating or meeting new women. So the thought of breaking up then going on another year-long dry spell without a single date looms in the back of my mind as well.

How should I get through these next few months? Is it even possible? Or am I being too idealistic in staying together with her now when I know that we're going to break up? 



   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend and I have an understanding that long distance may not ever end. We have decided that we'll probably take a break when she leaves for a distant internship this summer. I don't know how to live in the meantime because I am both sad that we're on a abbreviated timeline and also terrified of going back out into the world alone."

I have all my chem, physics, composition, math-class requirement filled 

but in terms of experience as a CompE I'm still a freshman.

I currently work as a computer assistant at one of the institution 

probably will for the summer too as I take classes.

My problem is I honestly can't help but feeling bit behind. First semester in UIUC 

and I'm taking intro level classes like ECE 110,120 MTH 173, 

two gen-eds. After this semester credit wise I'll be a junior.

I really want a good internship next summer so I really want to start working on it.

I've self-taught myself little bit of Python\PHP\MySQL, only self ""project"" I've done was to create a simple storage website using PHP/MySQL/AWS and a sudoku game on C++. I've only used C and C++ in intro level classes. 

I have a decent programming background my biggest regret is taking the counselor's advice straight forward and not taking CS 225 this semester. 

Just for those curious I went to CC because of a visa issue. International tuition was too much. I honestly regret it tho, I could've worked something out seeing that I'm able to work out the out of state loan... sigh past is past.

So what are you guys' thought on this matter?

""We're sorry to interrupt your normal broadcast to bring you urgent news.""
     
`
`

Meet Mxtfx, Perfection's most famous news anchor. He's a young adult Vzk'tk who's appearance, though professional, looked a little off from your standard Vzk'tk.  

`
`

""We here at Dominion News just learned of an all-bands broadcast coming from an unknown building asking the famed Human Disaster, Adrian Saunders, to rescue an unknown person(s) from imprisonment. This news caster is currently enroute to the scene to bring our viewers a live feed of the event as they unfold."" Mxtfx is on an automated company transport vessel, complete with audio and visual communications and broadcasting equipment.

`
`

 Mxtfx landed a ways from the scene, affixed his mobile camera to his harness, just as he started broadcasting he paused to listening to his ear piece, ""Oh my! Ladies and gentleman, it has come to my attention that the person broadcasting the signal is none other than Gaoian pirate Chir and a human crewmate. Chir was last seen in the company of human Adrian Saunders as they..."" 

`
`
  
Just then a sudden loud noise ripped through the air like a shockwave, followed shortly by explosions and crunching noise in the distance. Mxtfx was shaken to the ground, the camera along with him. Mxtfx looked up and around with the camera still facing him, ""What in the void was that!?"" he stood up, camera now with a live feed of his feet. 

`
`

He picked up the camera, panning it around as he stared walking forward. As he panned the camera around, he could see hundreds of citizens staggering to their feet trying to make since of what just transpired as light debris fell from the surrounding buildings. The pristine facade of the Perfection town's business district was now less than magnificent, as cracked exteriors, broken windows and displays were now the focus.

`
`
  
Then suddenly, the view from the epicenter came into focus as hovering ships positioned outside the building were seen falling from the sky in a crumbled mess. Mxtfx raced into a nearby high rise, nearly tripping over his own feet, taking the elevator to the roof where he had a clear shot of the building

`
`
 
""What in the void is going on? Folks, i don't exactly know how to describe what I'm seeing, but it appears that the entrance to the building has been blown wide open, as if hit by an orbital bombardment. No evidence as to who or what has caused this devastation but we can assure the citizens that the security forces are on the way to secure the situation."" 
 
`
`

The camera zoomed in as best it could from the (1 mile) distance from the scene, taking focus on the entrance, shrouded in dust and debris, where two figures could barely be seen just outside. 
 
`
`

""We have what looks to be two people just outside the building. It very well may be human Adrian Saunders but, if true, he is not alone. We'll try to get in closer for a better..THAT'S A HUNTER SHIP!"" Mxtfx bellowed out, just in time for another blast from a shockwave to hit. This one, being much smaller than the first, he nearly toppled over but kept his footing. The camera jostled and nearly fell out of his hands before he caught it, placing back in his harness, he re-focused on the entrance.
  
`
`

""Something has happened. I'm not sure what exactly but there appears to be light smoke and dust billowing out of the front of the prison. The two figures are going inside!  Is this a Hunter attack on Perfection? Is that the Human Disaster living up to his name? Stay with our frequency viewers. Since things seemed to have settled down for a moment, we are going to take a very short break as we make our way closer for an investigation.""

`
`

Mxtfx turned off the camera and packed it into his backpack. He made is way back down the elevator to the main lobby, as he stepped out he took pause. He could see hoards of panicked citizens running every which way through the partially broken glass of the main entrance. As he got through the doors to the outside, people started taking notice of who he was. 

`
`

""Is that Mxtfx?"" 

`
`

""Mxtfx?"" 

`
`

""The news is here? It's about time!"" 

`
`

""Hey what's going on?""

`
`

""Who are those people?"" 

`
`

""Is this a Hunter invasion?"" 

`
`

""Do we need to evacuate the planet?"" 

`
`
  
Mxtfx was bombarded with questions from every which way from a multitude of species. ""Friends listen to me! I do not yet have the answers you seek. Go home, get off the street."" The crowd stopped to listen to a calm voice amidst the chaos. ""The Perfection Guard should be here soon. I do not yet know who is behind this terrorist act but we at Dominion News will bring you all the information you deserve from the comfort and safety of your homes. Go. Spread the word to go home have trust in the Guard."" 
 
`
`

The words seemed to have calmed down much of the crowd in the immediate area. Mxtfx turned and headed toward ground zero. As he approached on foot, he looked up just as the Perfection Guard flew in overhead. When he finally made it to the scene, guards were posted around keeping the few curious onlookers at bay. He pulled out his camera and started broadcasting again.
 
`
`

""Welcome back viewers. Dominion News is up close to the devastation to hopefully answer questions on everyone's mind."" Mxtfx approached a control line, ""Stop! You can not cross here."" a guard said. ""Don't you know who I am?! I am Mxtfx of the Dominion News and I demand to be let across the line!"" 

`
`

The unflinching guard just stared at him, perfectly and professionally composed, replied, ""I know who you are sir and I respect you, but orders are orders and you can not cross the line."" 
 
`
`

 Mxtfx remembering the camera is still broadcasting, calmed down and tried a softer, more professional approach. ""My apologies guard, please tell me who the Public Information officer is, the public has questions, and Dominion News will give them answers."" ""You're looking for Officer Chewl'le. Walk around the outside of the line, you will find him in front of the mobile command center.""
""Ah yes, of course. Thank you guard."" Mxtfx turned and walked away following the outside of the perimeter line. ""Soon viewers, we will get to the bottom of this travesty."" just a few moments later, ""Officer Chewl'le! Officer Chewl'le!""

`
`


Officer Chewl'le, an esteemed Gaoin, retired from the Clan-of-Whitetips. The ""white tips"" refer to Chewl'le ears, lined on the outside in white, the nickname was given to him from his childhood. Chewl'le founded the Whitetips with the speciality of information gathering and intelligence. ""Ah Mr. Mxtfx, we meet again. Here to interrogate me about the current situation no doubt.""

`
`

""Hello again Officer Chewl'le,"" replied Mxtfx, ""yes, we last met when I interviewed you on the 'Rich Plains'. Lucky for the passengers on that ship that you happened to be relatively close to receive that distress signal. No thanks to the human's causing the problems.""

`
`

""You do understand, Mxtfx, that it was the human that saved that ship from the Hunter attack yes?"" Mxtfx frowned at that response from Officer Chewl'le. ""Yes yes, but if not for the Human Disaster himself, the Hunters would not have declared the 'Great Hunt', unleashing the 'Swarm of Swarms' upon the citizens of the universe."" Mxtfx said quite smugly.

`
`

""Speaking of Hunters, what do you know of the Hunter ship that suddenly appeared in front of the prison? Who were the two figures just outside?"" Mxtfx asked, as a news caster seeking answers should be.

`
`

Officer Chewl'le paused, arms crossed and eyes closed, breathing deep to take in the questions and search his mind for an appropriate retort. ""We do not know of any Hunter ship here on Perfection. The craft in question was gone, along with any person(s) outside before we arrived on scene. The Gaoin Chir and the human are currently unaccounted for. The investigation is still on going, so I have no further comment. Thank you.""

`
`

Mxtfx took this all in stride and thought that these answers were not quite satisfactory. ""Thank you Officer Chewl'le."" Mxtfx turned is camera back toward him as he walked off, heading back to his transport vessel.

`
`


""Viewers, you heard first hand of the devastation the Human Disaster, Adrian Saunders, caused here on Perfection, to rescue his pirate friends with a brazen attack on the city. Not only that, he appeared to be in a Hunter ship! Is Adrian Saunders now working with the Hunters to overthrow the balance of power? Is he so dangerous as to have actually stolen the ship from the Hunters? This attack further proves just how dangerous the Humans are! We at Dominion News will keep all of our viewers up to date with any new developments. But until then, this is Mxtfx, signing out.""

`
`

With that, Mxtfx terminated the broadcast so that the regularly scheduled programming could continue. He made is way back to his transport ship, and sat inside with the door open. Exhausted, he was happy that the streets were nearly clear of citizens, heeding his word, and that no one bothered him on the long walk back. He took a few slow deep breaths and closed the door, tapped on the data pad and the transport ship rose of the ground, heading for his office.

________________________________________________

`
`

Jeng, the new, young female intern was the last one in the office. Trying to impress the would be employer, she was cleaning up and organizing for the next days' activities. As she was moving down the hall, she heard noises coming from an office, Mxtfx's office. She heard him talking to someone, but it was so late at night, she wondered if it was against the rules to have anyone outside the company to be in the building after hours. She opened the door as slowly and quietly as she could, and peeked in.

`
`

She saw Mxtfx, standing, facing a corner of his dark office. The lights were off and the room was only illuminated by the soft glow of the city lights coming through the bay window at the back wall of the room. She took a quick look around and noted that Mxtfx was indeed alone.

`
`

""The Humans are incredibly dangerous. They can kill the Hunters."" 

""That's what the universe needs! Someone to stand up to the Hunters!""

""Don't you think they'll turn on us once they're done with the Hunters?""

""I don't know! I don't know!""

""They're meat eaters for crying out loud!""

`
`

Jeng knew she had to intervene, ""Umm,"" she spoke softly out loud, ""Umm Mr. Mxftx, are... are you ok?"" Mxftx turned around suddenly at the sound of another person, nearly foaming at the mouth and twitching eyes, ""GET OUT!"" he screamed. She slammed the door shut and ran for it.

`
`

A few [10's of minutes] passed with Mxtfx still in his trance in his office, when the door opened again. He turned at the sudden change in illumination and took sight of a small figure he couldn't make out, shadowed by the light coming from the hallway. ""Who are you? What do you want?"" Mxtfx growled out. The figure stepped into the office leaving the door wide open.

`
`

""I'm a doctor Mr Mxtfx. I'm here to help you."" The figured stepped forward and produced a syringe, and gently stabbed Mxtfx in the thigh, and then took a few steps back.

`
`

*A doctor? Why do I need a doctor?* Mxtfx thought, but before he could supply himself an answer he felt a small pain in his hind quarters. He rubbed the injection site, still thinking nothing of it, as the drowsiness hit him.

 ""What's going on? Why do I'f eel fun ny, my my my my boooody gos leep...."" His body was growing weaker and weaker, as he tried to keep standing, his eyes heavy, he sat down on the floor, now resting his head on the floor, his last sight was that of two large shadowy figures entering the room, towering over the ""doctor"" as they stood next to him. The drugs finally took full effect just as the two large figures leaned in to pick him up...

`
`


`
`

...he closed his eyes and his world went black.

2zjj5t,4,2015-03-18,Killing the old me.,kmyp,ThankTRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThankTRP/comments/2zjj5t/killing_the_old_me/,"A bit of background to give you guys an idea of my journey down the rabbit hole so far. 

Throughout high school I was a beta, without question. I was the guy who girls came to with their boyfriend/relationship problems, and I got some kind of validation out of this (fucking stupid). However, towards my senior year I started to develop more and more Alpha qualities. I had been lifting with my dad (incredibly strong dude for his age) 5x/week and wrestling 3x/week at an intense summer wrestling club. By the time senior year hit, I was ready to fuck the world for 72 hours (shoutout Kendrick). Immediately, I started spinning plates without even knowing what that meant as I hadn't discovered TRP up until a few months ago. 3 different bitches from 2 different grade levels, 2 of which had boyfriends. Fucked 2 of them, other one was a bit of a prude and I hadn't properly developed my game. 

This is where it all came crashing down and I was reverted back to being a beta bitch. 

While spinning my plates, I fell hard for the one who had a boyfriend she was on and off with. We were ""dating"" for a while, then we made it official about 3 months in after constant ""breaks"" because ""she still had feelings for the other guy"" and ""she knew what it felt like to have your heart broken and didn't want me to experience that."" AKA she was fucking that guy and one other. Of course, the beta in me took her back every time. 

After those tough 3 months, shit went really well for about a year, then I caught her sneaking around with one of her other exes through Facebook and text messaging. I even caught her parked at his fucking house. But yet, I still took her back because I had developed one of the most serious cases of oneitis the world has ever witnessed. I was trapped. 

Finally, after about 2 years of this, we didn't get back together after I caught her doing the same shit she had been pulling for the past 2 years. 

Fast forward another year, and here I am, writing this post. I have realized how shitty my life is because of my own actions and beliefs about women. I destroyed my self-confidence, I turned to drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of losing her, stopped working out, stopped socializing, completely lost my identity as a man by only identifying myself as my relationship with her, basically fucking destroyed my life. 

But now, I'm awake. I have seen the toxic lifestyle I've allowed myself to live for the past 3 years. Today marks the day where I officially have killed my old self. I refuse to be a fucking beta bitch and let people walk all over me any longer. 


I started lifting again and have been seeing great gains so far.
I've got 1 and a half semesters left of uni, one of which being an internship at a law firm. 

I've started learning Chinese with a goal of moving to China for 2 years via the Peace Corps to teach English. 

I've got a goal to go to law school after my time in the Peace Corps. 

TRP talks so much about Game and how to deal with women, but for me it's much bigger than that. This is a lifestyle I truly want to commit to and utilize it to achieve great things. The most valuable thing that TRP has taught me is that no one, not even your own fucking parents want to see you hit the pinnacle of success. Every single day I'm ridiculed for believing that I can make something great out of my life. ""Stop being unrealistic"" ""It'll never happen"" ""You know how slim the chances are, don't you?"" ""You're doing WHAT?!"" ""Good luck with that!""

Fuck. All. That. What's the point in living if you're not going to give it every ounce of strength and willpower that you've got? The answer for me is simple: there is none. I'd rather die a warrior than live as a coward. 

I just want to thank TRP community for getting my ass in gear and helping me to realize that everything you do in this life is a result of your own doing, and no one is here to help you fix your fuck-ups. Never, ever again will I let a woman rob me of my precious time in this life because of my ideals about what love is supposed to be. I've swallowed the red pill, and I have no intention of turning back now.

2zjp7p,3,2015-03-18,Finding Internships in Toronto: Feeling Discouraged,jj2parkie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zjp7p/finding_internships_in_toronto_feeling_discouraged/,"I live near Toronto in Canada, and since December 2014, I have been looking for an internship through various means such as career fairs, meetups, and cold-calling. I almost had luck when someone I met at a meetup tried to refer me, yet I received no response. Meanwhile, I did get contacted from people abroad for opportunities yet due to personal reasons, I could not leave the GTA. Generally, for all the companies I applied to, I received no responses; thus, I am feeling very discouraged, and I would like any advice.

The following explains a bit about me. I am currently eighteen years old. I recently graduated from high school last June 2014. However, during the summer, I got very sick due to a sudden appearance of adult onset Still's disease. It plagued me with fevers and an inability to walk until treatment became effective by October-November. As a result, I had to defer my enrollment to the Mechatronics Engineering program at the University of Waterloo until September 2015. I recovered greatly and finished my physiotherapy and treatment by January, and I was told by my doctors I was healthy to work or to study.

Even before I recovered while I was stuck in bed, I spent a lot of time studying computer science and software engineering through MOOCs and e-books because I didn't want to waste that time. After, I started working on developing Android applications and server-sided applications. I published one moderately successful Android application which reached approximately 50,000 installs and ranked 25th in Top Free Comics and 3rd in its search category before it was removed. Furthermore, I had a moderate GitHub of three projects which total together to have over 150 stars and multiple contributors. I started getting a small presence on /r/androiddev where I often discuss about or show my own open-sourced projects utilizing architectural and design patterns revolving around MVP or MVC, dependency injection frameworks like Dagger, functional reactive programming with RxJava, relational database management with SQLite, networking with HTTP, automated testing with Espresso and JUnit 4, build variants with Gradle, and debugging with Android Device Manager and Eclipse Memory Analyzer.

Nonetheless, no matter how I try to get an internship, I receive no response. Meanwhile, I know a lot of people without any prior experiences or projects attending the University of Waterloo who are easily getting multiple interviews and co-op placements involving development or quality assurance. I've also read Effective Java and Cracking the Code Interview to try to prepare if a company responds, but I never got to use them. **This year has been very rough on me being sick and my friends moving away for university, I am feeling very discouraged and depressed that I can't find an internship to try to make this year worthwhile. What should I do to try to get an internship or if I don't get one?**

So, I'm a freshman in college right now at a small private school. I've been depressed for most of my life, I can remember trying (pathetically) to kill myself as early as 8 or 9 years old. My depression comes and goes, but recently this year with the stress of college, my internship, and having a new long distance relationship it has gotten a lot worse. I often fantasize about suicide throughout most of my day... without real intent. Until I start to get really stressed.

Anyway, I'm posting because throughout all of this I find it really difficult to have a roommate. He's a great roommate, let's me use his coffee-maker and shelf, not even in the room a lot. But I just find it really difficult to live with another person. I need my space and time alone. It's difficult because when I do need to cry or just be alone I have to go outside and go for a walk. (It's very cold where I go to school) I guess I was just wandering if anyone else in r/depression was experiencing this, and how to deal with it. Should I try to switch rooms?

As I am typing this, I am absolutely sick to my stomach. I just had a new conversation about moving in with my girlfriend of two and a half years. Before tonight, the plan was for her to move to my hometown, where we both graduated from college. That has been the plan for nearly six months, although we do not plan on moving in together until May of 2016. It is important to note that we both LOVE my hometown and we both feel VERY comfortable here. However, as my girlfriend finishes her masters program in a huge city (that I already feel very uncomfortable in and have made this very clear), job offers have been rolling in. Unfortunately, I do not have a career yet, so the ball is in my court to find a full time position in my field. Back to her... she has been offered a position with very good pay as soon as she graduates and I am ecstatic for her. This job requires her to work in the area I am very uncomfortable in though, and she would be locked to work there for the next ten years.

This offer changed everything, though. She now wants to live thirty minutes from this HUGE metropolitan area and is not willing to compromise much since any further will give her a two hour drive during rush hour. The reason she has to live in that area is because 1) her field is fairly hard to get a job in. 2) she has over $70k in student debt and this job would pay off her debt fairly quickly 3) She likes the area.

 I really do not feel comfortable in this area and I check my car nearly every five minutes in fear my vehicle will be broken into (since it has been twice in the past year...something not uncommon for the area). It makes me incredibly anxious and I genuinely fear my safety because of how sketchy the area is. Here is the kicker. I am in law enforcement, and I really do not feel comfortable being a police officer in this area. I have literally had guns pointed at my face during my internship in my hometown, but this metropolitan area makes me very uncomfortable (if that helps put it in perspective). In fact, I have been told by many officers (even those from a rather large city) not to be a police officer in this metropolitan area. 

I don't think it is fair that I am being forced to live within thirty minutes of this HUGE metropolitan area, especially when I do not feel comfortable there. I refuse to live there because of how uncomfortable it makes me and I do not want to raise a family there. Please help me. I have no clue what to do. I feel like me sucking it up and living in fear or breaking up with her are my two options. 

TL;DR: Original plan was to move in together in my hometown, where we both feel safe. New plan is girlfriend wants to live in a huge metropolitan area, where I do not feel comfortable.   I would literally live anywhere else in my entire home state. She refuses to live any further than 30 minutes from said area because of job prospects and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable to live there. What do I do?"
2zjze9,1,2015-03-19,Intern conversion rates,reversecs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zjze9/intern_conversion_rates/,"I have to choose between Apple and Google for my last internship before I have to hunt for a FTO my senior year of college.

It is my understanding that Google requires additional interviews in order to convert into the FTO where most companies just base solely on intern performance. 

I will begin by saying that I would rather work for Google, but not by much. So I know that my mentor for Apple is very enthusiastic about me and my experience and is already talking about training me for a full time position and how they could really use me there. This is very encouraging and makes me feel more secure about going with Apple for a long term experience. But as I said earlier, I have a stronger interest in Google and would rather work there all things being equal.

Can anybody shed some light on the conversion rates from Google interns to FT? How much should this factor into my decision? All opinions are welcome.

I am not impressed by my ability to get the opportunities I did because as far as I'm concerned I'm not in the clear until I can get a full time offer. I'm worried about the conversion and would like some advice."

I have recently graduate from high school in December(not from the US) waiting to study CS at college on fall in the US, and have around 8-9 months doing pretty much nothing. So, I know this person who is the executive director of a company,I later proceed on asking him if he could grant me a internship at their Tech Department. Eventually he accepted my offer, and I have already begun 3 days ago. 



This is not exactly a ""formal"" internship, as they don't really train interns very often. The agreement was based on, ""I try to improve/help out their social media department, and they teach me how does the IT department works, overall"". So basically it's a win-win situation.




After being there for 3 days, I felt like I didn't learned anything. I was basically working on social media, taking pictures and what not, all my time there. I felt kind of hopeless, and unsure whether or not I was going to gain something at the end of this. After thinking for a while, I decided to talk to the boss and tell him that I was expecting to learn, and unfortunately was not. He took it pretty well, and told me to send him an e-mail of what I wanted to learn. And now I'm here writing to you guys, hoping you can help me. 



I want to know what would be cool to learn from a big and modern IT department. I'm still pretty much an amateur at CS, but I really like computers since I was a little kid. So I was hoping you guys could give me any suggestions regarding what you think its very important/interesting/essential/helpful to learn as I slowly emerge myself in the world of CS.


Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thank You in advance! And sorry for my poor writing skills as english is not my native language and I'm very tired."

Previously I had just manually defined these things one by one but was never happy with such an obvious inefficiency.  Tonight I decided I'd fix this and whacked them and implemented a way of doing it where I can iterate over a list containing labels and define these predicate functions using those labels:

    (defvar orphean/labels '(""label1"" ""label2"" ""label3""))

    (defmacro orphean/gen-predicate (label)
      `(defun ,(intern (concat ""orphean/"" label ""-p"")) ()
                (member ,label *orphean/system-label-store*)))

    (defun orphean/define-purposes ()
      (dolist (label orphean/labels)
        (eval `(orphean/gen-predicate ,label))))
    (orphean/define-purposes)

Now this all works fine and I get my auto-generated predicates, so success.  My question/concern/niggle is around the use of (eval) in orphean/define-purposes.  If I don't put eval in there then the defun the macro evaluates into never gets evaluated itself.  Stylistically, is there a better way to do this or am I just being weird about (eval) and should just get over it?"

We were both out of relationships around the same time, hers had lasted longer than mine.  Since both of them ended on a downward slide instead of suddenly, I wanted to believe that we were both ready for something with each other.  But yesterday it basically came out that she really wasn't emotionally ready.

The difficult part is that I've never met someone more similar to me in the kinds of ways that I want (and she had said the same thing, and repeated it yesterday).  We work in the same field, have many of the same interests, the chemistry was great.

She's going to be away from town for the summer doing an internship (I'm just graduated from a grad program, she's earlier in the same program).  I work in the area, so will be here.  We're taking a few days to regroup right now, but I hope to maintain contact and she said the same thing.  We both enjoy each other's company (although I realize that once sex enters the equation, it's hard to put the genie back in the bottle).  My hope is that maybe in a few months we might have another chance of something working.  Not pushing anything here, but just... if we continue to hang out, and chemistry remains positive.

I realize this depends on her and me and how we handle things, and as much as anything else, I guess I'm wondering if it's possible to come back to someone and try again.  I would hate to lose this girl for good.

But maybe I'm just being an idiot here.  Relationships fail all the time, and people *always* want to imagine that they might be able to come back to them.  But does that ever happen?  I honestly don't know.
   
**tl;dr**: Rebound relationship ended, we're still planning to spend time together.  Is it possible to rekindle something later on, especially after being separated for a few months?"

The issue is that I've realised I don't enjoy working in the finance and accounting industry as much as I thought I would. Instead, I like programming and being surrounded by tech. I've been programming for roughly 3 years now, although it's been more of a hobby than anything else. I'm rather decent at python, C++, php, CSS, SQL and using *nix systems, but still learning a lot. I'm focussing more on doing some actual projects to upload on github instead of just dicking around and experimenting.

I've done an internship in a tech startup last summer as a data analyst assistant and it's been one of the most enjoyable experiences I had. And now's the time for me to get my 2nd year internship, and I'd rather work in tech than finance, especially since I've already been rejected by all the big banks. 

Right now, I'm considering finishing my degree but trying to work in tech anyway afterwards. I was planning on working on my own projects as well as open source projects this summer as I have no chances of getting an internship in tech with my current background. Perhaps even my own startup as I have some ideas sitting around.

What should I do? Am I just being delusional or can I actually follow this path? I can't really afford starting a new degree, and I feel that a lot of the material would be redundant anyway. I'm currently located in London, UK, and will be here till I finish my degree at least.

M37 / F26, 3 mos.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zkohf/can_you_turn_a_relationship_back_and_rebuild_m37/,"DISCLAIMER: Read to the end (or skip to the tl;dr) before commenting, I may address your initial criticism in this wall of text.

I met Laurie about two or three months after both of us got out of long term relationships.  We started dating informally, but things progressed relatively quickly.  In retrospect, although we both discussed it and convinced ourselves that it wasn't a rebound, at least for her (her previous relationship was longer) I think maybe it followed that pattern somewhat.

We initially connected because we had so much in common.  We're in the same field, I'm a little further along (recent PhD grad, she's in her first year of the same PhD program) but we have very similar interests, backgrounds, hobbies, and so on.  Seemed (still does) like a great fit, and it definitely has been.  We sort of made the transition to ""significant other"" over the last month or a little more.

Over the last couple weeks, she started getting a little distant, most especially over text messages.  She explained it as not feeling sure about entering into a relationship when she was going to be away for several months (summer internship).  We decided to take things as they came and see what happened.  But, yesterday after sitting down to talk, she more or less realized that she just wasn't emotionally ready for being in a relationship with someone.

It hurts.  But the tricky part is...

She knows why she was having difficulty.  We still have tons in common, and neither one of us wants to discontinue our friendship.  Sex complicates things, of course, and so the real difficulty is putting the genie back in the bottle.  We're taking a few days apart to regroup and think independently.

So here's my conundrum.  She and I both acknowledged how difficult it is to ""turn things back,"" so to speak, after sex enters the picture.  And it is.  My hope is that maybe by stepping back, we can take a fresh start at things.  I hope to spend time with her (and she feels the same way about that) and I really want to see whether there's any possibility-- especially after a few months of her being away-- of us possibly having another shot.

Am I delusional?

   
**tl;dr**: I was in a rebound relationship (that ended yesterday), but I think it still has the potential for something more.  Is it possible to step back and rebuild?"

My gpa sucks so I can't transfer from this bullshit big expensive university where none of your professors even send you a message if you don't come to class for a month. I don't have any money and I can't bring myself to go outside and walk around the city for a job. I just can't be stuck working a bullshit job because if I go on leave from school that will trigger my loans to come back into payment mode.. And I owe fucking 56000 dollars. I just can't believe my parents let me sign my life away into that much fuckin debt. I mean I know it's my fault too but damn I was 18 that money wasn't real to me. I didn't give a second thought to any of it. My whole life I had just been told that you need to go to college just go and get a degree. But nobody said anything about the crippling debt you would get into. And nobody said anything about deaths of family and friends. Nobody really said anything about not liking your major or feeling so depressed that it's tough to get out of bed. It's so much easier to just lie and put on a front for everyone else because it seems to make them happy. Everyone is always super happy when you tell them you're studying engineering. It doesn't matter if you absolutely hate every second of differential equations and linear algebra and circuits and all that bullshit, just as long as you're there doing it. Yeah I'm smart enough to do it. I am. I fucking understand that I'm smart enough to do it. But life got in the way and it all got fucked up. People are going to read this and tell me I should just stick with college and get the degree I started. Well that is not an option. If I had to come back here for another semester of professors who are just here to do research and who don't even know my name even if I do attend every class.. If I had to come back to this bullshit money grubbing university that just wants to put you into a system that gets you ready for a dark fuckin world where everyone is cold and single minded focused on stupid fucking material possessions and transforming their life's energy into numbers in their bank accounts.. Where they transform their fucking life energy from 9-5 your best fucking waking hours and they sit there and waste them and get them transformed into weird bits of green paper with fucking Egyptian symbols on them like some weird satanic cult. If you don't think capitalism is a weird cult or religion then think again. You get up and put on your fucking ceremonial robes you put on that suit, and you start your morning ritual you drink your coffee and get the kids off to junior internment camp where they are groomed to behave and follow the rules and not question authority and to fit into this shitty cult system too.. And then you get on the road and join the rest of the cattle on the freeway where all of you have all of this pent up rage and hatred for everyone else because you don't have fuckin time for anything else between the job and wife and kids and if you're late again you'll probably be the talk of the office for another few days until the boss calls you in and fires your ass. You get to the fuckin office and you sit there with your hands spread out to your plastic fuckin shrine where you perform the rituals fuckin Karen should be doing since she's being paid 80k a year to do it but it's easier to pass on her fuckin work to the intern making 15 an hour because she doesn't know how to read a fucking wiring diagram or P&amp;ID. You sit there all day with fuckin matlab and excel and solid works and whatever other ritual you needed to perform that day just like the Muslims that you all hate for no reason get down on their knees and pray everyday. It's no fucking different. We are slaves to fucking money and if you don't believe it wake the fuck up. It is a fucking system and if you want to get out of it well you get from whenever you make it home from work, beat and tired from your horseshit office slave day doing everyone else's work, until the next morning where you need to go do it all again. You get the hours where your brain is working the absolute shittiest because the good hours have been spent wasted toiling away at a plastic and metal electric shrine where you're only making the man money. At least you get to go home and watch your TV and shove Doritos into your face until you pass out because you have no self control. Every time you bring that unhealthy bullshit into your mouth it is just further affirmation that you are in fact stuck in this system, you are a meat robot that makes money and that's it. Because if you weren't you wouldn't be treating your body like shit because it's the only one you get. You wouldn't be working an office job at a desk that makes you so depressed you toy with the idea of ending it even though you would never do that. You wouldn't keep going to a university that doesn't give a fuck about you and studying material that you hate. But what if you decided to change? What can you do? There's no options. I don't know what to do. Our government is too busy getting fuckin poppies to make synthetic heroin and oil to make gasoline from the Middle East to give a shit about any of us. The only thing our government wants is more money for oil and tobacco and alcohol and pharmaceutical companies and all the fuckin big wigs who pay them. This is a load of shit. I wish I could just get up and move to an island somewhere but I'm 56k in the hole from fuckin student loans and if I bail then I fuck over the people who consigned for me. Maybe I should just go to jail the government would probably be pretty fuckin happy with that right? I mean we have fuckin private prison systems in this country. People are fucking profiting off of locking other people up. How the hell is that okay? I heard about a guy in San Diego the other day who is facing fucking life in prison because he threw up some gang signs on facebook. Fuckin dude never had a criminal charge against him in his entire life. But he's black so he's probably guilty right? I just don't know what my options are guys I'm sorry for the rant. I just hate everything. Weed is illegal but fuckin go buy a pack of cigarettes and fifth and have yourself a grand old time. Here's the bottom line if anyone is still reading..

I have no idea what I'm gonna have to pay per month but I know it won't be covered by working a regular job. I've been thinking about maybe joining the Air Force because it seems like the most laid back of the military branches. The only reason I'm thinking about this is because it seems like the only escape from going into default on my loans. And I don't even know if that's a solution. Meanwhile I'm just sitting here worried about how the fuck I'm gonna pay rent that I'm still late on from last month. I don't know. Maybe I'll just go back to sleep. Fuck it. "

I wish I was better informed from the start, but I'm at a point where with 5 months left on my current work permit, I might not be able to file for residency in time.

Here's my story. 

I'm from a country where crime and corruption is close to the norm, daily murders are common to hear about and generally anything's for sale if you have the money. Early on it's something I knew I'd try to escape until such a time I'd have the tools to protect myself. By 'tools' I mean the ability to have a decent career from the skills I've gained, regardless of where I worked. So 7 years ago, to considerable cost to my family, I was able to move to Canada to get a degree. We were never well off, but we lived very cheaply and saved enough to afford it. For a while, it was good. I'd excel in my classes, I'd make friends, I'd enjoy meeting people that thought about things in completely different ways than I did. The concept of recreation outside of TV was new to me, but I hid it well and assimilated.

Soon enough the beginnings of my fall would be put into place, only to be realized nearly a decade later. I wasn't able to get a job through my university's internship program. Simply no foreigner was allowed - even if you're an excellent candidate. I didn't pay much attention, I focused on my school work, and worrying about graduating on time (I simply couldn't afford more time at that school.) Years pass, and my classes grow tedious, but by the grace of the department I graduate! With Honours!

I begin looking for work. Nothing comes my way, the market is too competitive, I've no experience, I can't get a job. Eventually something opens up and I jump on it. Taking the first offer I had I toil away mercilessly at a job I hated. Nothing else mattered I just needed to get enough work experience to file for residency, and maybe I'd be able to progress in my career if people didn't need to worry about hiring me.

At the time, to file to become a resident you needed only 12 months of full-time work experience in a skilled job. That was really all it took for someone in my situation. But the company gets bought 11 months in for me, I'm fired for following my bosses orders, and I plunge head first into an 8 month long depression fueled job hunt. I despair for months. I'll have to move home, I won't get a job with a degree this specialized, I won't get a job. I wasted all that hard work my family sacrificed for me, I can't live with myself for doing that.
But one day a miracle happens; my phone buzzes and someone want's me to stop by just to chat. I didn't realize it but this was an interview. This guy's small business was growing and he needed someone that would fit in, someone that would be able to help. He offers me a job and I give it everything I have - I rack up billables of inhumane quantities for him and I'm happy doing it, finally I'm working in a job I'm supposed to be doing. My future is my own to make, and I get to do it helping people.

I start to file for residency, it's a year from my visa expiring and I want to get a head start. Now, never before was I asked for proof of my proficiency in English. Never. I was always exempt, why would you question it when my country's official language is English, my degree was taught in English, and I can keep a job that uses English. I'm by now accustomed to placing N/A in those parts of applications. 2 months pass and my application is returned. I need to take a language test. I'm furious, but I scramble, I take one not even knowing what the test was going to be like. Another month passes before the results are given to me. I return my application to the immigration processing facility. Another 2 months pass. After a long day, I'm greeted to a large envelope in my mailbox. That's never a good sign.. ""You qualify, but your application is over the 8000 per year allotment, even though you're a skilled worker, you must use another process to apply.""
Immigration law has changed, the processing is now more streamlined, and quite an achievement for a complicated problem. But I'm again broken. I pull myself together and apply. It's simple and I think I've a high score of 800 at the end of it! Surely that's good enough. I pay no attention to being asked to register for a job bank. It must just be one of those strange things that they'd like us to do.

It festers in my brain. Every day I take the bus to work, I get to think while someone else drives, and well I just can't afford a car. But it occurs to me, I added numbers to get that score, what if I added incorrectly?! I get to the office that day and it's busy but I take a peak at my online application, I fucked up. I've a score of 440, I need a score of 750 at least to meet the average score needed to THEN be even allowed to apply for residency.

I try to use the heartbreak I've grown accustomed to over my past years here, surely I've been through so much this won't hurt, but it does. It breaks me again. I go home and sit on my couch, and think back to the time when I first got a job. I couldn't afford furniture then, and I slept on the floor next to the radiator. Pro tip; you want to stay warm in winter when you've a ground floor apartment.

I reapply, it must be a mistake, I'm qualified! Rules don't change to screw us over. Surely there's a mistake. I make it clear that I have a job offer, I don't need to look for work! But no, it's the same thing that happened with my language proficiency, something I was previously exempt from is no longer something I can be exempt from. Side note: I graduated with a math-heavy degree, things not being internally consistent upset me.

So here I am, 5 months to go before I get kicked out of the country. I've studied up on what I need to do to get a qualified job offer, but it's an expensive and lengthy process. Takes a month at least, some lawyers say 3 to 5 months, costs 1000 dollars, and has the risk of me losing my job. I'm screwed, my employer might not want to help. If they do it could risk me losing my job or it could take too long for me to be able to benefit from it. I'm here waiting for my boss to get back from his vacation to see if he'll help..

Yours, 
r_ck.

TLDR: I assumed past experience with immigration was a good predictor for the current state of things, I was wrong, and I'm going to get kicked out of the country."

I've posted here once before, eventually found someone I liked, but his availability is ultra limited! Boo! So I have a lot of pent up energy.

Me: Short and thick girl so you have to be down with the BBWs, but have great proportions (so busty it's very challenging to buy bras, and my hips and ass don't lie) and a pretty face. Have plenty of honest pics to share. I'm a bit nerdy, mostly for comics and cartoons, and quite relaxed and personable. I make a fantastic friend with benefits.

You: Local! This is most important, I'm really busy. I work in Monmouth County and live in northern Ocean, so around that general area is best. You also have to be able to host because I'm a poor intern who lives home at the moment haha.

When if comes to a FWB, I love someone who'd like to smoke up together first, and has a slow and sensual body worship type style. Obviously orally inclined, and I also looove to be rimmed so that would be a nice bonus. Of course after I get mine I do like a bit more energetic fun ;)

I'm mostly available weekday evenings and some weekends, so you have gotta have decent availability on that front once or twice a week. I'm great fun to be with, very open minded and definitely return the favor for someone who makes me feel nice.

Get at me, y'all, tell me your basics and why you fit what I'm looking for."
2zlumh,0,2015-03-19,"College Freshman Trying to Balance Two Jobs to Become More Financially Independent from my Parents, Advice?",Rawzee,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zlumh/college_freshman_trying_to_balance_two_jobs_to/,"Hello! I first want to thank you all in advance for your time, comments, and advice. I'm at a bit of a crossroads and was hoping to make a decision after posting this thread (which I hope is in the right place). It may be long but all of this has been jumbling around in my head and I really just need a place to lay it all out.

So, I'm a 19 year old college freshman at NYU. I have been trying to become more financially independent from my parents since money is tight for our whole family. My parents are covering the majority, if not all, of the loans for school so I don't want to burden them by needing X amount of dollars each week/etc. I now put away a certain amount of my paycheck each week to pay for next semester's housing tuition, making weekly income a pretty important factor in the following section. 

I've recently made a resume and began applying for jobs on craigslist to work part time (~20 hours seemed reasonable). I had one interview for a ""social media marketing/PR"" firm which would look good on my resume, but they didn't get back to me for a month. Long story short, I started working as a host at an Italian restaurant (roughly ~22 hours a week, all on Fri/Sat/Sun/Mon) for 3 weeks until hearing back from the PR agency that I was hired as an intern. I accepted the offer and start this Monday.

Now, I am split between doing both jobs (40+ hours a week in addition to classes), working as a host for the great money, or working at the PR agency as a resume builder for about half the money. I thought it would be simple to decide, but there are so many factors at play, which I will try to lay out below.

**SCHOOL:** I have 10 hours of school (Mon-Thurs, no class Friday, minimal homework so I have a lot of free time).

**HOST JOB:** 
Amazing pay, roughly $19/hour to seat people, flirt with girls, have fun in very relaxed environment with very nice co-workers, no dress code, flexible schedule, cool boss, short commute from my dorm, and 75% staff discount on delicious expensive Italian food after shifts. However, it definitely has a negative impact on my social life since it is Friday and Saturday nights, then all day Sunday. I usually dress to go out after shifts but end up missing many events, plans and parties regardless. This has been the biggest, if not only, negative since I realize I can only be in college once. Also, I can't really add this job to my resume (or can I? I have no idea).

**Internship:**
It is a paid internship which is a definite plus, but only pays $10/hour (basically my weekly earnings would be sliced in half), 
it would look great on my resume (would be my first actual professional job/internship since I have no prior work experience besides the Host job for the last 3 weeks), more difficult commute to work (the subways make it hard to get from the East to West side at my location), seemed like a very relaxed environment with mostly young and cool people (the firm also includes a fashion marketing sector so there were some really cute fashion-loving girls in the office, that's always a bonus), and importantly they are only open Mon-Fri from 9AM-6PM (this means no more missing weekend events or working late nights). Finally, they are allowing me to work from home on Monday and Wednesday (8 hours), but then in-office Tuesday and Thursday (7 hours), and all day Friday (8 hours). 

I'm considering try to do both at the same time for the following reason and PLEASE let me know if this is a dumb idea: My GPA first semester wasn't too great relative to all my peers (I got about a 3.33 in one of the easier schools. Keep in mind that I only say this is low in comparison to many friends getting 3.7+ GPAs in the same school and people getting higher GPAs in Stern, the business school here). I thought that bringing up to future employers that I worked both a job and an internship simultaneously while maintaining a decent GPA would give me quite a bit of credibility and would say a lot about my work ethic. *Basically, I'd try to convey the idea that I focused a lot on professional life while at school, which is why my GPA is quite a few notches lower than my peers.* 

Again, thank you so much for reading. I really appreciate any response, comment, piece of advice, questions, anything at all. I really needed to get this all out.

2zm1ol,480,2015-03-19,Ein Wort zu unseren Zuschauer und deren Mündigkeit,[deleted],rocketbeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketbeans/comments/2zm1ol/ein_wort_zu_unseren_zuschauer_und_deren_mündigkeit/,"Hi Leute, erstmal ""Danke"" für die vielen Glückwünsche! Habe mich sehr gefreut.

Ich möchte kurz mal eine Tatsache/Information anbringen, die scheinbar nicht allen von euch geläufig ist und die schon öfter zu Missverständnissen und der Verbreitung falscher Tatsachen geführt hat.

Heute wurde auf Twitter etwas Staub aufgewirbelt und ohne näher darauf einzugehen möchte auf eine immer wiederkehrende ""Belehrung"" seitens verschiedener Nutzergruppen im Internet eingehen.

Heute habe ich auf Twitter und auch hier im Reddit öfter gelesen, wir als Content-Creator müssten mehr aufpassen was wir von uns geben, da uns ja auch viele junge Zuschauer verfolgen. Wir hätten eine gewisse Verantwortung der wir nachkommen müssten, da diese jungen Zuschauer vielleicht nicht genug Erfahrung oder Wissen haben könnten, um Ernst und Spaß/Satire/Ironie voneinander zu trennen.

Gleiches wurde uns schon zu Beginn der Support-Aktion von vielen YouTubern/Social Media Gelehrten vorgehalten. Wir würden ja Kindern das Geld aus der Tasche ziehen und unsere Basis auf dem Taschengeld von jungen Menschen aufbauen.

Ohne groß ins Detail zu gehen und Interna auszuplaudern, hier ein paar wirkliche Fakten:

Der Großteil unserer Zuschauer hat ein Alter zwischen 18-34 Jahren (84%). Lediglich 1,7% unserer Zuschauer sind im Alter 13-17. Wir haben sogar mehr Zuschauer im Alter von 35-44 Jahren (5,7%)

That's a fact! Und es sollte eigentlich jedem aufmerksamen Zuschauer klar sein, dass wir eben eine andere Zielgruppe bedienen als der Rest der gesammten YT/SM Welt. Und genau für diese produzieren wir auch unseren Content.

Wir halten unsere Community für erwachsen und mündig genug, um einen Tweet wie den von Etienne auf die richtige Art und Weise zu verstehen; nämlich als provokanten Humor ala Etienne. Wir haben uns intern alle gut drüber amüsiert und ebenfalls unsere Mitarbeiterinnen haben gleich verstanden wie es gemeint war und sich über Etienne und seine Art amüsiert.

Bevor also von außen der große Zeigefinger gewunken und geschrien wird: ""Denkt doch auch mal an die Kinder!"", sollte man sich über den ""Ist""-Zustand informieren und sich uns einmal genauer angucken. Dann würde man auf oben genannte Fakten auch von alleine kommen.  Wenn euch der Humor trotzdem nicht zusagen sollte, gut, dann müsst ihr daraus eure Konsequenzen ziehen und das wäre auch euer gutes Recht. Aber wie Eddy schon sagt, wir passen unsere Art nicht für ein paar wenige an nur um besser in eine Schablone zu passen.

Beste Grüße,

I'm a second year CS student and want some advice choosing the best summer internship. I have software engineering internship offers from Lockheed Martin in their Missiles and Fire Control area and from a not so known energy company that has a start-up culture.  

I feel like I'd learn more modern, relevant software engineering practices at the energy company (e.g: they do agile development) vs Lockheed Martin who has been around forever and probably doesn't do things the most modern way since they are such a large company.

My goal is to try to snag an internship and full time job after graduation at one of the software giants like Amazon, Facebook, Dropbox, Microsoft etc. I have heard some mixed things about Lockheed from other students who have interned there from my school and they said it depends what group/project you get put on. But, that they largely emphasis on testing and teach awesome testing practices which I know is a great skill to have. 

Also, would having a big name like Lockheed on my resume actually make a difference to these software companies?

Basically I wanna know your guys' opinion on where you think I should intern at, which would best prepare my resume and myself for the companies in the software industry.

Thanks!"

She was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder before we met but felt it was in her control when we met. We had a great year and then some hardships hit her hard. She was in band in college and she was kind of betrayed by her support system and had to leave what she felt was her family. She lost that support system and lost her control. She went into a deep depression which has overcome here ever since. She hates going to school, she doesn't have a job, she refuses to have any friend for fear of being betrayed again, she won't help around the house. This is my first post on this subreddit and I hope I don't sound like I am belittling her but I am just overwhelmed. I work full time, go to school full time, I have an internship, I clean the house, I cook, and I am her only emotional support. I am just exhausted. I want to help her but I have kept this up since early Summer 2014. She has been diagnosed with sever depression but we can't afford any medication to help her. She gets very agitated with me if I say something wrong or I can't devote all my free time to her. I love her dearly and I know she loves me the same. I want to stay with her but I am just so afraid that if I do this will be the rest of my life.

Chequing: 9400 (currently) + 4000 (come May from my internship)  
Savings: 50  
TFSA (Tangerine): 5500  
TFSA (Tangerine INI220): 1000  

I have school in May-Aug with tuition that is going to cost me roughly 7-8k. I'll have to pay rent for the 4 months which will cost around 400 monthly. I'll also have to pay for food and other necessities that I assume will be no more than 500 monthly.

So my questions are:  
1. Should I move some money from my Chequing into a saving account because i know i have more than enough for the next few months? And if i do end up not having enough cash i can always dip into my savings right?  
2. I want to invest more with the 5.5k i have in my TFSA. Should i invest it in the INI220 fund or someplace else or just leave it in my TFSA. Note: I know money that i put into investments i shouldn't touch for at least 5 years and i wont."

After that he became a regular guest at our house, for dinners, the occasional movie, or dropping me off somewhere when my parents couldn't, even on holidays since he has no family.

He was handsome, sweet, and kind. Of course I developed a little crush on him. But he never pandered to me the others would a little kid- he talked to me like an adult. But he was never inappropriate and when teased about my crush would blanch.

That changed when I was 21 and graduated college. I got a ""grownup"" job with my dad and found myself basically living there to prove that I deserved it. Since James also practically lives there we became friends, real friends, not just polite-family-friends friends.

Soon we began to date and at first my family was a little hesitant but admitted we made a perfect couple. And I have never been happier. At first, James would sulk and question our relationship on the age difference, but then he declared that he didn't care if it was selfish, he was happy and that was that.

And we were happy. For two years, we made a fantastic life together. We got a dog and he learned my hobbies and I learned his. But today he told me that ""this isn't right or fair"" and broke it off. 

I am devastated. I feel like I deserve more of an explanation. Yesterday we were in love (and genuinely had one of the happiest days we've ever had) but now he broke it off. I want to demand more explanation but at the same time I am afraid if I see him in person I'll humiliate myself. I don't know how to face him at work.

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

2zml2e,17,2015-03-19,"Girlfriend dumped me last night because she ""didn't realize the extent of my depression and self-hate"" (her words). I'm 26 and still a virgin, drove someone else away because I let her in, and I think of suicide every day.",gsodgh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2zml2e/girlfriend_dumped_me_last_night_because_she_didnt/,"Backstory: I'm attending grad school in a city far from home. I met my (now ex-)girlfriend through tinder over the holidays when I was back home. We hit it off amazingly and we both said we would like to attempt a relationship. We knew it would be long-distance through Skype. She is a teacher and made plans for her vacation time to be spent with me in the city where i'm going to school (that vacation time is now). From January until March we talked over text every single day and skyped each other almost every night. We both couldn't do without seeing each other. She is the type to ask what I'm thinking and what is bothering me, and I developed so much trust with her that I let her in, and revealed so much about my true self. 

I told her that I believe I suffer from depression, although i haven't been formally diagnosed since I haven't been to any mental health doctors to discuss it. I am 26 and still a virgin and never had a relationship of any substance before her. Being a virgin at this age makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit and believe that something is severely wrong with me. She said there is nothing wrong with me but so many people have told me that (mostly online) and I just don't believe it. Earlier on she talked about how she could help me with that, but later said she had stopped all conversation on that topic because she didn't want to build up an ""expectation"".

I am also 26 and still have yet to enter the workforce. I have been going to college since 2006 and this is also contributing to my depression. I majored in something I don't feel is too practical and did not find an internship for it while I was still an undergrad. I was banking on grad school. I graduated senior year in 2010 and entered grad school for my pure-track major from 2011-2012. During this year I began to realize I could do nothing with my field other than become a professor in that field, and have no real-world impact on society outside the field. I want to have an impact, so once I got my first Masters, I took steps to apply across the country to another more techincally-oriented professional masters program. I got accepted to that and have been attending since September 2013. I am set to graduate at the end of this summer if I can get all the requirements completed. All through this time I have been trying to apply for internships related to this field and have gotten interviews but they all either never respond back or respond with ""we have decided to pursue other applicants"". I think it has something to do with the fact that I'm 26 and have no real-world experience in the working world. This bothers me just as much as the virginity and I am feeling extremely depressed.

Back to my ex-girlfriend. We were both so excited to finally be seeing each other after nearly 3 months and, naturally, I was excited to have an opportunity to finally lose my virginity. She came and I was cuddling and putting my head against her and being extremely emotional because that's just the way I am. The next morning she told me she was uncomfortable about the entire situation, and was not the touchy-feely type, and didn't like that I had an ""expectation"". She said straight up we're not going to have sex, we're not going to do anything sexual at all, and I'm not even going to get to see her naked. Yet she still said she didn't want to give up on being with me, she just said she needed a lot more time to develop the same level of attachment I had, and it wasn't going to happen during the week-long trip. She made arrangements to stay at a hotel instead of with me. I did my best to accept this but I just could not shake the feeling of not being wanted.

Yesterday we went exploring in town and went to see some attractions. She knows me very well and I don't hide emotions well and could tell something was really bothering me. When we got back to her room I finally told her, she wasn't being receptive to my affections (refusing hugs and kisses even for 2 straight days) and I could not shake the feeling of not being wanted and it hurt. She knew I was a virgin and I brought this up again with her. I'm 26 and my desirability has not been validated for so damn long and now she comes here and continues to not validate that and that is damaging to me. I felt that I don't mean as much to her as she means to me and that hurts me so deeply. Finally I understand I'm being completely selfish and want to consider her feelings but my depression and apparent self-loathing gets in the way of it all. I asked why she even wanted to be with me in the first place, she said because she didn't realize the extent of my negativity and depression and self-hate. She said I wasn't fit to be in a relationship right now and ended it last night. She's still in the city, apparently doing stuff on her own now. I'm completely heartbroken and I know she is too.

Anyways, the company is located right in the heart of Mountain View and  I've been searching long and hard for apartments but I'm not getting any luck. 

So far I've found ok options in Sunnyvale and San Jose, but I'm not sure if living there would be a good option. 

If I decided to look in San Francisco, I would be looking ~~at a ~50 minute~~ *haha I get it the commute would be a lot longer* 1 hour 30 minutes, at the least, commute to work. 

For those of you already living and working in the Bay Area, is it worth it for me to live in San Francisco and have fun in the hub of young tech innovators, but take a ~50 minute commute to work everyday, or am I better off finding a place in San Jose, closer to work, but far from San Francisco? 

Any help and insight would be much appreciated!

**Edit**: If you have any recommendations of districts in Cupertino, San Jose, Santa Clara, etc., that I should be looking at instead I wouldn't mind that either. I'm just trying to find a place close to Mountain View but still good for a young 20-something year old."

I am an undergraduate CS major heading into my senior year next fall who just finished applying to roughly 10 different internships. I haven't heard back from all of them yet but trying to keep my chin up. If the worst case scenario does happen, what can / should I do to properly prepare myself for a good job once I graduate?"
2zmxvc,23,2015-03-19,"Girlfriend dumped me last night because she ""didn't realize the extent of my depression and self-hate"" (her words). I'm 26 and still a virgin, drove someone else away because I let her in, and I think of suicide every day. (x-post from /r/depression)",gsodgh,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2zmxvc/girlfriend_dumped_me_last_night_because_she_didnt/,"Backstory: I'm attending grad school in a city far from home. I met my (now ex-)girlfriend through tinder over the holidays when I was back home. We hit it off amazingly and we both said we would like to attempt a relationship. We knew it would be long-distance through Skype. She is a teacher and made plans for her vacation time to be spent with me in the city where i'm going to school (that vacation time is now). From January until March we talked over text every single day and skyped each other almost every night. We both couldn't do without seeing each other. She is the type to ask what I'm thinking and what is bothering me, and I developed so much trust with her that I let her in, and revealed so much about my true self.

I told her that I believe I suffer from depression, although i haven't been formally diagnosed since I haven't been to any mental health doctors to discuss it. I am 26 and still a virgin and never had a relationship of any substance before her. Being a virgin at this age makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit and believe that something is severely wrong with me. She said there is nothing wrong with me but so many people have told me that (mostly online) and I just don't believe it. Earlier on she talked about how she could help me with that, but later said she had stopped all conversation on that topic because she didn't want to build up an ""expectation"".

I am also 26 and still have yet to enter the workforce. I have been going to college since 2006 and this is also contributing to my depression. I majored in something I don't feel is too practical and did not find an internship for it while I was still an undergrad. I was banking on grad school. I graduated senior year in 2010 and entered grad school for my pure-track major from 2011-2012. During this year I began to realize I could do nothing with my field other than become a professor in that field, and have no real-world impact on society outside the field. I want to have an impact, so once I got my first Masters, I took steps to apply across the country to another more technically-oriented professional masters program. I got accepted to that and have been attending since September 2013. I am set to graduate at the end of this summer if I can get all the requirements completed. All through this time I have been trying to apply for internships related to this field and have gotten interviews but they all either never respond back or respond with ""we have decided to pursue other applicants"". I think it has something to do with the fact that I'm 26 and have no real-world experience in the working world. This bothers me just as much as the virginity and I am feeling extremely depressed.

Back to my ex-girlfriend. We were both so excited to finally be seeing each other after nearly 3 months and, naturally, I was excited to have an opportunity to finally lose my virginity. She came and I was cuddling and putting my head against her and being extremely emotional because that's just the way I am. The next morning she told me she was uncomfortable about the entire situation, and was not the touchy-feely type, and didn't like that I had an ""expectation"". She said straight up we're not going to have sex, we're not going to do anything sexual at all, and I'm not even going to get to see her naked. Yet she still said she didn't want to give up on being with me, she just said she needed a lot more time to develop the same level of attachment I had, and it wasn't going to happen during the week-long trip. She made arrangements to stay at a hotel instead of with me. I did my best to accept this but I just could not shake the feeling of not being wanted.

Yesterday we went exploring in town and went to see some attractions. She knows me very well and I don't hide emotions well and could tell something was really bothering me. When we got back to her room I finally told her, she wasn't being receptive to my affections (refusing hugs and kisses even for 2 straight days) and I could not shake the feeling of not being wanted and it hurt. She knew I was a virgin and I brought this up again with her. I'm 26 and my desirability has not been validated for so damn long and now she comes here and continues to not validate that and that is damaging to me. I felt that I don't mean as much to her as she means to me and that hurts me so deeply. Finally I understand I'm being completely selfish and want to consider her feelings but my depression and apparent self-loathing gets in the way of it all. I asked why she even wanted to be with me in the first place, she said because she didn't realize the extent of my negativity and depression and self-hate. She said I wasn't fit to be in a relationship right now and ended it last night. She's still in the city, apparently doing stuff on her own now. I'm completely heartbroken and I know she is too.

Lastly she told me to get help because I can't love other people until I learn to love myself. This morning I made an appointment with my college counseling center and I'm going on Monday afternoon. I don't really know what to say when I'm there.

2zmy1u,2,2015-03-19,Take undergrad research opportunity or keep working in the industry?,lumalav666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zmy1u/take_undergrad_research_opportunity_or_keep/,"Favorite subreddit of all time, period. Thanks to all the lurkering, I landed an awesome internship almost a year ago. However now, I have a new opportunity that I have to think about, and I would like to hear your opinions:

Intro:

a) F1 international student

b) 1 year left in undergrad program (B.S. C.S. Spring 16')

c) Currently working in an awesome mid-size company with awesome people that is only 25 minutes from home that promised tramit my h1 visa after graduation and it has a lot of little perks like remote work, free local nba/concerts tickets, free food on Fridays, etc.

Actual question:

As you may see from my intro, I have immigration priorities to deal with and I am pretty sure that I don't want a life in academia. Also, I am more willing to do an MBA In the future that a Grad degree in CS.

However,

I REALLY REALLY like the idea of pimping out my resume with research work. Basically, the professor who's manipulating/selling the idea want me to invest a lot of my time to prepare myself and complete an undergrad thesis in computer vision. He is promising that I'll be done for the time of my expected graduation. He doesn't like the other option that I have that is to complete an independent study. (I don't know maybe he needs a lot of workforce to complete his research papers or he really likes the idea of selling the whole academia life)

I have a very good relationship with my superiors and if I am complete honest, I don't think they won't say no. Of course, at the end it is a business and they still need to make money, so replacing me should not be that hard. I think. But of course, I would have to stop working with them. As a little fact, another intern went back to school to finish her degree and they liked her so much that they promised her to have a spot after her graduation. So, that is what is really motivating me. 
What would you do?

a) stay in work and graduate without research

b) convince professor to train me for an independent study instead of the whole crazy thesis.

c) thesis

As you can see, I really like option B. Will he accept? Maybe, but will be a good independent work? Thesis is going to be stronger/more interesting and will have obviously more weight on the resume.

Thanks so much for your opinions"
2zmya5,3,2015-03-19,I [23M] feel guilty for talking to my ex (and now friend) [23F]. How do I approach this?,youngchunk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zmya5/i_23m_feel_guilty_for_talking_to_my_ex_and_now/,"This is my first post on this sub although I've dabbled a few times. 

I broke up with my ex around 6 months ago because she was moving to another state after college for an internship. We had been dating/sleeping together for roughly 5 months. I didn't think long distance would work out and towards the end of our relationship I kind of just lost intimate feelings for her. 

The problem for me is, this girl is awesome in so many different ways. She is smart, funny, speaks 4 different languages and has a quirky side that I've always admired. I was just never that sexually attracted to her. At first during our relationship this wasn't a problem for me. We were intimate and it was just okay. As the relationship progressed, our sexual chemistry started to bother me more and more and I know how selfish that sounds. So by the time she was moving away, I had my mind made up that I didn't want to continue a sexual relationship with her anymore and decided to cut off our relationship.

After we break up I start to discover how strongly my ex felt towards me. We remained friendly and she would always want to talk on the phone or skype because she was feeling lonely in a new city. I would oblige because I generally feel like a dick blowing someone off when they seem to genuinely want to talk. In November she came back to visit for a weekend, and we hung out for a bit one Friday night. After a few drinks she tried to kiss me and I rejected her kiss, feeling extremely guilty that I had lead her on again and trying to explain myself. Later that night I got berated by one of her best friends for being a selfish asshole. 

Fast forward a couple months and she is moving back to the state I live in because her internship is over. We still talk regularly because I like having her as a friend, and she usually initiates conversation. Now I have no idea what to do. Do I continue to talk to her and risk leading her on or do I cut things off completely? I feel guilty of I agree to hang out with her because I don't know how she is interpreting our time together. I never feel like I'm leading her on when we talk or when we hang out but her friends seem to think otherwise. Any advice for what I should do?

TL;DR: Broke up with girlfriend because I wasn't attracted to her anymore. Feel guilty still communicating with her and seeing her because I don't want to lead her on. Want to remain friends because she is super cool."
2zn1sy,1,2015-03-19,"Me [28F] with my friend [25F] she's the ""other woman"" and I'm conflicted on how to support her",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zn1sy/me_28f_with_my_friend_25f_shes_the_other_woman/,"I've been friends with Kate (not her real name) ever since I moved to this new city about two years ago. She was my first friend here, and our personalities match really well. The only thing that differs between us is our approach on dating life; she is more of a casual Tinder hookup person while I tend to move more slowly. We decided to become roommates earlier this year in January. 

Kate works in a very specialized field that's pretty tight knit, as in less than six degrees of separation from everyone. She's by no means highly respected yet, but she could be in a few years at the rate that she's going. While hanging out with her colleagues, she met John, who is the boyfriend of another girl named Nina. Nina is about my age and is very successful and highly respected Kate's field. She and John have been together for about 4 years. Nina is often out on business trips at least every or every other month. 

When we first became roomies, I saw Kate every day. After a few weeks, she was gone most nights. I didn't think much of it, I figured she was dating someone new. But then she came home and didn't want to talk to me. She was really somber, and usually kept to herself in her room. After a few days she finally confessed to me that she and John slept together behind Nina's back, while she was travelling. Apparently John was coming on to her hard, and she resisted, but she started to have feelings for him and got weak and gave in. She looked like she was feeling pretty shitty, so I didn't think it was worth it to tell her what a horrible thing she did (I, myself, had a bf that cheated on me in the past). I told her that she had to end it and come clean, before it gets any worse. 

About a week later she comes to me again, this time with even worse news: Kate met up with John with the intention to end things. But before Kate could say anything, John was asking her if she would ever consider being with him if he left Nina. Kate said no, that it had to stop, and that it was wrong of her to sleep with him. Then she got a text from an unknown number. It was Nina, asking her if she was with John, and that she needed to talk to them. Kate started freaking out, cussed out John, and came back home. She decided to call Nina and came clean about everything. All she said back was ""thanks for telling me all this"" and she hung up. 

The next morning Kate woke up to a barrage of texts from Nina, telling her that she's a fucking slut and that she'll ""get what coming to her."" Nina called all her colleagues and clients and told them to ""reconsider doing business with her."" Kate called Nina, asking what was going on, and she basically railed on her, telling her that she's scum, and that everybody knows she's an easy ho and she ""won't allow a fucking slut to sleep her way into the success that she worked so hard for"" and she ""will do everything in my power to squander her career.""  

For the past week Kate has been pretty depressed. All her colleagues and clients have not 'dropped' her, but because Nina has threatened to stop working with them if they continue to associate with her, Kate doesn't hear from them anymore. Luckily she was able to get an internship, but Nina called her up and left a voicemail saying that she could get her fired from that job if she wanted to (which I don't think she can?). Kate has been doing her best to lay low. 

As for John? Nina broke up with him and threw him out. He has called Kate to tell him he was sorry, but Kate told him that he needed to set the record straight because Nina is under the impression that Kate seduced him to get ahead, when it was John who pursued her and was also willing in the affair. 

As someone who was cheated on before, I'm conflicted on how to deal with this. Kate was the first friend I made when I moved here. Some of our mutual friends have called me asking me how I could support Kate after doing such a shitty thing. I don't condone what she did, but I also don't think she should be paying for it with her career and livelihood. I sympathize with Nina, but I also think she's being a bully and she's not handling the situation like a mature adult. 

I'm not sure what to do in this situation. Do I support Kate? If I do, does that mean I condone what she did and take her side? Should I kick her out because of my experience with cheating?
   
**tl;dr**: My friend slept with someone else's boyfriend, and now she's harassing her, threatening her, and squandering her career prospects. I don't condone cheating, but I can't help but feel like she's being bullied. Should I still lend her my support?"

Before everyone says ""eeerrrgh, graphic arts, what did you expect - I already know... ""


Bit of context;
-Studying Graphic Design and Photomedia - Pretty good at what I do, solid marks mostly.
-Had to do industry placement as part of my course (this is mid 2014)
-2 Weeks in and the boss offers me a full time starting immediately, or for me to do a few days a week until uni finished at the end of 2015, *then* start full time.

I like my job, its good fun and I have a pretty good setup there, and they found out I'm a keen 3D modeller which is essentially why they hired me - no one else there can do it, even slightly.

The thing is, when they offered me the job at the end of last year, they said they'd have to hire me as technically a full-time employee - business cards and all -(not a casual or intern) even though I was only doing one or two days a week until the end of uni when I'd start full time.

For many, this is pretty much the dream opportunity, and I was pretty stoked about the offer, and being unemployed at the time with a big uni debt already I took it. They said once I'd completed my ""industry placement"" i'd be put on a training wage of $16 (AUD) per hour until the end of the year, which was fine for me, as they taught me a lot more in a week than I'd ever learned at uni.
The problem is, I'm still on that $16 p/h, and the minimum wage for my age/position according to my states law is something around $23/25 p/h.

I've approached them a few times mentioning about the low pay and they've come back with the standard ""we can't afford to pay you more"" &amp; ""not just yet"" crap, but I'm beginning to feel that if I don't do something about it I won't be able to change it.

I've had a look around for some other jobs but being in the graphics industry in Melbourne, Australia jobs opportunities are pretty slim.

I've got about 2k saved up, but with the limited amount I'm working it's slowly decreasing with bills and expenses.

Not really sure what to do as the last guy who did this got fired, turns out I'm his replacement.

I've lurked on this sub for some time. I've tried to stop masturbating for some time. On Sunday I decided to quit. I'm an intern right now, and I need to get motivated to get a full time job where I'm working. I've also been single for my whole life (I'm 23). So I decided..no fapping until I get that job, and get someone in my life. Maybe even longer if I feel it's really benefiting me.

Anyway, to what happened this morning. So today was any morning. Drive to work, park in my spot. I'm walking towards the building and I hear two excited/happy female voices say ""Hey [my name]!!"" I turn to discover it's these two really cute blonde girls that work in my department. They work around the corner from where my cube is, so I maybe see them once or twice a day.

The thing is, they never really say hi, let alone my name. So I stop and wait for them to catch up to me. Then they start talking to me about clichè stuff like the weather.

Another thing. I usually always get kind of tense/nervous/a little sweaty when around attractive women. That didn't seem to happen today. I still felt a little awkward, but I felt finding my voice was a little easier.

So my question is for thise of you who have been at this awhile. Is this becasue of NoFap? It's only been for days. If this gets even better, I'm not fapping for a long time.

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

You are basically the biggest tease ever. You flirt with everyone but never escalate things. Most of the guys in the office have a crush on you. Me, I just wanna bend you over my desk and go to pound town. 


And that's how we get here. Today I've forgotten my anti-horndog medication. So I've had trouble focusing all morning. When you come into my office wearing the SHORTEST skirt and most low cut blouse, I can barely contain myself...

What happens next? Does the seductive secretary take advantage of her boss and leverage her lusty lips to get a raise? 


Or does our pent up protagonist lose all inhibitions and take his innocent intern right there on the floor of his corner office? 


Maybe our devious duo decide to cum to a mutual agreement where they both achieve sexual satisfaction?


Its up to you! Send me a message with where you'd like to take this, and what your character is wearing. I particularly enjoy D/s play, light bdsm, consent, cumplay and maybe some romantic quips for fun. 


Also into dirty chatting about office encounters in general. "

Now if you've never been to a game, they have this promotion called ""Ford Trade Up"", where you post a selfie on Instagram and have a chance to get ""upgraded"" to courtside.

So my sister and I raced to our seats to make it in time to take the selfie. Boom, few minutes later I see an intern coming to our section. I knew it was about to go down! Sure enough, ""hey, you guys wanna go sit courtside?"" ""DUH!""

So we walk down and we're super excited. Go down the back way and we're there. Left corner, slightly away from the court. It sounded so great, until the game started.

Not only are the waitresses constantly hawking the on-court seats, the ushers chit chat with everyone who walks down and lets them stand while the game is going on. I probably saw a fifth of the game. Didn't even notice the lead was almost blown.

I also still live with my parents and sister. I am going to move away when I transfer to a new college to finish up my last two years, but that won't be until January.

I have tried dating websites and apps since about June but I just wasn't the biggest fan of them. I met up with 5 guys from those websites and apps and they were fun, but online dating isn't really for me. Long story short, does anyone have a suggestion of how I could meet gay guys around my age, say 18-22 year olds?

I don't know how to start this except to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry because I have almost no memory of the things I wrote, or even of writing them at all.

Three days ago I woke up in the hospital looking like I'd taken a brisk jog through one of the circles of Hell. I had no idea how I'd gotten here or what happened to me, but from the looks of it, it seemed like I'd been attacked by an animal of some kind. There were cuts and bruises all over my body and a pretty bad hematoma had colored my right eye red. I knew who I was and all that, but my last solid memory was of job searching after leaving my old job. After that it gets blurry. It's a bit like trying to remember what your third grade teacher looked like. 

The nurses have been nice to me, and extremely patient with what I can only describe as my overall confusion with life, but whenever I ask them what happened they have no real answers. The only information I got out of them was that I'd been found wandering around near the shore, bloody and disoriented, and when someone tried to approach me to ask if I needed help, I nearly clawed the poor guy's eyes out. From there your guess is as good as mine, but I'm pretty sure it involved some cops and a handcuffed ambulance ride. Apparently they tested me for drugs and found a bouquet of narcotics in my system. A bouquet. Their words, not mine.

Two days ago one of my neighbors was nice enough to pick up a few things from my apartment, one of which was my laptop. As far as my phone goes, who knows what happened to that thing, it's at the bottom of the ocean as far as I know. Having my laptop is nice, though. I use it to kill time while I wait to get out of the hospital, and also to send my mother an email telling her I was okay. She didn't respond, of course, but at least I did my part. My conscience is clean.

You can imagine my surprise when I opened the page titled “The Body Farm” and found all these things I'd written just days ago about an island full of corpses. I've never experienced anything like this, but my head was flooded with pictures- small moments, bits of faces, both alive and dead, snippets of conversations like sound bites on the news. Each piece was cut too short to make any sense. It felt, honestly, like a dream, something I'd made up to entertain myself, except that some of the pictures felt too real, too grounded to be a dream. I read every word of it. If I blinked more than twice in that time, I'd be impressed.

It's a strange feeling having that kind of distance from something that happened to you. I felt like one of those people who yells at horror movies, except the actor on the screen looked exactly like me. I wondered why on Earth I would go back to that island, not just once but twice, and how I could be so naïve about the doctor. I formed opinions and took guesses as to what the truth was- I'm pretty sure all that missing body and handprint stuff was Terri running around the island being generally insane- and became frustrated with how it ended. That confession bit? I really wish I knew what I was about to say there. Just ten seconds more and the truth would have come out. Maybe it's better that I don't know, now that I survived and all, but as they say- the truth always comes out in the end.

Yesterday was a bad day. The pain was stronger than normal, so the morning nurse gave me an extra dose of morphine along with all the other antibiotics and various meds they have me on. It helped to dull the pain, but with it the rest of me was dulled, too. The whole day I felt like I was being held under warm water, watching the bodies float past, never quite close enough to touch them. It took me a minute to understand what the nurse was saying when she said someone was there to see me, if it was okay with me. All I could say was, “Can't everyone see me?” I mean, had I died and become a ghost? Did they need to ask my permission for me to appear? I said yes, of course, they could see me, and a minute later I was looking at a hand holding a badge, and someone was telling me his name was Detective Andrews and he wanted to ask some questions.

I took a minute to sit up, drink some water and shake off the fog. I apologized to the young detective and told him he looked familiar. He was surprised and said he'd actually tried to speak to me a few days earlier but I'd been too out of it to hold a conversation. “You were beat up pretty badly,” he said, “can you remember anything from the attack?”

So it's true I was attacked.

“That's what it appears. That's why I'm here. Do you have any reason to think otherwise?” I told him I was pretty sure I was attacked, but I was having a hard time sorting out exactly what it was that had attacked me. He could tell I was holding out on him. “I don't want to force you to relive a traumatic event,” he said, “but if you know something you're not telling me, I have to insist for the sake of the investigation.” After a few moments I got my laptop from the side table, opened the bookmark and  spun it to face him.

“You have to read the whole thing,” I told him. He looked confused, but he agreed. A little while later he closed the laptop and handed it back to me.

“You can't actually believe this.”

I'm not sure what I believed, I told him, but a few facts remained: one, I had been attacked by someone or something incredibly violent, and two, some of my memories coincided with the events in the story. He was skeptical, but he said he would look into it on the off chance that parts of the story were based on real events I had distorted. “The brain has a funny way of taking creative licenses,” he said.
 
Before he left I gave him all the details I could drum up and told him his best bet was tracking down some of those interns who had worked on the island. He told me I was better off not sharing the story with anyone else, including strangers on the internet, for the sake of the investigation. I assured him I had no interest in having people look at me like I was sick in the head, especially when I told them a murderous doctor and a girl with a ghost brother were trying to kill me. I told him that included strangers on the internet. Obviously I was lying about that part.

This morning the phone by the side of my bed rang. It was Detective Andrews saying he'd found Doctor Christianson's name attached to the island, but that the university had cut ties with the doctor a number of months ago. He went on to say that records of the interns who had worked on the body farm were sloppy at best. As of yet he'd had no luck tracking any of them down. 

But it got better. He also informed me that the police had found no evidence of foul play on the island other than signs it had served as a body farm very recently, a fact on common record, and that any clue to the doctor's whereabouts led invariably to a dead end. 

A dead end. His words.

Here's the final kicker: he asked me if I would go with him to the island. He wants me to show him around the place, take him through the story and maybe even point out where they should be digging for clues. After saying no about nine or ten different ways, and him saying it was the best chance at finding who had hurt me, I agreed on two conditions. One, we would arrive on the island during the day and leave before it got dark. And two, we would have a full police escort the entire time we were there. The actual words I used were “a butt-load of cops,” but  the meaning was all the same.

He accepted my conditions. We go in three days, the day I get out of this hospital."

2zp7bw,1,2015-03-20,college friend and now coworker [M24] is plagiarizing my work and messing with my career [M23].,lostmessage256,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2zp7bw/college_friend_and_now_coworker_m24_is/,"So a little background. I graduated college last May and was offered a full time job as soon as I graduated at the place where I was an intern for a over year. I work in a small engineering team and I have a unique specialization that puts me in charge of a lot of elements at my work. The guy that I was intern under and who trained me was a 30+ year industry veteran, was offered a great position elsewhere and left our company in November. 

My boss said that because I was doing so well they would not hire an engineer in the specialty that is senior to me but rather find one that is junior or equal to me that I can train and mentor. My friend, lets call him X, graduated this last January with a degree in an entirely different engineering field and had a lot of trouble finding work because he did not have any internships or research or a stellar GPA any other resume builders under his belt.  I thought i could hit two birds with one stone and recommend him to my boss as a good candidate for the position, so that way i could work with a good friend and help him get on his feet as well. 

Here's what I have a problem with.

X got hired last month and is now working at my place of work. In that time it seems like he has been coasting through work and not putting in much effort into learning the various aspects of the job. He has been using a lot of code that I developed for projects and adapting it to his, and even doing that he often needs my help. This guy is supposed to be able to hold his own if I am ever out of office on a trip (which I sometimes am for weeks at a time). If he starts looking bad it will reflect very poorly on my because i recommended him to my entire chain of command. 

Also in that last month, he has taken my LinkedIn page and plagiarized a lot of content from it (almost word for word) which makes me a bit uncomfortable. I get headhunted and recruited for side work all the time and having a clone of my profile out there makes me feel like my professional image and, to an extent, my livelihood is being jeopardized.  


What do I do now?

2zpm8p,16,2015-03-20,TIFU by ordering coffee like a douchebag,AbortRetryImplode,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2zpm8p/tifu_by_ordering_coffee_like_a_douchebag/,"I had a late night doing server upgrades and so I decided to reward myself this morning with the free coffee that's been sitting unused on my Starbucks card.  I'm normally a black coffee or earl grey tea kind of girl.  I'll buy coffee for my employees and people I'm meeting with, so I'm used to the ridiculous orders.  But I like to keep it simple.    
I stood looking at the menu board and trying to decide on what I wanted.  Apart from the rare pumpkin spice latte I didn't really know what was good that was non-seasonal.  I got up to the counter and as soon as the barista asked what she could get started for me I blurted out my favorite intern's usual order:  ""I'll have a venti half caf skinny caramel macchiato...with an extra pump!"" Never in my life have I felt like such a raging stereotypical white girl.  iPhone in pocket, Prius in parking lot, ordering coffee that's obnoxious enough to make up for the fact I'm not wearing leggings.  I took my free shame coffee and headed in to the office.    
My morning routine slogged on as usual: the scuffle for a parking space, the walk to the office.  I put my coffee on my desk and went to retrieve some papers my boss had left on the printer that I had passed by as I came in.  That's when I heard the unmistakable sound of liquid hitting the floor.  It's been raining lately so I expected another roof leak as the obvious culprit because I have NEVER in my 18 years of having a job managed to spill my coffee (my boss does it at least once a month, which I'm kind of in awe of).    
Nevertheless, there was my extra large and douchey coffee laying on its side completely empty, tipped over by the back of my chair which had apparently kept turning after I stood up without my notice.  The first thing I saw was my phone seemed to have taken the brunt of the butterscotch typhoon, so I quickly turned it off until I could take it home to put in a bag of rice.  The bluetooth keyboard and mouse were the next biggest victims and I watched as it fed some incomprehensible garbled text into an iMessage to my mother while I fumbled to turn both off without letting the puddle progress further.     
As I started to clean up I realized how much worse of a situation it was than I had originally thought.  My external hard drive with my backups and important files was soaked, as was my DVD drive.  It had dripped off the front of the desk and into the drawer that I keep all my USB thumb drives in and had gone under the enormous sheet of glass on the desk.  The carpet was completely drenched.  And absolutely everything was **sticky**.  
That's when there was a knock on the front door to our offices.  I ignored it.  They could come back later when my office wasn't an explosion of coffee.  Then came a much louder more insistent knock followed almost immediately by the sound of our door being flung open.  It turns out my mom had gotten the incomprehensible string of text from my dying keyboard.  So she texted back ""Are you ok?""  No answer (because by then I'd turned my phone off and unplugged my computer).  So she tried calling my cell phone and it immediately went to voicemail.  I had never given her my office number so she couldn't try reaching me there (it's a shared line so we try to not take personal calls on it).  But she basically inferred I was being murdered by an intruder so she called campus security.  I appreciate that my mom worries about my safety, don't get me wrong but I felt incredibly stupid explaining to the slightly disgruntled guard that I was fine and that my mom had been sent the dire message by a cup of coffee.   
With the distraction gone, I went through two rolls of paper towels and almost an entire tub of Lysol wipes mopping up the mess.  Then I spent half an hour rummaging in our storage room trying to find a new keyboard and mouse.  It's now four hours later.  My office reeks of coffee and fake caramel.  I cleaned the carpet as best I could but it's still soaked.  And I'm pretty sure that halfway through next week it's going to start smelling like coffee, fake caramel, and spoiled milk.  In spite of all my cleaning everything is still covered in a disgusting patina of stickiness and no amount of scrubbing seems to be resolving that.  I also still haven't had a cup of coffee. I think this is the universe telling me I should stick to drinking it black.   
**TL;DR: Destroy lots of office equipment and data, mom assumes I'm being murdered.**

So I work in a startup, we're a small team of 5 people. We recently hired a new intern [24F]. I'm on the tech side, she's on the communication/marketing side. At first, I didn't liked her, I mean, I was ok to work with her, but on first sight, with our different background I didn't wanted anything more than a professional relation with her. 

Then we spoke a bit, then it hit me... This is one of the most amazing women I've ever met... I'm very focused on my carrier, I rarely date women, I've not been in a relationship since high school, and I tried to met some woman, but none seemed mature enough to me.... But her ... she basically changed my life... even if she doesn't know anything about that...

Yeah...

She have a BF, I don't know much about him. I know her since 1 month, we didn't talk much at first, but it seems like she enjoy talking to me now whenever we have time for it. Both about work and other personal things. I love talking to her obviously, and it's very rarely smalltalk, we talk about our background, what we did before, what we enjoy, our different of point of views etc... She and I have some great conversation I think. 
I'm very confortable speaking with her alone, we did have some time only the 2 of us at lunch or in the morning/evening, and she seems very confortable with me. 

I didn't made any move yet, I help her when she need help, I'm maybe nicer to her than to some other people, but I didn't told her anything nor I invited her at an event outside of work. 
She have a boyfriend, and it seems that everything is going fine between them, she mentioned him to me a few weeks ago, maybe twice, but since we talk a bit more, the didn't mentioned him again. Sign or not... I'm fine with it. 
I don't want to let her go without trying anything... but I don't want to ruin our team, our relationship at work and her current relation with her bf. 

I did texted her a bit 2 or 3 times after work, we talked a bit, but nothing more. Mostly about work related jokes. I don't want to be the oppressive coworker or the stalker and she have a bf... She never texted me on her own yet...Which is something I can understand since she have a BF. 

Maybe I'm making some ideas, maybe I'm just the nice guy at work she likes to speak to... But she really behave kind of different with me than with the other. 

I read this sub a lot, and it sound like everytime it's mentioned that the other one have a bf/gf I should basically let go... I really want to try something. 

My next move is to try to invite her for dinner at a restaurant after work. Just the 2 of us. I want that to be my move... So I think I'll know rapidly if she want us to have a relation outside of work, if she want to invite her bf, of if I'm just a good co worker... 

Story of my life.... I'm a very sensible person, I'm not showing anything on the outside, but I'm kinda obsessed with her, I rarely met someone I can feel confortable with that soon. When I leave work, I feel really depressed until the next morning when we say hello and talk a bit. 

You can ask me questions, and I would gladly get any advices I can. 

Thanks! "

We both go to the same school and work at the place and in the same team together as interns. On top of this we have become very close friends and hang out often outside of both work and school. I also stay over at her place several times a week (she lives a lot closer to work than I do). We share many of the same interests and hobbies and she is the first girl I've met that I can truly be myself around. I have asked her out several times and have been turned down. 

The problem I am having is that the more I get to know her and the closer we get, my feelings for her grow. I have been through the unrequited love battle several times before and have always conquered it by taking time away from whoever it was and letting the feelings fade. I don't really see a way to really do this given the fact that we have to work together (we have both accepted jobs working on this team after we graduate and lets just say that it is good enough right out of college that I would be an idiot to walk away from it) and see each other all the time. I do not want to lose this person as a friend and I also don't want to be left carrying a torch for them either. I feel like I am stuck in a position where there are no good choices.

Any advice?"

Dear friends,

As you may or may not know, my final day with the City of Boston will be March 27, 2015. I have decided to take a position with the City of Seattle leading their Active Transportation initiative.

When I began working for the City in 2007, Mayor Menino pledged to transform Boston into a world-class cycling city. Under Mayor Walsh, the city has continued to move Boston forward for cycling. There will be an exciting announcement about Commonwealth Avenue on Tuesday, cycletracks on Connect Historic Boston should break ground in the spring, and New Balance Hubway is expanding in Boston in late summer 2015.

I am proud of how much we have accomplished together for cycling here in Boston. Since launching we have added 92 miles of bike lanes and nearly 2,000 bike racks. We have an award winning Community Biking Program which has donated 4,015 bikes and trained 23,000 youth. And of course, the New Balance Hubway system has become a new Boston institution.

Kim Foltz from Boston Bikes will be the immediate point person on issues related to bicycling, supported by a remarkable, dedicated, enthusiastic and tireless Boston Bikes team that includes Program Managers Najah and Jenny, mechanics Nate and Jonat, interns Meghann and Mar, and our many youth cycling instructors. They are the quiet champions behind Boston Bikes’ success.

I am honored and humbled to have had a chance to serve you and all the residents of Boston these last 8 years. I hope I have contributed to making Boston a great place to live, work, and visit. Since many of you have become friends over the years, please do stay in touch. My personal email is thefirstsnerf at gmail dot com.

With utmost respect and appreciation,

Nicole Freedman

I later came to find that the prereq in question was Intro to Discrete Structures, which I took in my Freshman year and received a C-. Despite not being listed as a prereq for in the class catalog or tech elective list, it prevented me from getting into CNT 4714 (I needed a C or better, not a C-).
I managed to get an override approved from my adviser, but CECS rejected it. I visited the professor who teaches the class to discuss the prereq requirement, and he told me he has no idea why it is even a prereq since they don't use any of the topics from Discrete, and told me he sees no reason that I shouldn't be allowed in the course. I then went to CECS to discuss it, where I got quickly shot on the justification that they had a 100% unwavering policy when it comes to prereqs, which was instructed to them by the dean (in a conversation where the person I talked to was extremely rude to me, and flat out insulted my adviser to my face). My final attempt was to email the dean of the engineering department, but I never heard a reply back.
So where I currently stand with this is: I have the support of my adviser and the professor who teaches the course. I have no less than a B in all of the listed prereq classes in the class catalog. Based on class availability, I may not be able to find an alternative tech elective before I finish Senior Design 2. I have several years of real-world business experience in the class topics, and they are topics I intend on pursuing after graduation. And CECS is still telling me I am not qualified enough to take the course, and I have not been able to even contact the dean via email.
Do I have any moves left here? Any ideas as to how to get around this asinine roadblock?"
2zq2fa,1,2015-03-20,Planned trip during probationary period,tbkudo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zq2fa/planned_trip_during_probationary_period/,"I'm about to start a permanent position at a big company, but I had planned a personal four-day trip in middle of June (planned a year ago and all paid for), which happens to be during the probationary period of three months. In mine and some others' opinions, taking a vacation during the probationary period doesn't look good for anyone. 

I haven't had the formal interview with the manager yet. I thought I would bring it up during the interview to ask what some of my options are. Realistically, what should do or plan on doing besides to look for another job just in case this one doesn't work out?

**Some Background**

* I am currently an intern at this company which ends on April 30th (I started in January)

* I may take a leave up to two weeks at beginning of May to prepare for my internship report and presentation to my professor (which the manager said they are willing to give me 20 days max before I can officially start)

* To be honest, I did not expect to get a job offer. I applied for the internship position mainly to finish the remaining credits for graduation. That's why I had planned a trip a year in advance thinking I might be still looking for a job while I'm taking my trip. 

Edit: To clear any confusion, I am an intern that was offered a permanent position by the manager. I'm just going through a formal hiring process that a new applicant would go through. Since the position has been offered, the interview is most likely about my base salary and any additional questions the manager may want to ask me.

Please reddit help me out.,DownandoutMI,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zq6q6/almost_a_year_unemployed_and_its_seriously_taking/,"And if nothing else, I will serve a warning and wake up call to people. This is a throwaway because several of my friends know my plight and will probably find this post.

I am 26 years old, and this coming May I would have been unemployed for a year. The last job I had was actually an internship right before I graduated law school. Well that summer I graduated and studied for the bar exam. While I studied, I applied to all types of places. That fall, I found out I failed. I took it again, and resumed the job search and after coming across 5 interviews, two from the same company, I am coming up empty.

The feedback I am getting is totally baffling me. Stuff like, they didnt think I can multitask (even though in that same interview I painstaking described that in two of my previous jobs I did nothing BUT multitask) or that I wasnt enthusiastic when I was job shadowing after an interview (I was talking that dude UP about what its like to work there and asking TONS of questions about the job). 

I just dont get it. It seems that was my final chance to get an office job before I get bar results, which mind you doesnt come out until May. My savings are dwindling, and I even resorted to staying with a family member. I am going absolutely crazy not having anything to do, and I know I can be an asset. Every type of internship I had was met with glowing reviews.

And its not like the second I get my results ill bolt, I know companies are giving me a chance so I will reward them with loyalty. I know they dont know that, but lawyer jobs are hard to come by on its own, it might be awhile. 

I just dont know what to do. I prepare for every interview I receive, and I am getting met with baffling feedback at best, and the cold shoulder at worse. I just want a job, ANY job at this point, to bring back meaning in my life. I think I did ok on the Bar Exam, but I do not know for certain if I pass, and I dont think I can take another 5 months period of being unemployed, especially since I dont think I can last much more on my savings. 

Thank you reddit for listening. Even if there is nothing that can be done.

I'm a CS student, finishing up my sophomore year. I've literally applied to nearly 150 different internships for this upcoming summer, and so far I've only had 1 offer. My GPA is around a 2.7, because of some health issues I had my second semester of college. If it weren't for that one semester, I'd be around a 3.3 or so. Outside classes, I'm very involved in STEM outreach and leadership.

Last summer as a freshman I interned at a well-known, fairly difficult-to-get-into software company. All the other interns were Master's/PhD students, or seniors from top-tier schools. I go to a somewhat small state school, nothing special. I got through a lot of rounds of interviews, and somehow got the offer. I did well with my internship, but when I got called back for an interview for this summer, I screwed up (technical interview), and they rejected me for this summer. I feel like absolute shit about it, because I'm sure the other interns are all returning. I really want to go back this summer, but that's not happening. :/

The only offer I have so far is from PG&amp;E out in San Francisco, CA. Given where I interned last summer, I feel like I'm slipping, because they hired me only after 1 interview, but I had so many rounds to go through last summer before I was hired. It was so much easier to get into. It's also not as ""prestigious"" so I feel like shit about that, because I see so many people getting internships at companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc. and I'm just not good enough.

I've had interviews with 3 or 4 other companies I was really interested in, but they all found better candidates, or just never responded.

What's wrong with me, how do I make myself more competent?"

This thread is for a more specific approach that I am seeking to make the best possible use of resources that I will have.

Some background info/context:
- I am a sophomore computer science student and have got a summer research internship that I am very excited about. I will be getting a stipend of about 1300$ (tax free) every month along with a fully furnished 2 room apartment free of cost (electricity bill is not included). 

Calculation of expenses:

-Electricity bill ~$100 (it will be hot, so AC might contribute to that)

-Phone bill ~ $32 (T-mobile 30$ plan)

-Haircut ~ $20$ 

Now the dilemma that I am facing is regarding food cost. I have never cooked anything and considering how hectic my schedule would be, I am not in a position of cooking anything either. Eat out everyday @$8/meal will cost about $500 /month. 

Is there any way I can bring this down? I can replace some of these meals with bread sandwiches/pasta to bring that down to about $400. 

Does this seem like a correct strategy or can I make some changes? 

Thank you. 

EDIT - Messed up the title it seems...sigh

2zqgdd,8,2015-03-20,[O&amp;G] Calling all experienced petroleum geologists: need advice,Rocketman3563,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/2zqgdd/og_calling_all_experienced_petroleum_geologists/,"I am at a career crossroads and want to get this subs advice. Like some of the other posts I have seen, I am a about to be a new graduate. However, unlike most of them, I am fortunate enough to have a full time job offer and am not too concerned about the company rescinding it. 

What I am concerned about is the outlook of my chosen industry and profession in the near to mid future and is who I want your advice.

I think there is a significant chance that oil prices remain depressed relative to the last few years. This scares me. In this scenario, instead of dynamism and growth, I would be working in an industry that is constantly cost cutting and laying people off and mergers and asset sales create volatility for employees. While industry has been warning about the 'great crew change' for many years, I am afraid that they have been crying wolf. I am not convinced that the positions of many retirees will be filled again in a long time.

Pursuing a career in oil and gas has been my dream for nearly half a decade now. To that end I have completed two internships, will graduate from one of the premier oil and gas schools, and will produce publishable research. I have networked, I have produced excellent results for my employers, and I am now ready to direct my full creativity and energy to my future employer. 

I am not so certain that this industry wants or needs me in this lower oil price environment. If oil prices do not recover to their previous levels, I feel that there is a significant chance that I would  be laid off. If there is one thing I am not willing to do, it is to sit on the sidelines waiting for the price of a commodity to rise. 

I believe that it would be unethical and harm my reputation to pursue other opportunities after accepting an offer, so I am considering declining the offer and pursuing a career in academia or in other industries. If I had 5 years experience, a little downtime wouldn't bother me. As it is my status as a new graduate will be ticking.

So my question to you, petroleum geologists of reddit, is: assuming that the latest bust is a severe 1980s like downturn, would you choose to start your career as a new graduate in oil and gas and if so why (or why not)?"

I lost my appetite, was barely eating and when I did, I would throw it up. I actually fainted at work and smashed my face into the bathroom sink. Went to finals day with a black eye. The finals itself was horrible even though I passed. After that, I didn't have time to rest or recoup before the next semester started and my appetite remained low. I lost 6 kgs within that month. I tried to maintain the weight loss with healthy eating, and was actually doing really well with a dairy free and low-carb diet. But recent events have led me to stress eating - the complete opposite  of before - and I. Can. Not. Stop. So many factors; mid-term project deadlines coming up; getting ready for an internship and move to another country; my mother is having health and mental issues that needs my constant attention; my husband and I are in long-distance relationship where we haven't seen each other in 3 weeks and it will be another 4 days before we do. My appetite has come roaring back, and I literally feel sick and dizzy if I am not overly full. I constantly feel exhausted and depressed, my sleep pattern is bizarre where I'm asleep early and wake up early but still feel tired. Everything has gone monotone, almost like the colors around me are bleaching out. The icing on the cake (mmmm...but I digress...) is that the stress-eating is adding even more stress, especially as I feel bloated and gross and jiggly. It's a vicious circle and I am so scared of gaining back the weight I lost plus more. I need help. Please?"

My ideal situation: 20k down payment on a used Audi S5 (~40k) with 20k left to pay which I would take care of. I would keep the car through college and 3-5 years after until I can buy something nicer. I play on working ~20 hours weekly and having internships each summer so do not see a 350-400 monthly payment being a problem. I guess I am jumping the gun on buying something like this but just wanted everyones take. At the end of the day I don't have much financial experience so I'm sure I'll receive a lot of good advice.

Insurance: Reduced because I am on my parents' policy (~70 monthly)

Is this feasible? I won't have loans for college as I got a full ride and will be getting back around 1k each semester due to left over scholarship money. "

I am in my second year of Computer Science at a University that used to be a polytechnic school (hence not very recognized). 

For reasons unknown I made a very big mistake;  I **omitted my education as well as any hint of my age on my resume**. On my resume I just included a technological summary of my skills, my past internship/work experience and that's it. Right now I am slightly freaking out that I have lost  many *potential* opportunities because of this stupid mistake. 

I apply mostly on Indeed, Monster and Career Builder and since I'm not part of any Co-op program there aren't many paid internship positions in my area abit the ones I applied to. (Maybe I'm not searching hard enough but I applied to 40+ places with one or two that open daily)

I want to get back in touch with these companies or reapply with an updated resume but am unsure of how to do it.

________________________________________

I have a few questions

1. How should I handle my mistake? Should I reapply to positions still open? 

2.  If a job ad was posted +15 days ago but isn't taken down should I assume the job is still vacent? 

3.  I planned to ask this as a separate question so *don't feel obliged to answer* Or ask me to post this separately. Will applying for developer jobs that pay stipends/below minimum hurt my future career prospects? I see many successful people on this sub who had internships that pay $25+/h during University and it kind of made me question standards for employment. Is it still encouraged to gain learning experience at a startup or frowned in this sub?"

I recently rejoined a temp agency 

After two weeks they've found a job doing clerical work at a car financing company. It's guaranteed to be 1 week, possibly stretching into 2-3 weeks full time and they do all their permanent hiring through the agency. So the possibility of being hired permanently is there. I've been told they're looking to hire FT people from the pool of temps (which could be a lie...). 

I've also been asked to interview with the Post master for an assistant carrier position at the post office. I scored well on the in person exam they require every applicant take. I've been asked to interview for two different areas in the same capacity...meaning two different post offices want to interview me. I'm very confident I'd be taken on as they've continued to pursue me. 

But I'll keep the scenario hypothetical at this point. 


The temp job pays 12.00/h

The assistant carrier position pays 15.60/h


My career goal at this point is to gain office experience. I just finished an internship with a U.S senator about 3 months ago and for the last month I've been interning with a start up non profit. Regardless of which position I'd take I'll continue working with the non profit. 


My question is should I 

1) Take the temp position, hope it last a few weeks and potentially go for permanent. I'm thinking even if it doesn't last more than 2 weeks I'll still build some history with the temp agency and hopefully continue to get placements in offices where I'm trying to build experience. 

or

2) Take the post office position which has various hours... the glassdoor reviews I've read have ranged from 60 hours a week (6 days a week) to 10 hours or less a week. It depends on the area and the time of year as well as the current full time staff (sick leave, etc). 

You essentially cover routes when needed and assist when there is demand. 



Ultimately I'm thinking the temp agency is the best bet. If I prove I'm reliable then I could continue getting placements at full time. The post office could pay off if I'm getting significant hours but it's no guarantee either. 

I know I still need more information, but what would you guys suggest?

anything I haven't thought about?

This is my first full time summer internship and I was wondering if there is any advice anyone has to offer between now and the summer.

I was curious about if anyone had a rough idea of what I can expect daily (It was explained to me in a fairly broad manner), should I be trying to contact them occasionally/stay in touch up until my start date, if I can do anything to prepare myself in the mean time, etc.

Sorry I hope this isn't too vague I just am not too sure on the step in between now and starting in June.

Thank you for your help! "
2zqrax,2,2015-03-20,College student here. Will not having a good social life negatively impact my chances at an actuarial career?,robot90005,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2zqrax/college_student_here_will_not_having_a_good/,"I made a throwaway for this post since it's rather embarrassing to admit that I do not really have a good social life. Don't get me wrong, I do have some friends and acquaintances, but I only speak with them when I pass by them around campus and when we meet during club activities. I do not ""go out"" with any friends, as I like to keep to myself (that, and I do not really have any good friends to invite out anyway).

It seems that the biggest problem with not having a good social life in terms of this career would be the obvious lack of communication skills. I managed to ameliorate this problem as I have been working as a math tutor for a few years now. I am definitely practicing my communicating of technical concepts to lesser informed audiences with this part-time job.

For some additional information, I have passed two exams (hoping to pass a third before I graduate). I have a decent GPA at 3.8, and I have an actuarial internship lined up this coming summer. I am also currently practicing all the software and programming languages readily available to me that actuaries use. So far, my resume is lining up quite nicely with these credentials. 

As I said, my only concern is the lack of a social life. I'll admit, one reason I was drawn to this career was that I heard it was a good career for quiet, introverted people. Though from what I've heard recently, it seems that the actuarial field is gravitating away from this notion and actuaries are becoming more outgoing, energetic and sociable. How bad would it be for someone like me to enter into this field?"

I'm a student intern and very new to SQL so I asked my boss the same question, and he told me to first make a new table from one of the four, and then individually append the remaining three tables into the new combined table.  This definitely got the job done, but I'm thinking there has to be an easier and faster way to do this, where you can add all four tables into one new table with one set of column names using one string of code.  

When I was trying to do this I was instead getting the columns from each table acting as unique columns, so you'd have 

Column_1, Column_2,...Column_n from Table 1 followed by Column_1, Column_2,...Column_n from Table 2. 

Here's the code I was using

    SELECT VV.*, CP.*, FV.*, CE.*

    FROM Visa_Verde_Course_List AS ""VV"", Fairview_Course_List AS ""FV"", Chualar_Elementary_Course_List AS ""CE"", Chalone_Peaks_Course_List AS ""CP"";

Language wise I prefer JavaScript. Currently I am delving into Node as well as front-end frameworks like Backbone. I've done some PHP/SQL, tried out Laravel (awesome) and currently looking at Rails and learning a lot, which I am liking.

I go to school out of state, and my spring break is ending tomorrow, so I could really only do phone interviews before I come back in mid-May.

I recently got turned-down from the only internship I had in mind(which wasn't profession-related) and I am absolutely clueless as to where to start looking; most internships seem to require knowledge of multiple languages -with a large amount of them requiring a lengthy experience with those languages- so I am left really confused and frustrated and wondering if it is possible to find internships that would even consider me?

2zr5p4,3,2015-03-20,"Me [19 M] with my [20 F] SO of 5 months, ex-stripper and had problems with lying and her ex. Need advice ASAP",footballjets24,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zr5p4/me_19_m_with_my_20_f_so_of_5_months_exstripper/,"Started seeing my current girlfriend in November of last year. We are both in college at the same university, she is 20 and I am 19. She was a stripper when we had started dating and it did not bother me at all in the early stages of our relationship. I believe this is because I wasn't fully in love with her. She worked in a club in our current city that was fairly safe; cameras in every room, no full nudity, and she had worked in a club in a different city over the summer, (she had an internship in that city) that was not as safe. About 2 months in, once I had fully fallen for her, the stripping began to cause me a lot of problems with jealousy, anxiety, etc. I told her I thought it would be best if we broke up because I wasn't able to handle her stripping and it would be unfair of me to ask her to quit. To my surprise, she offered to stop stripping, saying she didn't really enjoy it and that I was more important to her. 

Anyways, the relationship was going fine until I fucked up. She keeps journals and up until that point, I didn't really have any clue what she was writing about- I figured poetry, drawings, etc. One night she left her journal on her desk and I took a look while she was using the bathroom. Now before I get into what I saw, I should mention that she had an ex boyfriend that she was still in touch with at the time. They had dated in high school and had remained friends after breaking up- I didn't think anything of it. Anyways, she had written in the journal that she and this ex were seriously discussing marrying each other and that she was excited to marry him because ""we are both on board"" and ""everybody knew this would happen."" She had even told her mom about this.

I felt as if I was being used- she and her ex were planning marriage while she was with me, and I confronted her. She told me that he had cheated on her while they were together and that he currently lives in another state and that their conversations were nothing serious. I believed her for a while until the issue came up again. I was laying in bed and she was showering. Her phone went off with a message from her ex, and it was a bunch of heart emojis. I shouldn't have done this but I looked in her texts, and she was telling him she loved him, calling him handsome, basically acting like an LDR. I confronted her again, said she had lied to me about her relationship with her ex, and told her it was him or me. I don't feel like this was unreasonable. 

She told me she was just ""keeping her options open,"" which I felt was extremely inappropriate, but that she would tell him to fuck off basically and show me the text she sent him. Later that weekend we went out to dinner for my birthday and she still hadn't mentioned anything about talking to her ex. I spent the night with her, and the next morning I looked in her texts again. She had told her ex that ""a friend"" wanted her to stop communicating with him but that she ""doesn't care what he thinks."" She had then told him she was out to dinner with ""a friend."" Keep in mind that I was this ""friend"" and said dinner was my birthday.

I broke up with her and it was very sad, but a few days later we got back together. Apparently she had called him and told him to stop contacting her. She also told me she was done with ""lying and sneaking around"" as it would only ""blow up"" in her face. Things went fine for a while but we ended up breaking up again for various reasons; a lot had to do with her lying to me over the smallest issues, which I saw as a trend. It was around this time that I found out that she had been giving her clients ""extras"" at the rougher strip club in the city where she worked her summer internship. To be clear, she didn't have sex or give oral to her customers, but apparently she had let clients come on her, finger her, etc. and this concerned me about STDs. I would also consider this cheating if she had done it while with me.

I realize that I must sound like the world's biggest sucker, but we ended up getting back together again. She went back to work for one night because her sister was in town and wanted to see her at the club (I found this to be really strange), and this brought back a lot of the old jealousy/anxiety problems I had had previously. This time I was also concerned about STDs because of her experiences in the rougher club. 

We are currently still together but I honestly don't know if this relationship is worth it. We won't see each other much over the summer, as she will be back at her internship, and I'm really concerned that she will go back to stripping without telling me. I realize that it isn't my place to decide whether or not she should strip, but I'm concerned about STDs and I'm also concerned that she will cheat on me. I'm also not interested in continuing our relationship as long as she is a stripper. I can't get these thoughts out of my head because she has really struggled with honesty in the past. 

I think its worth mentioning that she has seemed reluctant at times for our relationship to be in the open. She's introduced me to her friends as simply ""my name"" or worse, ""my friend, my name."" I also tried to put ""in a relationship with..."" on Facebook and she got very upset and asked me to remove the post which I found strange. She doesn't have many female friends, and she has complained to me in the past that all her friends are ""guys that want to fuck me."" This also concerns me.
 
Basically I'm constantly worried that she will cheat on me, get back with her ex, go back to stripping, etc. This has stemmed from her lying to me, being seemingly uncomfortable with our relationship being in the open, and her past experiences as a stripper. 



 tl;dr: My girlfriend has had problems with honesty and I need advice on whether or relationship is worth it"
2zr6al,2,2015-03-20,It started on Tinder and ended in crippling anxiety.,Thisismythrowaccnt,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2zr6al/it_started_on_tinder_and_ended_in_crippling/,"About a year and a half ago, I decided to get a Tinder. While I've been told that I'm fairly attractive, I'm also reserved and standoff-ish to a fault, largely thanks to my social anxiety. I figured that using it would give me a way to maybe meet a few people while simultaneously giving me a much-needed confidence boost.

After using that damned app for about a month, I met someone who was wrong for me in the all the best ways possible. He was 34 (I was 20), in amazing shape, and also holding an appealing job in the medical field. Long story short, I met up with him, had sex, and continued talking to him for a few weeks until he eventually pulled a fade on me for reasons we never addressed. I hate to admit it, but this embarrassingly affected me profoundly. It never left my mind and I would Facebook stalk him multiple times a day, looking for clues in regards to who else he may be seeing.

Fast forward a month later and he matches with my best friend. This friend and I are close enough to the point that we figured we'd mess with him a little and suggest a threesome. Another long story short, it actually ended up happening, and funnily enough, brought me a lot closer to my best friend. 

As February, March, April, May progressed, we continued to hook up, just me and him. I knew we'd never date, but I did enjoy his company and talking to him, and the sex got better and better every time we'd do it, which was probably once or twice a month. I left for the summer to do an internship, and while we didn't talk that much, we started right back up as soon as I returned. Between summer and Christmas, the routine stayed the same, and then this week, I thought it'd be business as usual: I'd go to his place, we'd fuck, talk for awhile after that, and eventually fall asleep. All week, we talked about when we'd meet up and what we'd do, and 30 minutes before I was supposed to go over there, he texted me ""Thisismythrowaccnt, I want it. I want it bad. But I've met someone and my conscience can't take it.""

I knew this would happen eventually, and through my obsessive Facebook stalking, I knew that he was dating other women (seriously or not, I have no idea). Through the past 1.5 years, I've also dated/slept with my fair share of men, but I never felt the same way toward them as I do toward him. He's 36 now and probably wants something more serious. I'm now 22 and moving to New York City in July, working a job in engineering that will pay me enough to live the lifestyle I want. 

Despite all of this, and despite the knowledge that he was likely using me for sex, and I was using him for validation, I've had this knot in my stomach all day. I can't pinpoint why it bothers me. I don't feel rejected, but at the same time, I do. I don't feel deceived, but at the same time, I do. I don't feel taken advantage of, but the same time, I do. I don't have any ill feelings toward him, and I don't know if I should. I know he has lots of issues - he constantly friends women on Facebook that I suspect he's met on Tinder, only to defriend them weeks or months later. You always hear about how single men over 35 must have ""something"" wrong with them, and as much as I can see how that's so true in this case, I know I'm going to miss his company a lot, as sporadic as it was. 

Mentally/outwardly, I am a very rational person. I keep all my emotions, anxiety, and ""crazy"" on the inside. I have a therapist that I try to share all of this with, but it's so hard for me to get it out because of the super rational facade that I put forward. My best friend knows this situation inside and out (as well as all my crazy), so at least I have her to talk to, but talking about it doesn't seem help me either. I know that my life will be so different, and when I look back on this 2, 3, 4 years from now (just like I've looked back on all the other guys I've been with through the past years), it'll be ridiculous to me, and I'll laugh at it.

But right now, it feels so bad. I don't even know what to do to distract myself. Getting it off my chest certainly feels good, and typing it out makes me see how ridiculous it is...I just wish the knot in my stomach would go away. "

I think with my leadership/organization skills from the military, my programming and tech skills from previous jobs, and my personality, this would be a good fit for me. Prior to the military I had 4 years at an IT company repairing computers and then eventually database admin and programming. Still a ""military on leave"" employee there, so on paper 8 years with that company.  

I plan on interning with a few companies while going to grad school to get my foot back in the door and help me decide for sure what I want. 

Now for my questions...
1) For internships, what type of positions should I look at? I know this may sound silly, but I'm not sure how many project management internships there would be. I love programming, so should I go in that direction to obtain more experience to become more qualified?

2) Once grad school and my internships are complete, do you think this would be an adequate amount of experience to start in project management right off the bat or would I need more experience?  

I guess my concerns are:
+ I don't want my 4 years of military (and not in the IT world) hurt my chances in the experience department, hence interning.
+ I don't want to come into an entry level position (again) with an MS and previous exp, or for the MS to hold me back on jobs 

Thanks for taking the time to read this :) I appreciate your guys thoughts and advice!


EDIT - The reason I am jumping straight into grad school is A) I'll be getting it paid for and living expenses. B) I want to experience being a full time student for once. :) "

I have applied to two different programs at college and I don't know which one to pick, the first is close to my house, it's a computer technology course and I could to do it but I don't see myself doing that. The second one is music administration/ business, working at labels and stuff like that, the program mainly focuses on intern-ship, but it's is far from my house and not an easy commute (two buses, hour and something) and if I intern some where that is even more travel. I am lost as what I should take. My parents are against me taking the music one for multiple reasons and they said they won't support me if I take. I'm currently unemployed (I have social anxiety which they don't understand) and I'm looking for work but it is extremely hard for me. What makes me upset if the fact that I don't find interest in many things, but I love music and I finally found something I could actually see my self doing, and they just shoot my idea down without even considering it. I hope to get a job soon but even then I have to get many things done with the money, so I'm screwed.
I would love to hear from you guys and tell me what you think. Should I just take the music program despite their disapproval, or should I take the computer course I have no interest in?"

2zriv1,2,2015-03-20,My ex [23M]broke up with me [22F] after 5 years and has been stringing me along for 2 months.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zriv1/my_ex_23mbroke_up_with_me_22f_after_5_years_and/,"My ex and I have known each other for 10 years, were in a relationship for 5. We have broken up several times before, always him breaking up with me saying he just ""needs space"" and wants to ""learn how to be alone."" After every break up, he would still talk to me saying he loves me and misses me, and we would get back together within a month.


In our last breakup, I found out that right after he broke up with me, he was sleeping with an old roommate and friend of mine. He said it meant nothing, and he was lonely. Said he couldnt even get it up for her (who knows if thats true). I believed him and forgave him (fuck me, right?). 


4 months ago I moved to Phoenix for an internship and he stayed in Kansas. He promised we would do the long distance thing, everything would be alright. Things were great, he visited, life was good. 


Then one week, I didnt hear from him and couldnt get ahold of him. After several days, he finally picked up. I asked what was wrong, he said "" I think you already know."" He broke up with me, saying his usual ""I just need to learn how to be alone and figure my life out."" 
I was devasted, didnt see it coming at all. We talked for awhile, and he ended the conversation saying he still loved me and we woukd get back together, he just needed time. 


Two months passed. Technically we were broken up, but he ended phone calls saying I love you. Said I miss you, we sent dirty pictures, and he said he didnt want us to see other people. I visited him, and we acted like we were back together. Like nothing had changed. 


When I returned to Phoenix, he switched again. Said I need to ""look at this realistically,"" that he ""doesnt want to be in a serious relationship for a long time,"" and ""doesnt want to work it out."" I lost it. I told him I would never let him put me through this again. Well, he jumped on that. Didnt return my calls or messages for 5 days. Deleted me from facebook. I sent him one last message saying I cant believe he cut me out. He finally responded, saying when I ""calm the fuck down we can have a mature, adult conversation about this,"" and ""this is the reason why we didnt work out."" 


Today, I found out from a mutual friend that he has been talking to/hanging out with my old roommate that he slept with when we last broke up. I dont know if he is seeing her/sleeping with her now.
  

I dont understand what happened. I dont understand why or how he could string me along. Any and all insights/advice, and tough love are appreciated. I know I need to cut him off. I know that I deserve better, and that I need to move on, but I dont know where to begin. I put all of my love, commitment, and 5 years into this relationship. I have known him for 10 years. How could he do this? How do I build up my self-respect so I never take him back again? 

Sorry for the long post.


   
tl;dr: Boyfriend of 5 years dumped me and continued to use me when he was lonely. Feel like shit. Don't know how to move on. "
2zrmm3,0,2015-03-20,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Pegging, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2zrmm3/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_pegging/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I graduate in May, so I'm trying to get an ""in"" with a company. My main reason for trying to get hired quickly is due to me having a wife and 2 kids. The first week was gravy, and I was reading/learning to myself about the language that I will be coding. 

Then the second week comes by, and my ""boss"" finally comes down to train me. He is younger than me, cocky, and a little brash. Full disclosure here, I have ADHD badly so I struggle to get things at first. Sometimes it takes a bit before it happens/clicks. I'm not so much being trained as I am being humiliated at times. I'm not being told how to do something but rather ""figure this out on your own, and I'm not going to help you"". He makes a lot of messed up jokes such as eating kids and what not , even going as far as ""cutting their throats and bleeding them out"". I don't get easily offended, but that's pretty messed up, right? Especially considering this is supposed to be a professional experience. I don't know. 

They are looking to hire somebody, perhaps an intern, but I don't know if it's the place for me. I don't trust myself or my thoughts any more. I feel like an idiot, because I'm struggling, but I don't know if something is wrong with me again or is this truly a bad thing for me. I'm starting to consider that perhaps I messed up again by choosing a major that deals heavily with concepts I have struggled with. I wanted to prove that I could do it, but I'm having doubts and really don't want to let my family down...

I can't really mentally lay my finger on what I want out of a job, so I am posting here to see if there's some advice on trying to find the ""right fit"" in a helpful way.

Im 36 years old, started working when I was 14-15 in the summers for a my family's business which was asphalt paving.  Did that pretty much anytime I wasn't working somewhere else if school scheduling permitted and work was available.

Did a summer of quickly taught translation from Dibol to C in high school at a summer job, it was OK.  Nothing spectacular, being by far and away the youngest person there aside from other summer employees doing the same jobs was off-putting.  And it ended up being kind of  a competition at speed of translation instead of how useful it was when it was finally implemented, which I also didn't care for.  Wasn't around when their system went live, so never saw it really used or heard anything about it.

For fun after this, I did some programming on a MUD (multi-user dungeon), sort of a text based MMO for those not familiar with them.  I really enjoyed adding new things and being able to fix problems as they occurred and just generally making it a better experience for the players.  Plus it was something I enjoyed playing myself, monitoring, and interacting with the players.  Eventually someone else who hosted it started taking a lot of credit for my work and I was getting busy with college work, so I left.  

Had a co-op/paid intern position at a place working on medical imaging for 2-3 years while in college.  It was interesting at first, seeing how everything was laid out and how things were handled by different groups.  But I felt that the coops/interns at the company weren't really being ""trained"" or handled like a real junior employee would have been, or at least I wasn't.  And I really started to care less and less about the job.  I was not offered a full time position, which really bugged me more than I would have admitted at the time but it made sense as I had been put on a lot of non-critical ""future project"" type work that really never turned into anything.  I definitely would not have liked continuing with that with how open ended they left it for me to decide what to do, but I had absolutely no framework to work within to come up with something that would at least look like it met the planet Earth's expectation of &lt;xyz&gt;.  AFAIK this company has been bought out at least once, maybe twice now.  And I dont know of anyone still working there...so it kind of seems like a pretty useless work history point on my resume TBH.

After getting out of college and not being offered a job there, I applied some places but it was during the dotcom bust and I was competing with 10-15 years experience people going for the same positions and it was looking bleak so I went back to the family business and slowly tapered off looking because those summer back breaking jobs left me lucky if I could get out of the bed the next day.

Had another 6 month programming job I kind of landed from a friend doing some part-time contract work for a guy, who wanted to bring it in house.   He recommended me, it was going great for 4 months.  I felt like I was doing a pretty good job for being alone on it.  Was making some medical billing software, it was sort of a bridge between some medical charting software to make it entirely paperless for offices looking to go that way.  But around the 4 month mark, the owner of the company started getting it in his head that he was going to roll this out to hospitals and I was going to be able to account for every nuance of their systems so it wouldn't crash and burn.  I started asking for him to hire at least one more person so I had someone to bounce ideas off of at the very least, and someone would always been in the office since sometimes I had to go on-site to do upgrades or fix issues.  He gave me a raise, which I was paid hourly and working like 55 hours a week just to keep up with the current production, phone calls, support, etc.  Then when I brought it up again 5-6 months into the job, he said no.  And I gave my two weeks, because it just wasn't going to happen with me alone there and it was starting to affect my health being that stressed out and his expectations were only growing.  I loved my immediate boss on it, but the owner had final word and it really didn't matter what I said eventually.

After that I gave up on looking for programming work, lost total interest in the software development aspect.  I still enjoy messing around with the hardware and configuring systems when they have a bit of a challenge to them or are new.  I don't really like doing mundane stuff that could be easily automated if they just invested the money to do so, I'll do it some if it's a small number of computers.  But I can't see myself supporting anything over 10 computers without having software to automate a lot of it.

I have a bachelors in Computer Science, I believe my overall GPA was 3.3-3.4, with the CS aspect of it being higher but never officially calculated.

So, I've basically been part-time employed for 6-8 years now.  For the most part I'd consider myself unemployed just because it's very little work keeping up with a couple family owned business things and helping my parents with paperwork on some properties they own.  The asphalt company they had went under when the economy fell out in 2007-2008.....work just dwindled off and was no point bringing it back after the season ended.

I looked for work for years, still submit some applications on jobs that look like I might enjoy them by their descriptions.  Such as Network Engineer, etc.    But I just don't have the work experience for them IMO.  And I really hate fluffing resumes or BSing in job interviews.  I mean it REALLY bothers me how much bullshit these people are expecting from applicants because it makes the reasonable/accurate resumes look like you've been eating paint chips in comparison.  Plus I live near a Air Force Base and the majority of the jobs and bigger businesses are related to work for or on the base, so security clearances help there.  That's not to say there isn't work, I'm just not getting any bites on it...and quite frankly Im not sure I even want to be in the computer science aspect of it anymore because I don't like how little many places value their IT staff and anything they associate with ""tech"".


I've done some career assessments at the University I went to, but I felt like the people giving these assessments had absolutely no idea what the job prospects in the tech field looked like or your options.  So I guess Im here to see if the people here in the subreddit can take this post and give me some ways to evaluate things that I can turn into a goal and some sort of ""path"" to reach said goal before Im 40.  Hopefully with the least debt possible, but at this point if it will get me somewhere I really don't care anymore.  Because where I am right now is not sustainable, not fulfilling, and honestly not worth living to continue on with.  I am in such a bad emotional place right now I can't even imagine being here months from now.  It just is what it is, so try to be constructive because I realize it's fucked...Ive spent PLENTY of time thinking about how fucked it is.

I really dont' want to limit you, but the job has to have some availability obviously so mere mortals can achieve it.  

And I guess we'll see where the questions and comments take this.

2zse12,0,2015-03-21,VERY LONG POST! [22/M] Never had a girlfriend. Complicated relationship with 3 women. Need Help.,Throwaway65831,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2zse12/very_long_post_22m_never_had_a_girlfriend/,"As the title suggests I've never been in a relationship and am in much need of some advice. This is going to be in excruciating detail so you get the whole picture so bare with me here. For clarification purposes I'll refer to the 3 women involved as A, B, and C. 
Let the back story begin. A and I are neighbors (when shes not away at college) so we grew up together and within the last few years I've developed feelings for her but haven't told her because of the typical fear of rejection and ruining the friendship (yea I know grow a pair and ask her how she feels) well i haven't yet. When she goes ""away""for college (not far but she lives on campus) we barely talk (she always has quite the course load) and I lose hope that there can be anything between us when we don't talk. She has also never been in a relationship and could be as afraid as i am to ask (I can't tell).
B, C, and I all work together (they're the only women in a department full of men) and while A was away at college I grew closer to B. No dates or anything but shes been very touchy feely (very obvious signs) and asked for a date in the future when a certain new movie comes out (I said yes). B only works on C's days off so I see her maybe once or twice a week (B and C very rarely see each other). She is not currently in a relationship (if she's ever had one, i don't know). 
C works a lot so i see her almost everyday and when you see someone that much awkwardness goes out the window. Since shes usually the only woman in the department all of the guys (me included) make nothing but sex jokes and innuendos and she loves it. She has been in a relationship with the same guy for 4 years and they recently got an apartment together so me and the other guys are never serious about all the sex jokes (I think she just likes the attention).  
Now the trouble starts... I was invited to a coworker's wedding months in advance (so B and C knew about it) and was unsure who to take as my date. At the time A was at college and I figured she'd be too busy so i was considering B. Then B straight up told me if I couldn't find a date she would go with me (I could tell she just really wanted to go) so i asked her, she said yes and all was good. Then it turned out B couldn't go due to a surprise family spring break vacation (She wasn't lying, she had proof and felt terrible that she had to cancel). So being dateless I asked A. A in addition to college works as an intern and has no control over her schedule and with the wedding still being months away didn't know if she would be able to make it. So to not disappoint me in the future she very kindly said I should use her as a last resort and try and find someone else. Months go by and I have no one else close enough to me to ask to this wedding so I'm still dateless. 2 weeks before the wedding C asks if I've found a date and offers to go with me (I had mixed feelings about this, feeling like less of a man because i couldn't find my own date). Being out of options I said yes but I still really wanted to go with A for the potential to finally express my feelings for her (hoping I could suddenly grow a pair of balls). So with that in mind AFTER saying yes to C I asked A again (First mistake). Turns out A wasn't working the night of the wedding, said she would go and she was excited. Went in to work to tell C that i had found a date thinking it wouldn't be a big deal because she was already in a long term relationship(Second mistake). Went in, told C, and was a complete and utter asshole about it being high off my own self confidence (basically said ""I found my own date! HA!"" because all we do is joke around). She almost broke down crying (she had even bought a new dress for the occasion) and I instantly felt like an ass and tried to figure out why I said it like such a jerk. I didn't see C for 2 days afterward so I had 2 sleepless nights of feeling like the biggest jerk on the planet. Went to work the next day to apologize and ended up also telling C all about my secret feelings for A and how Iv'e never been in a relationship (I don't talk much about my personal life to coworkers). To make up for the pain I put C through I offered to take her to the wedding again and after some thought she said yes.   
So I went from taking C, to taking A then back to taking C. I explained the entire situation to A (minus my secret feelings for her) and asked if she'd mind if I took C instead to make up for what i put her through and A was ""ok"" with it. C and I went to the wedding as friends (she still has a boyfriend), had a blast and were back to joking around status. In the days afterwards A and I hung out as if nothing happened (she was home on spring break) and I managed to survive with both A and C's friendships intact. 
(And for the finally) B comes back from vacation, I explain the situation (without telling B about my feelings for A) and B agrees that I was a jerk BUT thinks I did the right thing by taking C. And after all that B still wants to make it up to me for having to cancel on me in the beginning. 
A week or so goes by and i start to notice things between C and I feel different (again she's still in a relationship). In less than a week C and I escalated from sex jokes and playful showing of skin (small amounts of lower back or stomach, nothing provocative) to mutual and welcomed butt touching (I'm 22 I'm not gonna say no to a woman telling me i can touch her ass). And just today that playful showing of skin escalated to full on showing me half of her ass in some very nice black lace panties...I don't know what the hell is going on at this point, if C likes me, If shes still playing around or if shes just doing this for attention. And i have not told either A or B that C showed me her ass. And I've never met C's boyfriend so I can't tell him about any of this either.
If you're still here thanks for reading. I will take any and all input anyone has to say about this situation.

TL;DR:
Don't know whether to ask out the girl I have feelings for or the girl that has feelings for me. And definitely don't know what to do about a third girl (THAT HAS A BOYFRIEND) but also just showed me her ass at work."
2zshqb,3,2015-03-21,TIFU by doing cardio at the gym and throw away the only job interview I have,hal0t,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2zshqb/tifu_by_doing_cardio_at_the_gym_and_throw_away/,"This FU didn't happen today, but today is probably when I know it's real. A little background, I am an international student in a Master program in the US. I am switching career from EE in undergrad to data analytic, because after my last internship I felt like EE is not for me. Summer is coming, and I am looking for an internship. However, probably due to my prior professional work experiences don't match the job very well and international status, I have been applying since late Feb till now with no call. Pretty pressured because I know if I don't get more experience on my resume I will get fucked when I get out of school.

I applied for a job on Tuesday. The job is perfect, good pay and will run from May till Dec, so I can get 7 months of relevant exp on my resume. On Wednesday, after laying at the house all day long applying for jobs, I went to the gym and decided I would do cardio because I haven't done it like forever. At 6:00PM , as I entered the peak of my HIIT, my phone rang, on the other side was the recruiter for the firm saying he want to discuss the internship with me. I couldn't hear him clearly due to me breathing hard, and all the music in the gym. Hell, I was barely able to hold my breath, let alone hold a proper conversation. So I told him it's not an appropriate time to have a serious conversation because I am at the gym, it is very noisy and I am exhausted. He told me he could call back again at a later time. I ask him to call back on Thursday morning, and I said I would send him an email to remind him.

I waited the whole day on Thursday, no call. I called his office and it went to his voice mail. Email, no reply. I think he was probably pissed off at my attitude. My roommate is trying to console me saying it's not my fault, because it's 6PM I should be able to do something with my life beside applying for jobs, and I still have time. But I am just going from stressing out to freaking out. My family were against me going to grad school to switch major, so I am going to grad school with almost no support just because I want to do what I want. Without summer job financial matter will be tight also, but it's another matter. And I had to blow the only chance to an interview I had. 


My roommate bought me some vodka to cheer me up, so I am tipsy. Sorry for any grammar mistake I would make.  


TL;DR: Recruiter called while doing HIIT, couldn't hold the conversation. Recruiter told me he would call back the next day, never did. All this while effort to find internship is in vain.

2zsks9,7,2015-03-21,An experience at VITA,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2zsks9/an_experience_at_vita/,"So I was looking for an internship that was tax or accounting related so I volunteered to be a site coordinator for VITA. *Volunteer* for those not familiar with the program. It's a social program that benefits both the client and volunteer.

So there were a few rejected  returns and I called them to let them know that they have to come in again because there were problems with their return. Usually a wrong last name or first name is mispelled.

This lady comes in that I had called and I pulled up her return to fix the error. Before I even pull it up she says “Oh I use to prepare taxes and I should have seen the error.” 

So I fix her return (had one letter wrong with a name, not on the ID card) and she made a few other rude comments and was very condescending to the other volunteers that had helped prepare and review her return. She was like “Is that the only problem with the return?” I said it was based on what I could see. 

The next day I check rejected returns I see it is rejected again and my stomach just drops. I have to call this lady again and she was more rude than anyone I have talked to before (and I have worked in the service industry for 7+ years, Fast food joints, Grocery stores, Car wash. Typical college jobs). She was  livid. Here are a few things she said:

-	I can’t believe it got rejected again
-	Who ever prepared my return should be fired
-	I am never coming in again
-	I should have done it online 
-	(I demanded she calm down and explained that we were volunteers and mistakes happen. Then she had the fucking audacity to say that I was talking rudely to her [which I kind of was, I suggested she go use someone else.])
The phone call took around 20 minutes to fucking end. She did calm down a bit  and started asking if the volunteers were trained (She said it in a way to question if the volunteers were competent enough to do taxes). 


I was almost in tears because she was talking so badly about the volunteers and me personally, I had to flat out demand some respect because we were doing it for free and we try our best to service everyone. 

Anyways. Sorry for the rant guys. I know some of you guys did VITA and it really does help a ton of people out and 99% of people appreciate our service.

However, I'd have to delay my graduation by one year. I'm weighing the pros and cons of going for a 1-year internship in Silicon Valley as opposed to finishing my studies on time. 

Will having a SV working experience on my resume be a great boon for my career (software engineering) in the future? Or is it not worth it? I don't plan to work at SV after graduation due to the ridiculously high living expenses, but I feel that the 1-year internship is a good opportunity to further develop my software engineering skills and have a taste of entrepreneurship.

2zt15z,22,2015-03-21,Not fitting in yet and no work friends... Does anyone else who has beenat a large firm for less than a year feel this way or is it me? How do I make work friends in audit?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2zt15z/not_fitting_in_yet_and_no_work_friends_does/,"I have worked at a midtier firm for 6 months now and I feel invisible and like a ghost when I'm there. I prefer being at clients because at the office I know no one. I can go a full day without any basic social interaction. I feel like if I went out of my way to be friendly with people it would be a breach of the culture of the firm. I don't understand how everyone else seems to have work friends already tho.


I am the age of a new senior but I'm a new associate.... I'm also a first year and 2/3s of my starting class are men. I think I form faster work friendships with men but i don't want to give people the wrong impression by being friendly to the guys in my starting class.

The first year women are already in cliques... They either started when they interned or during the first month of work when I was assigned on audits already.

I have worked at least part time and have always had work friends... Even some I keep in touch with. I never had this problem and it sucks... I feel like maybe something is wrong with me. It makes this job so miserable for me.

Also the few seniors I have don't include me in things or reach out to me. Some don't even respond to my emails when I'm unassigned asking to see if they have work for me to help with.


I have noticed that some of the other first years have comfortable relationships with their seniors while mine are distant and professional at best.


I'm not sure what to do or if this is normal in big firms. My office has 700 people including consulting so I don't expect to know and be friends with everyone but I feel lonely and lost without work friends. 

Lastly, it doesn't help that I already am different. I'm one of the few minorities, didn't intern, and I'm naturally friendly so I feel stifled.

It's depressing to be there.... What should I do? "
2zt1gs,4,2015-03-21,GF (23) wants to explore things with someone on the side [lesbian relationship],treeoak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zt1gs/gf_23_wants_to_explore_things_with_someone_on_the/,"My girlfriend, of 2 years next month, has recently expressed an interest in seeing how things play out with one of her friends. We have lived together for about 1.5 years and have had a normal relationship with normal problems here and there, nothing ever major. 

It all started about 8 months ago when my girlfriend started working for a new company. She was introduced to this other girl (age 19) and they hit it off really well as friends. We tried setting her up with one of our friends, but it did not go well. After that, they began talking non-stop every day through text. When the girl would come over, they were very touchy-feely and cuddly with each other. I was uncomfortable with this because I am not this way with my girlfriends and it seemed unusually intimate(friends who are girls p.s. I am also a girl, age 23). 

Shortly after their friendship blossomed, the bedroom began to decline for me. It has been over 6 months since my girlfriend has sexually touched me or anything, but she still allowed me to please her on occasion. Though, she normally claimed to be too tired for any kind of sexual activity. 

At one point, around thanksgiving last year, she tried to go on a break with me because she said she was getting irritated at me over nothing and needed to figure some things out, but she was very vague with me and it was very out of the blue. I didn't understand, and she took back her idea for the break. After that point, things went relatively smoothly. The other girl continued to come over, and the intimate touching and sitting together, cuddling on the couch, etc. continued to happen, despite my voicing that it made me uncomfortable. My girlfriend simply told me that she did not feel uncomfortable by it, so it shouldn't matter. 

At one point I had a conversation with the girl (19) in my kitchen where I told her how I felt about my girlfriend and she was somehow moved to tears over it and told me what a great and caring partner I am. The other girl is polyamorous, at least typically, and is very flirtatious with everyone, especially my gf. It always made me uncomfortable. I even told her that I was not ok with polyamory and the idea of sharing my gf made me sort of angry. 

I began to sense that something was going on, and before long, my gf had told me that the other girl confessed her feelings for her, but was currently trying to be in a monogamous relationship with another girl. I became angry over it one night when the girl was over at our apartment. I was visibly angry but did not shout or anything at anyone. This sort of forced the issue to come out, however, and my gf felt it necessary to talk about everything with the other girl. 

Suddenly, my girlfriend claims to be interested in polyamory. I asked her to give up this relationship with the other girl, and just minimize her time with her so that it would be easier for her to let go of the romantic feelings. She claimed it was impossible because the attraction was too strong and she needed to see what could happen, but did not want to pursue a relationship with her. Thusly, I want to make her happy and I told her that she could see where things went because she told me she did not want to resent me. However, I am plagued by thoughts of them together and it has taken a large toll on me. I am trying to keep it together but I'm really struggling. 

I know it is all sex based, mostly. I feel completely useless and like I've been put on the back burner this whole time so that she can develop these feelings for this other girl. The other girl has a perfect body. Muscular and very in shape. I am average, and this whole situation has driven my self esteem into the trash can. 

The whole time our sex life fell down the rabbit hole, she has been struggling with these feelings. I feel like, if my sex life was in order, I would feel better about it because at least I wouldn't feel like I'm being kept on because I am a very attentive partner. 

My girlfriend says she loves me and only cares for/likes the other girl. However, she recently spent many hours crying over the other girl, feeling that she was being ignored by her, so I feel like there are complex feelings involved in this for her and that makes me even more uncomfortable. I have already given her the green light, the other girl thinks I hate her (which is not far from the truth, she probably should not have flirted with my gf this whole time under my nose), and I'm happy when I'm with my girlfriend but often feeling anxious and paranoid. I just feel like she is going to develop a more meaningful relationship with her, if things take off between them because of the sexual intimacy they would experience. 

In the beginning of our relationship, my girlfriend had an incredible appetite for sex. This lasted until that abrupt halt about 6 months ago. I know that she still has a sexual appetite, she has told me that she is sexually attracted to the other girl. She did mention to me that she was not really sexually attracted to me anymore (which was a huge blow to my self-esteem). She claims that I a a necessity in her life and that I am very important to her, though, as a romantic partner. Around the same time as all of this was occurring, my girlfriend gained about 30 pounds and became very conscious, however. I can't help but wonder if that contributed to our initial bedroom problems. 

With al of that said, I gave her the green light so she went over there on thursday night to talk to the girl about everything. They are on the same page and want to ""see where things go"" and they kissed. I was very upset when I heard this, but feel like I have no right to be now because I am allowing this to happen. I have tried to make myself feel better about this situation but it is difficult because everything is very vague. 

The worst part is that the girl is probably going to take an internship in a couple of months, to the other side of the country for 3 months. Then, depending how that goes, she will probably go to school out of state to continue to her degree. I don't understand the necessity of this relationship/fling/whatever. Scarier yet is the possibility that this girl might not take the internship and would be here indefinitely, and then I have no idea what happens then. There is no definition, so I feel very insecure about everything. When I try to ask for clarification, definition, anything my girlfriend gets upset because she doesn't know either and just wants to ""go with the flow"". 

I just feel very disrespected in all of this. My gf didn't respect me when I asked her not to flirt with her anymore, not to cuddle with her anymore, etc. because I knew what was happening. She has lied to me about them holding hands before, but kept me in the know about everything else, at least to the best of my knowledge. I feel extremely disrespected by the other girl because she knew how much my gf meant to me and continued to flirt with her. She claims to respect me and like me but does not really understand the idea of a monogamous commitment and so she just bulldozed over mine. I want to talk to the other girl about it, but my gf has told me she would not like that and feels like it would ruin what she is trying to do. 

Part of me was hoping desperately that me giving her the green light would make her understand that I care for her a lot because it was a very hard decision to come to. I was hoping that she would see this and cool off her feelings for the other girl. The day after I ""took the leash off"" she told me that she felt immensely better because the pressure was gone and that she wasn't sure what to do about the situation or what she wanted to do even, but this was before the girl and her had a talk to clarify their feelings for each other. 

I love my girlfriend, so so much. I love her family, I love our life together. The other girl is younger, quite naive in a lot of things, and is not a good partner according to her past relationships. I worry that my gf will be hurt by her in the end. Everyone, including my gf's own friends have told me to end it, but I can't bring myself to do it. I guess I just needed to put this out there. 

**TL;DR; My GF (23) and I (23) have had a normal relationship, a good one for 2 years. She met a friend that is polyamorous and they hit it off. After struggling a lot, my gf told me how she felt and wants to explore things with her friend. I was not ok with it, but gave her the green light anyway. Now I am filled with a lot of pain, and a little bitterness. I am afraid of becoming distant.**"
2zt51e,3,2015-03-21,I'm now officially a software developer without any degrees in the topic. Should I shoot for a Masters in CS or an MBA in IT Management?,Comet7777,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zt51e/im_now_officially_a_software_developer_without/,"Hey all!

A bit of background on me: I spent a couple of years working on a CS undergrad degree. I somehow became enamored with the idea of becoming a history professor so I switched out of CS and got a BA and MA in history (dropped out of a PhD in history to get a job at a software company). I took an internship at said company and made my way up the ladder in the last two years working in marketing, then as an IT guy, then as a QA guy, and now I've been promoted to a full-time software developer. Hurray! 

Now my question to you guys. Given the fact that I don't have a BS in CS, is it worth my time to even consider getting more degrees to qualify myself as a developer? I would like to work my way up to dev manager, then keep moving up. I know experience as a dev is the most important qualification, but I'm wondering if I should:
a) get an MS in CS to qualify my CS background. I've already done the prerequisite course work when I was an undergrad.
b) an MBA in IT is a bit more versatile, yet vague, degree. This will definitely help in going down a management route, but I fear I might need something a bit more rigid to qualify my technical knowledge such as an MS

By the way, I wouldn't pursue a degree any time soon. It would be about 5 years out in the future assuming my career stays on track and I stay gainfully employed and get good experience. 

What do you guys think? "

It's been 22 days since Update #2 and so far it's been dead silence on Nmom's side. I think about her, I wonder what's going on, but I am not stressing about it. 

I got into contact with my one cousin on her side (we were always sort of close? But I feel like Nmom would kinda drive small wedges into anyone getting super close without nmom involving herself) and hilariously enough while texting with my cousin, she said ""I think you turned out amazing, despite having lived with a nazi. She then apologized for being mean. I said yea, you don't have to apologize for being mean. It is true. I found it amusing because in the past this cousin has said my nmom was her favorite aunt. 

She also mentioned that my mom and her had a falling out a few weeks ago (my cousin is awesome, going for her masters with a 15 year old and an almost 1 year old baby, and 3 step-children in the middle who have a crazy bio-Nmom as well). They were at IKEA with cousin's mom as well and my cousin had to go pick up her pup from the groomers before they closed, and my mom made a passive aggressive comment when cousin had to go about 'something ALWAYs happens when we go to IKEA..."" Like lady, IKEA is about an hour drive one way from where we live. Cousin has a life, has responsibilities to take care of later in the afternoon.. Suck it. 

My cousin mentioned that since she hasn't been talking with my mom it's been so peaceful, and that she's able to focus on kicking ass and taking names in school, and raising her kids. She is also having a pool bash for both girls, and offered to call/text me on the day when my mom leaves so I can still visit with the family. I'm ok with this, even though it'll be a bit awkward and I'll have to watch my tongue. I'm also working on getting over my mother's body shaming of me, via my Zumba class on tuesdays, and even though I'm a large curvy woman, I'm looking at buying a bikini this year! The only thing holding me back is my chest, and finding a top for a 40 DDD is crazy difficult! Feel free to link to places that you know of, that sell that size :)

SO and I are moving forward on getting the house in our name. We've gotten pre-approved from a couple of banks so far, trying for a few more, as well as some state funded down payment assistance. We should have the home out of my Ex's name by the end of May, which is when SO's office is closing down. He might wind up picking up contract work, he's in high demand apparently. :) Contract work pays a lot better but is much more sporadic. 

I had also gone to therapy a few weeks ago... and it wasn't a great session. but it was a bit eye opening. She helped me realize that the wording of the letters to my mom, were using my mom's manipulation tactics against her. I'm better than that. I'm still ok with how the letter was worded and phrased, but if I hear from her again, it's just going to be point blank end of story type thing. I'm still working on getting over the feeling of needing to justify. My therapist had a strong reaction to me 'diagnosing' and requiring my mom to go to a specialist. That's just what happens in my family, is a lot of people get 'diagnosed' by other family members doing research. 

The session transitioned into a 'mock up' session of what would happen if my mom and i did therapy together, with her letter. I had to try to get into my mom's head, responding the way I think she would have (damn that was hard), therapist was me, and intern was the 'specialist' therapist. Even though it was an exercise.. I feel I could have done better. I explained too much, I justified too much.. and I specifically remember one part where my therapist was 'my mom' and I was me... and my therapist talking me thru some of my mom's outbursts, got me to where there was something I wanted to say about my abortion at 15... but I bit my tongue. 

Not because my therapist wouldn't want to hear it.. but because justifying myself to my 'pretend mom' wouldn't do any damn bit of good. Lashing out wouldn't do any good, and would only give her fuel. I know it was only an exercise, to help me be in a safe place and practice not engaging when I'm being attacked, and that my therapist is still fully supportive of me. I guess I just wish I had been a lil bit forwarned and more prepared? I know it was a spur of the moment thing.. and it was helpful, it made me realize that the reason I wrote the letters in a manipulative way, was because that's the only language she understands. I don't do it regularly, or with people who I value, who value me. I'm ok with this. But I expressed that I didn't feel supported towards the end of the session, and she said she thought me writing that letter took courage, and bravery. And she came over and gave me a hug. The intern did too. I was lightly crying thru most of the session, held it in afterwards, went and got ribeye steaks for dinner, walked in and just hugged my SO and let the tears flow. 

I was supposed to have my next session last night. But with working on the mortgage, I worked it out with my boss to come in 1 hour early on Fridays, and leave an hour early, so that SO and I can have time to get to the banks before they close and work on mortgage things. so waking up early 2 days in a row, at the end of the week has been kicking my ass.. So I rescheduled for next week and hopefully I'll get more sleep this week. 

SO and I have also recently re-picked up playing Diablo 3. I played it when it first came out and loved making $$ with the RMAH. However I hadn't played it since it got overhauled, and it's more reminiscent of Diablo 2 which i LOVED! All the Diablo games make me miss my grandmother though, she adored these games when she was alive. I'm handling her death much better, much healthier nowadays. Even though I will always miss her, I feel closer to her playing those games that we both loved again, and not hurting, but remembering all the good times. I've found that since I started playing again, it's been an awesome stress relief, and I've been sleeping much better, able to get up with my alarm easier, and looking forward to the day again. Plus if I wake up early enough, I can play a little before work :) YAY

So.. that's what's been going on in my world. How about you? :)

2zt95v,9,2015-03-21,Situation about clogged g-tubes with a nurse who has seniority over me on my unit,liquorkisses,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/2zt95v/situation_about_clogged_gtubes_with_a_nurse_who/,"I work on a Med-Surg/Urology unit in a hospital in Maryland. I came to the unit August 2014 and completed my new graduate internship and started working on my own in November 2014. What happened:

I had three patients on continuous feedings through G-tube yesterday. One of the three, we'll call him room#26, had come from ICU 10 minutes before I came on at 0700 with a new G-tube, which was working fine. Rooms #25 and #24 had been on my unit for a few days already. Their G-tubes were clogged when I started my shift. #24 was in especially bad condition because the feeding started leaking out everywhere and he was soaked in it and so was his entire bed. My CNA was not happy. The day before was the same situation at the start of my shift with these patients all being handed off by the same night shift nurse. They were not clogged when I handed them off to her. 

I am still a new nurse so I had some trouble unclogging them and it was really putting me so far behind so my charge nurse took over unclogging the G-tubes for me both days. 

When I started my shift yesterday, I did not mention anything about the tubes being clogged the day before. Yesterday ay change of shift at 1900 I told her about the tubes being clogged. I said, ""Hey, I just wanted to let you know, the G-tubes in room #24 and #25 were clogged when I started my shift today and the day before. And we had to change 24's bed because the feedings soaked through both days too. "" She immediately replied, ""What are you saying? I flushed all the tubes very well all the time. I do my job. You need to watch the way you come at me."" My CNA and the oncoming night shift CNA were standing closeby. I replied back, ""I never said you didn't do your job or that you weren't flushing the tubes properly. I was just making you aware of a situation which occurred before I received the patients on your shift."" For some reason she was extremely offended and said, ""I don't need a lecture on G-tubes from you, liquorkisses, especially not you. I know what I'm doing."" Then she just turned around without another word and went straight to the Assistant Manager's office, who happened to be the charge nurse on both days of the clogged G-tubes. 

I should mention I live in a very diverse suburb right outside of Washington D.C. Many nurses are international such as Africans, Indians, you get the picture, as well as Americans. We all get along great but there are sometimes misunderstandings that result of cultural differences. 

The charge nurse informed both of us that we need to get along, and informed her that the G-tubes indeed were clogged because he spent an hour-hour and a half unclogging them both days, and that she should learn to take constructive criticism because ""nobody is perfect and we all will mess up sometimes.""

I agreed and continued on with report (yes this happened during report just outside of the patient room) but now she was just silent and ignoring everything I said. Did not speak an entire word to me the entire time.

What happened, and what should I do if anything? Was this a cultural difference? Am I being insensitive?"

2ztfjo,5,2015-03-21,I just don't feel driven anymore...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ztfjo/i_just_dont_feel_driven_anymore/,"I have been feeling pretty bad today. Lately, I've been so worried about everything. I'm too poor to afford college, yet too rich to get aid from the government. I've been so worried about whether or not I will get in to my dream school or if I can go intern at NASA during the summer or if I end up going to community college. I worry so much about everything. Sometimes, I think about taking that path and giving up on going to a 4 year school for now. Besides, I am getting a full ride at community college.

But at the same time, I don't want to end up in that position. I still want to intern. I want to be able to experience new things and create a life of my own, something I have never done as a high school student. I got so many things on my mind that nothing seems to help. I've been crying about everything, including this situation, my grandfather not being here, my first crush (which I though I got over), if I can intern, all this.

At the same time, I am not sure what to do with myself. I sleep and I just don't feel happy sometimes. I wish I had my closest friends surrounding me and I can do so much with them. All I really do is stay on my computer and do nothing. I no longer feel happy or have the drive to do what is required and what I want to do.

I don't know what to do anymore. I had enough of waiting and hearing how everybody did with their college applications. I just want to know real answers now. Sometimes, I just can't relax or stop to worry because it is all that I do. I sometimes feel really sad because I never wanted to end up like this and all I want to do is get out. I just no longer feel like pushing through this. The past 3 months have been a pure hell with the arguments that my dad and I got into for just about everything. Sometimes, I wish I was never where I am now and in a better place, but I just can't do anything."
2ztfzy,6,2015-03-21,"Company got sold, I need to rant. Seeking advice/Stories/Shoulders to cry on",fluffy_muffins,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/2ztfzy/company_got_sold_i_need_to_rant_seeking/,"Hey guys! Sorry, I already know this is going to be long. I need some career advice/reassurance/stories from anyone who has something to give.

Background info: Me, female, 31, Mid-west. I graduated in may 2012 with a degree in graphic design and started working at a small (at the time) 5 person agency. I came in as an intern, got hired full time within a month, and was made the art director before my one year anniversary. I’ve been slightly spoiled with my quick career advancement, and until recently had higher expectations, all of which I believe are adding to my difficulties accepting the current situation. 

We were a small team but we managed to put out some really (IMHO) amazing work for small to medium sized local businesses, startups, and government departments. Over the last few years we have had our ups and downs, growing to a team of 12, and now back down to 8 full time employees. I love the people I work with. I love the work we do. Due to our small size, we have always managed to avoid the ‘office politics’ that are apparently common in other companies, and we lack the red tape and convoluted approval processes that a lot of other agencies seem to have. 

Our creative director/owner also had another company, a software/application start up that launched in 2012. The application had been gaining traction quickly, and pulling the creative director out of our day to day more and more over the last year and a half to two years - basically since I became the art director. I would say for the last year or so I have been the de-facto creative director for our company.

In December the creative director finally moved out ‘officially’ and took over at his new company full time. They called me into a review/meeting in early January, and I genuinely thought that they were about to offer me the creative director position, along with the much coveted giant, sunny, QUIET corner office that had been sitting mostly empty for the last year.

Instead, I was informed that the creative director had sold our company, and we would be merging with another ‘agency’. I have never been more shocked. in. my. life. 30 minutes later we are breaking the news to the rest of the team, meeting our new HR person, COO, and hearing lots and lots of pretty talk. Promises of raises, a shiny new office, ‘awesome’ new benefits, etc… Then we are taken to a ‘welcome party’ where we meet all 150 of our new co-workers. Talk about a culture shock. I have never felt less like partying in my life. 

This other company. I still don’t know what they do. There is a larger, parent company, with about 10 smaller companies under it. One of these is the ‘agency’ that we are merging with, and it seems to be a relatively new venture - they’ve been around for about three years. Their background is in magazine publishing. Their company structure is completely foreign to me, and seems somewhat backwards. They have THREE creative directors, all of whom report to the COO, one art director, and one production designer. That’s it. Is this in any way typical? I honestly have no idea. What are all these creative directors doing? 

They also, as an agency, have zero work posted online, which I find/found troubling. So naturally I googled everyone involved and found their various portfolios/behances/dribbles… and it is NOT GOOD. Que sinking stomach. The only portfolio with any promise was the production designers. I wouldn’t have even interviewed the rest of the staff based on what they have posted online. Rationally, I know it’s hard to keep your online work updated and this may not be representative. Irrationally I wonder who the hell these people are and why they are being put in charge of any one. 

Fast forward to now. The shiny new office has yet to appear, and their creative team is moving into OUR office on monday. The sunny corner office is being taken over by their ECD, which stings, but I am trying to manage my disappointment. However, I can already tell that this ECD is going to be difficult to work with. Bad portfolio notwithstanding, my interactions with her have not been promising. We had a ‘get to know you lunch’ with assigned seating and a one drink maximum. We had a very awkward mandatory potluck. It’s been hinted that she will be rearranging our entire office on monday when she moves in. I’ve heard a lot of ‘I’ statements, and very few ‘we’ statements. One of their employees has hinted that their level of work is ‘embarrassing’. Another employee hinted that she was grandfathered into the company and that several people left when she was made ECD. I don’t know what to believe but all of this is making me absolutely DREAD what’s going to happen on monday.  

I am scared. I am envious. I have never had a creative director in the traditional, large agency sense. I am trying to remain open minded but it is very hard right now with so much uncertainty and the feeling that I no longer have any control or say in the company that I have poured my heart into over the last 3 years. I am worried that I won’t be able to protect my team, and that we will lose our energy and focus and leave one by one.

If anyone has any advice, thoughts, encouragement, or even a hefty dose of reality for me please, I’m all ears. 

**TL;DR Small agency got sold to larger company. Possibly unrealistic career hopes dashed, Possibly difficult ECD incoming.**"
2ztgho,6,2015-03-21,Deciding Between Internship Offers???,TheDudeFrom94,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2ztgho/deciding_between_internship_offers/,"I have two internship offers to decide between this weekend. One is doing financial analysis for Amazon, and it's a six month, full time, opportunity that pays very well. I would be assigned a business segment and do work within that segment. It doesn't necessarily lead to an offer at the end of the internship.


The other is a year long opportunity, doing data analysis in the trading department of an asset management company, with roughly $250B AUM. It pays quite worse than the first one. It would be part time during the school year and full time during the summer. It also doesn't necessarily lead to an offer at the end of the internship.

Neither opportunity would require me to relocate or affect my schooling.

I'm a junior-year economics and finance double major, and more interested in going into the investment side of finance as opposed to corporate finance. Is the second option the obvious choice?

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide. I will also offer clarification on anything!"
2ztiw7,1,2015-03-21,"I lost my internship, a couple of days later my girlfriend broke up with me. I struggle with my thesis, as well. I fucking need to get my shit together.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ztiw7/i_lost_my_internship_a_couple_of_days_later_my/,"Great, I have to write everything again because my browser crashed. So I will make this one shorter. My life is shit right now because of three reasons. And I will try to make the best out of it. There may be some mistakes in this one, English isn’t my native language.

First some background information about me: I am studying psychology for 6 years now, it’s time to finish. I studied to become a counselor/therapist. In December/January, life was good: I finally found an internship at a counseling center for victims of sexual abuse which would start in February, I had a fantastic girlfriend (hot as hell and great character) and I was about to start with a new master thesis, since my first attempt failed. I know about my problems with these kind of tasks, I had similar problems with my bachelor thesis. Anyway, now we are in march, as you all know and somehow pretty much everything went to hell. 

Reason 1: I got fired at my internship two weeks ago. Misunderstandings in the beginning and devastating feedback caused a negative atmosphere for everyone. In the end, my boss ended it and I felt relieved to be honest. It have been 5 weeks of constant criticism, she even told me I do not have the social skills to become a counselor/therapist. All my friends/family/housemates don’t agree on this but still, it made me very insecure. Now I have to look for another internship.

Reason 2: The relationship with my girlfriend went worse. It became some kind of routine in the last couple of weeks. We didn’t go on special dates that much anymore, we just kind of hanged out together, the passion wasn’t like it had been before.  I felt it when we kissed, talked, looked at each other. She even couldn’t tell me that she loved me anymore, it became just very, very awkward. At the same time, I was of course feeling pressure because of my internship. 3 days after I got fired, we agreed on having a one-week-break in our relationship. It actually felt like the end, to be honest. I knew it was coming and prepared for it mentally. 6 days later (yesterday), she sent me a text “I need to tell you something, please visit me”. I thought I knew what was coming (breakup) and went to her place. 

“You wanted to tell me something.”

“Yes, I just don’t know how to do it..”

“You’re breaking up with me.”

“Yes….and I slept with xxx (colleague from work).” 

I expected the break-up, but not that. It turned out that she slept with him two weeks ago. And a second time a few days afterwards. I kind of knew it before, but didn’t trust my feelings. Being jealous was never an option for me anyway. That’s not who I wanna be.

I know that she was the one who cheated. However, I feel like it’s my fault, as well. I didn’t do enough for the relationship, I wasn’t spontaneous anymore, I just didn’t treat her like my girlfriend that I love. I’m feeling ashamed of that. I know that she wasn’t the love of my life, but we really had a great relationship and it just feels like I took that for granted. 

Oh, and she told me that the guy who she slept with felt sorry and bad, too. Well… fuck that guy. Couldn’t have been so hard for both when they did it for a second time a couple of days later. 

Anyway, I didn’t want to ruin the good memories about our relationship. I didn’t treat her well in the last couple of weeks. And if a man doesn’t treat his girl right, she might cheat on you. These things happen. I’m not even angry at her, because I know that the breakup would have come either way. I told her that. I will not talk bad about this girl who I had a wonderful time with for 1 ½ years. So we talked a bit about the good times. At least the breakup went well and I feel like I reacted like a man. I accepted the situation. 

However, I woke up this morning and after a few seconds I thought about yesterday. And then the pain hit me. She was my first actual girlfriend (one-night-stands and fuckbuddies before) and she left me. She cheated on me. It fucking hurts. 

Reason 3 (yeah, it get’s even better): I didn’t write a single word for my thesis yet. I sit in the library every day, but I do not plan doing my thesis properly. I spent my time surfing, not doing shit. I literally wasted all of my time here. I am terrible in organizing things, planning my thesis. I do know my problems, I just haven’t been able in implementing the proper solutions.



This stops. Now. I wasted enough time of my life already. I will schedule my time NOW. Wasting my life took too much energy from me. No apologies. It won’t be perfect right from the start, but I will keep changing my behavior. I need to get my shit together, I need to live. I wanna live. Shit happens, no it’s time to get up and make it better than last time.



Thanks for reading. I can imagine that the structure of this one is not the best, but I just had to write my thoughts down. I don’t even know what I should expect from this. I told you very much and I can imagine if some stuff here is confusing. But what I tried to write down is this:
Life hit me hard in the last two months, but I will not hide. I will not just swallow it all. I will learn from it and I will succeed in organizing this big mess in my head.

2ztvl1,0,2015-03-21,My (22/f) relationship to my best friend/lover (22/m) could be made into a soap opera. Needing to share and seeking advice.,shlumps22,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ztvl1/my_22f_relationship_to_my_best_friendlover_22m/,"It's an essay length but important. Please read.

I have been best friends with this person since high school. We went to a really small boarding school. Like 90 people per grade. We met freshman year in English class. I have no memory of first meeting him but he says that I said, ""He's kinda a dick and might be gay."" As a very strong supporter of gay rights, I seriously doubt I would have said that in an insulting way. Regardless, it has become a running joke between us because we disliked each other at first but it lead to us noticing each other more closely and then ended up with us becoming friends. There's a phrase that hate is closer to love than indifference. I think this is true.

Anyway, we dated for 4 months Sophomore year. Very vanilla. Only kissing and awkward attempts to get anywhere else. Pretty cute. He was pretty awkward around girls because he went to an all boys school. I have grown up with tons of brothers so guys don't intimidate me at all. I wasn't too dedicated the whole situation and took him for granted. We broke up but remained very close. He was always there for me when I was anxious about my future or feeling stupid compared to my ridiculously intelligent peers. Or my resentment towards my parents for sending me away. Boarding school tends to do that to you.

Junior and senior year we had a messy relationship. We both dated other people but would hook up in between relationships. We would attempt to be platonic but there was this magnetic pull both physically and emotionally. He was shy but told me I was one of the only people he could be fully open with and not feel judged. I'm a very honest and blunt person so he was my opposite. I made him more open and he made me more kind. 

The first two years of college we saw each other less frequently but would have very intense sessions. I don't mean that in a purely sexual way. We would just be super comfortable and honest. My school was miserable. Everyone was ugly inside and out. Judgmental, unmotivated, druggy, dirty, and spoiled. Just the opposite of my high school. I started to realize just how special he was. The total package: kind, smart, motivated, handsome, considerate. 

Third year of college, shit hit the fan for both of us. I was so depressed that I went home on a medical leave. As an extrovert, I was starved of what makes me live: people, friendship, conversation. I didn't connect to anyone. On his side his parents were fighting, he started not liking school, he got into a car accident. Then he disappeared for a year. That's his coping mechanism for stress so I knew that when I hadn't heard from him in a month, shit was real. I called, texted, sent emails, called his home phone, fb messaged his friends. Keep in mind this took place over a year, not like a week. I'm not a psycho stalker. We just had never gone that long without speaking so I was concerned. 

Welp, this was kinda naughty of me but I used my friend's phone to call him. She has the same area code as his college so I thought he may answer because he may think it was his college calling. Sure enough, he did. I apologized for deceiving him. He sounded like shit and the conversation lasted only about 5 minutes. But in that time I noticed his voice lifting and he sounded happier. I always seem to have that effect on him. Perhaps it's because I'm a slightly ridiculous person with few filters. He asked if he could call me that weekend. 

Since then I've talked to him frequently. He's completely terrible with his phone but when he is with a person, that person gets his full attention. It is so rare to experience someone without phone addiction. He only sees you and it's magic. 

His car accident caused him to have chronic back pain. It took months but they finally found the cause: an 11 mm spinal tumor putting pressure on his nerves. Cue the dramatic music. At this time, I had gone through a year off school with therapy and an internship. I had transferred to another school and was in a great place. I was in a position where I could be there for him like he had been in high school. The only problem was that I was madly in love with him after realizing what a catch he was. We had both changed individually in a way that improved our relationship. Sure, it was messy and sexual and emotional, but we could have honest dialogue, productive disagreements, and plain old fun. It didn't hurt that he had become great at kissing and very generous in bed. 

I confessed a few months ago and he basically said that his life is a mess and that he is barely able to take care of himself. I understood and empathized to my best ability but I can't help but think that I could help him. I'm already his closest friend and confidant. He isolates himself but I am one of the only people that can draw him back. We say ""I love you"" all the time and do outlandishly generous things for each other. He drove 5 hours to see me in the middle of the night because I was flying overseas the next day. He tells me that I am the epitome of his type: blonde, blue eyes, bubble butt, looks fantastic in red ;). We also have an intense physical connection. Am I crazy to think that we are so close to dating that it's absurd? Maybe this is all in my head and I'm reading him wrong. But what he does and what he says are so different.

Basically my question is: should I hold hope that we will date or should I give up? I'm going on dates and am trying to be open to other guys. I'm just so stuck on him. I don't think it's completely improbable years down the line but now it is. I just want feedback.

Side Note: He got removal surgery, the tumor was benign, and he is on the mend physically."
2ztw4d,2,2015-03-21,"Me [18 M] and my girlfriend [19 F] have been dating 5 months, we are having sexual troubles and are going to be facing long distance soon. I am having extreme anxiety, please help.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ztw4d/me_18_m_and_my_girlfriend_19_f_have_been_dating_5/,"My girlfriend and I met the second day of college. We are both from towns that are less than a half hour apart, but the college we attend is about 8 hours away. We had never met until the second day of our college orientation week. She is more of an introvert whereas I am an extrovert, so I introduced myself at first and tried making conversation whenever I saw her. We became fast friends and spent a lot of time hanging out with the same group of people and eventually we started hanging out just us two. Neither of us had any idea we liked each other, until one night a little over two months after we met. We decided to go to a beach bonfire with some friends, which was not out of the ordinary for us to do. Once we got there she proceeded to get pretty tipsy. She tripped over a log and when I was helping her up a guy said ""you two would make a cute couple"". I ended up kissing her that night, and a week later we started dating. 

I want to start this paragraph by saying the sexual component of our relationship is the least important part to me. I cannot put into words how I feel about her. She's my best friend and so much more. We decided to wait for a while to have sex after we started dating. After two months we both decided we were ready. Neither of us were virgins, and we both were okay with that. She experienced a lot of pain the first time, but she wanted to keep trying. Nothing seemed to help, lube, more foreplay, her trying kegel exercises, sometimes she would feel nothing and other times it was just pain. I never felt good after we had sex, I felt guilty most of the time and she would generally leave right after, even if I wanted her to stay. Although our sexual relationship put stress on us that was the only thing that was amiss with us. 

Here's where my anxiety started to happen. She has been planning to study aboard in China spring semester next year. I honestly thought it would not happen until, she told me it is basically a sure thing now. I have been worried about this, but I figured we would have all summer and fall semester to become stronger before she had to leave. 

Three days ago we were watching a movie in my bed when I asked if she wanted to have sex, we had not had sex in over 2 weeks at that point and I figured it was worth a shot. She agreed and we started. Something was different this time. She would not look at me and just kept her head pointed to the side. I stopped and asked what was wrong. She yelled at me for the first time saying ""JUST FINISH ALREADY!” I didn't know what to think. I said I didn't want to continue, and I didn't know that it was hurting her so bad. I asked her to stay and talk about what just happened, but she left anyway. I barley slept that night because I couldn't stop feeling so guilty, I never want to hurt her and the fact that I did for basically no reason at all is killing me. 

The next day she would not respond to my texts and I was getting really worried so I went to her room. She was there, I said I never wanted to hurt her and I didn't think we should have sex anymore. We hugged and cried a little bit. She then said she thought we should slow things down. When I asked what she meant, she said she doesn't want to have sex anymore as well and she did not want to say Love to each other anymore. After this she said she wanted to be alone for a while. At this point I was so confused and upset I don't know what do to, so I text her after an hour and ask if this means we are breaking up and I gave her a bunch of reasons why we shouldn’t. She responded, no that she does not want to break up at all, just slow things down. I still do not know what she means by that. 

This weekend she went home, so we did not have the chance to talk again. Yesterday while she was home she got offered an internship about 2.5 hours away from where we live. Previously I thought we would be able to spend summer together. When I read the text I had an anxiety attack. I got extremely sweaty and I couldn't hear anything going on around me. Eventually when I recovered, I texted her that I was excited for her, because I did not want to add any more stress to our relationship. Since she left I have had such bad anxiety I can barely concentrate on anything, I just have a terrible feeling in my chest that will not go away. 

Please help me, I don’t know who else to ask. What do I say to her when she gets back? How can I make a long distance relationship work? How can I be supportive of her? I still love her and want this to work. Thank you for reading this and I apologize for any grammatical errors.


   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend and I are experiencing sexual troubles on top of a soon to be long distance relationship. These issues are giving me extreme anxiety and I want to know how to make things right with her.

2zub72,6,2015-03-21,I had pretty negative interview for an internship. What should my next steps be?,EmmaFei,cswomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/cswomen/comments/2zub72/i_had_pretty_negative_interview_for_an_internship/,"My background is quite different to most people looking to get into computer science. I've been studying two degrees concurrently, accounting full time and computer science part time. I'm a little over halfway through my computing degree so I thought I'd try applying for a few internships this summer.

I attended an interview with a company a few of my friends work for so I knew the culture and technologies would suit my interests. The CTO asked a few questions I felt were quite rude and negatively phrased. These include:

* **""So why haven't you quit the accounting degree yet?""** I finish the degree this year so it seemed a waste to not follow through. It is fully funded, unlike the computing degree, and my parents aren't able to pick up the bill. Since leaving high school I've had to be financially independent from day one.
* **""You've obviously not figured out what you want to do yet?""** She didn't seem to believe I would much rather become a developer and if the accounting knowledge is useful to my role then that's just a happy coincidence. I don't feel I need to know my exact computing path at this point but I know I want to be a developer.
* **""So you're just looking for any old job until your startup works out?""** I have a small startup with a few friends which I felt was good experience but at this point in my life I'd be much happier working for a company until I feel ready to fully go it alone. I was mostly testing the waters and gaining experience while at university.
* She also grilled me over the projects I'd completed so far. I wouldn't consider any of them too big but I've done two game jams, co-developed a Flask/Angular web app for my startup, a PHP based eCommerce site with paypal integration, a couple of java projects, university work and online courses. I didn't get the impression she was pleased with the amount I have completed so far.

So after this interview I feel I need to be focusing more on CS, working on bigger projects and making myself more employable as a developer. I was just wondering if you have any advice on how I can improve and to what extend you feel the interviewee was in the right with her approach? 

I've never had an interview where I've felt the need to defend myself more than sell but I want to take as much as I can get from the experience instead of simply sulking, as tempting as it might be!

Thanks for taking the time to help me out."
2zujlv,1,2015-03-21,My SO [24/M] and I [21/F] of 2.5 years have been in an LDR since Dec 2014. Distance + our differences have either opened or shut my eyes. Other perspectives appreciated.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zujlv/my_so_24m_and_i_21f_of_25_years_have_been_in_an/,"In December, I moved 550+ miles away for an internship. I’m also taking courses while I’m here.

Things have been strained due to distance, difference, and conflicts of interest.  I'm going to get right into the heart of the matter: We get along well. Not superbly, but well. However, we have *very* little in common.

* His religious views are a huge part of his life. I'm agnostic-atheist. He has told me that my ""not knowing Jesus"" will make him ""miserable for the rest of his days, or until I do.""
* He has a low libido, but on occasion it seems normal. I have a pretty high libido.
* He has a hard time reciprocating in the bedroom. In his defense, I do take a long time to finish.
* We have very few common interests and hobbies. What we do have in common is minor.
* He's immensely lackadaisical. Absurdly blase. He procrastinates to the point of serious inconvenience and disadvantage.
* He practically refuses to go to school ""because he doesn't like it.""
* He is easily swayed by his father's opinion. We held of from PIV sex for 2.5 years despite him being okay with it at first. For a few months, he was even scared to hug me for too long.
* He wants lots of kids. He comes from a big family. I do not wants kids at all. I'm open to fostering or adopting down the road, but he wants his own kids.

Despite all of this, I do love him. I care about him deeply. 

He told me a week ago that he planned on proposing to me when I got back from my internship, which is supposed to be over in August. However, I may be staying here another 2 years while getting my Associate's Degree. 

I do not know if I'm ready for that kind of commitment, though. I would've said yes a month ago, but in the past few weeks I've developed a crush on someone I met here, and it's made me realize that maybe I'm not as deep as I thought I was. This is the first time I've felt anything romantic for anyone outside of my SO. My SO is also the first one I've ever had who hasn't hurt me or cheated on me. I know he really loves me.

I feel like I'd be stupid to leave him. But another part of me feels like maybe there's someone out there who I'll not only get along with well, but also have more in common with.

Everybody keeps telling me, ""You're in your early 20s! This is the time of your life! Be single, be free! Figure out what you want!""

I can't help but feel guilty breaking up with him.

**TL;DR; BF and I get along well, but we have little in common. Distance + difference = strain. I still love him, but I'm feeling torn between seeking the possibility of someone better, or staying with him and wondering.**"

1. Will companies even give me an internship if I have only been at Davis 1 year?  Plenty friends I know there have gotten internships at great companies but they were not transfers.

2. Should I delay my graduation so I can have 2 summers for internships?

Although I'm not against activism, I just find it's not very effective, so here's an alternative method to change the status quo.

As a Chinese immigrant from the late 90s, I saw the radical changes in how people perceived my ethnicity over the years.

When I first arrived in Canada, I experienced a lot of racism. It was still 1999, and China was still a *poor* country. Fellow classmates and society in general thought we were uneducated, cheap labour, poor and undesirable. They liked making fun of China, and all thought it would amount to nothing, that it'd just be a sweatshop for the rest of the world.

Fast-forward 5 years later around year 2005, Chinese-Americans started to make their mark in society. Universities started filling up with Asians; medical schools, dental schools, engineering, accounting, etc. all started getting a huge influx of Chinese. The stereotype also started changing. We were no longer the cheap and uneducated. We became the ""nerds""; memes with Tiger moms and Asian Dad started appearing. Society began to think of us as smart and hard-working.

In 2008, with the Beijing Olympics, the world saw what China was capable of. The city was on par with metropolitans of industrialized countries, or even more modern. Chinese athletes also dominated the gold medal count. YouTube began its rise to popularity, and Peter Chao, Wongfuproductions, and many others showed us different personalities, and that we weren't just a uniform mass, but that some of us are great dancers, singers, musicians, athletes, comedians, that we could be cool or awkward and no two asians are the same. By 2010, we considered that being Chinese was a non-issue; I personally used to hate being Chinese when I was younger because of all the stereotypes we faced. It was no longer the case - I didn't need to be proud of being Chinese, nor ashamed, I just was. It was just a part of who I am, just like blue eyes or brown hair.

Fast-forward again 5 years. Today, in 2015, China is #1 in GDP (PPP), and have pretty much moved up to the upper echelons of society. The largest IPO in the US was Alibaba, a Chinese company. Vancouver is *bought out* by the Chinese, where they jacked up the house prices. In university, if you see an exotic car (Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini), it's most likely driven by some 2nd generation rich Chinese *kid*. When I visited New York City a year ago, the people working at tourist attractions, who weren't Chinese, spoke Mandarin, and on the airplane, first class seats were almost all taken by Chinese people. If I click on a random Chinese's Facebook profile, most of the time they're going to be pretty successful; most of my asian friends are already making six figures+ at an internship, are going to once they graduate or are starting their own company.

We can't change our physical attributes, but we can change how they're perceived. Tall, white, male has been the de facto best-perceived, but that's because they ruled the world for so long. If the majority of short people are successful, then public perception will change. It's not enough to be just as good, but you have to show that you're better.

tl;dr Become successful, public perception will follow.

**EDIT**: as expected I'm getting downvoted like crazy. This is how the world works. Stereotypes exist because there's some truth to it, and humans are programmed to make quick judgments based on past knowledge. Like Bruce Lee said ""be like water"", don't fight human nature (activism - pleading people to stop judging based on stereotypes), rather let it flow in your favour. Change the stereotype. Imagine if 90% of African-Americans were scientists making the latest discoveries, I doubt the stereotype that blacks are criminals would exist; it would be replaced with ""African Americans are all geniuses"". Do the same for being short."
2zv37a,3,2015-03-21,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Pegging, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2zv37a/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_pegging/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Basically, I have one workbook on my laptop with a very basic table format with columns of First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Address. I will need to then try and match the items in this workbook to items in a second workbook. I'd be fine with doing an initial match on the last name, and then possibly the first name to consider it a duplicate record. 

The main problem is that this whole process is part of lawsuit my company is a part of, and as such, I:

1. Can't copy the file or remove it from the lawyer's office
2. Don't know how the data is structured in the second workbook
3. Am unsure as to how I might be allowed to manipulate the second file

Normally I'd probably just dump both Excel files into a Sql Server database and do some string matching to try to find matches, however I am not sure if I will be allowed to do this. I will most likely be monitored/watched by a legal representative and IT person and I'm not looking to fool anyone or try to pull any shenanigans.

I do have experience writing software that parses and manipulates Excel files so I could possibly create something to write the files into data sets to do comparisons, but again, I'm not sure if this will be allowed.

I know this sounds like kind of a vague request, but unfortunately I was given pretty vague instructions as to how I can proceed with this task. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!


**[UPDATE]**

I wasn't allowed access to their Excel file at all. In the end, I was only able to give them MY Excel file and now they'll probably bill us $350/hr to have an intern manually compare the two. I do appreciate all the suggestions though. If nothing else, at least I learned a few new tricks."

Some factors in this that need to be known before this tragic happening.


* Both outside of our home states for an internship (California and Idaho). 
* He is supposed to leave in April, me in May.
* We jumped into a relationship kind of fast, but we were both on the same page the entire time, up until the recent end.
* Possibility of going back to respective states for school, possibility of staying here if we both get better positions.

The sweetest guy I've ever met, the perfect gentleman, manners galore, ma'am and sir, respects me, texts me nonstop about how much he adores me and misses me and every thing he loves about me in general. Perfect guy!

Things were sailing smoothly without bumps in the honeymoon phase, until one night when he left his FB open. Being the hilarious motherfucker that I am and wanting to get him back for the last time he raided mine, I posted a funny status. A few hours later I went back on to check the number of likes/comments, and I saw a notification at the bottom of the window. It showed a person liking a comment that he posted, saying the names that he had given my boobs. I clicked on it, thinking he might have been talking about me, but no. 

He was flirting with a girl in a meme group that had posted a picture with cleavage, calling her a ""babe"" and saying she should ""set them free"", ""let them breathe"", and that they ""deserve names"". Enter the comment with the names he gave MY boobs. Needless to say, I was fuming. 

Later that night I confronted him, he said it was meant to be a joke and that she was also in a relationship and she was also 1000 miles away, etc. But I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with that and reminded him that if I was talking to someone like that, he would be furious. He owned up to it and apologized and offered to leave the group. I said that he didn't have to because I didn't want to be crazy. He says it threw him for a loop that I would look through his notifications because I don't look at his phone, and he was upset about that.

Fast forward to him being on a trip back home to visit friends. We text on and off, his phone dies or he left it in the room. He was visiting a friend that he won't be able to see for two years, so I didn't mind at all if he took forever to text me because two years is a long time. 

BUT as soon as he came back he started acting really distant. Not texting me as much and when he does text it's not as affectionate as before. On nights that I come over to hang out after work, he stays out with coworkers until 4am when he gets off at 12am, without letting me know. I talk to him about this. He apologizes and owns up to it, telling me he'll change that. Everything is perfect the rest of the night and the next morning, until his roommate drops us off for work.

He asks me to sit down with him and he basically tells me that he feels pressure from all sides. His parents pressuring him to go back to school, his friends pressuring him to come home and to ""not have a girlfriend, because the last time he had a girlfriend he didn't go to school for a semester"" and the girlfriend of the friend that's leaving for two years ""needs him there because she'll be missing her boyfriend a lot and him being there will help"", and he was apparently feeling pressured to be in our relationship by our friends, which makes no sense to me because he always seemed to be head over heels, but whatever.

He says he still loves me, but he just needs this to be done until he can figure out what he truly wants to do for himself, without the pressure of friends or girlfriends. I told him I would have one of our friends bring my stuff to me and he said he didn't want me to ""just leave like that"", so I'm assuming he still cares??? 

Am I/Was I just dating a selfish moron? Was he just trying to let me down easy? Is this whole ""let me figure stuff out"" issue actually legitimate? Has anyone ever benefited from ""figuring stuff out"" while technically/officially single and then getting back together? Should I give him this time or am I just wasting mine?

Also let me make it clear that I feel for this guy more than I have ever felt for anyone in my entire life. I've opened up to him in ways that I haven't opened up to anyone else, he helped me get over insecurities, and was there for me when a family member died suddenly. He's also opened up to me about some very very private things, and we've spent so much time together getting to know one another. I love him with my whole heart and if this is fixable, I want to fix it. But I need advice. 

tldr; Perfect boyfriend fixes his fuck ups, then gets distant and drops the breakup bomb out of the blue, saying he is being pushed in multiple directions and needs to figure things out. Should I wait for him to figure it out, or should *I* figure out how to avoid him at our workplace?"

Help?",Certamente24,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2zwk6b/without_adderall_i_cant_do_anything_but_lie_in/,"I've always had a history of tardiness, lack of interest in schoolwork, and waiting until (and sometimes still missing) deadlines. But until recently, I had never really thought of myself as ADD.

I first decided to see a medical professional about it shortly after graduating from college and my tardiness cost me my summer internship. So since Aug 2014, I've been on Adderall. I'm prescribed 20mgXR (once in the morning) and 10mgIR (once in the morning and once in the afternoon timed to coincide with XR's second half). I'm supposed to take that every day, 30 times a month.

But even in the beginning, I was worried about dependence and tolerance. So I take off-days when I can. For the first few months, I probably had more off-days than on. But as the semester of my next phase of schooling (professional school--think law or medicine) progressed, I would take it on the very day an assignment is due and crank out the assignment in 5 hours or so. Then came final exams and I took it yet more frequently about 12 hours before each exam. So I'd study, take the exam, and crash and sleep right afterward only to repeat this 12-cycle for the next exam.

My final exam grades were underwhelming. They were my first taste of academic failure in a while, and it's not like college was a walk in the park (this isn't a source of pride but just to give you a rough idea, I went to an Ivy League school for college and graduated near the top of my class).
After finals ended, I took a break from Adderall for a month. That month was my most unproductive ever. I would just lie in bed and watch TV, read easy-to-read nonsense online, play video games, and do other cognitively easy tasks.

I'm always supposed to be busy (networking, applying to summer jobs, studying some things I had assigned to myself). But I can never get started on any of those things unless a hard deadline is approaching. Recently I was evaluated by another psych who administered an ADD battery of tests, including a fool-proof computer game. The psych concluded that my ADD is in the 96-99 percentile of adults, where 93% is the threshold for a diagnosis.

I also see a psychologist (i.e., someone other than my -psychiatrist- who prescribes me medications) twice a week but there's so much to cover that, after a dozen sessions, we haven't practiced actual strategies. Rather, we just talk about my life and things on my mind (a lot) that week.

This psych really made it a point that ADD--my condition--is ""neurological."" That is, there's something wrong with how my brain works, and I can't overcome it by just ""working harder"" or ""putting more effort in."" At first I thought ""what's the big deal? OK I believe you it's 'neurological,' can we move onto solutions now?"" But as it sank in, I was for the first time unsettled by my ADD diagnosis, because to say that it has to do with how my brain is configured is to say that it's fate, that it'll be like this for the rest of my life.

This semester is going down the same road as last semester. Only worse, because at least last semester I can leisurely read and do schoolwork without Adderall. This semester, on the days I'm not on Adderall, I can't bring myself to do schoolwork or pretty much anything.

My days off Adderall is much like the month right after finals--all I do is lie in bed, let my room get messy, play video games, browse nonsense internet, and watch TV.

A year ago, when I was about to graduate college and move on to professional college, when I hadn't gotten on any medication yet, I felt very content with myself.

Nowadays, I'm very disappointed in myself. I don't know how I can look in the eyes of people who've supported me but who I've lost touch with. If only they could see me now--a year after accomplishing quite a bit on just coffee or the occasional Red Bull, now I need Adderall just to get out of bed and take out my trash.

I've spoken to friends who also say that they're diagnosed with ADD, and when I describe my typical day of lying in bed just watching TV and browsing the internet, they say ""lol, are you me?"" But they've also said that they went on Adderall as children and have gradually relied on Adderall less as they've grown. I can't imagine how any of them can be as lazy and unmotivated as I am.

The irony is that on my off-days, I can't do anything but lie in bed. But on my on-days, even though I can get stuff done, the Adderall makes me too anxious to hang out around other people. Sometimes I need to take the Klonopin I'm prescribed just to make a public appearance in class because I worry that my gum-chewing and other behaviors make it totally obvious I'm on Adderall and all kinds of other judgments unrelated to Adderall. Since I've more frequently avoided classmates, peers, and friends because of either wanting to lie in bed or being too anxious, I've become something of a recluse and lost touch with a lot of the friends I made earlier this academic year, when things weren't as bad.

That social isolation and my academic disappointment has resulted in an additional diagnosis of depression. I had always thought of myself as socially anxious (hence the Klonopin) but never depressed. Now I guess I am and have a daily dose of 40mg of Prozac to remind me.

This is all a really long way of asking ""how can I stop being a lazy bum nailed to my bed when off Adderall?"" It's one thing to take Adderall to concentrate on schoolwork and studying for exams, but it's ridiculous that without Adderall, all I do is lie in bed and waste time."
2zwmnw,2,2015-03-22,Graduate school...will it ruin me?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zwmnw/graduate_schoolwill_it_ruin_me/,"I have a perfectly good job now and am making just over 60k/year + benefits. I started last May (a week after graduating from college.) I have managed to save about half of my take-home income, and I have been investing 15% in an IRA. Unfortunately I am completely unhappy with both my day-to-day job and also the long-term outlook. However, I am scared of becoming comfortable in my lifestyle and being happy merely being happy outside of work. I've done a lot of thinking and have all but decided that I want to attend graduate school starting this fall to make a career change, but first I want to ensure I won't be financially ruined.

Let's say I'll have about 50k saved by the time I start.

I currently have two options:

1) Attend a very highly ranked school in my field with a large scholarship. I would still have to pay about $11,000/year for tuition, fees, health insurance, books, etc.
With this option I would get free room and board with family but would spend about $350/month ($4200/yr) on transportation fees. 
I could get a part-time job (likely unpaid or low-paying). I'd hopefully get a paid summer internship next summer.
It would be in DC, so I would have lots of free entertainment options.

Estimated total cost: $40,000.

2) Attend a (probably) unranked school that has a new program in precisely the field I want to enter. I was offered $8k/year + tuition + health insurance coverage to do research up to 20 hrs/week. I would still have to pay 2.5k/year in fees and would likely not be able to do a summer internship. I estimate living expenses to be $1300/month.

Total estimated cost = $35,000.


I'm 22 without plans to start a family anytime in the near future. My car is completely paid off. I have no debt. Am I setting myself up for potential ruin if I burn through my savings as planned? My grad degree would not increase my starting salary (I'd honestly expect to make what I'm making now), but it would likely increase both my long-time earning potential and my job/life satisfaction. Option two is slightly less expensive, but I am worried I wouldn't get the same opportunities after graduation. Is there any real difference between these two financially?"
2zwn7a,1,2015-03-22,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Pegging, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2zwn7a/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_pegging/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2zwuta,1,2015-03-22,Career Advice- Stay as Nuke Eng. or go Defense Intern?,Seal160,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2zwuta/career_advice_stay_as_nuke_eng_or_go_defense/,"Hello all,

&amp;nbsp;

I was looking at a possible career change and was wondering what you think about this, especially you with defense industry XP. **TL;DR @ END**

&amp;nbsp;

**Info about me**: 

* Ohioan, BSEE recent grad of 14' here, No debt, interested in Space / Defense Systems Simulators, Testing Hardware, Drones or Systems work long-term (Think hush hush NASA, SpaceX, Lockmart, Booz, 3 letter agency, Boeing, or other places that do cunning edge things that help the good guys) 
 
* Previous experience: Solid State Lighting, Cyber security, Lab Background work with GPS, Accelerometers and Gyroscopes, made an autonomous robot to navigate a maze. Active ""L"" Clearance for nuke work 

* Never got into any trouble or done anything stupid / regrettable in my life. (for clearance purposes) -- Really wanted to join the military after HS to serve, but instead went to college to become an EE (enjoyed it too!). My family has a lot of Vets in it, we take pride in those who serve. Very ""Murka!"" mentality.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently a new **Nuclear Engineer** tasked with learning turbine systems and eventually seeing a new Digital control system upgrade. The work here is very regulated and everything is by-the-book. As an engineer, I am not allowed to touch any of the systems physically, so I have to have the maintenance department do all the hands-on work due to union agreements, this kind of bothers me as it is my system and I would like to help too. The work is like a sine wave, some days its a hectic mess, other days it is smooth sailing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**About the current job**

&amp;nbsp;

**Older engineers have recently warned me** that the company uses and abuses engineers at our plant. The engineers even tried to unionize a few years back because of this. *(calling them in during days off, not paying them during forced outages, making you give 5 hours over-time for free, and not paying you overtime rates 1.5x ~ 2x your rates that maintenance and electrical techs (unionized) get paid when coming in for overtime)* Basically, because they are unionized I can easily state that Electrical Techs make more than engineers, have better hours, and are treated better here than the engineers that are incharge of them (and they let you know when they are pulling $90/hour days and your not) Odd to have an older engineer say that he lost a ton of family time and personal time without getting paid in order to keep his job.. I like the job, my co-workers are funny, its cool to put on my hard hat and go out in the field and actually see things working, and the cost of living in the area is pretty decent. I just wish I wasn't working with ancient legacy systems *(cunning edge 70s tech)*, a company that doesn't want to properly fund repairs or fix things the way the engineers suggest, they would rather do cheap and easy, or bury under papers and forget.

&amp;nbsp;

**Nuke Engineer**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pluses**: 

* Steady Work

* 60k Sal

* New DCS system sometime in the future

* Power Company = Job Stability / Security?

* Co-workers are funny and enjoyable

* Boss is from the interwebs, older but gets funny references

* Closeish to city I grew up in / went to college in.

* Cheap cost of living in the area

* Around a rural, lake area, I love paintball, hiking and want to do SCUBA

* Nuclear jokes and stories to tell friends

* Every day is different, from water gushing out of a boiler to filling out paper work to OMG!!! FREE LUNCH TODAY!!!!! :D

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**: 

* Very Regulated by the book work.

* Older engineers warning me about the company.

* Cant touch my systems! :(

* Have to give 5 free hours of overtime

* Never can get OT unless approved

* Techs make more than engineers (Sometimes $1k Days and have better hours)

* Outages - 6 days a week , 12 hour days for usually 2 months, you give them 5 free hours OT, rest is paid normal rate, not OT like the techs / maintenance / ops / electricians,

* Ancient tech, like microfilms, tape reels, DOS, and punch cards.. AND WE KEEP USING THEM =...(

* Toilets are abysmal here - I believe Low flow toilets from the 80s waste more man hours each year than World of Warcraft.

* Friends wont stop talking about Homer Simpson / Radioactive song -_-

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Experiences Trying to get in the Space / Defense Industry**

&amp;nbsp;

The other opportunities I have been pursuing are in the Defense and Space industry. I recently interviewed with Lockmart about 4 weeks ago and was impressed with the things they described. Unfortunately they have not contacted me back, despite my emails. Before working at the nuke plant I talked / interviewed w/ Boeing, but they called and said they took a candidate who had a TS/SCI poly - clearance over me (probably saves them money).

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Other thoughts on it**

&amp;nbsp;

Now, hear me out, I have been shot-gunning some job apps blindly to some of the big firms and recently have been talking to one that starts with ""Booz"". They said they cant hire on a full-timer who doesn't have a active TS SCI clearance / isn't already clearable, so a recruiter is asking if I would be interested in a summer-fall internship so that I can get a TS SCI. It talks about software development, analysis, some programming with problem solving and application. I can program, but I am by no means a CE or CS. I can do Scripting and Batch files pretty easily, but I am sure a CE/S would cry if they saw my technique.. (My code = if,else,if,else...) But I am interested in the work, depending on what it is and also the TS, because I see that as a stepping stone to get in the industry I am interested in going into. But my thing is that it is an internship.. and well, I just don't know. Aside from joining the military, this maybe one of the better ways to get a clearance and some experience.

&amp;nbsp;

**Booz Internship - Engineering Prototype unknown opportunity**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**:

* Industry I am interested in!

* Clearance for more opportunities in that industry!

* Title sounds interesting with ""prototype"" in it? = new tech?

* Maybe better hours?

* Better bathrooms?

* Working with the industry that helps defend our country! 

* Develop cool things you wont see publically in years maybe?

* I think its nice for them to offer me this / think about me to get cleared!

* Better pay in the future?

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**:

* Its an internship, after college

* Unknown - But probably going to have to move to an urban area that I cant paintball in or SCUBA in.

* Unknown - Probably less pay at first, until cleared to a real position - Intern

* Unknown - Coding? - Not the best at it, but I can do it! :)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Work at a nuke plant now, its steady work, we are upgrading to a new system some year or another.. But I like the idea of working as an engineer in the Space / Defense industry. - I was Previously rejected for other candidates with active clearances in the Space / Def Industry - In my head its a way of serving and also working with the technology I am interested in. I am in the initial stages of getting offered an internship to get cleared, but I question risking and giving up what I have now to become an intern. Follow a dream of eventually working with Defense / Space? Or is the dream already right in front of me / is a lie / there is no spoon?

&amp;nbsp;

**Long Term goals**:

&amp;nbsp;

Long term I want to first be an engineer who either works with new hush hush tech or Simulators for Defense / Space applications (think plane / helo / war game sims) and/or stuff you'll see in years after it declassifies (think lithium battery), and help bring about new ideas to the table! :) Later I would like to be in charge of a group of new engineers and help them do their tasks / lead some people

&amp;nbsp;

**EDITED: FORMATTING**

When I was younger 
(about 5 years old), I was always told to hold in my emotions because guys (at any age according to everyone) can't show emotion at all.  On top of that, I have high-functioning autism.  Once I'm told to do something a specific way, I have to stick to it.  So I have these bottled-in emotions and have had them for 15 years which makes things such as dating and physical intimacy difficult because when someone wants me to let them out, I just can't.  And anytime I do want to pursue someone, something always happens.  Examples:

-Stood up multiple times, including on Valentine's Day.

-Broken up with over Facebook, where she didn't even tell me, but I found out myself about a week later.

-Have been told by girls ""Don't fall in love with me"".  I mean I wasn't anywhere near that point, but still.

-Been dropped for no reason by multiple girls.  One did apologize and wanted to go on a date to make up for it, but she stood me up.

-Been lead on and used for their emotional help.

The thing is though, I want someone to help me ease in with letting out my emotions.  I wanna date someone who is okay with me letting my emotions and feelings out in a more transitional way and not just all at once.  I wanna date someone who is okay with letting it out because sometimes, all I want is a shoulder to cry on and a hug.  I know this may seem like a desperation thing, but I'm not desperate.  Other than everything I've said, I have my life in order so far.  I'm working 2 jobs, going to school for Software Engineering, applying for internships, and I am going to therapy for help recognizing my emotions and such.  I know this may seem like a big jumbled mess of words, but it's been on my mind for a while and I wanna know if I'm wanting to pursue someone and date someone for the right reasons.

Also, thank you to anyone who makes it this far for listening to me."

I freaked out senior year and decided against medical school. I got a job in early 2012 in online marketing because of a friend, but I quit after a week for a few reasons. I was put with a coworker who was incredibly rude/nasty and didn't want to teach me. On top of that my parents were fighting constantly at this time. I felt miserable, trapped and I knew the work didn't mesh with me. Both my work life and my home life were miserable.   Looking back, I should have stuck with it, but at the time I thought I would have found something else. 


4 years later I'm still unemployed and live with my parents. I had a couple interviews in places I actually did want to work at, but didn't get the job each time. I see all my friends who have great jobs and I feel like such a loser. I shadowed a few careers, took the GRE, and even visited grad schools but nothing clicked. I visited a career counselor and 2 psychologists for anxiety and it didn't help. This year it hit me that nothing I have done has worked.  In February, I started reaching out to friends and family and I got two interviews but again, I haven't got the job. Every day that passes by is another day where I have nothing to show for it. Thankfully one of my dad's friends gives me some work to do 1-2 days a week at his office so I have at least a reference I can use. 


I feel like every job I'm interested in is unavailable to me. You have to have experience and the only way to have gotten it, is to have previous internships. But you can only get an internship if you are a student. I missed out on that period of time. I'm not one of those people who can work any job. I need to be interested in it at some level or if its not interesting, it at least has to have minimal stress. I have a feeling I will have to go back to school. In what, I don't know but I really don't want to.  I think I did well in school because there was a lot of variety throughout the day and I was able to study and do work on my own time.  Jobs don't have that luxury.  I have stacks upon stacks of jobs that I have applied to and no responses.  It takes forever for me to even land an interview, and even getting an interview doesn't guarantee me a job.  I just can't keep waiting around for opportunities, but what else am I supposed to do?

2zx6qt,2,2015-03-22,"I feel my custody agreement needs to change, but I don’t know what to do. (Orange County, CA)",throwaway454540,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2zx6qt/i_feel_my_custody_agreement_needs_to_change_but_i/,"Backstory: My son’s mother and I split when he was 3, he is now 5 and in school. We lived close to each other in Orange County, California and we had an order put in place where I had him roughly 30%. After a few months, we stopped following the order due to constant college schedules changing and we both didn’t want to go back and forth to court to change it. It worked out for me since the time spend with him got a lot closer to 50%. However, I wound up paying her the same amount ($46) which I didn’t mind. 

Fast forward a year and some change, I graduate from college and landed an internship on the east coast over the Summer of 2014. This was a huge opportunity for me career wise, so I went. Unfortunately, I had to leave my son behind with his mother for the time being. Upon completion of the internship, I was not offered a job which was a devastating blow. Luckily, I was originally from the East Coast so I was able to move back in with my parents to help until I got on my feet. 

During my internship I paid my son’s mother her support ($46) plus an additional $250 to compensate for me not being around and I paid half of his day care ($300). However, after my internship was over I was out of money and in desperate needs financially. I could not afford to pay her the additional $250. I used family loans to pay the support ordered by the court and half of the day care costs, but not the additional $250 we agreed upon. 

A few months of this go by, then she goes to the courts in January 2015 and wants more money (rightfully so, since I wasn't there to care for him). At this point, I find a job in Southern California, but it is 90 miles from my son. I started in February, but before I started I go to court for a temporary child support order. Considering his school schedule, my distance from him and the “status quo” of me not around for the past few months, they had to set the algorithm for child support at every other weekend (I think it wound up being 18%). My son’s mother is also not allowing me every weekend since then she wouldn’t have any weekends with him at all. At this point I’m not technically, hired yet so I had no income and they said “they had to set me at minimum wage.” So after the algorithm was set, I had to pay $230, half the day care cost and only see him every other weekend without an income at all. 

Now, March 2015, I’ve worked enough to establish myself and I want to spend more time with my son. However, my son’s mother isn’t going to let me have him more than every other weekend. Also, the distance/traffic and his school/my work makes it impossible to see him during the week. I was considering asking the courts for Summers. So my questions are:

Is it reasonable to ask the courts for 8 or 10 weeks of my son’s 12 week Summer?

I’m also afraid of my child support evaluation next month which will take into account that I actually have a job now. However, during the most recent temporary child support hearing they would not hear anything about visitation changes. Which doesn’t make sense since if I spend more time with him, the amount I have to pay will be different. How do I go about making changes if I can't make it to court during the times available due to my new job?

I know the amount factors in how much she makes, but how can I factor how much I will be paying? Will I still have to pay half of his day care ON TOP OF more child support? I fear I will be paying through the nose if I was paying $230 without a job at all. Should I even be paying for half his daycare? They did not put that into consideration for the temporary child support order even though it is a significant amount of money.

This post may just get a bunch of “get a lawyer comments”, but last time I got a lawyer it cost me over $4,000. After being unemployed for 6 months and traveling to and from the west coast for interviews trying to be closer to my son, I’m already in thousands of dollars of debt. 

Any suggestions on how to fix this mess is much appreciated. 

TLDR - I want to adjust my child custody agreement, but I work everyday and I’m 2 hours from the court I originally got my order done. What can I do? And is my recommended change for summer time with my son even possible? Is there anything I can do to make this situation suck any less?!

I applied and got into PennState and UC Santa Cruz. I'm torn between these options.

I am going to do computer science - NO doubt about it. I love writing code and would really like to write code for a company like ASAP - internship or something. I'm getting mixed feedback from everyone I meet about UCSC or Penn. 
Being an international student, I can't just go and visit the schools. Maybe I would have been more clear from campus visits?

Any responses would be very appreciated. 
Thanks."
2zxc8o,2,2015-03-22,LDR of 8 months quickly coming to end but BF (22/m) of 3 years suddenly wants to call it off. (22/f),ConfusingLDR8,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2zxc8o/ldr_of_8_months_quickly_coming_to_end_but_bf_22m/,"Throwaway because of mutual friends.

**TL;DR: Been abroad since June 2014, have visited BF three times and he's visited me twice, plus going back in 3 days for another visit and then afterwards will be returning for good early May. Have been trying a ""break/open relationship"" while doing this LDR, yet BF has always been an huge supporter in us getting back together once I return for good, and things have been largely normally between us despite this break. Then he unexpectedly tells me yesterday that he might want to call off entire relationship.**

**Background**: Campus sweethearts. Been together unofficially since November 2011 (his freshman year of college, my sophomore), and officially since March 2012. We've done long-distance before when I studied abroad for a semester and then did a summer internship in another city immediately following after (a total of 8 months that we didn't see each other, from January 2012 to August 2012). 

However, after that we were reunited again at university and for the most part, our relationship has been very fulfilling and happy. Admittedly, there have been major problems along the way, in particular regarding cheating, where we'd been going through a rough patch early 2013 and I'd kissed an old friend of mine while high (immediately told BF when it happened, worked things out between us, and
I'm absolutely in no way in contact with that guy now). BF has also committed his fair share of mistakes and acknowledges that, but for the most part both of us have always been able to forgive each other and try to work to make our relationship stronger.

I graduated May 2014 and have been doing a gap year in two different countries since June. BF is finishing up his senior year. Before I left, we talked through what our relationship would look like during this year and agreed to try an ""open relationship,"" since we thought we might be limiting my experience/what his final year of college would be like if we tried to do an LDR similar to how we'd done when I'd studied abroad before. BF was reluctant to the idea at first but gave his consent and by December, actually was advocating taking a break since he said he thinks it's really allowing us to grow as individual people and, according to him, has been making him more certain that he wants to be with me when I get back and not just staying with me ""out of habit"" or comfort.

BF and I continue to remain in daily contact (ever since the beginning of me going abroad actually we've talked literally every day, with him almost always initiating the communication - mostly through messaging, but on average one or two phone calls per week). Things for the most part have been fine between us. There have been moments when I've admitted I'm scared that this break might mean that we won't get back together, yet BF would constantly, constantly say things like ""no, I'm extremely confident we'll be back together when you return, this break is just making me realize how much I love and care about you, I have all the faith that we'll be together again and I can't wait for you to return."" (And he would say these things even NOT at my prompting). In fact, BF was absolutely opposed to breaking up completely, because he said that he was scared of possibly losing me forever. And this would all be so comforting to me, because I don't think it's been made clear yet but I truly, deeply care about this boy and I feel like I've grown and matured a lot as a person from being with him and he has really influenced me to want to be a better person. Plus we've talked very seriously about marriage, a future life together, etc, and both of us say that we can't really imagine more suitable partners.

Since leaving in June, I've had two casual flings with guy X and guy Y (between the two of them, probably a total of 7 hook-ups altogether, and with guy X always drunkenly). NEVER had sex with them, even though both guys insisted on it, but BF and I had agreed that sex was a hard limit no-no. I would always tell BF about it each time I hooked up as he was very adamant in me informing him. He was never too keen about it and was always very upfront about that. To me, it was confusing because I felt like I was getting mixed messages because he had told me hooking-up was fair-game during this break, but after a while it became painfully clear that it wasn't okay, and so I called things off with both guys.

It's now March and even though technically we're still on a break, I haven't been with anyone since guy Y in late November. BF himself has not been with another girl at all, although I know he goes out and parties and went on his spring brink cruise and basically is living that ~*cOlLeGe LiFe*~ hopefully to the fullest. It's now seven weeks away that I return in May for good, and I'm actually going back in just 3 days for a week-long visit. I am VERY, very excited to return and have repeatedly expressed this to BF, and he's always shared the same enthusiasm about the countdown timer coming closer and closer to 0.

And then...bomb dropped yesterday. BF asks to talk on the phone and says that for the past 3 days, he's been thinking a lot about our relationship, and he thinks that we should end it, for good. I am 100% taken off-guard, because everything has been seemingly normal, because even with this ""break"" thing hanging over our heads, we still talk every day (and as I said earlier, nearly always at his initiation), he would still tell me things like ""I love you, I miss you, I can't wait to see you, I'm so confident our relationship will good and back to normal once you get back if you still want me"", and he was initially VERY against the idea of breaking up versus just ""taking a break/doing an open relationship."" And I do still want him and he knows this. So I ask him why he's reached this decision. He says that he's just been thinking a lot about how I had hurt him with guy X and guy Y and in general all of the various problems we've had as a couple over the past 3 years and how he thinks he doesn't know if he can accept my faults.

I'm so confused because I have always been very remorseful, very repentful, and very intentional after each of my slip-ups in order to improve myself, improve our relationship. I get that the situation with guy X and guy Y had really impacted BF, but it was also spurred on by the fact that BF prior had AGREED to the arrangement, and it wasn't until I saw that it was not working that I called it quits. Plus, BF insists that he's forgiven me for those events and that this isn't him acting out of spite. Yet I don't get it, because I feel like he is, even though these are events that supposedly are dead and done and I haven't done anything like that since.

I asked BF to please reconsider and to not punish me now for mistakes that I made earlier, especially since I've shown for months now that I'm not willing to hurt him like that again. I gave him the analogy of a drug addict in recovery - while what I did before was certainly not acceptable and I recognize that, for the past few months I've shown that I'm serious about not doing anything he's not comfortable with and haven't done so. I just don't want him to kill an entire relationship that HAS been for the majority of the time very positive and healthy for our past misunderstandings and faults. And even more so considering that this whole long-distance thing will be over for good in just seven weeks, which has undeniably been putting a huge strain on our relationship, because whenever we're together in person we're like fish in a pond.

I don't know what to think or what to do. I really do believe that our relationship is overall very positive, he makes me a better person and he claims I do the same, we share so many values and outlooks on life, all our friends constantly tell us how they admire us as a couple (even those who are aware of our break situation, they say that they believe we'll make it through and come back together stronger than ever, especially since we DID try something else and realized that at the end of the day, we'd still choose each other and each other's happiness over anything else). And BF echoes all of these sentiments, even when we were talking yesterday. He says that I'm still the most important person in his life, he loves me strongly, and that he really is excited for me to come back. But because of thoughts he's been having for the past 3 days he feels very confused (and he did admit to me that even to himself his logic seems flawed).

Please help... Am I crazy for not wanting him just yet to take such a big decision of ending something that has largely been good for the past 3 years (and he agrees that it has)? I really want the chance to try to help him go through and process whatever he's feeling, because he did emphasize over and over how confused he's been feeling and how he doesn't know what to do, and I would love to try to work things out with him. I just feel so blind-sided and confused how someone can go from being so sure about us to now wanting to call everything off. Especially when we're so, so close to the end. Am I right in thinking that this may be a case of cold feet?

**BTW**: he tells me that he still wants to see me and spend time with me when I come back this Wednesday...should I? He says that if I'm uncomfortable with it then I don't have to, but he did make a point in saying he really wants to be with me during my trip."

2zxitq,3,2015-03-22,Would it be unwise to open a credit card specifically for a plane ticket (but also for other expenditures)?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zxitq/would_it_be_unwise_to_open_a_credit_card/,"Apologies in advance for the length-

In July, I will be moving to California with my SO. His parents are taking him out there for a week in May after graduation (and Vegas because the place we're moving to is incredibly boring so they'll only be apartment hunting for a day or so). They have invited me to come along. Pretty much the only big thing I am being asked to pay for is the plane ticket (plus any shopping, gambling, or miscellaneous...they are paying for hotel, food, etc.).

Unfortunately, I'm a relatively poor college kid. I have about $700 saved up so far for the move out there (yes I know I need more, but his company is paying for all of the move except for my gas/hotels on the way out there and a majority of our start-up living expenses will be covered in other ways). So what I have saved now should easily cover what I need, but I plan on having about 1500 by the time I leave just to be safe).


The plane ticket for the trip in May will be about $360ish. **My big question is, should I use the money I already have saved, or would it be worth it to open a credit card to pay it off over the next few months?**

Some info:

- My only current expenses are groceries (80ish/month), entertainment/going out (30ish/month), gas (40ish/month) and utility bills (70ish/month)
- I have already paid all my other bills (rent, car payment, phone bill, car insurance, etc.) through August
- I have an auto loan through a credit union that is $148/month (as previously mentioned, it is currently paid for through August). After the payments through August have officially been made (they're currently in a separate account that does automatic withdrawal every month), I'll have 20 months and about $3100 left, although I would like to have it paid off in closer to 12 months or less just to get it out of the way. No late payments have been made on it.
- I have 7 federal student loans right now dating back to June 2013 , totaling approximately $22,000. My hope is to haul ass and pay it off within 2 years (unless that's a stupid idea, but I'll probably come back here later and seek more advice on that)
- I have one credit card open through Best Buy. It was opened in January 2014 and has a $1000 credit limit. I made a purchase for $650 in July 2014 with 18 months no interest financing and paid it off within 6 months. It has carried a $0 balance since and I have never made a late payment.
- I have a job that pays approximately $300-$500/month. I haven't been able to save much of it lately because I have had some medical expenses this semester that weren't covered by insurance, but going forward I should be good. 
- I just pulled my Experian credit report today, and everything looks good (all green ""OK"" boxes and no accounts I didn't recognize)
- I also did my Credit Sesame score (I know it's not the most accurate, but it's free) and it said it was 668, but it also said I didn't have any credit cards despite having the Best Buy card...
- I've been considering opening a credit card for a while so I can build up my credit just by putting gas and groceries on and it paying it off every month. But, my mom always tells me it's a horrible idea. I love her, but I find it difficult to fully trust her financial advice.
- I currently don't have a job for when I move (the decision to go was in the past couple months, and I've had school and some issues with an internship required for graduation that have kept me extremely busy). But the jobs I am starting to apply for will put me in the $30-$40k range and I am relatively confident I won't have any issued securing one of these jobs (I have a guaranteed job out there as a backup, but it would only put me at around $20k a year, so I'm trying to find something better)
- I realize there will be other expenses on this trip besides just the ticket. I will definitely have the money for those expenses, the ticket is just the only big thing.
- I also realize that given my financial standing, this trip doesn't look like the best idea. But I'd very much like to go apartment hunting and I also pretty much never get to go on vacation except to the Gulf once every other year with my giant family.


I have no doubt that I would be able to pay for the flight by saving my money, but I'd prefer to purchase the ticket within the next 3ish weeks. If I save my money, I would be cutting it too close for my comfort. Using the money I have saved for the move makes me kind of uncomfortable, but if a credit card is just a really bad option, then I'll do it. My other option would be a loan from my mom, but I'd like to avoid that.

**So again**:
Would it be worth it to open up a credit card to purchase the ticket now, or should I use my savings? If a credit card isn't a bad idea, what are the best options for low interest rate cards (maybe even student cards if I can keep the card after I stop being a student in a few months)?"

Especially after reading about the architects with no certs. My last mentor in the lopsa program told me I had the smarts and reasoning skills to make it in the field, and he also laughed at degrees.

I have a 3.2 GPA and have generally done alright in my classes but have constantly felt inferior to my classmates who seem much more dedicated and knowledgeable and have jobs in the field already. I switched majors my freshman year while going through community college to CS with a minor in Mathematics. I took an intro to programming class and I loved it. However, I had to reduce my full time courseload my junior year due to a bout of severe depression and the last few years have been marked with self-doubt as I started hitting the heavier CS courses (enjoyed the math, surprisingly). It's only this year that my school has taught actual hands-on software engineering from scratch. I enjoy coding in Java and it's very satisfying when I complete assignments after being stuck on a problem for so long, but I haven't done much of it in my spare time and I'm worried it will be a big red flag. As I lurk this sub the common refrain I hear is ""work on some personal projects"", although the only projects I have are a group database design project using PostgreSQL and a web application with Flask (I knew next to nothing about Python and web development, but my contributions involved writing python scripts to import the instructor-given JSON data into the database), and a group Android development project I am currently working in this semester. 

My work experience is also a little sad as I have been working at a fast food restaurant the last 6 years and had a few months working at a PC repair shop.

**Or does anyone have any general advice for me about data science?**

I majored in chemical engineering, but my internship experience has all been  very data and modeling centric - I developed predictive and stastical models in MATLAB and C++. I found this to be signifcantly more exciting than my major but it's too late to switch: I graduate in May.  I was able to take a numerical algorithms class though this semester, which I found really fun. 


The mismatch between my desired field and major has made it difficult to find a job. (although also likely because I can't put together a good cover letter for the life of me).

I've emailed my advisor asking about work study programs and internships, although I really don’t feel like I know enough to talk people through computer problems, I am open to other suggestions she may have about where I can work. I've built a few computers and maintain my home network but that’s about all I have experience with. She will hopefully get back to me tomorrow and we can go from there. I don’t know how much they pay, so I’m still looking for jobs outside of school. They have someone who specializes in helping students get housing closer to campus, but with no job and no income I highly doubt I’ll be able to get in one. I’m currently going to be traveling about 60 miles a day and using roughly an 1/8th of a tank of gas. To fill my tank takes about $30-$40 although prices are going back up so it’ll probably be close to $50.

For starters, I didn't want to file a claim on my own policy so for some unknown reason my insurance agency didn't report my accident to my insurance company for over a MONTH. It wasn't until I contacted them to find out what was taking so long that they told me as much. I eventually had to file a claim against my own insurance and received a check of $432. I was roughly quoted $2300 to fix it. So now I have no hope to sell it even for what I still owe on it. Even so, that option would leave me without a vehicle to get back and forth to school.

* **I look every day for jobs. On craigslist at least here in RI most ads don’t feature any kind of company identifiable information. So you have literally no clue who you’re sending your resume to. Also, I don’t trust temp agencies AT ALL. I've talked to 4 different ones in the area, and of those 4 times every single time I've been bait and switched for a lower paying job by several dollars. Other sites like Indeed have such random jobs and absolute shit search features its damn near impossible to narrow it down to what I’m open to. Even then they’re 90% sales or just blatant phishing posts anyway.

That's about all I can think of for an initial post. I will answer questions as best I can. Any guidance would be very greatly appreciated.

2zya80,9,2015-03-22,Are all engineering jobs like this?,themister32,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2zya80/are_all_engineering_jobs_like_this/,"Hello everybody!

I am in the middle of an internship right now and am seriously doubting whether or not being an engineer is right for me. To begin, I'm a mechanical engineer major. When I got this internship, I knew that I didn't particularly care about the product that we are making at our plant, but I figured that there would be a lot to learn in the process. 

While I have learned a lot, I have found myself disenchanted with the process of engineering. With it being a manufacturing plant, it is required that any change on the floor is documented. (which makes sense)

Unfortunately, the effect is that I dont feel like I am actually doing anything.  There are many times when a simple, common sense change should be made on the floor, but you can't do it without a grundle of paperwork and oversight from several engineers. The process ins't helped when the overseeing engineers think the intern is completely incompetent. (which I don't blame them for, it is an inevitability of being inexperienced) Many times the problem isn't the paperwork, but the fact that the companies internal software allows zero flexibility, which leads to IT problems. 

Mix that with the fact that my office works with really low efficiency, and I dont feel like I am being as productive as I could be. (Many days my coworkers spend more time making small talk than talking about company projects or doing real work.) I definitely don't feel like I am adding value to the company at a rate proportional to my pay. There are days when I have plenty to do. There are also days when I have to go asking around for work to keep busy. Some of the time, there isn't, which puts me in a tricky spot since I have a minimum hour quota. If this is a level of inefficieny happening in the private sector,I can only imagine the horror of doing government work (or at least from what I have heard).

I don't hate my job. It is far superior than the minimum wage retail jobs I have worked in the past. I'm just not sure that this is right for me. It seems many times like the company is paying you to be responsible for any fuck ups, as opposed to actually doing any engineering. 

Are all engineering jobs like this? What have your experiences been like? 

TLDR: Engineering internship not what I expected. I'm learning a lot, but not sure if this is right for me. I feel much more productive in school, and am thinking that maybe acedemia may be my thing? "

I will start taking upper level CS classes as soon as I am there and I think I should be able to get them because I have a high unit count from a previous bachelors degree. I should be able to finish in 4-5 quarters. Unfortunately this only gives me one summer for internships. I have two questions relating to this.

1. Will companies even give me an internship if I have only been at Davis 1 year? Plenty friends I know there have gotten internships at great companies but they were not transfers.

2. Should I delay my graduation so I can have 2 summers for internships?

2zycgd,1,2015-03-22,Does having work experience matter for a CS internship?,Captain_Forge,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zycgd/does_having_work_experience_matter_for_a_cs/,"So I'm a freshman majoring in CS at a respectable institution, and it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to get an internship this summer. I also have no prior work experience. So, right now I'm wavering between two options:

(1) Take summer classes at my university to get ahead, allowing me to take more CS classes later on (or graduate early)
(2) Get a summer job in some unrelated field, purely for the work experience.

Is work experience necessary (or beneficial in any way) when I am being considered for a computer science internship or job? Or is my summer better spent taking classes? Either way, I will of course continue working on my side projects."

2zyfal,821,2015-03-22,The Night We Ruined Daniel Bryan's Return at WWE.com,barstoolLA,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2zyfal/the_night_we_ruined_daniel_bryans_return_at_wwecom/,"I used to work as an intern at WWE.com. 

I was working the Summerslam PPV in 2010, the night that Daniel Bryan made his triumphant return to WWE after getting suspended during the Nexus angle for getting too violent. If you remember, team Cena had a mystery teammate for that night as they were ready to take on the Nexus, or something along those lines. 

Now, at WWE.com my desk, even as an intern, was located in the bullpen. Meaning, I was right in the shit with every other writer on staff, EXCEPT for the 3 senior editors of the website. Now again, even as an intern, I was privy to the script of every PPV I worked on, as sometimes I was tasked with prepping or writing match results for events on the PPV, and because of the time restraints, we had to start writing these things before the matches even started. So at the start of the show, I knew who was going over in the main event match, but the script that I got did not list the last member of team Cena on it.

I obviously didn't think too much of it and continued with some work I had to do, writing photo captions for matches.

About 10 minutes before the main even started, ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE at WWE.com. The craziest freakout I ever saw. Phones are ringing off the hook, the Senior editors are yelling at everyone, Joey Styles is coming out of his office, staff writers are keeping their heads down. Someone on staff had ruined the surprise that Daniel Bryan was the mystery teammate on team Cena. Someone had fucked everything up.

Murmurs started to spread in the bullpen that the Bryan thing was why all our bosses were getting riled up, and in a panic I double checked our internal server to check that I wasn't in fact the one to fuck something up by accident. I mean there were a lot of ways someone could do that, especially someone as inexperienced as myself. When I logged on, I saw that one of my bosses, a senior editor on the website, was the person who's name was linked to the article that was accidentally posted to WWE.com. 

Me being new to the company and a bit naive, I decided that I'd cover for my boss. I DELETED my boss' name from the article and retyped in WWE.com STAFF as the writer of the article in question, hoping that my boss wouldn't get reamed out for making a mistake. What basically happened to spoil the surprise is that the internal WWE.com website had 3 different categories for a new post on the website. You can either Publish immediately, create a Draft to be edited later, or set a date and time for an article to automatically appear. My boss thought he did the latter, but instead published immediately.

My covering for my boss didn't work, as there are IT people at the website much smarter than myself who could go through the history of the posting and find out the name of the person who ruined the angle.

5 minutes into the match, the phones at the website keep ringing. Then they go quiet. VINCE himself is on the phone and he is PISSED. I've never heard a more deathly quiet in an office then that moment. Evidently Vince NEVER personally calls the WWE.com offices, so in a way I got to witness history. Vince ripped into the boss of the Senior editors, and held him personally responsible for the whole incident. Screaming and yelling continued for the entirety of the rest of the PPV, and if it wasn't such a big deal to the majority of the WWE ""Universe"" that the Daniel Bryan return was posted too early on WWE.com, it certainly seemed that way too all of us at the time.

Looking back on the situation now, it was interesting to see who in the company had access to top secret information. I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been for a guy like Vince to cultivate a surprise like Bryan's return, for it to get ruined by a writer at .com. There were also clearly multiple scripts for show, some for guys like myself, and others for Senior members of the staff. 

My boss who messed everything up didn't get fired, but he did leave the company by the time my internship ended. As we know, John Cena did his best to fuck up the finish of the Summerslam match anyway, so in the end, who really cared?"

My first IT position started out as an internship at a very small MSP that focused on small businesses. It all started when I got an internship at this small MSP during college they hired me shortly afterwards and just worked around my college schedule as most of my classes were at night anyway. Initially when I started there was only one other tech. I guess there were many more at one point but they left to go start their own company.

Anyway I worked at this small MSP for about 6 years. For the first two years I worked along side the one other tech mentioned earlier before he left for a better job. At this point I was left as the lead tech managing a bunch of small business networks. The work consisted of everything from AD, Exchange, Cisco VPNs, to new PC installs and virus removal. It was a jack of all trades position basically. The owner of the business really didn't have an IT background and there wasn't much structure in place. Needless to say I was very busy and stressed but I learned a lot during this time.

Now I do IT for a local High School. I get paid about the same amount in terms of my annual salary but I have way more time off and not nearly as overworked. I work with two other members of the IT department. It is a pretty laid back job that gives me a lot of freedom. With all the free time I still try to look for something proactive to work on most of the time. The other two members of my team don't share this attitude.

I have been there two years and I feel like I am running out of projects. I made a lot of improvements/upgrades to the network including AD, Firewalls, CMS, Web Filter, improved documentation accuracy, Setup MS DPM instead of random backups that they used to use, Setup a VPN server instead of how they were just using straight RDP, automated different tasks for other departments as well as many other improvements (excel macros, VBA, etc..). You get the picture. Anyway, all of these projects were primarily done by me. I feel like I am always being self taught and have never had a mentor. 

Right now I am torn between if I should leave to look for a job that can challenge me more or just stick where I am at and use the freedom I have to learn on my own. I do really like my job right now but I'm afraid that I am not growing."

I had a 161V : 169Q : 4.0W on the GRE. I had a 3.85 for both major and cumulative GPA (with A LOT of graduate classes taken). I had multiple teaching assistantships (in one of them I actually was chosen to be the head TA in charge of three masters students) and multiple internships at large companies. I had 1.5 years of research experience (which near resulted in 2 papers but didn't for unrelated reasons). I had 3 letters from professors, with (at least, I hope) 2 strong letters asserting research capability and 1 asserting teaching capability and ingenuity. I did not have any publications. I applied to a STEM field, with 2 programs ranked in the top 5 and 10 programs ranked in the 11-35 range. I have been rejected from 11 out of the 12 programs. I LOVE the school I've been accepted to. There's no question about it. I wish I believed I was good enough to go. But, what does it say about me if I am rejected from 11 schools. These schools didn't just have a resume, they had everything about me and what 3 other people could say about me. They looked at everything and wrote me off as not good enough. I am analyzing every facet of my application and I see where I could have done better (I had 3 B+'s in classes for my major in my first couple semesters, no publications, etc.). The worst part is, when I tell people about this they are surprised. I am embarrassed and I feel like somehow I let my mentors down. So many people told me to go big, that I had done well enough to go wherever I wanted, and I avoid those people now. If I had a nickel for every time people tried to tell me, ""Oh, it's just random!"" I'd have like 78 cents or something. It isn't random. If it were, I would've thrown in a couple applications to nuclear physics programs despite not having taken a single physics class (because WHY THE FUCK NOT, RIGHT).

I'm lucky enough to be graduating without student loans. I seriously do not know what to do with my paycheck. I'm so used to spending as little as humanly possible on things like rent, food, etc and having not very much left over because I've needed to budget based on my part time job + what I've saved from summer internships, so now that I'm starting a real job, my mind just like melts at the thought of that much money. After taxes, I should apparently be bringing in about $4175/month. Assume that I'm starting out with about $0 (with enough to cover basic living expenses my first month of work) because that's essentially what I'm going to have come May after paying a security deposit/first+last month's rent on an apartment.


My plans so far go like this:



Rent/food/car and health insurance/utilities/gas/internet/cell phone: $1298/month. This is based on research into rent prices in the area along with what I pay for things now (and I'm moving to an area where the cost of living is lower, so it'll actually probably come out to less than this). Am I forgetting any essential adult-type things here?



Charitable contributions: $311/month. I  would really like to not move on this number unless it's deemed absolutely necessary.



Retirement contributions: $708/month. My employer does 50% matching on the first $3000 I contribute to a 401k, plus I'm trying to max out an IRA, so I figured I'd contribute enough to reach 3000+5500 = $8500 per year. Does this make sense? Should I be contributing more?


Gym membership: $50/month



6-month emergency fund: $1166/month. Aiming to get this funded by December of this year. I calculated how much I'd need if I cut the charitable spending, because that's not a necessity.



After all that, I have about $640 left over per month, unless I'm doing some terrible calculations. Some of this will go towards entertainment/shopping and saving for a vacation, but what should I do with the rest of it? Put it towards retirement? Funding the emergency fund sooner? And after I fund the emergency fund, I'm going to have like a shit ton of money left over every month that I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO DO WITH. Someone told me I should put it into a mutual fund? Is that a good idea? Are there better things to do with it?

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2zz0af,19,2015-03-22,Burning out of Computer Science,[deleted],AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/2zz0af/burning_out_of_computer_science/,"I am currently a Junior and a student studying Computer Science at a reasonably reputable US university (top 25 ish).

I had a kind of unconventional switch into computer science. I switched from a liberal arts major freshman year. I felt like it enabled me to bullshit and get away with it, and I saw that there were a lot of kids truly passionate about the major, not just taking advantage of, say, the ability to skip all the reading which made me feel like I was in the wrong place. 

I took AP CS in highschool and decided to take another intro class in college and loved it. I went on to excel in Data Structures, having one of the highest grades in the course and coming back as a undergraduate teaching assistant. It was, for me, the first time I really had to put in 15+ hours into a single assignment but I felt such a rush when I accomplished something or was at the top of the class.

After a rough semester spring of my sophomore year (where I put too much on my plate academically, extracurricularly, and socially) my grades took a dive and I dropped class. I felt like I experienced burn out. That summer, I had an internship at a fortune 500 company with a technical product (but not particularly prestigious) and I felt useless the whole summer. I was given a huge project feature that they told me to just research, and make a prototype if I could. I don't blame the company or my team for the experience, but they were simply too strapped to provide much mentorship and I never had any guidance minus an hour or so of peer programming where they really taught me how to debug using a robust IDE and to get through a huge codebose (which was very useful, but the tip of a big iceberg). My feature was far away from anything anyone else was doing (which makes sense, because I was the intern) but I never got a feel for the platform nor was asked to fix a single bug. I had a killer commute and really didn't manage to have much of a life that summer, so much of my time outside of work was spent being upset at my performance in work.

Into my junior year, I'm grappling with a lot of imposter anxiety - or maybe it's all valid, who knows. I am onto the super tough low level classes that everyone struggles with but I lack the grit to put in the 15, or 20, or 40 hours required for each assignment. I'm getting each assignment done by the skin of my teeth and I dread the neverending list of programming-intensive assignments I have. My GPA is still ok (around 3.65. All of my low grades were in pure math/science, but I did well in CS/programming courses) and I have an internship at a ""Big 4"" company this summer.

Few of my friends are computer science majors. I am part of several extremely time consuming activities that are not related to my major in the slightest. I watch a lot of Netflix. I don't think this makes me special or unique, but I don't program in my spare time at all. I also in general have very little spare time, but don't we all.

I think what I need above all is a break. I'm on scholarship (which expires after 8 consecutive semesters) and so close to graduating that taking a semester off seems silly. I have committed to the Big4 for the summer and it would be foolish to back out of that to play video games all summer in attempts to ""refresh"". I think about taking time off after college like a year for travelling but I think this will only fuel my anxiety about not being equipped with the skills to succeed in a software engineering career (because I would want it to be a break where I WASN'T working on personal projects or trying to ""stay sharp"").

I don't know what to do. I don't think programming is right for me - I found it a fun intellectual challenge when it was one hard class instead of all hard, and I crave validation (excelling in a ""hard"" major like computer science) but I think I lack the passion and maybe even the work ethic to do it for 40+ hours a week. Computer Science is the subject I am *most* passionate about compared to the other college majors available - but I am still not very passionate about it. Work is work, play is play, and my hobbies/social life are not transferable into things that pay the bills. I think my classes and major are just really taking a toll on my morale (and mental health?). Right now, I HATE programming - but I know I liked it before and I don't want to do anything else but sleep and play video games at this point because I'm so mentally done.

I guess my question is -
a) given all this information, does it seem like I'm cut out for it?
b) if so, are there types of programming jobs where I wouldn't feel like I'm swimming upstream constantly (the example that jumps to mind is webdev, which requires CONSTANT relearning of the latest trending tools) and will I ever feel a sense of competency or is that in direct conflict with the idea that many programmers love the ""constant challenge""?
c) if not, what can I look into to do instead? I think about Project Management a lot - I am a great facilitator and am very good at dealing with interpersonal stress (just not academic...). Are there other jobs where a computer science degree would be useful, but would not put me in the position of programming 40 hours a week?"

TL;DR: Boyfriend is a loving, good partner who pulls his weight and i love him very dearly, but he's very unmotivated and isn't progressing in education or his personal development, both of which are very important to me for a long-term future. He's got no hobbies or friends and spends a lot of time online and gaming/on Reddit. I'm in a healthy place and getting ahead in life, and I feel like I'll be weighed down if this continues too much longer. Can I still help him or not? Where is the line? Help, advice and anecdotes are much appreciated, thanks. 

----

We both live together in an apartment. We used to date online and have known each other for years, and had lots of issues before (mostly with distance, him having problems with porn/online interaction). He came here for school, things got a lot better. A couple years ago, I struggled with depression, a crap family situation, an ED, OCD... just a big cluster of stuff that all triggered one another. Lots of therapy, focus, medications and moving to my dad's and then to school really helped. 

Now I'm doing super well. I'm on a D1 sports team and in fantastic shape, set to graduate early. I have a well-paying internship that's already offering me a full time position when I grad. I don't speak with my mom much or my stepdad at all, but my dad and stepmom and I are very close. I've made a lot of friends, got my ADHD treated so my grades are up. I'm graduating with no debt and a savings. I'm basically riding high after struggling for so long and it's pretty darn great. I've gotten a lot calmer and more mature, and more-self aware as I think about my future.

On the other hand... my boyfriend is just so mediocre and he's stagnated completely. He dropped out of his BA, making poor grades. He's never been athletic, but he's put on like 25 lbs - not fat, but just weak and no muscle at all, can't run for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. He plays WAY too many games. Online, xbox, for hours at a time. He doesn't have hobbies or friends and seems lifeless and speaks little about his own emotions. 

I keep trying to get him to work out with me, or go out somewhere with me, or pick up some kind of solo activity. He works a very flexible job but hasn't made any attempt to make friends with anybody from school or work. I'm making him sound awful, and sometimes I get SO fed up with his ""blah""-ness. He makes an effort occasionally, when he can sense I'm really irritated, but I feel like he's complacent overall. 

I'm making him sound terrible, but I do love him. He stuck by me through the worst of my mental illness with understanding and tenacity. He works hard and although he's not great with money, he's learning to budget and save and he's paying for his college without loans or his parents' help now. He's very, very considerate - cleans the house when I've had it rough, fathers the cats very nicely (it's heart-warming), remembers small details of things when it comes to gifts, goes out of his way to make me happy, is very perceptive. He's very accepting; I used to be a sex worker and it's something that he's never judged me for or used against me and he supports me very much. A lot of people would have issues. 

My issue is, we live together with a lease and pets, have been together for years. This is one of the relationships where we're going to be thinking of marriage soon, and we've talked about it. However, something needs to change. I don't know if he's depressed, vitamin deficient... he's seen a doctor, had antidepressants but stopped taking them, saw no change. There's something very lackluster and grey about him for a long while now, and I'm fed up with trying to bring him up with me. I put a lot of effort into encouraging him, spending on him, etc. I bring home a bit more money, so if he needed help with school/books/hobbies/medical stuff, I'd jump to help in an instant if he'd just tell me when there's trouble. The thing is, he's just not motivated to help himself and that's just where the roadblock is. 

When it comes to school... He lied to me about being in school last semester when he dropped his degree. That was almost it, but he enrolled in nursing school and we worked through it. However, I just found out two days ago that he was considering taking a 'W' on his courses THIS semester because he couldn't afford the books on top of the tuition and I was SO mad. If he'd told me, I could have helped him with money or finding another solution. He said he felt embarrassed that he couldn't take care of something so simple and that he felt ashamed. That and only a few other times in our relationship (all related to himself- education, fitness, computer time) that he's broken down like that. 

But I can't stand the avoidance and lying and stuff and that was (and still may be) the final straw. We're on this lease for a year and if it keeps going like this, I'm going to be out of school and working and he'll be halfway through his second associates with the only debt out of the two of us and I know I'll be taking care of us. I feel like I'm getting dragged down. He also has a porn issue... that doesn't bother me alone, but I feel like it ties into his ""escapist"" tendencies and hurts our intimacy. We used to be very kinky/sexually active, but now it's slowed down a lot. Passion and all that.

It makes me sad, because he's said that he feels he's worthless and I hate that he feels that. If he were to get a hobby or find SOME kind of passion in his life outside of games, I could see us having a very happy marriage. We make an excellent team on everything and the idea of running a household and a family with him is one that I like a lot. It just feels like a solid and peaceful partnership and one I can see lasting, but for this one (albeit huge) issue. Imagining myself without him feels so lonely and he gives me that warm, happy feeling still, even if we're strained right now. At the same time, I feel like I've worked so hard to pull myself out of the muck and I don't have much more energy.  

I guess my question is... is there anything more I can do for him? I know that I can't just give forever, logically. Thing is, he hasn't really done anything SO egregious (cheating, abuse, being a general asshole, etc) that's an instant dealbreaker. It feels like the negatives are dead equal with the positives - provided a change is made, but I guess that's the part I'm unsure on. It's like there's this cusp we're on right now, where either this tanks or succeeds, if that makes sense. 

When is the point that I say enough is enough? Has anyone seen someone make a positive, major change in their life? Have you been the person struggling like this in a relationship? How did that happen (or not) and how did everything work out in the end? I'm not sure what else I can do, or if there's even anything else. What should I do? What are my options here?

Sorry if it isn't D:

My psychiatrist prescribed me to an antidepressant in August. This was the first time I had ever been diagnosed with any sort of mental health issue, though I believe I had spouts of depression through my teens. I'm in my early 20s now. Had it not been for me also being diagnosed with a chronic illness in May, I probably wouldn't have seen said psychiatrist for anything as I was the happiest I had ever felt in my life prior to my chronic illness diagnosis. After that, I became a recluse, gained 30 pounds, and lost myself in Netflix and sleep for the summer, since I'm a loser and didn't have an internship to get back to like my peers did.

I'm in my last semester of university. I'm a ""creative,"" and I'm supposed to be finalizing my portfolio not just for class, but to get a job in the media industry. Of course, I can't bring myself to touch my work. When I eventually do open Illustrator and InDesign, I'll stare at a blank canvas and cry. Then I put my computer away.

It has been seven months since I have been taking this damned medication, and while I feel more energy to actually DO, I can't get out of this darkness. I don't know if this is my own doing, or if the medication just isn't working.

I've recently been thinking ""I'm better off dead."" I don't know if my psychiatrist hears me, though. I also told him I was feeling senses of anxiety I had never experienced before, but he didn't really listen. I stick to a few very close friends, who I love, but I don't talk about this stuff to. About half of them know about my chronic illness diagnosis. Otherwise, I've isolated myself so much that highly social situations are best avoided. I have recently just been able to get myself to (sorta) go to class (I'll make it once a week maybe, and I'm usually ~20 minutes late. IDC that I'm late but I know I should?)

The only thing that somewhat gets me day-to-day is pot, but I hate that I'm no longer using it recreationally. My days are a hazy, numb, kinda-panicky-and-hungry mess. The hunger is good, because both my medications leave me with no appetite. I can go a whole day eating a small meal. Given my shitty health, though, this can't fly, so initially I started smoking more to help with my appetite and to also get to bed since the meds give me some bad insomnia throughout the week.

My (boy)friend also ALWAYS internalizes everything when I say I'm worthless, sad, lonely. He hears it as ""you're not good enough,"" and instead of being compassionate and just giving me a fucking hug and telling me it'll all be okay, he yells at me. I don't know how to get him to hear what I'm actually saying.

I just want to graduate on time, get my portfolio (beautifully) done, and keep going on my journey. 

**TL;DR
I'm depressed for a wholelottareasons and have been on medication for 7 months. I feel the ~energy~ boost it's supposed to give me, but I still feel depressed. What's this energy good for if I cant' even get myself to do anything with it? What have others done to navigate this? If it included changing medication, how did you get the courage to advocate for yourself?**

2zzenn,1,2015-03-23,I just feel like a loser.,[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/2zzenn/i_just_feel_like_a_loser/,"I don't know if I need a good laugh or cry or a bit of both.

I'm right on the precipice of graduating with a BS in Political Science. The problem is that I hate my job, I am tired of being in school and I am also struggling with a lot of confidence issues. It is to the point now where I do not even know how to feel about anything anymore. Some days I just want to leave everything behind. But I'd feel so foolish leaving school with only a month left. 

I have been uncertain on how I feel about my relationship for as long as I can remember now. One day I feel like I am ready to marry my girlfriend, the next day I almost find her repulsive. I go through a lot of doubt on everything, I've been to therapists about anxiety and I am now at the point where I started Prozac about two weeks ago, but it doesn't feel like it is really helping.

Today I got into a huge disagreement and argument with my girlfriend because as of right now I find it extraordinarily difficult to maintain an erection during sex with her. I finally cracked after a few weeks of this happening. I told her I just wasn't feeling much sexual energy towards her anymore. It's been eating me up for weeks. What's weird though is even if I am in the mood I still couldn't finish, so I cannot tell if it is entirely her or not.

What's strange though is I still feel a tremendous amount of affection for her. I love hugging her, sleeping next to her, kissing her, complimenting her, I don't even mind getting her off with foreplay, I still feel an intense amount of positive energy towards her, even with the problems.

I've come to an impasse though, I feel torn between some yearning for freedom and sexual adventure, but also the call for family and stability in the long term. My girlfriend is wonderful and has given me more support than I could've ever expected from a relationship. She is exactly the person I could see for marriage and family. 

She isn't trying to pressure me towards such things either. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I just got off a week of vacation and spring break and I don't want to go to work or school anymore. I just want to feel like I am right about something again, I just want to know what to do for once.

All the pressure beyond that thigh, I feel like a perpetual fuck up at work. I do not feel ecstatic about my future job prospects. I've been passed up for a number of internships and jobs I have applied for and I worry that chain will not be broken after graduating. At my current job I've been denied a promotion twice.

I told myself all week I'd get a paper done and I didn't even start it. I have two essays and a number of homework assignments due over the next month. I have work 5 days a week. I eat with my girlfriend's family every week, I eat with my family every week. I tabletop game twice a week and I am also leading a book club this week. I don't even feel like I have time to do these papers. I don't feel.like I have time to do anything anymore and when I do find it I piss it away on games and friends and then kick myself when I am out of time and scrambling again.

Worst of all though, I feel like shit for complaining so much even though I have it pretty good compared to so many people."

I am of course aware of the prestige of the program, but I live on the west coast, so other than what I have read online I really don't know a whole lot. I haven't been able to visit yet either. 

For the time being, I just have a couple of questions if any present or past Newhouse students are kind enough to answer. I have spoken with my school provided college counselor with similar questions, but she knew little to none. I also felt that it might be cool to see what actual students think, since I don't personally know any SU students yet. 

- How expansive are the internship opportunities? Are internships encouraged/required?

- What do Newhouse kids with majors related to print/online journalism typically do after graduating? Do many, if any, go to work at publications straight away? Grad school?

- How prepared do you think Journalism majors from Newhouse are compared to Journalism grads from other top ranked schools. (Northwestern, USC, Missouri, ASU)

And finally....

- Am I better off at a much cheaper state-school with a good J-school? Why spend the extra cash with Syracuse?

Thanks guys!

2zzl4b,21,2015-03-23,"R/filmmakers, it's time to stop failing at crowdfunding",robteehan,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/2zzl4b/rfilmmakers_its_time_to_stop_failing_at/,"Every day here there is at least one link to a floundering indie film kickstarter campaign with a slightly vague encouragement to ""check it out!""   Has anyone had any luck with this non-ask-ask to fellow broke filmmakers?  I'd bet not.  I've seen a lot of campaigns here that are not doing well and obviously not going to reach their goals, and it's heartbreaking.

Coming from the music industry we also rely heavily on crowdfunding to make independent album projects.  And as someone who just ran a successful modest campaign for my debut album (5K goal, 6K raised) I have some advice for all of you who are trying to crowdfund your first film.

**Most donations come from friends and family**

So you should focus on reaching out to them.  My parents, brothers, aunts and uncles combined for about 40% of my fundraising.  Almost all of the rest were people I knew, worked with, went to school with, or had some personal connection.  Even though I was a Kickstarter ""Staff Pick"" from day one of my campaign, I only received a handful of donations from complete strangers.  Marketing your kickstarter far and wide gives a very low return on investment.

**Nobody Cares About Your Film**

They care about YOU.  In your video pitch, tell YOUR story, show YOUR passion, explain why this film is YOUR dream.  You are not selling a film, you are selling opportunity for your friends to help you achieve your dreams.  Far too many campaigns focus on the details of the film but, let's face it, if you're raising $5K to make your first short, you are not going to have the resources to produce an amazing trailer.  Focus on why this project is important to YOU.  (remember, it's mostly your friends and family that you're talking to!)

**Ask For Money**

Don't ask your friends to ""share"" the campaign.  Don't say ""if you can't give, it's ok!!""  You need to be bold here.  Ask them to give you their damn money.  Ask them several times in the pitch and in your text.  Post on facebook every day.  And don't stop there.  You'll get best results if you actually make a personal connection with your potential donors: email them, call them, take them out for lunch and ASK THEM FOR MONEY.  It's really hard to do this at first but once you get over your fear, you will realize that it's incredibly empowering to be able to ask someone for what you want without being ashamed.  Better get used to this anyway if you want to make films!

**Set a realistic goal**

It helps to know a lot of people.  I've you've been working as a PA / intern in the film business for five years, you probably know a lot of people with jobs that will want to help you so you should have no trouble getting to (for example) $5K.  But if you're estranged from your extended family, there goes a huge potential source so maybe you want to set your goal at $3K instead.  If you're a team of five people, then you all have families and friends to draw on, maybe you can get to $10K.  If you already made a film that got you a fan base, then that helps too.  But If you're 18 and fresh out of high school, you will have less people that have money who are likely to be in a position to help you.  You get the idea: set your goal close to what you can achieve, not what you need for the film (you can raise the rest later!).  People are way more likely to give to a project that's succeeding.   The appearance of success actually attracts more donations.  Which brings me to...

**Momentum is key**  

People want to join a cause that is moving well and going to succeed. It helps to call your close friends and family and ask them to donate on the first day of the campaign so you start with a bang.  When people see a campaign moving quickly, they want to jump on board.  Which brings me to another point regarding which platform to use: many people look at Kickstarter and think, ""if I don't reach my goal I lose everything, so I'm going to use Indiegogo"".  But consider the two scenarios:  You are at $2834 out of $4000 with a week to go.  On Indiegogo you think, ""well I did pretty well even if I don't make it to 4K"" and your donors think ""well he already got lots of money I don't really need to kick in my $10"" so your campaign winds down.  But on Kickstarter you think, ""jesus christ I gotta HUSTLE now, who haven't I reached out to, who haven't I called? Ok let's do this"" and your donors think ""Ahhh I'm broke but I can't bear to see him lose all his money, I'm going to help him reach his goal"".  With this extra surge you make it to $4K and a little over and you just made 30% more than you would have if you had used Indiegogo.   That's why I chose to use Kickstareter.

**Mid-level rewards are huge**

Come up with something good and creative at the $50 and $100 level.  That's what the average working person can afford for a cause they really like.  I got 60% of my money from the $50-150 level.  It's way easier to get ten pledges of $100 than 100 pledges of $10.   

**Believe**

Crowdfunding is tough, you will have slumps, but you have to keep hustling and keep the faith.  If you present an energy of unfailing optimism, people will want to get behind you.  So don't give up!

By the way, I learned a lot of this stuff from [this website for music crowdfunding](http://www.launchandrelease.com), which is also very much applicable to film. If anyone's interested, [here's my finished kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1079878417/come-home-debut-album-from-composer-rob-teehan).  (Note how I focused the message on myself and my personal goals rather than the specifics of the music.)

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[With the average weight of Americans increasing year after year, do you find yourself having to administer more anesthesia drugs to these patients to knock them out?  If so, does this increase the overall risk to their surgery?  Also, I once dislocated my elbow.  To put my elbow back into place, they told me that they had to sedate me.  I've never used any recreational narcotics in my life so I thought it would be an interesting experience.  At first they gave me morphine.  It really didn't do anything to me so they gave me a bunch more.  The increased dosage didn't do anything to me either, so they decided to switch drugs.  Once they gave me the new drug I was out in about ten seconds.  What do you think happened that made it so that the morphine didn't work the way that they intended it to work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpndry2?context=5)|Ok, so a few answers:  Obesity in anesthesia, hell in medicine in general, is dangerous.  Most of the drugs given are based upon ideal body weight, so the dosage isn't necessarily the problem.  The anesthetic gases can sit in the fat compartment of the body, potentially keeping the obese person asleep/sedated for a longer period of time, but that can be compensated for as well.  The danger lies mostly in the airway.  Everything is bigger, not just the waistline, so not only is it a lot harder to breathe for patients, when they stop breathing, or if I can't breathe for them, they lose oxygen saturation MUCH quicker.  I remember a few years back a really big lady came in for surgery, the anesthesiologist and CRNA couldn't intubate after administration of anesthesia.  Then couldn't mask ventilate (basically meaning the patient was asleep, but we couldn't breath for them, no breathing = no life).  I come in, basically lift her head off the bed, we could administer a few breaths, then blood starts pouring out of their mouth.  The CRNA, through no fault of her own, had inadvertently torn part of the airway trying to intubate, and now we had a bleeder on top of can't ventilate.  To the previous question on stress, yeah that stressed me out a bit.  Blood pouring out of a mouth we need to administer oxygen isn't fun.  I get an extra set of hands, we shove her onto her side so that the fat is off her chest, stick in an LMA, and suddenly/luckily we can breathe for her.  On her side she goes straight to the ICU, get a fiberoptic, and after multiple tries we secure and intubate her, kept intubated and sedated overnight.  Thank god she came to with no neurologic injury, because that O2 Sat came down and stayed down below 40% for a good 10-15 minutes.  Which felt like 10 hours.  She is still losing weight to try to get her abdominal surgery (can't remember what it was exactly).  Part 2:  Not sure exactly what was given in your situation, or who gave the medications, and at what exact dosages.  But if you said morphine, it typically doesn't cause much sedation, but more pain relief.  you most definitely would be wide awake if only morphine was given, unless in a massive dose that would put you dangerously out (could be done, but you'd have to administer a LOT of morphine).  Additional possibility:  People of italian descent can metabolize morphine at a faster than normal rate, and can require more.  Opposite end of the spectrum are people of asian descent who can have a morphine metabolite which continues to act on the Mu receptor, giving additional analgesia.  
[I'm curious about that metabolism related to ethnicity that you mentioned at the end of this comment. Do you know what it is due to? I mean, genetics, obviously, but is there a theory or explanation on why it is so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnnkrr?context=5)|Unknown to me why certain ethnic groups have this.  
[What's the craziest thing you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn5w0r?context=5)|One of the bloodiest:  got called to a code in the afternoon on a weekend, an older lady with end stage lung carcinoma, started coughing blood uncontrollably.  When I got in there, it looked like a scene out of a horror movie, literally blood on the walls and all over the bed.  She had been coughing up blood the entire time, and I think no one had noticed as it must have been in between nursing checks.  By the time someone came in she was already unconscious.
 |Most ridiculous (there are a lot):  A lady who needed an ""object"" removed from her rectum, which was stuck in there pretty deep, causing complete obstruction, and I explained that she needed to be knocked out completely for surgery, she promptly left the hospital.  We all knew she needed an open laparotomy, its not coming out, but she left anyway.  I would have liked to know what happened to her.  -Weird but true:  A guy with a gunshot wound to the head.  I was in training at the time, and remember reading a lot on how you aren't necessarily unconscious when you get that, but never saw it first hand.  This guy had a bullet in his frontal cortex, and somehow was able to sign consent for surgery from the surgeon who basically told him to sign it and he'd take the bullet out.  I got the anesthesia consent from a family member as well as him, because honestly I didn't think he'd remember signing my consent form. 
[Who the fuck consents a patient with a bullet in their frontal cortex? That's so beyond meaningless. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnphqn?context=5)|I agree.  Which is why it was a formality to consent him, and the actual consent I got from a family member.
[From the first one: Did she end up being okay? That sounds terrifying!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnls8g?context=5)|Not a good outcome unfortunately.  I think ACLS/BLS is only really successful something like 15% of the time.  Most of the hospital TV shows aren't very truthful.  
[Pain control: Morphine vs. Fentanyl? Which do you prefer? When and why? Are there any instances when one is particularly better or worse than the other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|Fentanyl.  My preference stems from the idea that fentanyl is in and out of your system quicker.  Faster onset, and shorter duration.  This is handy in your situation being a paramedic, where you don't have a lot of drugs hanging out in the system for a long time. true, narcan could be used, but its hard to take away a drug once it has been given. 
[Benzodiazepines: We carry Midazolam, Lorazepam, and Diazepam for seizures and sedation. Any preferences for either? Which tend to work or not work in certain scenarios?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|Midazolam for amnesia/anxiolysis, the other 2 for siezures.  Midazolam tends to be quicker onset as well, and shorter duration of action.  Loraz/Diaz are good for seizure breaking and keeping them out of seizures for a bit longer than midazolam would.  
[Ketamine: There's been a lot of talk around here about trying to get Ketamine into protocol for sedation, pain management, and induction for RSI. I've heard and read great things about it. What are your thoughts on Ketamine, particularly pre-hospitally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|If you've got all the other drugs available, you could skip ketamine if you're looking at things to trim down.  However, if you were on an island and could only keep one drug, ketamine would be it.  The problem with it is that its a sister drug to angel dust, and people can totally freak out while on it.  If thats something you're willing to handle on the back of an ambulance truck, ok.  
[Any other drugs you think should be added to our formulary for any of the above indications? We carry Nitronox as well, but I rarely use it and prefer to take the more liberal side when administering narcotics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|I think in terms of intubating and you wanted to be slim and trim, etomidate and sux are the way to go.  Offhand I can't think of anything to add.  
[Thanks, that was really informative!  *The problem with it is that its a sister drug to angel dust, and people can totally freak out while on it. If thats something you're willing to handle on the back of an ambulance truck, ok.*  I've often heard that it's good to mix Ketamine with a bit of Midazolam for it's amnensic effects to help prevent any sort of long-term dissociation-induced psychosis.  The reason Ketamine is being up is for trauma patients who often can't handle the hemodynamic effects of benzos and Etomidate, with Ketamine being much more hemodynamically stable. Some also suggested that the dissociation can produce a more effective analgesia.  Thoughts on both? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnb351?context=5)|Well it might mitigate some of the effects, but i've seen people break through it and still freak out in the recovery room.  And I'd say that etomidate is the more HD stable of the 2 drugs by far.  Ketamine can cause intracranial pressure issues, and in smokers can increase secreations making it difficult to intubate or ventilate through an LMA if you used one.  Additionally, once you've depleted catacholamine stores, Ketamine becomes a depressant.  So a young guy it'll work, but an old guy in a trauma, and you risk some degree of cardiac depression on induction.  Again, falling back, if you could only choose 1 drug, ketamine would be great, its cheap, gives you analgesia as well as amnesia.  
[Opinion/rant on the healthcare industry as a whole in the us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn98g8?context=5)|Not really a rant, but my opinion is as follows:  I completely believe that everyone should have fair access to healthcare, whether it be universal or otherwise.  There are people in this country (USA) who legitimately cannot afford it, and need it.  How the hell is a hospital supposed to on the one hand act like they're doing the public a service, but on the other hand hand each person a bill which is the equivalent to the cost of a Ferrari?  On the flip side, the HUGE factor against Universal healthcare from a physician's point of view: it pays WAY less.  To the point that if I do xyz procedure, the cost of doing the procedure (equipment, etc) is more than what I'll get reimbursed for it.  Operating at a loss is not financially feasible in the long run.  I'm not smart enough to know what the right answer is, but I know what I believe in, everyone deserves an equal fair shot at getting healthcare.  
[What's the highest education you have/need for anesthesiology ? Whats the salary like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn7c9g?context=5)|4 years undergrad.  Apply to medical school, get in.  4 years med school.  Apply to anesthesia, get in (last I checked, some insane number of applicants per anesthesia residency spot amongst the top 4-5 hardest specialties to get into).  4 years of anesthesia residency including your intern year.  Become board certified (which I am), has about an 80% pass rate overall.
 |To put it in more detail, its a lot harder than most people would imagine:  Assuming you finish undergrad, then decide to apply to med school: [Link to www.aamc.org](https://www.aamc.org/download/321442/data/factstable1.pdf)
 |49,480 US applicants for med school for 20,343 total spots.
 |Then lets say you decide on anesthesia:  10,782 people per year applied to an anesthesia residency program, for 1000 or so spots roughly.

2zzqqf,92,2015-03-23,TIFU by not telling someone I loved them twenty years ago...,Sharknose1,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2zzqqf/tifu_by_not_telling_someone_i_loved_them_twenty/,"This happened yesterday although it was something that happened that made me realise I fucked up twenty years ago.

Yesterday I saw my female best friend who I’ve known since 1995. We first met when we worked together as interns and I instantly fell in love with her. Sadly for me, she didn’t feel the same way and I accepted that and put my feelings aside. We did become best friends however and spent pretty much all of our time hanging out together.  In truth, until I was married I was always in love with her but never came out and said it because we had developed such an amazing friendship and I didn’t want to ruin that. Girlfriends and boyfriends came and went for both of us but we were always constant friends and have been for twenty years now. 

Eventually I found an amazing girl and we got married and have been for ten years now. It’s not exactly the marriage I’d envisioned but we’re pretty happy and have two wonderful sons. But I freely admit there have been many times where I wondered what life would have been like had things been different with my best friend been different and it was her I married. While she’s had relationships here and there, she’s never settled. I often tease her about being a ‘perpetual spinster’ and she has happily admitted that’s what she fully intends to be. Knowing how much she valued her independence, I never regretted my decision.

Yesterday we got together (which in the last two years we can only do two or three times a year now as she’s moved quite a distance) and I went through my usual teasing her and asking when was she was finally going to find a man, get married and have some kids. But this time instead of professing how much she loved her freedom as she usually did, she just looked at me and started welling up. I went over to her and gave her a hug and asked what was wrong and that’s when it all came out.

She admitted that all those years ago while she didn’t originally have feelings for me because she felt I was too young (she’s five years older), she did after we’d been friends for about a year. She also said that she was still very much in love with me and has been for all this time but didn’t want to ruin our wonderful friendship. Through tears she kept apologising and said that she couldn’t go on with the charade any longer and that she’s been in pain for all these years and the reason she never had any long term relationships was because no one had ever come as remotely close to understanding her like I did.

I was pretty much in shock and still am. I’m a bit of an emotional wreck at the moment and all I can think of right now is how incredibly massively crazily stupid I was to not just come out and tell her all those years ago. I’m almost looking at the life I’ve had as an alternate reality that shouldn’t have happened. I also feel so much guilt that she’s never had a long term relationship or got married because of me. Stupid dumb fuck me. And what do I do now? There’s no way I can console her. And while its completely wrong of me to wish my present life away, in truth I think if I could build a time machine I would go right back in time right now and make sure I ended up with her. I need to call her later to make sure she’s ok. But what the hell do I say?

EDIT: Well thanks for all the advice everyone. I was never going to just up and leave my wife and kids in a million years but my head was spinning for a while at the thought that something I did or didn't do twenty years ago which decided the path of my life, for better or worse, came back to haunt me. I've not spoken to her yet as many advised but I've also not told my wife which many of you advised against. In both cases I'm going on the principal of 'let sleeping dogs lie' (no reflection on either of them!)."

INTRO
       Hey guys and gals, if you are reading this post thank you (and sorry for the poor grammar and spelling) this post is mostly for me though I have to put this in writing, this is my official way of declaring to myself something has to change. My name is Jason I'm 5'11 and 274 pounds at the ripe age of 22. I would say I'm a very confident person in some areas, but have an absolute dirt view of my personal image. I have tried all the crazy diets but nothing last, I was able to get down to 220 pounds by literally starving myself I would eat one meal a week and whenever I was hungry I would just take a nap. It worked great until I almost blacked out at a record store and had to be rushed to the closest deli and pumped full of delicious sandwiches. my problem is I'm a by the book lazy dude with a ""eat my feelings"" mentality. when I'm sad I eat the pain away, when I'm happy I celebrate with a big mac its a vicious cycle. but my sisters wedding is in 46 days and in 60 days I'm moving to LA for an internship, and For once in my life I want to be attractive. sure being healthy would be a perk too but I WANT TO BE CUTE GOSH DARN IT. so for the next 30 days I will be eating right and exercising, no gimmicks, no unrealistic goals, no starving myself. just working hard to change my habits and make changes that will last past the 30 days 

FOOD
      As far as food goes I bought a couple bags of mixed veggies, some turkey, and brown rice. I don't know what ill do for breakfast yet because I have always eaten one big meal at night and a midnight snack so this whole morning food thing is new to me. any tips would be great. I will also be making sure I get my recommended water for the day and cutting out all soda. most of my water comes from however much is in the mountain dew I drink and i know that has to just be terrible for me.

EXERCISE
       Im starting slow and steady to start hopefully forming a habit of working out. I'm not going for anything crazy just consistent 
-2 miles a day walking (jogging some if my knees feel good)
-20 push ups (increase every week to my max)
-20 sit ups (increase every week to my max)
anything else that you feel necessary please let me know, but again I'm a coach potato who is just getting into this active life.
 
If you read this again thank you it means alot to be heard. I will be posting an update every 10 days with pics any advise will be taken and any support will be appreciated thanks again.

2zzyjv,0,2015-03-23,He blowdryed my facial and I (f) reapplied my makeup over it,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2zzyjv/he_blowdryed_my_facial_and_i_f_reapplied_my/,"Last summer I got an internship working for this boutique law firm for six weeks before I went travelling to Europe and started my sophomore year. It was pretty small but they handled a ton of really big contracts, anyway about 2 weeks into it there was this convention for people in the oil and gas industry in this hotel in downtown LA and I got send to it with the guy I was working under and a couple of other guys from the firm. 

I was basically a PA, it wasn't the greatest of internships but it was great to get on my CV. So the guy I was working for had to meet a bunch of potential clients and he brought me along to get some experience and sort out dates that they could meet up later and come into our offices. There was a ton of people there and it was super busy, a lot of rushing around and my boss kept saying how these things basically revolve around free alcohol and smoozing all these deals and stuff. So I had a couple of glasses of champagne which was pretty nice.  I guess we got there about lunchtime and spent like maybe two hours doing all that before my boss said he had to leave to go pick up his kids for some practice so he left I kept taking to the three guys who we'd just finished arranging some stuff with. 

Anyway one of the guys who was there, he was I guess 35, maybe a couple of years older was super flirty. Even in front of the other two guys who were there. But all three of us kept talking for a while cos it turned out two of them went to my college so that was cool. Eventually they both left and I was just left talking to Jeff. He was said he actually from New York and had just quit finance to take up a job with this oil company which was cool to me as I'd like to maybe get into finance so I picked his brains for a while. This whole time there was a massive undercurrent and I basically knew he wanted to fuck me so I kept being super flirty cos I wanted to see what he'd do, if he'd do anything. He wasn't thaaaaaat good looking cos he had a bit of a gut and was kinda loosing his hair but he was tall and I could tell he was really confident. 

He kept telling me all these amazing stories and then he said cos he was actually staying in the hotel we should go upstairs and check out the view as he said it was super good of downtown. I KNEW that he wanted to fuck me hah so I played along for a while, wasn't totally sure if I'd let him but I wanted to see the view.

We got to the room and I expected he'd keep rambling on because that's been pretty much most experiences I've had with guys my own age but he caught me so off guard as literally the first thing he said when his door closed was that he bet I knew how to suck cock good. Yah I was pretty shocked and my brain sorta froze over so all I said was yah I knew. And then he just told to get on my knees and he unzipped his pants. I've thought about that a ton of times since and I still don't really know why I did it instantly, I was kinda drunk but yah anyway I did. 

So I grabbed his cock and pumped it a few times with my hand. He kept his hand on the back of my head and kept telling me to look up at him. His cock was big, it wasn't super hard yet but I could tell I had my work cut out. I know how to work a cock so I started playing with it with my tongue before I opened up wide and started sucking, all the way up to his balls. He kept telling me I was a good girl lol which I'm so not used being told when I'm giving a blowjob so that made me feel really dirty. 

It happened in a blur but then he flipped me over, I'm not really sure how he did it so easy, but I was laying on my back with my head over the edge of the bed and suddenly his cock was soooo deep down my throat that I started gagging as I sorta couldn't breathe. I'd never sucked a cock like that before but it felt so good, I felt completely powerless to him. All I could see was his cock and balls and everytime he pulled out of my mouth I could see how messy his cock was with my saliva and his cum. Oh and somehow during all this he'd unzipped my jeans and had pulled my panties to one side. 

This went on for ages and my mind was totally blank, I was just focused on sucking his cock as best I could. Then he put me back of the floor, on my knees, pulled out and came all over my face. Like I mean all over, over my lips, a bit up my nose lol, over my eyes lashes. Luckily none got in my hair cos it was done up in a bun. So there I was, I felt totally exhausted just kneeling there with my eyes shut cos of the cum. I remember then he made me laugh as he asked whether I thought I'd end up sucking some guy's cock when I went to work that day. Which was true...I hadn't. 

Then he said he wanted to try something, that he wanted to use the hairdyrer in the room to blowdry my facial. Initially I was like what the fuck but he said that it'd actually work and I wouldn't have to bother having a shower. It's weird but I sort of felt so powerless compared to him that I just said okay. So the next thing I felt was this really warm sensation, and trust me guys if you've never accidentally touched a hairdyer on you, it's hot,  all over my face which went on for a few minutes. He did my hands too cos they were all covered as well. Eventually he stopped and said I'd looked as good as knew lol. I wasn't so sure so I had to look in the mirror and tbh it wasn't actually that bad, it was just my makeup looked really sloppy now so I got my stuff out of my purse and put on a ton of foundation and sorted out my eyeliner which was really smudged. 

And that was pretty much it, I asked him if he wanted to get some food but he said he wasn't in the mood so I just gave him my number and we walked out into the hallway and said bye. "

My girlfriend and I get along really well and have been for almost 3 years now. We are both getting ready to graduate college and are looking forward to turning a new page in life, marriage, kids, house, etc, etc. Personally, I began job searching long before my graduation date and found a wonderful decent paying job in the virtual reality industry as a sales representative. My girlfriend however is in the 11th hour and still has nothing lined up (even though i looked for jobs with her she is hell bent on either starting her own boutique or becoming a sales representative for a clothing company, she also refuses to work in a corporation..). I asked what her plans are for this summer if she isn't going to get a job. I was thinking if she did an internship, she could possibly push her loan payments back and buy some more time. Surprisingly She told me that she wants to volunteer at a kids camp for the entire summer... I disagreed with her at first, but eventually stopped caring about it because there is simply nothing I can do to stop her. Its incredibly risky for her because she is going to be receiving a huge loan payment in the next upcoming months and she'll have no money to pay it off. On top of that I don't want to be responsible for all of her debt if I decide to marry her.  I have agreed to help her pay her loans, but only if she has a job.. Regardless, She is not thinking realistically about a career, is not doing anything to get a career, and is not seeing the reality of the situation. What do I do? "

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

They just asked me when I could start. 

Last Thursday, I interviewed with a small general practice firm. I thought the interview went well. One of the attorney's thought it was awesome that I was a music major turned English major turned law student because he was too. They talked to me for about 20 minutes, went over my resume and my goals, and laughed with me at some of my comments. They asked about working during the next fall semester. I told them that I hadn't planned on it, and that I was trying to take as many classes as possible to free up my 3L year. Things seemed to go south until I asked what sort of commitment they wanted during the fall: they only need like 4-8 hours a week. I told them that that would be excellent for me, and that I could adjust my schedule accordingly if I were to receive this internship. They asked if I had any questions. I asked about 4 regarding daily life around the firm. I said that I had no further questions. They asked for a writing sample, said that they usually hire closer to the summer (I'd submitted a resume in early February and got a call over a month later), asked me when I could start, shook my hand, and said they would make a decision in a few weeks. I emailed the writing sample and thanked them for the interview, reiterating when I could start and my eagerness. 

I organized my schedule before I had this interview. I was planning on ""volunteering"" with the PD, taking Fed Tax this summer, and taking 16 hours next semester. Do I schedule as if I've gotten the internship and risk missing on possibly a better schedule, or do I schedule as I had originally intended and risk having an internship incompatible schedule? "
300tn3,3,2015-03-23,Sometimes I feel like a loser for majoring in creative writing.,tortillaandcheese,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/300tn3/sometimes_i_feel_like_a_loser_for_majoring_in/,"In high school, I had a ton of friends who were also into writing. Like them, I majored in creative writing and went to college bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and ready to carve out a meager career for myself, despite everyone telling me I would fail and be a loser forever. I knew I needed to pursue this passion of mine. The regret would have killed me otherwise.

Unlike my peers, however, I never changed my major. I never got the same ""epiphany"" that everyone else seems to have gotten at some point where they realize that pursuing their dream is ""childlike"" and instead decide to ""grow up"" and become an accountant or some shit.

While I've had my doubts, I've never strayed off of my path. And despite people's unfounded concern about the amount of ""lazy"" humanities majors, I have managed to get a few decent writing/editing gigs and internships. I am strongly committed to creating a life for myself that I will enjoy. I spend hours ""pounding the pavement,"" so to speak, for jobs and opportunities to give myself the best chance I can. And the thing is, it works. I've gotten somewhere, and I've improved more as a person, a professional, and an artist in these past two years of college than (sorry) many of my peers who believe they are entitled to success because of their chosen major.

So, in some ways, I think being constantly told I would fail has improved my work ethic and made me want this even harder. But despite all of the success I've attained, I still feel like there's something wrong with me for still sticking hard to this dream I've had since I was (literally) 6 or 7.  I feel guilty for enjoying the work I do while others struggle to complete mind-numbingly boring business or engineering courses. I feel guilty for getting opportunities that I work hard for because I've been trained to think of myself as lazier and worth less  than my STEM-y counterparts. And that makes me feel like crap."
300vo7,5,2015-03-23,Graduate Studies in South Korea,[deleted],korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/300vo7/graduate_studies_in_south_korea/,"Hello /r/Korea!

I'm interested in doing my Master's studies in Computer Engineering in Korea, hopefully in this fall. I have a few questions and I'd be very grateful if I can get them answered.

* I'm defenitely applying to the SKY universities and also to KAIST and POSTECH. Are there any other major universities that are particularly good in the engineering field that I should know about ?

* What would you say is the average amount that a student would need to spend per month (excluding tution fees and dorm fees) in Seoul and outside of Seoul ?

* How hard is it for foriegners to get internships and part time jobs as college students ?

* How hard is it for foriegners to get full time jobs after graduation in the engineering/research fields IN South Korea ? I mean no offense by this, but I've heard a couple of negative things like how the people discriminate between foriegners and locals and how the foriegners get paid less for the same jobs and such. Is this true everywhere or is it just a couple of isolated incidents ?

* Do Korean universities consider work experience when considering potential applicants for admissions? I've worked as an Android application developer for a CMM level 5 company for 2 years. Will mentioning this in my application increase my chances of getting into any of the universities I mentioned? 

Thank you in advance!"

300ysi,8,2015-03-23,She never saw it coming,bereavedd,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/300ysi/she_never_saw_it_coming/,"Exam week, a stressful time indeed. Here I sat, toiling away at the university library, desperately trying to lift my grade point average before the wrath of the finals bears down upon us all. It was awfully quiet tonight, a total of seven people here with me, I prop my head up and shift in my chair every few minutes, making sure my fellow library goers are still with me. Satisfied, I lean back in my chair, and blankly stare at the powerpoint presentation on my screen. Fluid mechanics, my favorite.

A few hours later, my stomach begins to rumble, longing for a taste of anything I have to offer. I check my backpack, alas, nothing to be found, the vending machine it is. Heading out towards the machine, checking my phone on the way out, 22:18PM. Making my way towards the mechanical food contraption, I feel a tingling sensation crawl up my spine. Let me elucidate. The vending machine lies at the end of a dark corridor, picture the same long corridor from “The Shining”, without the twins (thankfully). There I stood, contemplating making the trek towards the machine, The Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” blaring through my earphones. Am I really that hungry? I asked myself.

After pausing the music, I took my earphones out, placed them in my pocket, so as to heighten my hearing sense, and began walking down the corridor. Excessively wary of every sound around me, I trudged onwards. Soon, I arrived at my destination, with no complications whatsoever, I knew I was overreacting, now to select my item to devour. As I stood there, deep in thought, I heard a loud thud, followed by a metallic click. I stood motionless, wide eyed, waiting for an encore, nothing. Dead silence, I swear at that moment, I could hear my own heartbeat.

Typically, any sane person would bolt at that moment. However, I felt the need to investigate, and therein lies the reason I sit here, typing this. The noise had arisen from one of the many rooms that scattered the corridor, but how? I thought they were all locked at this time, surely I can’t attempt to open each one. My analytical thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the sound of a table being dragged across the floor, this, I was sure of. I cautiously approached the room through which the dragging had emanated from. The numbers “204” strewn across the door in a white plaque.

Do I knock? Or forcefully enter like some Hollywood police officer. Perhaps I could just wait for whoevers in there to come out. I opted for the third. I stood by the vending machine, about thirty feet from the room, and I waited, sweat dripping down my forehead, lost in anticipation, I let it slide down my face. Approximately four minutes later, I hear the door creak open, a man walks out of the room and immediately does a quick double take, scanning both sides of the hall. He was wearing a black hoodie, blue jeans, looked like your average college kid, it was way too dark to tell, he was about 5’9”, average build. 

Before I had the chance to blink, he was casually strolling down the hall towards me, in haste, I feigned immense interest in my choice of candy bar, as if this vending machine held the answers to life. The man walked by me, tapped me on the shoulder, and in a calm demeanor, said “Psst, she never saw it coming”, and just like that, he was gone, engulfed by the darkness of the seemingly never-ending passage. I tried to see where he went afterwards, to no avail, he simply vanished, wafted through the halls, blended with the walls.

Curiosity got the best of me, I had to know what he meant, sprinting towards the room, I pushed the door open and switched the lights on. What I saw next, I know I’ll never forget. Encircled in a pool of red, there lay my closest friend Amanda, a sharp dent on her left temple was the only visible marking on her, an obvious exit wound. She was untouched elsewhere. A hammer tinged red at its tip was thrown in the corner. I backed out of the room, fell to my knees, gasping, I called for help. 

The police and other appropriate authorities arrived within fifteen minutes, they asked me all sorts of questions, took a statement, sealed the body in a bag, and left like it was all nothing, routine. I was in shock for a few days, I didn’t speak or see anyone, shutting myself in, sleeping through several days. Weeks of investigation and nothing turned up, it was ruled a homicide, open case, no leads. During the coming weeks, I missed a few exams, almost dropped out altogether in fact. Amanda was one of my closest friends here in college. Andrew, myself, and Amanda, we called ourselves the three musketeers, close as ever, hung out practically all the time. Andrew was out of town, at an internship, and wouldn’t be back till next week. We rarely spoke after that.

Months went by, and time slowly heals all. I came to the conclusion that no amount of alcohol will help, I have to face this, and get back into society, and so that is what I did. I enrolled in summer classes, worked hard, aced all my courses, and learned to move past it. These events took place a few months ago, I write this due to the strange incident that took place on Sunday. At a local coffee shop, I sat, studying, browsing the web. An average looking man walks in, late twenties I’d say, he orders a coffee, nothing odd about that. But wait, the voice was so familiar, I cannot forget it, I knew I had heard it somewhere. “Thanks hun”, he says to the barista as he grabs his coffee to go. As he left the café, I followed in pursuit. He got into the passenger seat of a white Mazda, and it drove off. I went to the police with this information, they kept asking if I was sure of what I saw, and that I might be suffering from PTSD. No help whatsoever. 

I don’t know what to do with this information or how I am going to react, but something needs to be done. They may not believe me, although I am sure of it, that’s the son of a bit** who murdered my friend, and walked off like it was nothing. Who he is, or why he committed that odious act, are questions I repeatedly asked myself the past few months, I could never come up with an answer. Hopefully I’ll have an update in the coming days.

I am now debating dropping the minor and picking up a second major in Computer Information Systems.  It would be about 4 extra classes. I want to know if it would be worth it to stress over more classes.  I also work part-time at Geek Squad, currently work 20-30hrs per week at a software company doing quality assurance (will be ending in May), and have confirmed another internship as an IT Security Analyst at a major health insurance provider over the summer.  

I want to be a system admin or IT Security analyst primarily, but also may consider spots in QA or development.  

So the big question is if the double major would be worth the time, or should I spend that time gaining more experience in internships."

I started reading up on some of the things they expect from their candidates, and now I'm worried that I don't have enough to tell them that shows I'm really good at what I do.

I had three internships at two top companies, but I ended up not being particularly interested in what I did there, nor motivated to go above and beyond. I really love writing software, but I love writing software to solve big problems, not to develop yet another useless mobile app or social network feature that no one really needs. I went to a top CS school, but I pretty much just skated through my time there because it was pretty much all CS theory and no actual software eng. I ended up doing almost no coding in my spare time because I get bored with what I try to start and just give up since there's no real purpose to what I'm trying to do.

SpaceX is pretty much exactly the kind of company I want to work for, doing something I know I will never get bored with (I originally wanted to do aerospace eng before I discovered programming in high school).

Which path should I take? Obviously payment wise, the CC sounds a lot better as I get around 3 to 4K a year back in my ""refund"" which basically means I'm getting paid to get a degree but won't be as upheld as a 4 year degree.

The 4 year degree is also a little/lot more in depth, I'm REQUIRED to take up an internship and minor in a specialization of IT (Supervision/management, business administration, accounting, etc). The Uni also has the IT students run the IT lab in the university to gain more experience. 

The 2 year doesn't require an internship, or specialized classes. You get all your hands on time within the 2 year schedule. You do get to run the IT lab at the CC but again, smaller college = less problems and technology to work with.

30238r,5,2015-03-23,How can I convince Mom that weed is good?,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/30238r/how_can_i_convince_mom_that_weed_is_good/,"Me and my younger brother (21 and 18 years old), both ents, were on a family trip with our parents (older sister, younger brother, alpha mom, and beta dad). We decided to take some edibles on a hike we were going on. I didn’t realize how strong they were and ate a little too much, and got super high. Like not baked, but tripping balls. I spilled out to my family that I took edibles, and caused some drama. Think middle child tantrum. Nothing extreme, but a lot of inner feelings and thoughts happened to spill straight out with no filter. Here are the main events I remember so far:

- told family about a girl I started talking to again. We dated before, and she broke up with her boyfriend literally the day before. I was talking about how I may start something serious with her, but also expressing my uncertainty. 

- She keeps saying how studies aren’t done or that it’s harmful, I respond with evidence from studies and how legal it is and natural and …

- I was having a “bad trip” from edibles. My dad and sister already knew I smoked, but my mom had no idea. My mom started crying when she found out, it broke my heart. I kept saying I smoked to ease my stress and that I was doing well in school and life (attractive, apple internship, graduating undergrad soon, thinking about master's) so it helps me. Dad is recently getting over alcoholism (and for real this time, not like the first fifty fake times). Obviously mom thinks I have problem, so I over-defend that I’m not addicted. Bargain quitting, tell her I’m gonna be home over the summer so she can see, that I haven’t abused it (but I am bad at lying to my mom so I also had to admit that I was high for a family photoshoot that I thought was going to be cancelled, eyes were a little red but blamed it on eye infection, the photos are framed and hanging in our living room).

-  ""I think I'm a little crazy..."". Told family I get anxiety attacks and weed helps me deal with stress and depression. I also mentioned that I used to see a psychiatrist and mom suggested I see one again, I explained why I didn't need one. I later told my brother in private that I do actually think I'm a little crazy, which I'm afraid traumatized him. I really hope it didn't.

- I had my high moment where I thought I was not going to exist in infinite years so there is no point in existing. My mom calmed me down though by showing me a small plant sprouting from the earth in front of a large dead-looking tree, and that even though you die you still live on by the seeds you drop.

- I call dad out for being “a loser” (his words). I said something about him not fitting the male gender or something and that I do. We’ve been having a power struggle for the last couple of years though, so this wasn’t totally out of the ordinary. I have already been working on fixing that though by helping him gain power back.

- My brother gets called out for being high. Mom thinks it’s my bad influence though.

- We didn’t make it to the top of the hike for the view, which was around 2 miles one way. 

- I took a nap while my mom and sister made sandwiches. I woke up and then sat on the table to eat while my brother went to take a nap. The sandwiches were really good. No mention of anything dramatic.

What can I do to help my mom understand that weed is not harmful or addictive for me, but that I just choose to use it as a stress reliever and because it’s fun? Any articles or something I could offer to her to help the situation heal while/before I’m home for the summer?



TL;DR
had bad trip during hike on family camping trip. Mom knows about marijuana use, brother was also high, emasculated ex-alcoholic dad. How can I convince mom weed is good?

Her reason was legit, she needed to learn to love herself so that she could love me like I love her. She is scared that I'm so good to her and bring her so much happiness that she's unsure if she can make herself happy and doesn't want to depend on me 100% to be happy. And I understand, that doesn't make for a healthy relationship, I know there are day si need her to be the strong one, and if she's always looking to me then that's too much pressure. I'm the kind of person she sees marrying, but she's not ready for that in her life.

The hard part is the separation. I love her, I respect her, I built my life and planned my future with her in it. I learned what I was willing to compromise for and what I needed in my life. And now its all turned upside down.

I thought I was ok with it. My brain see the logic in what she needs, and I understand that I have time to reflect on myself, have ""me time"". I feel guilty that I hang out with friends and barely manage a smile. I've been on a few dates and I can't get into the moment of enjoying the presence of a person who's genuinely interested in me, and that makes me sad. I feel like I go up and down, some days are like FINALLY! I'm FREE! and then some little thing reminds me and I fall all the way back to the bottom.

Today I learned of a coworker that past away, a former boss actually. He gave me an internship that finally gave me the insight into the field I hope to work in, before that it was only a idea of where I wanted to go but with his help I have a plan forward. He was a great man, and it saddens me to see him go.

I guess that has really brought me to an all time low for the past few months. I have a hard time letting out my emotions, there have been several days I really want to cry and I cant get it out, like its stuck in my chest and my throat gets tight but it wont release.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting as a response, or if anything can really be said. I have had every family member and close friends support through all of this. And there isn't too much anyone can do, time heals and I'm impatient. 

I remind myself I am a good person, I try to do good to others, and I have good people that care about me. Sometimes my head is screaming BS! YOU SUCK! She left you because you weren't enough! And I tell myself the same thing, even if my feeling is that I'm lying to myself. Right now if have a great job, and doing well in school, and before my motivation was to make a good future for myself and her, now I don't have her and I don't feel much like caring about myself. But I can't give up, I wont because I know someday no matter how far away, I'll be better. I believe that even if all I can see is a tiny light in tunnel that never seems to get closer. I know I need to give myself more time.

But most days I just want to crawl under my desk and cry. Take your job, your school, your relationship, your feelings, and shove it."

3029ce,1,2015-03-23,Should I move in with my girlfriend?,Hotdamncoffee,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3029ce/should_i_move_in_with_my_girlfriend/,"Here is the situation:

My girlfriend (23F) and I (23M) have opened up the ""should we move in together?"" question. We have been together for 5 months and I have a solid relationship with tons of communication that both of us are very happy in. 

She currently lives about 20 minutes away with her parents, doesn't pay rent, and works at a small cafe (35 hours a week). I live in a neighboring, larger town, where my gf has an internship (15 hours a week). She recently started the internship and I offered to let her keep clothes and such at my house for convenience sake. This started the conversation for ""why not just move in?"" She doesn't have a car and so is dependent for rides, I am in school and don't work much so its not that big of a deal. I should note that she already sleeps at my house 95 percent of the time. She will even come over late just to sleep with me and wake up early to have her parents car back in time for her parents to get to work.

Initially, I just wanted to make her life easier given that she doesn't have a car and can't afford one. I feel as if she lives two lives in a sense with her splitting time between my house/internship AND her family/job (she agrees). I want her to quit her job and get one close to me so that she is more consolidated. Family is very important to her and she is worried about never seeing them if she moves in with me. I love that she is so into family and don't want to ever come between. I told her she is free to drive my car to see her family whenever she wants. She already drives my car most days when I am in class and so this is pretty well established. 

For MOST practical purposes she lives with me already but its the concept of living with her that seems a bit daunting.  I have never lived with a girlfriend before, in fact she is the first girl I have been in a serious relationship with. It makes sense to pool our resources and be closer but it also seems early in the relationship. But it doesn't really feel too early. 

This started out as a decision to help simplify and consolidate her life but has since moved into us taking our relationship to that level. 

What are your experiences with moving in with a SO? Is it really that big of a deal? Am I getting ahead of myself? Will it put too much pressure on our relationship too early? Should we wait?

Therefore, I am looking for an internship anytime between the beginning of April to the end of August.

I have a small presence on the ""androiddev"" sub-Reddit as one of my articles is featured in its Wiki: http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/index. Accordingly, I get messaged a lot about questions regarding Android development or various specific skills and tools while I do get the occasional contract, internship, or junior developer offers internationally. **Because I will be studying at the University of Waterloo in Canada by September, I formally declined their offers. As a result, I am a communicative, knowledgeable, and hardworking individual who would be very happy to get an internship this summer.**

**Resume**: http://goo.gl/zPGwK5

As you can tell from my resume, I am primarily proficient in Android application development while I have some experience with full-stack web development. You may browse my GitHub profile at https://github.com/jparkie to assess my proficiency further. In my GitHub profile, I have over 175 stars from 3 repositories. Obviously shown through these repositories, I can utilize Git for version control and GitHub as a platform for code reviews for pull requests and issue tracking.

From my two most popular repositories ""GivesMeHopeAndroidClient"" and ""Aizoban"" both of which are Android applications, I exhibit the use of various data structures and algorithms while applying architectural patterns such as Model-View-Presenter with Factories, Interpreters, and Services. In addition to these skills, I have utilized various technologies especially for Android and Java such as Dagger for its dependency injection framework, RxJava for its functional reactive programming paradigm, SQLite for its relational database management system, OkHttp for HTTP/2 networking, Espresso and JUnit 4 for automated instrumentation tests, Gradle for its build variants, and Android Device Monitor and Eclipse Memory Analyzer to profile applications and to analyze heap dumps.

From my latest repository ""HawleyRetainer"", I exhibit great knowledge in the Android SDK through my development of an Android and Java annotation processing and code generation library to reduce the boilerplate code required to retain complex objects which cannot be parceled nor serialized into a Bundle across configuration changes such as references to concurrent, file input-output, or network operations.

But people underestimate the shit undergrads have to do day to day. I busted my ASS in college. I studied my ass off, excelled in extracurriculars, networked, got internships, paid and unpaid. I did everything by the book for what to do to become successful (read: find a job).

Did I like doing them? Fuck no. I had to attend at least three, maximum 6 classes per day. I would have to run to a train right from class so that I could take an hour train ride to my internship. Then I'd get home around 8 or so and spend the rest of my night doing homework. Normally I'd leave my apartment around 8 and maybe get back by 11 that night. Rinse and repeat.

Sure, I did my share of partying and having fun, and I also realize that this type of stuff is suppose to ""prepare"" me for the workplace or build character or whatever. But I feel like a vast majority of my time is spent doing things that I get absolutely no benefit or compensation from, but I'm ""supposed"" to do them.

Now I'm a senior a month from graduating in very big city. I've applied to more than 20 jobs and haven't even gotten a rejection letter from any of them. I've been interning somewhere for a few months and have been excelling - I worked really hard and really made some big changes in the small company. I asked my boss if there was a job opportunity in the future and she said that she really wants to keep me on, but the company probably won't have the money (small start-up). That was my back-up plan.

I envy my co-workers for being able to leave work and go home and do things they enjoy. Every time I leave work after a full work day (9-5), I'm either running to class, study group, club meeting, whatever. All in the name of being successful, but I can't even find a job relevant to my major.

I feel like it's making me into a bitter and angry person. I have worked so, so, so hard to get somewhere in life, and now's the point where it's supposed to pay off and I have nothing.

The icing on the cake is that my fucking scumbag brother, who fucked off all through high school, wasted my parent's money for 3 semesters of school in which he dropped out halfway through without telling them, addicted to drugs, 23 and still lives with my parents with no prospects, etc. etc... yeah, my dad got him a job at his company and he now makes a ton of money and just bought himself a new car. I can't even afford to buy another jar of peanut butter.

I'm just really tired and really frustrated and I just really want to do things that make me happy but I don't have the time."

I have a lot of responsibility on that side as nothing is automated, and most documentation is messy or missing and i am currently implementing better procedures around this (autoscaling, puppet, continuous deployment and integration system, and development environments).

The company dumped internal IT on me within the past year. Currently we only support about 35 employees, however managing them is becoming increasingly difficult. Everyone is on macs, everyone has local admin, and there's no central management for the macs at all (no munki, jasper, etc). I'm also having to deal with it requests as well, this is very ad hoc and anyone can just come interrupt me any time they want. They recently announced a plan to go up to 55 employees within the next 3 years and there's no additional IT person planned.

Management doesn't seem to realize that I'm having difficulty doing both sysadmin and IT. I've requested help either by hiring another person or an intern but haven't seen any development on that front. I just got written up for not having a weekly meeting setup and ready to go because I was deep in a bad git code merge for a beta release of code were doing.

302lw1,1,2015-03-23,"My Personal Experience with Depression and Treatment (Warning: mild jargon, potential narcissism, long a.f. 1700 words!)",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/302lw1/my_personal_experience_with_depression_and/,"**(Disclaimer: none of the treatments described here should be attempting without first consulting a psychiatrist or pharmacist.)**

**--Forward(-ish thing or whatever)--**

First off, I'd like to clarify that the specific types of depression that I had (currently in remission), were dysthmia (chronic, low energy/motivation, decreased response to any or most forms of pleasure) and intermittent Atypical Depression (increased moodiness and usually increased social anxiety or fear of and response to rejection). These were both diagnosed by a therapist and a psychiatrist at the health center of the university that I am enrolled in.

Having said all that, writing about myself makes me uncomfortable, but I've decided to ignore that and make this post. Ideally, my anecdotal experience with depression will be helpful/informative that are or have been in a similar situation. This will be a very long post, so I'll break it up into sections in case someone wants to skip to a portion that is more relevant to them.


**--Early Life (a.k.a.: let's try to prevent this from becoming an autobiography)--**

I had a fairly easy life as a child. My family was poor, but I never went hungry. I spent most of my time reading or playing video games, like most other kids born in the 90s (I assume). There weren't any traumatic events that I could attribute to being either one of the causes or the lone cause of depression. Depression ""runs in my family"", so I assume it is a result of genetics. I never had trouble in elementary or high school that would indicate the onset of depression during those years, though I did decide to get a G.E.D., since I felt the private school curriculum, that I had been learning since fifth grade, wasn't worth two more years of boredom.

**--Pre-treatment College(2011-2013), where I first noticed the symptoms of dysthmia (and later, Atypical Depression)--**

At age eighteen, I enrolled in a community college in a program specifically designed to transfer to the local university for a B.S. in Biology. Like many people, I had aspirations of attending medical school.

My first semester went terrifically, especially when considering that I hadn't been in a formal educational setting in two years, and barely participated when I was. I studied hard, and got mostly A's, with a couple of B's.

This continued for three semesters, though during the summer, between second and third semesters, I did begin to notice a marked lack of interest in social interaction, and most forms of entertainment that I had previously enjoyed. I attributed this primarily to personality changes that accompany aging.

During my third semester, I met the person who I would have my first serious, adult relationship with. We'll call her J. This is primarily important because the majority of the significant symptoms of Atypical Depression didn't present until I started dating J. There were roughly two months of what I'd consider a perfectly normal dating relationship. We were both in the same general chemistry class, so we spent a lot of time together studying.

It was shortly before this that I had experimented (unscientifically) with supplements to treat the symptoms of what I believed to be seasonal affective disorder. The three most effective remedies were the following:

5-HTP (5-hydroxy tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin. It is similar in effect to SSRIs, though the potency varies)

Full-spectrum lighting (also believed to play a roll in serotonin production, though in hindsight I believe a large part of the improvements I felt from this resulted from the placebo effect).

Ginkgo Biloba (Though I wasn't aware at the time, the active compound in GB is a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor, one of the main targets for a class of antidepressants that is rarely seen today. I only took this for the possible improvements in memory and concentration, which began to decline during semester three).

5-htp was the most effective at restoring some interest in the various forms of entertainment, but I also experienced some transient, intermittent erectile dysfunction that I initially attributed to the supplement. The erectile dysfunction, as I now realize, was most likely due to the anhedonia resulting from dysthmia, as it continued to occur randomly for approximately two years after cessation of 5-htp supplementation. Being new to relationships, this was devastating to my self confidence, and subsequently lead to anxious attachment to J which, either as a result of or combined with the Atypical Depression, lead to childish, selfish, condescending, closed minded, passive-aggressive, and generally anti-fun behavior that put a tremendous strain on both of us. I don't know that I can blame my behavior then entirely on depression, but my attitude towards life currently is essentially the polar opposite of what it was during this period.

I began work at Wal-mart during my fourth semester of class as an unloader. This lasted roughly one month. Even though I only worked 16-24 hours per week, every shift left me with a drastic feeling of exhaustion that completely prevented me from focusing on school work, as well as making my appetite uncontrollable. These symptoms only partially dissipated after quitting.

After a two week long vacation with J, we were both preparing for a return to school, though she was now at the university that I would be attending after graduating community college. My anxious attachment and unreasonable neediness, combined with her increased workload (full time employment and full time enrollment) lead to my one moment of decency during this time, when I initiated a conversation with the intention of ending the relationship. 

I felt mostly ambivalent for the first week or so, and we continued to speak off and on for a short time. Though I was incapable of comprehending it at the time, J was not at all interested in continuing the relationship and I continued to try and convince her to be in a relationship with me again as if I knew what was better for her than she did (though it didn't seem this way to me at the time). I was pathetic and ridiculous, and I hate the type of person that I was then. To make a long story short, I ended up being about as bad as the average and then slightly more cringeworthy and asinine creep from r/creepyPMs.

After about two months, I finally accepted that there was nothing I could do to salvage the situation (I realize now that I should've accepted this from the first day, but I'm a very different person now than I used to be).

I decided to throw myself headlong into human interaction to try and brute-force my way through the increasing social anxiety, and got involved with a couple of local communities (BDSM through fetlife, and a school anime club). It worked for a while, but I eventually stopped participating in either community aside from occasionally hanging out with friends from both.

**--2014--**

Having essentially given up on school, and after a change of major to Biotechnology, with steadily declining grades (mostly B's and C's at this point), I graduated with a GPA of 3.5 (down from 3.9 in after two of six semesters). I managed to secure a full time summer internship with a local biotechnology company thanks to the head of the Biotechnology Department at my school.

The position was fairly easy (primarily large scale feed media and pH. buffer solutions), which enabled me to coast through it in a similar way to my last few semesters at community college. The pay was very good for an internship, and I decided to save up to move out of my grandparent's house into my own apartment at the end of the summer. I continued working here until December of 2014, though only at 20 hours per week after mid August. A potential opportunity to work full time with the company presented itself, and my ever increasing desire for simplicity in life lead me to pursue that, hoping to leave school.

**--University, Fall of 2014--**

I enrolled in four challenging courses (computer programming, organic chemistry, fourth level spanish, and calculus 1) hoping to force myself into working hard. This proved to be a terrible mistake, because not only did I not study for these classes, I eventually couldn't even force myself to leave my apartment on most days, except the two days that I worked during the week.

I realized that I couldn't continue living like this (I wasn't at all suicidal, however) so after weeks and weeks of waffling and anxiety about it, I finally scheduled an appointment with a university therapist. She came to the conclusion that I was most likely suffering from depression, and had been for years. After a few weeks of counseling, I decided it would be best to withdraw from all classes and wait until I knew if I'd get the full time position within the biotechnology company before deciding whether or not to continue my education.

The week after Thanksgiving, I had my first appointment with one of the psychiatrists to look into potential treatment options. The psychiatrist told me about Wellbutrin (bupropion), which, unlike SSRIs and SNRIs, would most likely not cause the usual side effects of antidepressants. Also unlike SSRIs, its mechanism of action involved norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent, dopamine.

The first time I took bupropion (starting with a week of 150mg daily, leading into 300mg daily), I noticed an increase in focus within an hour. After two weeks, my mood had improved drastically, and the ED had disappeared in a dramatic way. After a couple of months to see what the full effects of the drug would be, I gradually felt more and more motivation to finish my degree. I enrolled in organic chemistry, and spanish again, as well as a couple of easier classes.

**--2015, January - Present--**

Now, I'm experiencing levels of concentration and motivation that I've never had in my entire life, and I can only attribute it to bupropion. It has been a wonder drug for me. The music I make now is so much better than it ever was. I exercise regularly via Olympic powerlifting and running. I've gone from being a vindictive little shit to having my ideal personality (open minded, thoughtful, adventurous), and I don't experience any amount of social anxiety. Not only am I going to finish my degree, I plan on entering graduate school for a master's degree in Organic Chemistry (which I've fallen in love with) and changed my major to Biochemistry, which is significantly more challenging and infinitely more interesting to me than Biotechnology.

Ideally, this post will help anyone who is on the fence about treatment. I realize that not everyone has such a positive result, but I wanted to give an example where it did happen.

This year I paid about **13k in tuition** and **12k in housing costs** for university. I also received a **10k grant** in financial aid, and I took out **$5500 in total Federal/Perkins loans**. Family makes about 85k on FAFSA, and I am a dependent.


Now according to TurboTax, I have to pay an **additional $700** in taxes. This is freaking me out because I already spent the bulk of my earnings to pay off my university fees.

Does this number sound right? I never imagined I would have to pay additional taxes on top of what was already withheld, especially since I've been taking $5500 in federal loans for two years straight.


**EDIT:** I looked at the tax return and it's **counting my grant as income.** TurboTax is telling me that my total income is the grant(10K) + internship earnings(8k) for a total of 18k.
Is this how it's supposed to be?

**EDIT 2:**  My problem has been solved! The mistake was that the grant was entered to be used for Room and Board instead of tuition. Fixed it in TurboTax! I'm now getting a $800 refund.

But for some background that might help put things into perspective....

My parents came here from abroad when they were in their late teens. They were both very poor, and struggled until I was about 10--when their family business really took off. Now they're pretty well off, and have provided my sister and I with everything they possibly can. They've paid for my tuition and half my car payments without me having to ask them (hey, they offered!), and they're currently doing the same for my sister.

I got an okay paying job ($15) straight out of college, and have since moved on to a new job that pays a teensy bit more. Recently, my dad approached me and said ""Now that you're making more money--you should think about giving your sister $20 a week."" He says that since I'm her big sister, I need to be generous and give her things. That is literally what he said. Share what I have with her.


The thing is... **I don't feel like she deserves the $20 from me**. The selfish part of me thinks that since she has made no attempt to get a part-time job to pay for her non-essentials (going out to eat, movies with friends, makeup, clothes, etc.) like I did when I was in college... she doesn't deserve it. But I feel like I can't say no because I feel like I owe it to my parents since they've done so much for me. I told him I am more than willing to help her out by helping her look for internships, jobs, help her with her resume--all the tools she needs to succeed, but I do not want to just hand her money like they are doing for her now. I told him I think they're just enabling her to not look for work.

Am I being just completely selfish by thinking it's unfair for them to ask me to give her an allowance when she makes no attempt to get a job? I know she is completely capable of working part-time while also going to school, because I was able to do it with no problem. Can someone help me decide what to feel/think about this? What do I even say back to my parents? It's SO hard to say no to them :(

OT brings the terms independence to mind. During my internship with LaBorde Therapy I saw patients overcome their injuries and as a result of this their independence was restored. I would explain OT to a friend by telling them Occupational Therapist help patients with fine and gross motor movements. Activities that they do every day such as getting dressed and taking a shower are things that OT’s help patients re-learn.

I bounced between my ""mother's house"" and my fathers house (which was a hoarder pigsty). My brothers were with my mother since she had custody. This went on for about two years. At the summer of year 3 (I think 2013), she finally got approved for government housing while I was getting ready to head off to college. It was awesome! It was a 3 bed 1bath, but there weren't 8 people living there. The day came where I left for college and my mom and boyfriend went up with me to the campus to help me out with moving my belongings. She complained the whole time and got drunk at the parent meet and greet. My boyfriend had to drive her home and have his parents pick him up from my moms house. It was really embarrassing. 

Eventually I realized my parents were narcissists and I realized that I wasn't treating my boyfriend well because of the relationships I had experience with (everyone I associated with in junior high and high school also had very dysfunctional home lives). It helped. However I got assaulted on campus and I decided to transfer to another university after Spring semester because my anxiety was back 10 fold. I came back to stay with my mom for the summer and it took my 6 months to find a job. I got kicked out a few times because ""I was disrespectful"" by defending myself and my brothers. And then my father came during the summer (May/ June 2014) and trespassed onto my property and refused to leave. It was very scary and I still have trouble sleeping because of it. The cops came and removed him, but he didn't get charged with trespassing because I didn't have any kind of paperwork against him. Again, my anxiety and depression became worse because of this.  My mom was kind of supportive but also demanded that I speak to him and talk to him ""because he is my father"", despite the fact that he has treated me and my mom like shit my whole life (beatings, swearing, etc---CPS didn't care to help). 

Fast forward to now. I've been kicked out a few times out of my mom's house when she has been in a drunken rage and verbally/physically abusing my brothers and me. I have about $1400 saved up from my last job (that I had to quit because I was having severe anxiety from balancing 18 credits in college and a 35 hr/week job). I'm trying really hard to keep it together, but tonight was the last straw.

 My brother [16M] is autistic and we got him an awesome cat to help with his emotional problems. He is doing really well since we got the cat. However, he has had more problems with personal hygiene, and didn't want to take a shower tonight. My drunk-ass mom freaks the hell out (like flying into a screaming rage) and punches him in the chest and tells him the cat is going to be given back to the shelter if he doesn't shape up. This cat is our family. He has made this situation tolerable out of his amazing cuteness. There is no way on earth I'm going to let that happen. So I tell her that isn't happening. She tells me to ""mind my own fucking business"" and tells me to go walk off. I pick up the cat and go hide in the laundry/mud room. My other brother [18M] is upset and starts to record audio of the fight she is having with the youngest. The youngest starts yelling back. He never yells; he cries and gets upset, but rarely yells. So I'm freaking out and I text my boyfriend.   I've been with him [20M] a little over 3 years and its been amazing. He's out of the state right now doing stuff for his internship. (His family and I have an awesome relationship too. However, I want to keep them out of this whole mess because I really don't want anyone to know how bad it is. He is the only other person that knows about my family situation.) I tell him I don't want to call the cops because they make it worse and then I'm stuck with her anger after they leave. He doesn't know what to do and has work in the morning, but tells me to call the cops if it gets any worse. 

She eventually calms down and pulls out a bunch of excuses from her ass about why she freaked out and said she was wrong threatening to take away the cat. No one buys it and us kids leave to go grab something to eat and cool down. We show up an hour later and she acts like everything is hunky dory and she is even more drunk.

 I'm honestly surprised she hasn't killed herself from alcohol poisoning yet because she can drink a whole box of wine by herself in less than 2 hours plus half a pint of vodka as a mixer. I think I can get her into court ordered therapy because we have proof of her tantrums (my brother recording about 3 separate fights). She punched my youngest brother, has slapped us all, etc. I'm just scared of leaving because I have nowhere to go. All of my mother's (super mormon) family sees us a burden and doesn't want us around (especially since the youngest has autism). We aren't religious and all of us have a lot of distrust toward the Mormon church because of the abuse they have willingly ignored. I also left when I turned 18. We don't talk to my father's family, they are even more nuts (if that is possible). My boyfriend's family would take me in, but I don't think they can handle two more people, and they don't really have the room. 

I just want her to get help so my brothers have a somewhat normal life. I don't know how to help them or myself. I am willing to put my education on hold and use my savings so I can get them out, but I don't want to. Housing around here is difficult, and if she was forced to be committed or something, I don't know how I could pay the bills. 

I just really need some advice. 

 



   
**tl;dr**:Mother [39F] is an emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive person. I am wanting to leave, but don't want to leave my teenaged brothers with her, but I might need to drop out of college and work to do so. Father [42M] is an abusive deadbeat as well. I have a small amount of savings, but it won't cover much. Very little support and don't know what to do. "

I am looking for something in the Seattle area. So far I have applied to about 20 various positions that I have found through my college within the last couple weeks. I am a current junior with a 3.4-3.5 GPA. Are there any other worthwhile places I can look to apply to or things I can do to make myself more employable? 
303fyw,12,2015-03-23,Interviewing Advice,csinterviewhelp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/303fyw/interviewing_advice/,"I'm a graduating senior looking for advice on how to prepare for interviews in a year. I've recently interviewed at a few top companies and did pretty poorly, even after going through two programming interview books and doing dozens of practice problems total. I didn't try to just memorize the solutions but I seriously attempted the questions and solved them on a whiteboard. Currently, I've accepted an offer from a company in south Bay Area and will probably work there after I graduate. I'm grateful that I have this job and it pays quite a bit above average but I'm not really interested in their product and feel like I won't be happy there. I'm very upset that I didn't get a job I want after putting in so much time studying during my 4 years at a tough university (and doing above average) as well as the time I spent recently doing interview prep...so I'm seeking advice on what I should change for next time.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's more information about me so you know where I am in terms of skill level: 
My resume isn't the problem because I've gotten interviews with selective companies, so I just need help with the actual interview part.
I have the basics (data structures, sorting, hash tables, graphs, tree traversals, concurrency, etc.) down pretty well, and my communication skills are fine for the most part (I fumble for a bit sometimes, but not for entire interviews). I've had 2 internships at mid-size companies and done very well in both, and both companies have given me return offers. During my group projects at college (a top 5 university for CS) I've been one of the better coders and receive at least average but usually higher on projects and midterms.    

&amp;nbsp;

I honestly feel like interviews involve a lot of luck as questions seem to vary in difficultly wildly from one interviewer to another. Some questions I've received seemed bad in that you couldn't arrive at the solution logically, or at least not using any method discussed in the books I've read. The outcome depends mostly on if you've seen the question before or if you get lucky and get the key insight needed during the 45 minutes you have, and I don't know if I just lack the problem solving skills needed for these questions or just have bad luck.  But I don't want to make any excuses as other students at my university are getting offers from these companies so obviously I'm doing something wrong. I just want to improve and I'm willing to put in a lot of work...I have about 1 year (I want to stay at current company for at least 1 year) before I try my hand at interviewing at selective companies again and have some questions. I want to guarantee that if I fail interviews next time it won't be because of my technical ability. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the actual questions: &amp;nbsp;

* How long before I schedule my first interviews should I start studying? Are there any good timelines anywhere?
* How much time per day/week should I put in studying once I start?
* How should I study? I can review the basics again quickly but should I just do practice problems after that? I've done questions from CtCI, EPI, leetcode, careercup this round of interviews but is there something I'm missing? Any other study tips?
* What's a good indicator that I should stop studying and start interviewing?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks to anybody who replies. Your help is appreciated."

Apologies for the length and for throwaway; basically spilling guts here and would like to supply relevant details for advice. Ahem.

Background on 26M: released from captivity last May. I have been told by a few previous girlfriends that I may be autistic due to some of my emotional behavior (although I do not believe this to be true, it is certainly possible). For the record, I am of the opinion that I act in peculiar ways due to environmental, not birth, factors [childhood physical abuse, being bullied as a kid, being real ugly until well into puberty, family history of alcoholism and drug addiction, etc.]. When it comes to emotions I am not an expressive person and require a thorough ""breaking-in"" period to say how I feel (which will be relevant later): I show rather than tell. I play this off with women I am pursuing by saying ""Oh, I'm a robot. Beep boop."" At least early on. 

Background on 23F: bisexual, last serious relationship ~1 yr(?) ago. Sweet girl, just moved to my city in January.

It starts stupidly, with Tinder, because that's how people in their 20s meet nowadays. For the record I'm not a hook-up or ONS type of guy, never have been, but it's decently easy to meet people using the application. 

Met this woman that way in early November, texting takes a very quick sexual turn. We make plans to see each other that weekend, which do not materialize because she is in town to find an apartment and interview for jobs ahead of a January move. The understanding becomes ""be ready when I get here in January dude. Keep in touch.""

From late November-January a great deal of our new-fangled stupid communication (texting) occurs, many per day: about a 60:40 ratio of sexual talk: relationship/feelings type stuff. This woman is very funny, good to talk to, and I am very excited to see where the whole thing leads come January. It is in this time period that I mention ""I'm a robot"" as a joke because discussing your difficulties with emotional expression with somebody you've never met is a real mood killer. 

New year hits, all systems go: from the beginning our relationship is sexual but more quasi-dating - we sleep in the same bed when we see each other, talk shop (we have one hobby in common), I cook (lost a bet, also I just like feeding people good food), and there is just excellent rapport all around. Although I live with family, I have not yet introduced her because I'd like to find firmer footing first. I like her immensely, and decide that if the next month or so proceeds well, will be forthright with it and ask where she would like to go from there.  

I should mention that during this time, there are many instances of what is commonly called ""dropping hints"" from 23F, e.g.:

- ""Are you still on Tinder?"" (asked a couple times, I answered ""No"" each time)
- ""Your sister [**who I live with**] probably thinks I'm a skank""
- ""We should both do an open mic sometime"" [**we both do stand up**]
- Informing me about a co-worker who is going to embark on a FFM threesome with her boyfriend, when I reply ""what an awesome girlfriend"": ""Shut up, filthy_swine.""

You get the idea. 

Come February the tenor changes: 23F has an internship and a night job, so I don't read too much into it, but the frequency of interaction goes from ~3/week to 1/week or every 8 days. At one point in this period we were leaving her place and she said ""Hey you'll meet L [**her best friend**] on the way home!"" I declined, purely because my face reeked like vagina and I didn't want to meet a woman's best friend for the first time in such a state. 

I am aware something is off with her, but not quite what. I plan to be honest [**e.g. ""I like you, where to from here?""**] around the next available opportunity. The last time we see each other is somewhere around Feb. 22.

The last 4 days of February, 23F flies to her home state to vacation with family for several days. I do not hear from her during this time, except during the last day or so of her stay, when she snapchats me some videos of her cat. 

Two days after that, when she returns to our city, I receive the following text message (paraphrasing):

**23F**: Hey filthy_swine, hope you're doing ok. Had a lot of time to think, and I should be honest with you...I've been developing feelings for someone and I shouldn't have a physical relationship with one person while I try to figure out my feelings for another. Trust me I know what I am giving up if this blows up in my face [**this is referring to the sex, which was dynamite**] and you're smart and super funny and great to talk to, so if you want we can be friends but I knew that's probably not where this was headed, so I hope there are no hard feelings. 

**filthy_swine:** Ok. You should have told me about this development sooner, and not via text message.

**23_F:** I honestly didn't know how to do it, I thought you'd be more mad in person...[**more excuses follow**]

**filthy_swine:** Ok. 

**23_F:** filthy_swine I really am sorry I've loved getting to know you and I like you a lot...you are just hard to read so I wasn't sure the best way to say anything [**apology follows**]

Never replied to the last. Tried to deal with it in my own way, although I was pissed and then sad. Figured the deed was done, so 

Around 5 days later my anger has turned to deep hurt - my heart is killing me, so I tell 23F to meet me at a Starbuck's. What occurred is summarized below.

filthy_swine: so walk me through this. 

23F: Well it's like I said. 

filthy_swine: well here's the thing: if you like me enough to have sex with me for two months you like me enough to inform me you don't want to see me anymore in person. And judging by January and some of February, you seemed to have some type of feelings for me.

23F: Well I thought we were just having fun. We talked about sex so soon that I figured that's what it was, and you said you're not a feelings guy.

filthy_swine: Well I don't cook for just anybody, or tuck just anybody in in the morning when I leave, or stock my fridge with their favorite soft drink. I initially didn't want to talk to you at all, but my heart hurts so fucking much I couldn't really help it. I like you a lot, which is why I'm here.

23F: Okay. I wish I'd known you caught feelings for me before now. Well, I really think I need to give myself a shot with this other person. 

[**Before filthy_swine can reply, Starbuck's closes. 23F and filthy_swine head outside, stand near the door.**]

filthy_swine: Ok. 

23F: I mean, I care about you, and I have feelings for you, but I'm usually the one who gets emotionally invested too soon and I think this is what I need to do.

filthy_swine: That's what you want?

(nods)

filthy_swine: Ok.

After a pause...

23F: I don't wanna walk away because I'm never gonna see you again. It's over and I made my bed and I have to lay in it. [**Begins tearing up.**] ...You don't really have female friends.

filthy_swine: It's not fair to me to ask to be friends. You'd get to have me in your life your way, and meanwhile I'd be in pain. 

23F: Tell me how you feel about me exactly.

filthy_swine: ಠ_ಠ. I liked you immensely. You're a stupid kid who puts her foot in her mouth, but you have a good heart and you're caring and kind and you make me laugh all the damn time. I've never not enjoyed my time with you.

23F: You ""likeD"" me? Past tense?

filthy_swine: No. Present tense.

23F: You just gave me a heart boner [**a term we used in our relationship to describe warm or happy feelings.**].

23F: I can't ask you to wait for me...I mean, would...?[**trails off**]

filthy_swine: That's not fair for you to ask me to be your Plan B. 

23F: You're not. It's just...[**trails off**] Why are you doing that look with your face?

filthy_swine: It's a good way to not cry. 

23F looks sad. 

[**This is going nowhere. 23F's mind is made up.**

**filthy_swine kisses 23F passionately, and in a moment of frustration says ""Bye Felicia"" then turns and leaves. Hears a ""What the fuck??"" noise as he walks away.**]

That was ~3 weeks ago, and every goddamn day since has been agony. Little things remind me of this woman, I constantly feel down, I don't want to even talk to other women. 

For the record, I already gym, we are not Facebook friends, and I have not texted her. (What would I say that hadn't been said already?) I have, however, written a bunch of letters, some describing my feelings and why I find them hard to communicate, some just sad moping, some navel-gazing. But fear not, I am taking Abe Lincoln's ""hot letter"" approach and have not sent any of them. I have not decided whether to ever do so. 

My heart hurts and it's fucking killing me. I live a productive life otherwise, I am not doing stupid things, but I care about this woman a ton and I don't know how to handle it other than what I'm already doing. The bitch of it is, despite her poor etiquette if she showed up on my doorstep tomorrow I'd buckle like a belt. I want to keep seeing her, but it seems about as done as done gets.

From some of her stated words, she thought we were fucktoys - from some others she cares for me in a romantic sense, and wants me to be some sort of fucking boyfriend backup. So I don't know what conclusions to draw from that.

Those of you who have read this far, your endurance is the stuff of legend. I welcome your wise counsel. Those of you who didn't, the TL;DR is just below. 

**tl;dr**: **filthy_swine has 2-month quasi-relationship with 23F, likes her a ton, she disses him before he can tell her. She says she only thought of him as a FWB but maybe more than that, he peaces, is in intense emotional pain. Writes letters to work out his feelings, does not send them. Gym/FB taken care of. What do?**"

I'm 6'4"", 190lbs, brown hair, hazel/green eyes, and in decent shape (go to the gym regularly).


I also go to school full-time (computer engineering major), work part-time, and intern part-time (software engineer job). I'm pretty busy right now, and I'm pretty quiet/shy to begin with, so the odds of me meeting someone right now are really low. Despite being busy with everything, however, I'd really like to have someone to talk to or spend any free time I have with.


I'm into your average nerdy things.. I like to play video games, I watch cartoons/anime or movies constantly while doing homework, I play paintball as much as humanly possibly in the summer (basically whenever a friend is free to tag along). I love learning interesting things, I can't make it through a conversation without a ""did you know?"" statement related to something we're talking about.


I'm basically just looking for someone who I can connect with. Since getting out of a really shitty long-term relationship almost 3 years ago, I haven't had a good relationship. I've done dating, but I usually end up not connecting or when I do the feeling isn't mutual. I need someone who really wants a good relationship and will place importance on that. With how busy I am finishing school and working, I can't put in all of the effort, which is what always seems to happen lately. I'm willing to throw myself into something head first as long as I know that I'm not the only one doing so.


Anyone remotely close-by and interested in getting to know one another, shoot me a message! I'm more than happy to trade pics. Thanks for reading :)"

I asked for details regarding the interview and the kind lady told me the interview will have a few questions on OOD and C++, and more general questions (regarding my resume I suppose).

The qualifications listed for the internship were Java and C++/C#. However, I did *not* include C++ because I just don't know it (I included C and Java for instance). I know C very well and a decent amount of Java, but I've never experienced classes in C++. I have a huge week ahead of me with 3 assignments due by Thursday and I really don't have time to prepare myself for the C++ part.

Five days is a really short notice for me and I don't really know what they are expecting from me given they are *fully* aware I don't know the required programming skill. Yet they offered me an interview and the lady looked thrilled to speak with me on the phone. On one hand I don't want to ask the lady to delay the interview, but on the other hand I can't see myself performing well given such a short notice.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? What is the best way to prepare for this interview?"
303riw,2,2015-03-24,I want to fall into oblivion and simply cease to exist.,JustThrowItAllAw4y,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/303riw/i_want_to_fall_into_oblivion_and_simply_cease_to/,"I don't think anyone will read this whole thing or even reply, but i'll write this huge text just because i feel like doing so.

First of all let me clarify that i'm not suicidal. I don't consider myself crazy nor brave enough to even try ending my own life. Also there's the possibility someone would be affected by my death and inflicting any kind of pain on that someone is not something I can stand (i guess that's why falling into oblivion should come first, heh). Still... I see no purpose in life and wouldn't really mind if it just ended abruptly. Everyday I wake up disappointed just by the fact that I woke up, that i'm still alive.

I'm a 24 y/o guy that has nothing to show for in this life no big career, no great academic deeds and no meaningful relationships whatsoever... Only thing i have is this fucking depression. After almost a decade of feeling like shit i decided try seeking help. Got diagnosed, got into meds, thought it helped a little, dropped meds with consent of doctor. Lied to myself that I was okay for a few months. Now i'm back to square one and don't see much point into seeking help again.

I live with my aunt since my grandmother died (they lived together) because the house is bigger and i could have some privacy I didn't have at my parent's, still i see them very often because we are neighbours and i have most of my meals there... although we barely talk. 

I ""study"" Computer Science at university, ""study"" because i could've finished my bachelor at least two years ago, I just have to do my final dissertation and some obligatory social hours (volunteering) but since i have no motivation or discipline I keep failing at those. I've always been a good student and grew up hearing that i would be succesful because I always did so well at school, what a joke...

I have a job in a small company that isn't fulfilling in which i have been for the last four to five years, i have no future there, I earn decent money for the amount of work i do (not enough to live decently in this fucked up country though) but at least it's in my area of study.... Still all this time in a small company is surely a waste of potential (if i ever had any). 

I have no aspirations whatsoever, never had. I only got into uni because of family pressure. Only got an internship that became a full-time job because of external pressure. I never took any big decision in my life, i never wanted to do anything with my life. I just followed the flow... I have no big material desires, so i saved most of the money i made all these years (which isn't thaaaat much). I think i do this saving thing because I know If my father die I won't be able to handle all the bills. My dad earns a substantial quantity of money, enough for my mom not need to work and also that allowed me to start working very late in life (~20). I know i'll never be as successful as him. Unfortunately I don't have in me what it takes to be a successful person.

I live in a third-world country full of corruption and violence. I already got first-hand experiences of it like: knife pressed against the neck, gun pointed at head, house broken into, stuff like that... I guess leaving this shit-hole is the only kind of dream i have although i have no idea where to go. Also i don't think i'll ever be qualified enough to immigrate to a place where i can feel safe and try having a decent life.

I've always alienated myself with whatever I could like games, books, movies and tv shows. I can say that my only hobby today is reading because it's the only way i can turn my mind off of thoughts about how pathetic I am.

I recently took 10 days of vacation from work and am spending my days at home sleeping, reading and sometimes watching something. I haven't stepped outside in days.

Although i've always been lonely and tried to isolate myself most of my life I do have friends, the same group since elementary school. We can hang out all together only once in a few months because most of them have girlfriends, jobs and study. I never put much effort to maintain these friendships. They normally drag me around with them because somehow they think i'm fun (I'm the type of person that when with others act all silly and retarded, i guess i do this to cope with my ineptitude and inner sadness). Many times i find lame excuses not to go specially if they invite me to parties and stuff like that. I still like them although we are completely different in most things.

I have never had a girlfriend, in fact never even kissed a girl. I'm not hideous looking and i can keep a conversation, i just never felt like even trying going for a girl. Never found someone really thaaat interesting to raise that type of desire anyway. Since highschool I don't have even a small crush on anyone. I hate the party and drinking culture around here, also i'm not a very social person so meeting people is something i don't do often. Also i'm not an interesting person whatsoever, so i doubt anyone would ever be attracted to me.

To cope with my loneliness I always alienated myself. When that didn't work I used the internet to meet people to talk with. Found some random girls from around the world to exchange messages with. Exchanged emails for a few months in an intermittent way with some of them but in the end they always lost interest. 

In the beginning of this year i made a profile on this site used for language exchange and meeting people from different cultures. I had to always send the first message there but i was somewhat successful in getting responses because i've always put a lot of thought and effort into my messages (wrote messages as big as this post's text).

Same thing followed there, some stopped answering after a bunch of messages were exchanged... Then i found this one girl. I saw her profile and thought that she was the most beautiful girl i've ever seen, literally model-like gorgeous. Her profile pictures were full of comments from dudes, like hundreds of comments (she was on the site for quite some time).
After reading all her profile I wrote her a message because she liked reading and I read some classics from her culture which enabled me to initiate a conversation, so i sent her a big message with a varied content and some silly jokes. To my very surprise she replied to me. We messaged each other a lot and at some point moved from message through that site to phone messages and this became an almost daily thing (and still is). For some reason we got some kind of weird connection. I talked with her about everything, my depression included, i've never had this type of talk with anyone before and it felt nice having my fucked-up existence validated. Before this girl I've never found another human soul as lonely and as sad as myself. I started admiring this girl because she is the complete opposite of me, she had a harsh childhood growing poor and even so grew to become a smart and educated person that has big dreams, she even got into a very good uni from her country and because of that she had to move and that's one of the reasons she is so lonely, she doesn't have friends there. 

I realized i started developing feelings for her, which freaked me out since it has been many years since i had the tiniest crush on any girl. This made me feel terrible because how could i get into such a position!? I've never met this girl and so and so. Also after some time she told me the other reason she was always so sad: she had met this guy on the internet a year before and fell in love with him and he offered to pay for her to move to his country but her family didn't allow that to happen. This knowledge crushed me, i had no idea of the extent of how much i liked this girl before she told me this. This whole thing is kinda ironic. 

At this point I tried cutting ties with her by being honest about everything, that i started nurturing platonic feelings for her and etc. Somehow in the end we kept in touch and things proceeded the same way. As this goes on i like her more and more and i don't know what to do. I don't have hopes of getting this girl but whenever she tells me she is sad it breaks me a little. I always try my best to make her see the bright side of things and not to give up on things, to just push forward. I think about her way too often, about what can i say to her, what silly jokes i can come up with to try making her laugh... I think we became some sorta of emotional safety nets for each other, whenever one feels sad the other tries consolating them. But i know she doesn't have the same type of feelings for me. In fact even if she didn't like this other guy it wouldn't change anything in the end. There are way too many ""ifs"" in this story.... We could only be together IF she could like me back, IF she lived in a country where i could speak the language (i only speak english and my native language), IF she lived in a country in a better economic position (her country is safer than mine but is in a worse economical situation), IF i could somehow get into said country somehow, for instance by getting a scholarship at uni or something else,... I don't even know why i waste my time thinking about this, fantasizing about things that can never be, i just can't avoid it.

I think i even started loving her, I ""think"" because i've never loved someone before. I believe in this because right now I don't even care anymore if we can be together or not I just want her to be happy somehow, i really want this but there is nothing i can do about it and this frustrates me a lot. This situation is so pathetic because how the fuck could i start feeling this way in a span of 3 months for a girl i've never met face to face? Fucking inconceivable, really! Why the fuck she matters so much to me? At this point I really do think this girl is my soulmate and that i will never find anyone like her again. I think I must be going insane.... I'm glad i'm too rational to fall into limerence or i would have already move to her country on a whim just to be able to meet her.

The icing on the cake is that I know for a fact that my life wasn't terrible. That i had many opportunities that my lethargy made me waste. I'm a fucking ridiculous manchild on my 20s. Which rights do i have to be feeling so ""wronged by the world""!? None! I have always led a privileged life, not luxurious, but money was never a problem, i have never had to worry about my next meal. Never had any big health issues. Only lost relatives when i was already a grown up and had a better understanding of life.
Knowing all this makes me hate myself even more. Knowing that there are people out there that didn't have the opportunities i had and that they could've done a lot with them. Fuck, i'm so fucking useless.

Even so.. even so.... it's hard living knowing that you are your own worst enemy.... I can't avoid feeling that i want to disappear. I feel like i'll have a mental breakdown any of these days. 

If you read the whole thing, i feel obliged to thank you and to say i'm sorry for making you waste your time on such a stupid story.

Admin, Network Engineer, College Grad moving to Colorado.",[deleted],denverjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverjobs/comments/303ro3/for_hire_sys_admin_network_engineer_college_grad/,"Hi! I will be graduating from Ball State University in May with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Technology and Business Admin. I specialize in System Administration and networking. My fiancé and I are moving to Colorado this summer to reconnect with family in the Denver area. 

I have just completed an internship as an Engineer for Alliant Technologies where I had a large role in developing the baggage handling system for the Philadelphia International Airport. Being involved in such a large project further developed my Systems Engineering, IT Networking, Systems Administration, and Disaster Recovery skills while working in a fast-paced, deadline driven environment.

I am currently working for the College of Applied Sciences and Technology at Ball State University as a Teaching Assistant aiding a professor with multiple sclerosis. This humbling experience has given me the opportunity to manage a large workgroup of computers, while also giving exceptional facilitating technical support.

I am looking forward to being a part of Colorado and chance to speak to you guys! Thanks!"
303via,1,2015-03-24,Conflict with parents. Just need some input on how to handle it.,LordLundo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/303via/conflict_with_parents_just_need_some_input_on_how/,"So I'm 18, took off college for a year just for break from school. As of right now I have an internship for a great Biotech company. 
But Ive had depression for about 3 years now. At some points it gets fairly bad. But the thing is my parents don't really understand it and take it into consideration of what it's like and how it feels. They pretty much think I should just snap out of it and get along with my with my life. They don't like that I took off school for the year, I do intend starting up this year.
The big thing is that about 5 months ago I got into some legal trouble (MIC) by the way I do not drink anymore and have been sober since. So not a problem anymore. But I have been grounded since then. Which means I can't hangout with friends or go out at all pretty much. So really no social life.
And a month ago I told them I smoke (Weed btw, also do not use before I go to work), I told them because I felt bad about it doing it behind there back and to have a good relationship. The thing is that it helps me alot. Helps me get through the rest day and motivates me do things I usually don't do, while also keeping me happy and in a good mood. And helps me go to sleep, as going to sleep is very hard for me.
After I told them they were pretty mad about it and now I think I'm a drug addict and ruining my life.
So as of now I can't smoke because of frequent drug tests. And now I'm in slump without any motivation with my life.
Ive told them all the benefits of it and how it's not hurting me or effecting our family in a negative way.
So I was just wondering what you guys think of it and what I should do about the situation. Welcome to all questions or answers.

303vvj,0,2015-03-24,A review of my experience at ERAU-Prescott. (Full review and happy to answer questions),Matayoman,erau,https://www.reddit.com/r/erau/comments/303vvj/a_review_of_my_experience_at_erauprescott_full/,"Hello reddit,
I have not posted to this site and felt that I needed to speak about my experience at ERAU Prescott. So pardon me if I don’t follow proper reddit etiquette in my post.

I attended college at another University with the dream of attending Embry-Riddle to study my favorite field, Astronautical Engineering. I worked hard at my scholastic and earned a 3.5 cumulative GPA before I transferred. On my first day of touring ERAU I asked one of the students what is the one biggest complaint about ERAU, ""If you need any help, or any support, ERAU is not the type of school to help its students."" ~I wish I would have headed these words.

--- I am studying Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and taking software courses on the side for my own benefit.
After applying I received my acceptance letter several days after, and soon after that first year of classes. It was a new experience getting away from home and working on school, but I noticed immediately that the Universities standards for education were significantly lacking. 

(Science) The sciences and math departments are in absolute decay and need a complete revamp. No other University I have attended since has had such a distorted vision of math and sciences and it shows in the students understanding of true physical systems. It is godawful, you don't have a lab in physics until the end of your sophomore year when you are done with the physics series. The Chemistry class is a joke and the university knows it. There is no chem majors so the class is at the absolute bottom of the totem pole and in turn the professors offer no cares nor concerns in the conduct of the class.

(Math) The math department features no support structure nor any decent professors to cover the importance of mathematics in your 'engineering' education. Every university that I have compared against ERAU has a larger basis on application based mathematics while ERAU only covers a total of five mathematics courses for engineering majors. So the four general education math courses that everyone has to take, your standard calcs1-3 + diff-eq's, then all engineering majors take a generalized MA-441 'math for engineers' which is taken by not only the engineers but the math majors and physics majors. Just a terrible department with zero support for the students within it.

(Engineering) The Engineering departments are a little more organized and well maintained in comparison to anything else at ERAU. First off, the professors in the engineering courses are pretty good, and are usually passionate about the material. Now when I say pretty good, I am talking community college level good. So you have a very good chance of hitting bad professors at ERAU. If you hear a mention that a professor is not good then don’t even risk it and take the better professor no matter the inconvenience. Why engineering is more organized, because half of the students are there for engineering and they use the Daytona framework for the engineering program. At Prescott you are getting the cut rate educational quality of the Daytona campus unfortunately, why? Because Daytona is the bigger campus and serves a larger crowd, it has its lemon professors and its gold, but overall Daytona offers the students a choice with professors. ERAU-Prescott offers you minimal choices when it comes to any options with your degree. But luckily for the engineers, they are still the largest degree programs on campus.

(Software) Amazing department, and amazing professors with perfect learning outcomes. I have only taken several of the courses from the department to be aligned for a software minor, but everything here has been very well organized and it shows in the classroom.

(Electrical Engineering) This department actually has its act together more than any other degree on campus. Seriously though, I have not had an EE course with a notable lemon or bad professor. Yes some of the classes are difficult, and sometime unnecessarily difficult, but overall the best department on campus. Why is this, because for whatever reason the professors teaching EE are never disgruntled, none of them have a language barrier, all of them are suffering the case of being ‘overly happy’ about everything all the time. The downside, none of the classes are secure in the grading, every class has a curve and it is absolutely terrifying. Just ask how the average curve is in the EE department, its pretty scary, like you scored a 58% on that last exam…and got an A because the class average was a 35% scary. You will learn more from this department than any other department. {I’m not trying to convert you to an EE, just good department}
(Aerospace Engineering) Okay, the redeeming fact of the university, the Aerospace Engineering. Voted best in the nation, from one source, that everyone raves about, yet ask your future employer's HR department and they will be happy to explain to you it doesn't matter. Seriously though, every internship while in school, and every job I have had since usually starts with the employer mentioning that ERAU students are in fact not the best hires. Talk about a shitty feeling from day one. But by the end of each of my jobs, my employers have always told me “whew, you were the best Embry we’ve hired”
Now this may sound like a shit show when you compare it, but here are some of the redeeming factors about ERAU Prescott.

(The Good)  In my time attending ERAU Prescott I have procured countless hundreds of thousands for programs on campus that promote engineering. Seriously, I got together with a group of friends and came up with a satellite idea, and after drafting up the design and pursuing funding we got sponsored by NASA and founded EAGESAT on campus to become the first Embry-Riddle Satellite in 2016. I assisted another friend pursuing a program to build the first Embry-Riddle experimental aircraft and he was successfully sponsored and that aircraft should be done around 2016. That’s the Eagle Aerosport aircraft, very cool and very clever by my friend. I have also chased a few other small projects that got funded and gave me the opportunity to work on some of the best engineering technologies in the field today.

(The Bad) Everything that was listed above, had zero support from the classes on campus, and every learning opportunity that was presented at ERAU Prescott was not offered in scholastic achievement. Every job offer, every internship, and every project I have worked on for profit was not taught to me in class. Everything that has made me the engineer I am today came from my own efforts beyond school. (So be sure to work your extracurricular while in college, they will teach you more than any class you take. Just chase an internship and always ask to take trainings and seminars, the more learning opportunities you expose yourself to the better. Also you are training to be an engineer, so communicate often, it is real important too. )

You may have noticed I mentioned lemons a few times, well this is the absolute worst case I have experienced. I had a course with a Dr. Hay****** on ERAU Prescott campus. He is well known for being a hard ass when it comes to his classes but he like my work and we got along often. After getting two B’s in classes with him, I took another required course with him my second semester. I ended up getting exposed to chemicals in a lab on campus and got rushed to the hospital and subsequently missed his exam II at the end of the semester. After being bed ridden for about a week I also fell far behind on all my school work and worked my hardest to catch up. Dr. Hay****** then arranged for me to not take the exam and clump my final exam grade to be very large. I had a B going into the last week of the semester, and he failed me after the final. Undenounced to me he had come under fire over the break regarding failing me, and then proceeded to make my life a living hell on campus that following semester with him. He then informed me that no matter how well I did on any assignment, exam or anything in that class he would fail me regardless of how much I study or pursue anything on campus. This then lead to terrible depression and suicidal actions later all because of this one shitty professor. But I am well beyond it now, years ahead of it. Honestly I should have reported that professor for his absolutely unprofessional actions, but it is in the past and more importantly (below).

(The Worst) Now that is not the bad part though, the bad part is that when I did reach out for help from ERAU I found that Riddle had absolutely no support structure for helping its students. When I attended any other University I could feel a presence on campus of accountability, and at ERAU you feel nothing accountable to the University. This question does not mean much to any student who doesn’t have any experience from another University, but honestly ERAU does not hold itself accountable with any actions of its own professors or students. Such as reporting the professor, reporting rape incidents, reporting bullying, and overall anything that you would expect a University to take seriously ERAU would rather brush it under the rug.
But in the end, if you are willing to pay for school, ERAU is happy to take your money and not represent you as a student.

(Overview) I would not value the education at ERAU anywhere near what they charge for the Prescott Campus if you are looking to pursue a degree in Aerospace Engineering, Mathematics, or Physics. I only gave one of my horror stories from Riddle but trust me this college hides everything terrible under the rug and asks you to politely ignore it. Now on the bright side, the Electrical Engineering program has some shining stars that make it stand out as a program to inspire.
(My Recommendation) Okay, so you want a degree from ERAU Prescott. I can understand that, It has a reputation in some good circles. First off, I would not recommend it for anything undergrad. But okay, you want it, here is what I must recommend, get the first three years done somewhere else. Seriously, a state school, a less expensive university, ideally a large university that offers your desired degree program. Make sure the credits will transfer when you need them, but don’t stress too much while you are there because ERAU won’t care what your GPA is from the last school. Then when you are on your final year apply to ERAU, they will be happy to accept you and take your money. Then you only need to take the final 30 credits at ERAU, and those final senior year credits are easy as hell. With a bit of effort you will then graduate from the ‘best Aerospace Engineering School in the Nation’ with a good GPA due to the courses being easy. Try to stay above a 3.3GPA, ideally above 3.5 and you will be golden. I have been here for three years now and have a 3.4 in EE and enjoy it, but looking to leave due to the poor infrastructure of the university. 

Whew, I have not posted to this site and felt that I needed to speak about my experience at ERAU Prescott. So pardon me if I don’t follow proper reddit etiquette in my post. I hope this helps some future students, I wish I followed this advice when it was given to me.

I want to work at a Big 4 after graduating, so I'm not too concerned about the return offer. 

**Company A**:

* Located near SF, ~200 employees, owned by IBM

* Based around a good core technical product, customers are IT/devs

* I would be working in R&amp;D directly under lead data scientist, who seemed to have an interest in my projects

* Interviews consisted of talking about my projects, or technical questions (only one relatively simple coding question)

* Lower pay, no housing/relocation

**Company B**

* HQ in Seattle, larger, older company (I can choose to work in SF or Seattle)

* Based around popular web/mobile consumer-facing products

* Can choose department/project after starting (opportunities in web, mobile, back-end, etc.)

* Standard ""Big 4"" style data structures/algorithms coding interviews

* Higher pay, subsidized housing

Based solely on the interviewers and quick tours of the offices, company B seemed to be a better culture fit for me. But really what I'm most concerned about is what will give me more useful skills and look better on my resume for that entry position (or possibly another internship) at a Big 4."
3046d2,1,2015-03-24,Me [26F] with my husband [26 M] problem with large income disparity,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3046d2/me_26f_with_my_husband_26_m_problem_with_large/,"Together 10 years, married 1 year.

He currently makes 110k base salary in a corporate job and has been getting raises/promotions since he started working (4 years ago). I couldn’t find work after I graduated, so I changed direction and got a master’s degree. I finished my master’s degree recently and I have been working in an hourly paid internship that has career opportunities in the public sector. I make about 25k. 

We have our own home (my parents gave us an interest free loan for a down payment). Aside from our mortgage and paying back my parents we do not have any other debt. He has another property that he uses as an investment/rental income. It has just kicked off, so we haven’t seen any return on it and we probably won’t for 5-10 years. 

Combined, we make decent money. We enjoy ourselves. We travel from time to time, we go to nice restaurants. I don’t have any expensive habits or hobbies. He has expensive hobbies that requires expensive equipment. 

We are by no means “strapped” for cash, but sometimes it feels like it. I am future oriented so I think about upcoming expenses. I want to pay off our mortgage early, I want to pay my parents off as soon as possible, we are both due for new cars, we are also saving for a month long trip all over Europe at the end of this year. 

Recently he has been sharing his concerns about my career choices and about how little I contribute financially. He tries to dissuade me from going in the public sector because he claims that even when I do get the fulltime position I will only be starting at 45-50K and I will always have a salary cap and a ton of bureaucracy to deal with, whereas he is in a lucrative field with competitive bonuses and has tons of perks. 
It started off harmless. I forgot his exact wording, but the message that I was left was that I am somewhat of a financial burden to him. For instance, when we travel, he needs to train his mind to double his budget/expenses because he has to pay for me too. We laughed about it. He was being tongue in cheek – my kind of humor. After a few discussions we agreed that we would allow myself 1 year to get a fulltime position at my current place of work before I start aggressively looking for a fulltime salaried position elsewhere – I don’t have to go into the private sector, but I have to explore different organizations and salaried positions only. As time went on, his condescension, superiority and possibly resentment have grown. Evidence:

•	He brags about the money he makes, perks of his job, or humblebrags about the nature of the job – to me, family, and friends

•	Spends exorbitantly on designer suits to fit in in his corporate job (I can understand this, but I think he has taken it too far) 

•	He is now talking to me with downright condescension about how people in the public sector are sometimes incompetent but can’t get fired because of bureaucracy/unions. (I told him about this, and it is true in my organization.) To be clear, he doesn’t think I’m incompetent, he thinks I’m too good to be wasted in the public sector. He thinks I’m extremely intelligent and capable, but I picked a wrong career field. 

•	He talks about how unskilled, simple, or his word “stupid” my job is. It is entry-level work, but I work in a dynamic place. I complain about work and but it’s in my field of study and I am trained and qualified to do my type of work. 

•	Talks about how he can’t understand why I am choosing to work in the public sector despite all the flaws the public sector has.

•	He talks about how I am unmotivated by money and that I do not care about being rich. I just care about being comfortable. Which is somewhat true. I know that we will always be comfortable, so I am not afraid of being poor, and I do not think that being rich is possible so I only aim to live comfortably, whereas he wants to be rich. Maybe he thought that I was going to be a higher earner because I have a master’s degree and I didn’t live up to his expectations.

•	Complains about how hard he has to work to buy ME a house, pay for my living expenses, and so on. 

•	When I tell him he needs to cut back on expensive hobbies/eating out, I feel like a controlling, “crazy/manipulative” wife because he earned the money, and he should be able to enjoy it. But I’m just telling him to cut back because I think he should. He always buys coffee at a café (even if we have coffee at home, coffee is free at the office) and eats out for lunch. Whereas I always bring coffee from home, or drink free coffee at work, I always have breakfast at home and bring leftovers for lunch. He spends A LOT more than me on personal expenses.  
I started off feeling really fucking shitty about what my career prospects will look like, then I started feeling ashamed for how little I made and worried that people may think of me as being spoiled by my husband because I get to travel, have my own home, and go to nice places on a meager salary, but now I’m feeling so tired of how poorly my husband thinks of me and I’m feeling very angry and disappointed in him for thinking of me as a dependent, a burden, and unsuccessful. And this issue and an issue that stems from me making so little money seems to come up so often. It seems like every time I talk about work, talk about money, or have a shitty day we argue about it and he ends up talking down to me.

What should I do?  What are your insights on this situation? How do I make a life circumstance not a shitty argument every time?

TL;DR: husband makes a lot more than me and is condescending about it. We can’t stop fighting about it or indirectly about it.

Comms Master J'koab felt a stirring uncertainty as he surveyed the grey octagonal room reptilian eyes searching for any hostiles or exits. Affirming that their were two probable exits in the form of shaded indentations He presumed to be doors, J'koab took command of the situation quickly.

""Avast Lads, Dump the wasted junk inta t' cocoon and light it up, for we dare not let these backwaters gain a'hold o' our tech.""

As J'koab's subordinates piled the ruined scanners and jammers into the drop cocoon, The communication master moved cautiously towards one of the  indents he took for a door.

As He came closer to a presumed door way and static erupted in his embedded earpiece before clarifying into strange yet understandable Thfagen.

""Ahem can you hear me? Ah yes I see you can, good. Then I would like to formally welcome to the first Annual Xeno-Challenge Games! Since you and your entire species seems so intent on kidnapping and ransoming citizens of the United Human Alliance and the Interstellar Neo-Human Collective we here at Nova-Australia Global Entertainment (N-AGE) have decided to return the favour by luring you into a maze trapped up to the wazoo and filled with creatures native to our beautiful home world."" 

J'koab tried to switch comm channels to reconnect to the other squads, but found that the blasted human was broadcasting on every frequency with sufficient strength to drown out any other signal.

"" But Let me assure you we have chosen to give you an incentive for competing in this game... A chance to both serve your empire and gain great personal wealth and glory, for should you win this competition you shall receive not only a ridiculous amount of standard galactic credits, but a brand new luxury star-ship built by Higgs-Starchmen the largest shipyard in the system."" 



""However you are not alone in this endeavor since a group of select other Xenos have elected to ""volunteer"" themselves into the competition alongside not the least of which include some competing Military forces and a dozen lucky civilian contestants.""

""If you would like to withdraw form this contest and return to your Empire in shame and defeat feel free to exit through the door now flashing a red Cross""

The door near J'koab started doing exactly that A bright red cross flashing once every second.

""Should you decide to rise to the challenge for the glory of your empire and not inconsiderable wealth Step through the door marked with a green circle"" 

As the disembodied voice finished saying this a floating green ""O"" began flashing in the remaining  aperture.

With only a brief hesitation J'koab quickly mustered his troops and led them away from the burning cocoon and through the Green door into the unknown and whatever these cowardly backwaters had prepared.

Lucien Vicoson disabled the communication device for the Thfagen troopers as they entered into the maze proper. From then on in prerecorded messages and intern would deal with the brunt of the commentary. he had a stricter duty of editing which shots and scenes went onto the highlight reels, and which were to graphic or viloent to make unrestricted broadcast. Couldn't have the children see dismemberment or sex on their hyperweb viewers now could we? He was just glad he didn't have to manipulate the maze anymore. It was going to be a pain for whoever had to make sure all the passages went to the best rooms and that the right groups of ""contestants"" would meet each at appropriately dramatic times.

304k8f,0,2015-03-24,How to select the most appropriate actuator?,IAMA_monkey,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/304k8f/how_to_select_the_most_appropriate_actuator/,"Dear all,

I'm currently doing an internship project this semester which is about the design augmentation of a cadaveric knee simulation system.

Our university is in possession of an Oxford rig. Currently, only quadriceps forces are being simulated dynamically (closed loop control system with a fixed force of the ankle on the ground, under a constant hip load and decreasing knee flexion angles, thus simulating a squat). The hamstrings are being actuated by constant load springs.

It is our task to incorporate dynamic hamstring actuation (open loop). We have to estimate a physiologically accurate force profile and implement the controls that are needed.

My question is now this: How do we choose the best actuator for the job? It goes without saying that we have to thoroughly explain why we choose a certain actuator. I've had all the classic engineering courses but no course on actuators. We cannot possible write a review of all available actuators can we?

What is a good starting point? How do you do this? All information is welcome! Be it just advice, or a guide/tutorial, a pdf of a helpful handbook...


Thanks in advance!

304n6s,7,2015-03-24,"Me [21 M] , girlfriend [21F] of 1.5years. I'm a workaholic, She has trouble seeing beyond herself.",deadmun72,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/304n6s/me_21_m_girlfriend_21f_of_15years_im_a_workaholic/," Background: We are separate years in an intensive, limited admitted major. Between classes, homework, and my job, I'm out of the house from 7 am to midnight every day of the week. I'm a workaholic with very limited relationship experience. She is taking 12 credit hours and has no job outside school. She'd say she is very mature for her age. 


We met at school a while back, same program, similar interests. She's two semesters behind me, due to scheduling conflicts. 

Started to hangout and watch movies and play games together, things. We decided to make it serious a few months later. Then, we were living in the dormitory's, same building, separate halls. Hanging out on the weekends was easy, sometimes got dinner during the week. 


Cut to this past year, She, a mutual friend(We'll call her RM) and I have rented a house to avoid uni housing fees. We all move in, get situated, and start to live with each other, differences and all. Except RM lives a little messier than GF, RM leaves dishes in the sink, and watches a lot of TV. I don't mind it, because I'm on campus 18 hours a day. It drives GF crazy, but she won't say anything about it, instead she comes to me and just berates RM. I understand roommates have their quarrels, but it has become a daily routine for me to come home and GF just vents about RM, attacks her lifestyle, personality, everything. Someone who was her friend has become a punching bag for GF. 


We are in a small, cultivated program, only 15-20 people are admitted to the major each year, so we spend a lot of time with the same people.


 GF's voracious put downs don't stop at RM, every time I sit down with her, she complains about her classmates, placing herself above everyone as the hardest worker. Humble bragging that she works long hours like I do, even though ""She doesn't have to because she's so good"". 


Over the past year I've had some good opportunities thanks to my efforts in school. I was brought onto a professor's personal project, met with some iconic people in my industry, and applied for internships at several industry companies, trying to get my name going to the right places. Each time I talk about a new application, she says ""Well, what am I supposed to do? I don't want to move there, it's too ____, the people are too ___"" I mention the accolades I have received from professors, and her return is ""That's shitty, they shouldn't pick favorites"" 


I was watching a new show on netflix on the couch when she came home one night, I thought it was funny. She asks ""What show is this?"", I say the title and she retorts, ""UGH. I can't believe you are watching this, it's a terrible show"". I calmly ask, what don't you like about it? I just started it"". She replies, ""I haven't seen it, it just looks bad"", and begins to try and remove my laptop from my person as to prevent me from watching it. 


Recently I've been feeling mildly depressed. Some older family members aren't doing well, and it's putting strain on my immediate family. I admit, I've been pushing into my school work harder and harder to deal with it. I'm not a talkative person, and sometimes need to just be alone and not talk. Last weekend we were hanging out and she just went off on me about how hard I've been working. I tried to explain how I've been feeling and that I just needed to sort it out in my head. She exploded saying ""that was the most selfish thing she'd ever heard, do you even think about what you're doing to me?"", and stormed off.  I expressed suicidal thoughts, and she brought the conversation back to her, explaining to me her ""history"" with depression, not even taking note of what I had just said. 


I'm really questioning my relationship. I have another year on this lease, but it's a house of negativity. I have no silence, right when I come in, I get negativity shot at me.  I don't feel that she actually cares about me and what I'm doing. For me, my career comes first, I know I work hard, but I come from the middle of nowhere and I'm getting into a rough industry. When I work hard, it's terrible, but when she does, it's necessary. 


I just don't know what to do. 

EDIT: Just the other night she came to me after having a day long panic attack, crying because of the stress. (A position mind you, I had come to her in not a week ago and was offered nothing but, ""You're so selfish""). I sat down with her and tried to console her.

After she asked, ""Do you think I can do this? (Referring to the major)"", I replied, ""You can, you can do anything you set your mind to, you are strong""

She replied, ""That's so generic! GOD!"". and turned away from me on the bed. I then got up to go put my books in a different room, and she scalded me again ""What, you're going to just walk away?!"" I put my books away and returned not 5 minutes later.

Why should I put effort into trying to help someone if they aren't going to take any encouragement that is ""Generic""? Am I supposed to find new wave encouragement?

I was able to make her laugh and cool her off before bed, which was nice. It was nice to laugh again, but it doesn't overshadow the huge storm cloud I feel over me.


   
**tl;dr**: I'm a workaholic in a relationship with a constant negativity fountain who brings every conversation back to how good she is, and how I'm an awful person for watching, eating, talking to ______"

The apps will be 100% open-source. We aim to help the global church to translate scripture for themselves, without always having to wait for missionaries.

We cover housing in Orlando for the five weeks, plus a small stipend to cover food expenses. The only cost to participants is getting to Orlando. It's a great opportunity to work in an Agile/Scrum environment, playing with the latest development techniques. We'll be targeting Android tablets but looking to create tools that are cross-platform to iOS, etc.

Please check out [http://www.5weeksofcode.org](http://www.5weeksofcode.org) and share it with anyone you know who would be interested in using their software skills to grow the Kingdom!

Warmly,

It's seems like there's so much to learn, from API's to IDES to databases etc. Coming from someone that's only taken a class in data structures and a class on basic programming, this is pretty overwhelming. What I want to ask is if I want to get into the software engineering/IT field, what's the core concepts I should really focus on? I know knowledge about OOP is important, and I've heard the data structures class I've taken is great prep for interviews, but is there anything else I should look into?

3053uy,1,2015-03-24,Who Created Your Email Strategy? It’s Time To Own It,Madrivo,Emailmarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emailmarketing/comments/3053uy/who_created_your_email_strategy_its_time_to_own_it/,"“Who created your email strategy?” is an interesting question.

I’ve worked with a lot of organizations that have been sending email marketing campaigns for a very long time (10+ years), but no one has ever really stepped back and asked themselves why they are sending certain types of email, nor have they ever re-evaluated their overall strategy.

Organizations are so caught up in the minute detail of email marketing, such as creating hyper-targeted segments, super-responsive designs, sophisticated deliverability tactics, etc.

While these things are all important, there should be an overarching strategy that guides your program.

Quite often, I find that companies have no real strategy in place. The email contact plan was created by an intern in 2006 and hasn’t changed since. There also always seems to be a director with no knowledge of email marketing who needs to send an irrelevant campaign to everyone ASAP.

Does this sound at all familiar? If so, it’s time to fight back and own your email strategy!

4 Steps To Owning Your Email Strategy
1. Create A Mission Statement For Your Email Program — I haven’t met many marketers who have done this, but I really like the idea of creating a mission statement which outlines the core purpose of email marketing for your organization.

Whether it’s to generate revenue, nurture leads or collect donations and renewals, it should be very clear in your head — and everyone else’s — what your mission is.

2. Set Yourself Some SMART Objectives And Track Them – I’m sure that many of you know what SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely, but how many of you truly have set SMART objectives?

Make sure that your objectives are aligned with your overall mission and what you ultimately want your subscribers to do, and ensure you’ve set up ways to track performance against these objectives.

All too often I meet email marketers who are too focused on tracking and improving email-related metrics, such as opens and clicks, that they forget about the metrics which actually matter to their business – conversions, average order value (AOV), total sales and leads generated.

3. Develop A Comprehensive Contact Plan – A contact plan is a hugely useful way of mapping out the sequential order of the emails that you want to send, your segmentation and frequency.

Think of it as the who, what and where of your email strategy. It’s important to ask yourself and your wider marketing team why you send certain types of email and to think critically about what actually provides value for your subscribers during this process. Obviously you should seriously consider removing anything superfluous.

I personally find it easiest to map out this type of plan visually on a whiteboard first. Start at the very beginning of your funnel and keep in mind that you may have several different funnels for different types of customers or products, so make sure that you clearly define who you’re creating this contact plan for.

Depending on your business model you might begin with lead nurture emails or, if you’re a B2C company, a welcome program. The idea is to map out the sequential order of emails in your current program and then expand and improve from there.

whiteboard

4. Present Your New Strategy And Get Buy-In – As I alluded to earlier, you should have included your wider marketing team and any other key stake-holders in this process as this is going to make things much easier when it comes to getting internal buy-in from management and other people within your organization.

I suggest that you initially hold an educational training session on basic email marketing best practices and concepts for any internal stake-holders or managers who aren’t familiar.

I often find that these are the people that request irrelevant, untimely campaigns to be sent at a short notice. So giving them that knowledge is super important for getting them on-board with your new strategy.

You should now be ready to present your overall contact plan to the entire business. Be sure to clearly outline to everyone your new Mission Statement, your objectives and how the new contact plan is going to help you get there.

I know that this probably sounds like a lot of work on top of what you are already doing! And to be honest, it should take you a good chunk of time to complete this. However, I think it’s an important process to go through if you really want to improve your email marketing.

It’s easy to sit back and go with the status quo, but it’s much more rewarding to go back to the drawing board and own your email strategy."

A bit of background on myself - I'm a sophomore in the middle of my second internship. In this internship and the previous one, I've done full stack web development.

Front-end, backend with server side javascript, Spring, some database work, and in my spare time I've done some Android programming.

Basically, I've touched a lot of different areas in the programming world. Now, for my next internships I want to get a nice job in the Valley with a good company.

My question is, should I specialize and go really deep in one area, or just try and do everything like I am right now? 

Based on what I've done so far, I've liked web development more than mobile, but web development by itself is such a wide field that I don't know what to try and work on in my spare time to increase my employability.

What are your thoughts?"

I am a senior in high school, going off to college in the fall. My parents are divorced. Every summer, I go to visit my Mom and friends across the country. This will be the last summer before I go off to college, so I want to see my friends as much as possible. This summer, I would only be able to go during July and early August before I move into the dorms at my college. My Mom will be busy throughout June and I wouldn't be able to go.  

Here is the issue, I found an internship that is in my career field. Not just in my career field, but **EXACTLY** what I want to do. This internship is a month long, and occurs through the whole month of July. It would cut out a month of my potential time with my Mom and my friends if I get it.  

I would love to go, but it would give me a week and a half at best to see everyone. The chances I would get to see them all are low, and I won't be able to go see them for another year at the earliest, probably not until I get my Bachelors done.

Now I'm wondering if the current situation I'm in is good, or if I need to dodge bullet #2. 

I interviewed with officeteam yesterday for the position of Recruiter/HR Coordinator for a ""tech company"" (that's all they would say, said for confidentiality reasons I couldn't know the name.) They told me the pay is $31,000-$35,000 and its a 90 day temp position that goes to permanent afterwards. I know the pay isn't out of this world but I talked to my parents and I can live with them rent free as long as I want; I just have to pay my bills/food myself. 

So you know about me I have a 3.84 GPA for my Bachelors of Science: Psychology - I have worked two summer human resources internships at a company with 2,000 employees. The first summer I learned all the various aspects of HR and the second I mainly focused on full life cycle recruiting for the company. 

Does this all sound like something I should be excited for or keep looking, and does anyone know anything about officeteam? I did my research on them and their parent company Robert Half - I've seen two extremes. People either love them or hate them. I told them during the interview that I wasn't interested in contract work or temp only positions and they seemed fine with it.

The only thing fishy to me was they talked about the company in vague terms and made me fill out my I-9 and W4 when I walked in, is that normal? 

Thanks!

Side note: I've applied to roughly 100 jobs and I've only had about three interviews - my resume is fine and everything - is the market just this shitty for college graduates? "

I worked at an internship at freescale where I was making $25/hour but it doesnt seem like they will offer me mainly because they are looking for electrical engineers. 

I was looking for some advice if I should continue the interview process with this company even though they are a low offer. The manager did say there was room to grow immediately with the company, but still. I do graduate in May and wanted to start working pretty soon after graduation and I know its getting pretty close.

I worked over this past summer as an intern in the US at a tech company and was paid pretty well. Prior to that in the Spring I worked at a Canadian tech company as well.

Now it's tax season, and I'm about to go to H&amp;R Block to file them, but I want to know what I'm in for. In the US about 30% of every pay check went to taxes, and a similar amount for the Canadian company. I'm also a student.

Am I likely to get a tax refund? I'm 22 and still a student at university, and these were internships as part of my program, and I paid quite a lot in taxes every pay check. I'm worried that I made too much that I won't get anything back, I'm kind of new to all this tax information, especially for having worked in the US.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?"

I also fell in love with the startup company environment during my in-person interview. Also I am a contracted employee right now so on my offer letter I have the option to leave anytime and the company has the option to drop me anytime as well.

Here are some pros and cons. I guess I'll start with the startup. 
Pros: company culture, great team, appeals to my interests. 
Cons: pays a little bit less, the commute is significantly longer than my commute now. 

And now for the tech giant company. 
Pros: Closer to home, will look great on resume, pays more
Cons: It doesn't appeal to my interests as much, company culture is meh
So Reddit, what are your thoughts? 

EDIT: Some more info. The startup internship doesn't begin until the summer. I am planning to work at my current company until then before quitting."
305xpw,1,2015-03-24,I [19/F] need help dealing with breakup (?) with boyfriend [20/M],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/305xpw/i_19f_need_help_dealing_with_breakup_with/,"Hello Reddit. This is going to be a long one, so bear with me.

So, I met this guy in a class at school, we started off as FWB since we were both fresh out of relationships and weren't ready for a new one. Well, we proceed along, everything was wonderful. He's my best friend, we support each other in everything and we have a lot of fun together.
Eventually, my feelings for him deepen, I tell him I want a relationship, he tells me he isn't ready. The next day, he gets super drunk and confesses his love for me. This was hard to deal with, I brought it up to him later, we discussed it, and moved on with our FWB relationship. We started saying ""I love you"" to each other, and there was a deep connection between us. Eventually, he tells me he does want a relationship with me, but he wants to wait until after summer break. Ok, I agree.
Come summer, I get bored at home. I don't have a lot of friends at home, I have a bad living situation with my parents. I became a little over bearing, and he was very patient with me. We start our relationship during the summer, while we were away, first bad choice made. I held resentment over him for hooking up with other people, while he was telling me he loved me. But I do realize now that it was the dynamic of our relationship at the time. It was hard, but I knew what I was getting myself into. Eventually, I got over those bad feelings towards him.
At this point, it was too late. We had too many arguments that should have been handled better. He is more experienced than I am in this field. I've never really been in love before, and I haven't had many relationships before this. I understand my mistakes now, but by the time I went to try and fix them, it became his turn to hold resentment over me and start his own slew of stupid arguments.
Now, I've left school for an internship, and he doesn't want to continue the relationship. I've been trying to make things work, and I've been a lot better in my arguments. Honestly, I can see myself marrying this man. Before all of the bullshit that happened, he was (and still is) my best friend. He knows me better than anyone else, he has always been a great support, and we got along very well. We have similar goals in life and have similar lifestyles and wants for the future. I never really believed in love and soul mates and all that, and I'm not necessarily saying that he is my one true love or anything, but I just want a second shot at this to do it right.
Right now, he's said that he doesn't want to continue the relationship, and we can try again when I get back, which will be four months from now. I am ok with this, my main issue is just about him hooking up with other people in the meantime. I'm trying not to be selfish, but is it really not fair of me to ask him for some sort of commitment? I don't necessarily care about the labels right now, I just want to take a break from the stress that our relationship was. I want to rebuild our friendship, and try again when I get back. I want to start it off on the right foot, and if it doesn't work out in the end after that, then it doesn't. But at least I'll know that it wasn't from stupid arguing that needs to be worked out. We used to be very communicative and open with each other, and that's all I need at this point.
I told him all of this, and he still seems to be angry towards me. I did ask him for the commitment, he said he'll think about it, but he doesn't think it's fair of me to ask. And I do understand where he's coming from, but from my side of things, when he told me he didn't want to keep the relationship while I'm gone, he told me he could promise to not do anything with anyone else, and we could try again when I'm back. I don't know, I just think I'm rambling at this point. I don't know if I'm necessarily asking for advice, or just someone to talk to. I guess, if anyone has been in a similar situation, it would be great to hear your side of things. Or if anyone just wants to lend an ear for me to vent to, that would be great. I know things will work out for what's best, but I just know that this relationship could have been handled in a better way, and I want to try it again, and in the right way, before giving up on it completely.

TL;DR
Met a boy, everything was great, started relationship off on wrong foot, everything went downhill, I'm going away for four months, he doesn't want to continue until after I'm back, maybe, help."
3062qq,42,2015-03-24,Years in the Making,ArguablyCivilServant,talesfromtheoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/3062qq/years_in_the_making/,"I've been working for this government now for a few years. Started as an intern, and before that a campaigner on the trail of a candidate or two. That was back in highschool. I was still somewhat hopeful, and in turn interested in politics. However interesting my life was back then, I consider the more recent years to be some of the more... humorous ones, to say the least. 

The life of a civil servant isn't easy. It's filled with trials and tribulations; a constituent is stuck in a life-threatening bureaucratic paper loop, or a local's Social Services paperwork didn't go through and now they might be stripped of their medication, and a local charity stopped half-way through paying some guy's bills and now he needs help before he becomes homeless. It's our job to help those kinds of people.

So I imagined, three years ago when I signed my name on a slip of creamy light-khaki colored paper that told me to swear to protect and preserve the Constitution of this state. So I have experienced, anyway, once or twice. Although we don't really get that many cases in my office specifically, we do get them once in a blue moon. The time in between those long, dreary, weeks-long stints of boredom and hypocritical ""civil service"" is spent doing other things. Reddit is popular between my coworker and I, while my Chief of Staff attempts to fix the world and doesn't let us help. He's got a great work ethic, but sometimes it isolates him. 

The office itself is sort of an indicator of our productive output to society. The white-washed walls, now slightly darker due to a rooftop heater expelling black snowflakes of carbon everywhere, smearing black streaks and cracks throughout, encase a small area of roughly 30 square feet. A long, black, rubberized carpet leads from the doorway to the front divider, behind which sits my fellow Redditor. The carpet was supposed to keep the floor generally clean from the assaults of salt and gravel used by the highway department outside. Success has been varied. People rarely come in to warrant having it in the first place. Fluorescent lights indiscriminately illuminate the room, throwing harsh white light over files which haven't moved in an unknown amount of time.  

A single, long, equally as bland corridor stretches the length of the office. The first door, encountered immediately as you begin the trek to the back room, is *the* office. His office. My boss' office. It's small, relatively speaking. Elected officials usually have more spacious rooms, fitted out in all the decorations and rights of splendor which would present an air of authority and governing tradition to those who enter. This all is enforced by the fact that the couch, angled to face the door, forces you by the way it's positioned to awkwardly angle your head towards a large desk, pitted against the opposite wall and arguably taking up the other half of the already claustrophobic room. That's *His* desk. So it says in the paperwork, anyway. The last time he used it was... I can't even remember. I've used it more times than he has. It's great for napping in. A single, lonely portrait of JFK lingers near the corner of it, by the wall. It has the most melancholy expression

Further down, by about three feet, is another door on the left. The conference room. It's just a conference room. Lit by the same fluorescent lights, stuffing the room with an awkward, immature lighting which reduces any meeting to an almost impolite silence with their intensity. The large, needlessly expensive granite long table is encircled by a number of executive chairs. Each is identical, with the same ass imprint engraved into the depressed seating foam as the one next to it. 

At the end of the hall is a single store room. We technically don't own it. It's donated by the owner of the building. Because of this loophole, we keep all of our election material in there. Legal, but sketchy. The weird-smelling microwave, decrepit minifridge, and pile of assorted plastic silverware is also in there as well. The cleaning crew somehow managed to make that room spotless, while the rest of the office walls are stained black from the soot. 

And this is the place I work. Five days a week, and now four because of my college classes, I've been coming here for between 3 to four hours a day. I've done this now for three years, and I've grown to appreciate the finer things of government work. I've helped with presidential elections, congressional runs, county legislature campaigns, and State Legislature bids, but nothing prepared me for the irony that is the hypocritical work I don't do on a daily basis. I'll post more, but for those wondering- I'll be chronicling the hypocrisy of my State Legislature office through this account. I've had an itch to begin writing them since last year, and since I'm leaving in five months due to transferring to a four-year university from the one I'm currently in, I think now's a good time. These are the tales from my office.

Currently, I am a 0L faced with a seriously first world problem dilemma (I recognize that it comes off as ""boohoo, woe is me""), but it is causing me a lot of stress all the same. The problem: Columbia with minimal scholarship money/financial aid vs. NYU with a named, significant-amount-of-tuition-paid scholarship.

In person, most people tell me that I really can't go wrong with either and that it doesn't matter which one I end up choosing. However, online (sites like Above the Law, Top Law Schools, comments on various articles regarding law schools, and a couple comments here on the subreddit), people have much more opinionated responses. Some people say that Columbia is definitively better all around (by academia and by pure reputation) unless you want to do PI, in which case NYU is better. Other people say that Columbia's culture sucks compared to NYU. Many comments point out that being middle of the pack at a more prestigious school is worse off than having a named scholarship at a slightly/significantly less prestigious school, whereas others say that this is not the case. As far as job placement goes, NYU advertises a fantastic public interest network and range of opportunities, but I've read several comments that these are inflated and general numbers because many people 1) end up working in PI positions for NYU or 2) end up working an unpaid PI position.

I am open to both PI or corporate/business law. I lean more towards PI, but honestly, I simply enjoy legal practice (or at least, what I have experienced/seen during internships).

So...what's in a name? Is Columbia's prestige even remotely better for getting a job or at least getting a foot in the door than a named scholarship from NYU? I've heard a couple offhand comments that Columbia is slightly better because firms like having that prestige name thing on their lists and for their own reputation (which seems silly to me, but if it's true, then it's true). Is it so minimal that it doesn't even matter? There's the ""correct"" answer, but do YOU think employers (in general, not specifically PI or corporate) see one name as jumping out more than the other?

Thanks for listening to my insignificant problems."

306hjq,3,2015-03-24,Personal Vehicle Taxes That I Didn't Know Existed Are Now In Collections,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/306hjq/personal_vehicle_taxes_that_i_didnt_know_existed/,"To start, I live in VA. I bought a car when I was an intern in summer 2013 and registered it to the place where I lived (my dad's friend's house). After graduation, I moved (August 1, 2014) to a new county in VA. Evidently, this coincides with when county 1 sends out personal property taxes. When I moved, I reregistered my car and paid personal property taxes to county 2 (I now believe these were prorated, but I had no knowledge of this at the time). Never received any bill from county 1, had no knowledge that I owed the county money. Evidently I was supposed to notify the county tax office that I was moving, but why the fuck would I know that?

Fast forward to last week, my dad's friend that I lived with texts me  ""hey you got a letter from county 1 that you have an unpaid vehicle tax outstanding, i haven't seen any other bills or anything though"". I think ok great, I'll look into it next week, and put it on my calendar to today.

I log onto their website at 4:28, fill out their form saying that I moved, and go to ""pay bill"". I don't care if I'm being over-charged or whatever, I've got a good fund of emergency cash and just want to not have to worry about it.

""YOUR ACCOUNT IS NOW WITH OUR COLLECTIONS AGENCY. PLEASE CALL THEM AT 24249429329""

Fuck.

The tax office is closed, so I call the collections people, who inform me that I owe ~$700 dollars. I can pay this, but I'm more upset by the fact that I now will have an unpaid collection on my credit reports. I tell them I'll pay it tomorrow, but I want to talk to the tax people beforehand.

I don't care how much money I have to spend (within reason), I just want this to not be killing my credit for the next seven fucking years. I had no idea this debt existed, never received anything letting me know, don't live there and haven't lived there in half a year, and paid taxes where I do live now, thinking that was all that was needed. What steps should I be taking to keep this from killing my credit history?

Any help is much appreciated."
306iv2,1,2015-03-24,Advice on offer from startup as first job out of college,[deleted],startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/306iv2/advice_on_offer_from_startup_as_first_job_out_of/,"Hey guys,

I've recently been extended an offer from a startup that I've been working at during my final semester of college. I'm a computer science student and have had 3 previous internships + a few projects. I already accepted an offer last fall from a known company in Mountain View, California (not Google) that has great salary and benefits so i'm really torn with this decision. Everyone in this subreddit seems to have a lot of experience with startups, and I was looking to get some advice on my situation.

This startup is currently a part of an accelerator in the city I go to school in, and is doing really well. The business is in the e-commerce space with a subscription based model (think birchbox, dollar shave club, etc.). It just started about a year ago and has seen consistent 20% growth in subscribers each month. The two co-founders have previous experience as early employees at startups and are extremely knowledgeable about what they do (both went to top ivy league schools and are really smart + personable and outgoing). They use best practices as far as I can tell and everything is going smoothly. They've recently closed a seed round around 600k and already have over a million going towards series A which is on track to happen this year. I've already learned a lot from the CTO and would look at him sort of as a close mentor already. I would be employee #2 other than the co-founders and would be the 1st developer other than the CTO. They've offered me 75k salary along with 1.75% equity.

Basically I'm just not totally sure how to evaluate the offer since I'm not super familiar with the startup space. I'm also worried about taking a job at a startup as my first job right out of college. Another thing i'm worried about is that I wouldn't be going to California right away (i'm from the Midwest) which is somewhere I've always wanted to go. On the other hand though, California isn't going anywhere and I could always go there in the future. There are just so many factors to consider that it's difficult for me to evaluate things. Most relavent to this sub though is the startup's offer. Does the salary + equity look reasonable? Should I counteroffer? What would you do as someone about to graduate with these different possible paths? I know ultimately this is my personal decision, but I thought I would start a discussion and get some others' thoughts."
306kbg,3,2015-03-24,Career / guidance for a 12 year old!,rm-ca,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/306kbg/career_guidance_for_a_12_year_old/,"My 12 year old son has always been deeply interested in high tech stuff. As young as 3, he would be on the computer trying to fiddle with things. Never was too much into video games (at least we didn't give him the opportunity).

 I want to make sure that I give him the right opportunities to develop his talent and lack of which shouldn't be the reason he doesn't fulfill his potential.

**Background:**
 For his 7th bday he wanted an android phone (which was about the time Android was taking off). I got him a phone (no SIM,) and he meddled with it, figured out a lot of system level stuff. Last year he got a raspberry pi for xmas and has been tinkering with it. He got books from library, taught himself Python and generated some good programs. He also took an online course, downloaded the iOS SDK and followed a tutorial and created an app. Last summer his project was to build a PC (of course with my help). He did the research, online search for the best price and he built it and worked flawlessly the first time! Last week, he decided to learn Java, got a Java for Dummies book from the library, downloaded the development suite and is teaching himself Java. His favorite website is CNET. Watches all the videos and reads all reviews.


What I am trying to portray is that he has a lot of interest and is tenacious enough to figure out issues and follow up. I help him as much as I can. I am an electrical engineer with just enough software experience to help him. However, he is now getting to the level where it is not very easy for me to figure out the complicated issues. I don't want him to get discouraged and give up.


I live in the silicon valley (bay area CA) so there isn't a better place to be for this kind of stuff. However I am not quite sure how to nurture his talent. We enrolled him in a couple of software classes last summer but that just turned out to be video game programming. Not really anything really useful in the long run.


**Actual Question:**
Do you have any specific suggestions? Do companies give internship to 12 year olds? Are there specific software classes that are structured that he can take as he goes along?

**Disclaimer:**  :) 
BTW he is not a just a geeky kid. He is very social, plays basketball really well (in the YMCA league), does well in school and has a lot of friends. He reads and lot and also does other outdoor activity.


thanks..

I accepted an internship offer a few weeks ago. I kept applying to a couple of places as the company was not ideal in terms of area I'd like to work in/pay+lack of housing/location. It didn't go anywhere until I got an e-mail a few days ago regarding a position I had applied back in early December. This opportunity aligns much more closely to my interests, pay, and location.

I have a phone interview tomorrow, and I was wondering how to best approach letting them know I have an offer. Obviously I'm not gonna let em know I already accepted an offer, but I figured I could say: I have an offer on the table and need to accept by x, can you give an answer by then? 

What should x be? Should it be short to pressure them into giving me a quicker answer? Should it be long? Or will saying I have an offer drive them away and not want to bother continuing with my application?

I ask these questions because in the past, interviewers have asked me if I had any offers and deadlines they had to consider. I figured it's normal protocol to ask but I think my situation is a little different. Secondly if I were to secure this position, I'd like to let the first company know as soon as possible to not waste any more of their time, fees on background check, drug-test, etc.

306tst,1,2015-03-24,Removing myself out of my families life,abishop,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/306tst/removing_myself_out_of_my_families_life/,"This is going to probably be a bit of a long post. 

I am 21 years old. I was born in Korea and adopted when I was 3 months old. Ive grown up my whole life here in the States. I have been the only Korean let alone the only Asian person in my city. I was very depressed during high school from growing up in a very predominate white area. I was confused about myself, my culture, and who I was. If you arn't adopted then you wouldn't know what it feels like to be exiled and questioned relentlessly on why you're Asian, why you have white parents, why you have a white name, why dont you speak ""Chinese"". 
Getting berated with these questions while growing up adds up. Not only from children, but from adults as well. I tried killing myself when I was in 10th grade, but resulted in just injurying myself greatly. My parents have been supportive of me but I always felt like they regretted adopting me. It wasnt until Senior year of high school that I started to want to learn more about where I came from. What was Korea like, and why am I still here in the States. I started to become more and more interested in the Korean culture than the American culture that I was taught growing up. 

After Freshman year of college, I deiced I wanted to go back to Korea. I went with my best friend from high school and we stayed 2 weeks in Seoul. I was an amazing experience and for once in my life. I felt like I fit it. I wasn't questioned or stared at in public. I was with people of my own race. And it felt as if I should have never been adopted. 

Fast forward a year, and I wanted to go back. I applied for study abroad in Korea at Yonsei University and was accepted for the fall of 2014. During my time. I can confidently say that this was the best 5 months of my life. Not only did it boost my confidence, I didnt feel depressed, I didnt feel like I was an outsider. I was also seen as an attractive person in Korea, where in Western culture, I am seen as unattractive because of the social stigma that Asian men are weak and frail. 

Im currently on an internship working as an assistant admin and living at home since I found a place where I can commute a 10 minute drive to work everyday.

&lt;-------Skip to here if you dont want the background story---&gt;

I planned a trip back to Korea using the money from working at this internship to spend the summer in Korea. I would return a week before classes start up again. A few hours ago my parents sat me down, and told me that I was a drain on them financially and that what I am doing with my money isnt wise and that I should use it to pay off my student loans and use it towards tuition. My parents have paid for about $22,000 worth of my schooling, and I have 3 semesters left. They told me that they see me wasting money and that they're cutting me off. Now I have been self dependent since high school. I pay for my own car, gas, clothes, food, and travel expenses. I know where they are coming from on using my money for education. 

Personally at this point in my life I am already very distant from my family since they wernt there for me during high school, and approaching them with my issues always brought up more problems. Im on the fence of whether I totally leave them for the better. Stop being a financial drain on them, and let them live their lives without me. 

Ive always considered myself a loner and already being abandoned by one family makes it easier for me mentally to leave this one by my own choice. Im also on the fence about apply for Korean schools, finishing my education there, and not coming back. 

Its a lot of difficult choices for both ends but as of now, I dont want to even be in this house hold anymore.

TL;DR Do I leave my family to return to Korea/away from them, and carry on my life without a family?"
306ttn,31,2015-03-24,I: Years in the Making (Xpost /r/talesfromtheoffice),ArguablyCivilServant,talesfromthejob,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/306ttn/i_years_in_the_making_xpost_rtalesfromtheoffice/,"I've been working for this government now for a few years. Started as an intern, and before that a campaigner on the trail of a candidate or two. That was back in highschool. I was still somewhat hopeful, and in turn interested in politics. However interesting my life was back then, I consider the more recent years to be some of the more... humorous ones, to say the least. 

The life of a civil servant isn't easy. It's filled with trials and tribulations; a constituent is stuck in a life-threatening bureaucratic paper loop, or a local's Social Services paperwork didn't go through and now they might be stripped of their medication, and a local charity stopped half-way through paying some guy's bills and now he needs help before he becomes homeless. It's our job to help those kinds of people.

So I imagined, three years ago when I signed my name on a slip of creamy light-khaki colored paper that told me to swear to protect and preserve the Constitution of this state. So I have experienced, anyway, once or twice. Although we don't really get that many cases in my office specifically, we do get them once in a blue moon. The time in between those long, dreary, weeks-long stints of boredom and hypocritical ""civil service"" is spent doing other things. Reddit is popular between my coworker and I, while my Chief of Staff attempts to fix the world and doesn't let us help. He's got a great work ethic, but sometimes it isolates him. 

The office itself is sort of an indicator of our productive output to society. The white-washed walls, now slightly darker due to a rooftop heater expelling black snowflakes of carbon everywhere, smearing black streaks and cracks throughout, encase a small area of roughly 30 square feet. A long, black, rubberized carpet leads from the doorway to the front divider, behind which sits my fellow Redditor. The carpet was supposed to keep the floor generally clean from the assaults of salt and gravel used by the highway department outside. Success has been varied. People rarely come in to warrant having it in the first place. Fluorescent lights indiscriminately illuminate the room, throwing harsh white light over files which haven't moved in an unknown amount of time.  

A single, long, equally as bland corridor stretches the length of the office. The first door, encountered immediately as you begin the trek to the back room, is *the* office. His office. My boss' office. It's small, relatively speaking. Elected officials usually have more spacious rooms, fitted out in all the decorations and rights of splendor which would present an air of authority and governing tradition to those who enter. This all is enforced by the fact that the couch, angled to face the door, forces you by the way it's positioned to awkwardly angle your head towards a large desk, pitted against the opposite wall and arguably taking up the other half of the already claustrophobic room. That's *His* desk. So it says in the paperwork, anyway. The last time he used it was... I can't even remember. I've used it more times than he has. It's great for napping in. A single, lonely portrait of JFK lingers near the corner of it, by the wall. It has the most melancholy expression

Further down, by about three feet, is another door on the left. The conference room. It's just a conference room. Lit by the same fluorescent lights, stuffing the room with an awkward, immature lighting which reduces any meeting to an almost impolite silence with their intensity. The large, needlessly expensive granite long table is encircled by a number of executive chairs. Each is identical, with the same ass imprint engraved into the depressed seating foam as the one next to it. 

At the end of the hall is a single store room. We technically don't own it. It's donated by the owner of the building. Because of this loophole, we keep all of our election material in there. Legal, but sketchy. The weird-smelling microwave, decrepit minifridge, and pile of assorted plastic silverware is also in there as well. The cleaning crew somehow managed to make that room spotless, while the rest of the office walls are stained black from the soot. 

And this is the place I work. Five days a week, and now four because of my college classes, I've been coming here for between 3 to four hours a day. I've done this now for three years, and I've grown to appreciate the finer things of government work. I've helped with presidential elections, congressional runs, county legislature campaigns, and State Legislature bids, but nothing prepared me for the irony that is the hypocritical work I don't do on a daily basis. I'll post more, but for those wondering- I'll be chronicling the hypocrisy of my State Legislature office through this account. I've had an itch to begin writing them since last year, and since I'm leaving in five months due to transferring to a four-year university from the one I'm currently in, I think now's a good time. These are the tales from my office.

I apologize ahead of time for this long post-any advice you can give would be appreciated! I'm a college freshman choosing between two very opposing career options: a singing career or a career as a fashion designer. Some background on me in both fields: 
      For singing,I've always enjoyed it. I was in choir from elementary school through my first semester in college(unfortunately,I don't have room for it in my schedule this second semester),and show choir for three years in high school. I've performed in middle school musicals, and sang when I was in pageants for two years. I simply love performing. It makes me happy in my very core. I sing in the shower, I sing..everywhere,I guess. I don't think I'm the most amazing,but I am at least fairly good.I love singing. However, I am unsure if I have enough talent to make a career. I love performing,but of course the money sucks in it,and it's a very tough path to go into. Success is very slim,and it takes a long time to get to a point where you can make a decent living off of it. It's tough raising a family as well,of course,and on your spouse. Of course I can't guarantee we're together, but it's a pretty good bet I'll marry my long term boyfriend who's going into software engineering, it's not like he could travel with me.

Fashion Design:
I just got very into fashion a couple years ago- I truly love it. I run a fashion and lifestyle blog, and I'm currently studying fashion design at a state university. My classes are hard,but interesting,and designing clothes is fun.The actual career part is the only thing that I don't like. I hate the idea of sitting in an office all day, making money for someone else. I dislike the idea of sitting in meetings, just the daily life. I want a fascinating life. I don't want my own business,though. My university has an amazing placement rate for internships and jobs in this field with big companies, it's almost guaranteed I'll get a decent job with fairly good pay. I could make a living off of this.

 I want a career where I'm known- I want to inspire millions, be on magazine covers. I want to travel,and go to fun events. I want to meet up with fans and have a job which doesn't feel like a job(which is my main concern with fashion). I love singing,and the thought of a career of that is amazing. Also-many singers have their own clothing lines, so I could do both,which makes me even happier.

But- I'm faced with the practicality of it. Is it even practical? The most practical option would be to see if I could do both- I'll have an internship in NYC hopefully in the next couple years for my fashion degree,and I could audition and take voice classes in my spare time. But if I did get chosen for something after I have a career in the fashion field, it's not like I could just come back to my job. Singing in the early stages isn't a steady flow of constant work, you take what you could get. It's not like I could do it on the side and keep doing fashion work until I hit the big time.

 I'm just completely unsure of what to do-do I simply forget about my singing dreams to go somewhere where I'm guaranteed money? Is there some sort of balance? If I wanted to go for singing, and I wasting my time in college for fashion the next three years?How would I go about starting in the singing business-move to somewhere and start auditioning?Should I study voice instead? So many questions, and I have so many worries. What should I do?

TLDR: I'm choosing between pursuing a job in the fashion design industry or going after a singing career, and not sure where to go from here."

I've applied to anywhere between 30 - 40 places for entry-level positions, most not mentioning anything about GPA requirements. Out of those, I've gotten a few calls by recruits that represent the companies but only taken place in 4 in-person interviews. I've received one offer, from a place who's min requirements do not include having a CS degree, for slightly less than 40k.

My question to you is, should I roll with this place for 6-12 months and use it to boost my resume since my overall GPA is so low? I still have about a month before I graduate so I could hold out and continue searching in hopes of getting picked up somewhere else, but I'm starting to feel like the amount I was offered is probably about how much I'm worth.

For a little more information, I did do one internship three years ago, but it was in a stack not related to what I would be working with at the place offering me (low level stuff with C). If I go with the offer, I would work primarily with Java, Python, and a little bit of Javascript. Interestingly enough, I would be making one dollar more per hour than I made doing my internship. I'm also in a bit of a bind for money. I feel like it might be a good idea to use this as a foot-in-the-door situation position, pay off bills, take part in open source projects, and save up for 6-12 months.

What do you guys think? Is it a good idea to roll with this, given my low GPA and financial situation, or try to hold out for something better?

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

307hol,1,2015-03-24,Unsure of what to do for my career and college future,cldunsmore0215,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/307hol/unsure_of_what_to_do_for_my_career_and_college/,"I had no idea what thread to share this to,so I'll just put this here. I apologize ahead of time for this long post-any advice you can give would be appreciated! I'm a college freshman choosing between two very opposing career options: a singing career or a career as a fashion designer. Some background on me in both fields: 
      For singing,I've always enjoyed it. I was in choir from elementary school through my first semester in college(unfortunately,I don't have room for it in my schedule this second semester),and show choir for three years in high school. I've performed in middle school musicals, and sang when I was in pageants for two years. I simply love performing. It makes me happy in my very core. I sing in the shower, I sing..everywhere,I guess. I don't think I'm the most amazing,but I am at least fairly good.I love singing. However, I am unsure if I have enough talent to make a career. I love performing,but of course the money sucks in it,and it's a very tough path to go into. Success is very slim,and it takes a long time to get to a point where you can make a decent living off of it. It's tough raising a family as well,of course,and on your spouse. Of course I can't guarantee we're together, but it's a pretty good bet I'll marry my long term boyfriend who's going into software engineering, it's not like he could travel with me.

Fashion Design:
I just got very into fashion a couple years ago- I truly love it. I run a fashion and lifestyle blog, and I'm currently studying fashion design at a state university. My classes are hard,but interesting,and designing clothes is fun.The actual career part is the only thing that I don't like. I hate the idea of sitting in an office all day, making money for someone else. I dislike the idea of sitting in meetings, just the daily life. I want a fascinating life. I don't want my own business,though. My university has an amazing placement rate for internships and jobs in this field with big companies, it's almost guaranteed I'll get a decent job with fairly good pay. I could make a living off of this.

I want a career where I'm known- I want to inspire millions, be on magazine covers. I want to travel,and go to fun events. I want to meet up with fans and have a job which doesn't feel like a job(which is my main concern with fashion). I love singing,and the thought of a career of that is amazing. Also-many singers have their own clothing lines, so I could do both,which makes me even happier.

 But- I'm faced with the practicality of it. Is it even practical? The most practical option would be to see if I could do both- I'll have an internship in NYC hopefully in the next couple years for my fashion degree,and I could audition and take voice classes in my spare time. But if I did get chosen for something after I have a career in the fashion field, it's not like I could just come back to my job. Singing in the early stages isn't a steady flow of constant work, you take what you could get. It's not like I could do it on the side and keep doing fashion work until I hit the big time.

 I'm just completely unsure of what to do-do I simply forget about my singing dreams to go somewhere where I'm guaranteed money? Is there some sort of balance? If I wanted to go for singing, and I wasting my time in college for fashion the next three years?How would I go about starting in the singing business-move to somewhere and start auditioning?Should I study voice instead? So many questions, and I have so many worries. What should I do?

TLDR: I'm choosing between pursuing a job in the fashion design industry or going after a singing career, and not sure where to go from here."

Background is that I'm a political science student who wants to go into a highly competitive field. There's an internship through a private company that I *really really* want. After literally months (3 to be exact) of sitting on this application and panicking every time I thought about it... I JUST SUBMITTED IT!! 

This is huge for me. My therapist has been reminding me that it's okay if they say no, but that I have a good chance of getting accepted due to other things I've done. If they do say yes, that's one step closer to my ultimate goal.

So thanks /r/anxiety, for being their for me even when you didn't know because now I took a step towards living better with this.

Advice?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/307mwv/20f_considering_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_20m/,"We have been dating for almost 4 years (May 1st) We're both in college, he is going to be a senior and I will be a junior at colleges 45 minutes apart (we take a city bus). We see each other at least once a week  but lately it's become more of a job rather than exciting going to see him. Our sex life is poor, I no longer enjoy/desire sex with him (he's been my only sexual partner). He critiques me on not making him a priority over friends and sometimes school work. I want to work in the NHL and he is going into physical therapy, my job will most likely require much more travel which he will be likely to resent me for (he was upset when i studied abroad for two weeks and was upset when I took a camp job that requires me I work 9-4 on weekdays in the summer). He'll call me selfish because I forget to text him some days and place work and my friends first sometimes. Through all of this he's still my best friend, we've grown together in some of the most challenging parts of our young adulthood. He stimulates me intellectually and in most parts of my life is supportive and understanding. I've been considering offering him his senior year to be single (mainly because once he graduates is when I'll be most busy with my internships and jobs). I've been thinking about this for a month now and when he came back from Spring break I was not excited to see him and I was bored the entire time we were together (i've never felt that way about him before). We're not talking until Saturday, I told him I need some time to work on myself and figure out my own feelings and that he should take this week to do the same. Now I miss him but I'm not sure if I miss him, or having a safety nets of sorts. Any advice? This is my first long term relationship and I'm not sure how to go about this."

No President, no Secretary of State, no interns even.  With this the Mexican government officially recognizes the collapse of the US federal government.  

The new nations which have risen from the ashes of this former union still have a large number of Mexican nationals living in them however, and we still need to protect our own.  We are hereby converting the following diplomatic missions in the countries named into embassies, with the Consul stationed there acting as temporary Ambassador to these nations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**California**

Consulate-General in Sacramento is now the Mexican embassy to California.

Ambassador - Carlos Gonzalez Gutierrez

**Mountains**

Consulate in Seattle is now the embassy of Mexico to Cascadia.

Ambassador - Eduardo Baca Cuenca

**Pueblo**

Consulate-General in Phoenix is now the embassy of Mexico to Pueblo.

Ambassador - Roberto Rodriguez Hernandez

**Texoma**

The Consulate-General in Austin will be converted into the embassy of Mexico to Texoma.

Ambassador - Rosalba Ojeda y Cardenas

**Dixie**

The consulate in Little Rock will be the temporary embassy of Mexico to Dixie until arrangements can be made for a proper embassy in Memphis.

Ambassador - David Manuel Preciado Juarez

**Carolina**

The Consulate-General in Atlanta will become the official Mexican embassy to Carolina.

Ambassador - Ricardo Camara Sanchez

**Florida**

The Consulate-General of Miami will become the embassy of Mexico to Florida.  We also plan on expanding the Consulate in San Juan to serve all of the Caribbean territories of Florida.

Ambassador - Juan Miguel Gutiérrez Tinoco

**Virginia**

We ask for permission for an embassy in Richmond to be built, as the one in D.C. is in a precarious position as we speak.

Ambassador - TBA

**Midwest**

With the absence of an official capital being announced we plan on making the Consulate-General in Chicago the temporary Embassy to the Midwest.

Ambassador - Carlos Martin Jimenez Macias

**Great Lakes**

With the lack of a consulate in Green Bay, we plan on making the Consulate in St. Paul the temporary embassy of Mexico to the Midwest.

Ambassador - Alberto Fierro Garza

**Mid-Atlantic**

With the lack of a clear capital being known we plan on making the Consulate-General in New York City the embassy of Mexico to the Mid-Atlantic, regardless of where the final capital location is.

Ambassador - Carlos Manuel Sada

**New England** 

With no clear capital the Consulate-General to Boston will become the official embassy of Mexico to New England, regardless of where the capital ends up.

Ambassador - Daniel Hernandez Joseph

**Hawaii**

The Consulate in Honolulu will become the embassy to Hawaii from Mexico.

Ambassador - Andrew M. Kluger

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We hope that the rest of the world will truly recognize these nations as the inheritors of the former United States.  The former embassy in Washington D.C. will be converted into a consulate if the situation in that city cools down.  The former ambassador to the USA, Eduardo Medina-Mora, has been recalled to Mexico City where he will be given a new assignment.  

These new nations also have the option to continue their diplomatic ties with Mexico with the creation of the ""Special American Zones"" these are located in the buildings of the old USA consulates and will house diplomats from all former American nations.  The Embassy in Mexico City will be granted to Pueblo, and room will be made for the official embassies of the other nations.

308eih,13,2015-03-25,Unemployed - feeling stuck,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/308eih/unemployed_feeling_stuck/,"I finished university with a media degree in june last year. I didn't enjoy it much at all but kind of just felt pressured into finishing it. I also started studying a graphic design diploma online at the same time because this was originally what I wanted to do but couldn't get into that course at my university. Since I graduated from media I have been looking for work with basically no leads at all. My applications are ignored completely and I get no response to internship applications either. 

It's even worse to come on here and see that people have been unemployed for so long - 2 years, 5 years, whatever

But I have not even been able to get casual work. I don't have much experience - I spent some time working at McDonalds - and get no response for retail, obviously not for hospitality or admin because I have no experience in these areas. I also think that my issues with casual work are partly because I'm 22 and most businesses only want to pay for juniors (I live in Australia) but at least now I'm 22 I can apply for job seeker benefits and get some money from the govt so I'm not completely stressed about that. My parents had to support me up until then. I still have my old job at McDonalds but that would mean moving back to my home town and they barely roster me anyway (casual, pay rate is really high).

Basically this whole thing has steadily killed all my confidence and motivation to do anything at all, really. I have to see all my friends earning money, shopping, going on holidays overseas, living on their own, owning cars etc. while I get to do nothing. I'm really unhappy with my online course for various reasons. I feel extremely isolated working online and they changed the structure of the course. I'm supposed to be finishing in august but I haven't done any work since like november last year. Every day I hate design more and more which I don't understand. I've always been creative and I love to make stuff but I just have lost all interest in it. My parents aren't much help. They just keep telling me to just finish it because I'm almost done but they don't understand any of my problems with it.

I have been submitting lots of applications for both casual and career jobs. I have had one group retail interview which I didn't get (not a surprise) and have talked to one agency but they aren't looking for a junior until later in the year.

I was thinking about having a change of careers entirely and going back to uni but all the ideas I come up with for things I actually like either have shit money or no jobs. I went to see someone to help me with my resume and stuff and while that was kind of useful it hasn't resulted in an actual job.

I'm really not sure what to do and I'm not really sure what sort of advice I'm looking for but people don't understand. My friends who have jobs think it is really easy to just sit down and churn out applications because they've never actually had to go through this process. One girl I know applied for a HR job on a whim and got it immediately. It's so fucking frustrating. 

i'm fucking 22. Why do I have to feel like this?? i know i'm at least kind of smart. i'm shy but i'm friendly, I'm not arrogant, i  dont expect to walk into a high paying senior position, I know i have to start at the bottom. i'm willing to work but i just cannot get a foot in the door. I loved university; I learnt a lot and had such a great time socially but I feel like it was such a huge waste of three years. I'd love to just fuck off away from everything and go and work overseas but I have no money, no passport, no experience doing any kind of useful work.

TL;DR excessively long post: i hate my life

I've just recently come to the conclusion that I suck compared to this time last year. I went on an internship abroad leaving behind a possible remake of summoners rift, a crappy Lucian that was starting to get strong, and then I came back to last patch.

So, I ended plat 5 last season, and I've noticed that I don't have the same inpact that I used to have on games anymore. I used to fill any role, with my go-to being support or ad, being good enough to play them all at my own level (with limited champion pools).

Now I notice I am confused at what to pick, I'm confused at what to build, I feel like I'm getting destroyed in jungle (I can't even gank after doing a route, what?) and ever since my placements (that got me into gold 5) I feel like I can't depend on my team nor my ability to carry.

I'd love to get a little better again and regain my previous position on the ladder, but I'm confused on what I should do. I can play and record a couple games later today for you to watch if you'd like, but what comes to mind if you read this?

Thanks guys!"
308rgk,0,2015-03-25,I broke all the interview rules as an experiment,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/308rgk/i_broke_all_the_interview_rules_as_an_experiment/,"Hi, I'm currently comfortably employed, but my resume is still all over the recruiter's databases, and once in a while I get calls from recruiters who want to talk to me. Last week, I had another one of those. Since I'm not really looking for a job, I decided to pull an experiment and break every rule possible for the interview. Here is my story: 

1) I post-poned the appointment several times. After 3rd re-scheduling, I outright didn't show up. They called me back and scheduled me again for try #4

2) I didn't shower the day before, didn't wear a tie, and put on a casual shirt from last week. I mismatched my belt and shoes (brown and black respectively) on purpose as well. 

3) I made sure I pulled a half-nighter so I'm feeling bad and sleep-deprived by playing Dark Souls 2 till ~2 am the day before the interview.

4) I had coffee right before entering their building (I showed up 5 mins late obviously), so I have that distinctive coffee breath. 

5) I made sure they are serving me more coffee and biscuits before I even started talking business. 

6) I gave them my business card from my current job. 

7) They started by asking me to tell them about myself. I started with describing my exchange program during high school, and how I was cocky enough to take 4x SAT's in one week (and scored high on all of them). Then they moved on to my internship, and I made sure to let them know how I didn't like the bank at all, and how I was made to do meaningless tasks that looked like a ""who are you? fuck off, intern"" assignment to me. 

8) They then started asking about my current position. I made sure that I reply in the most condescending manner that I'm managing a portfolio of projects and that I'm super qualified to a point that it's boring, so I'm looking for a more entertaining company. 

9) When asked about my current income, I outright replied ""and why do you care?"". I also threw in some curse words somewhere there. 

10) Then they started asking those classic ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"", I said ""the CFO of some large company. Preferably yours"". 

11) They asked if i'm married. I said no, and added that I hate children (I really don't, but hey, it was an experiment!). 

12) They asked why do I want to work for their company, I said ""because you will pay more than my current employer"". 

We talked for 10-15 more minutes about the tasks I perform, and I got very technical. I started throwing in examples from complicated structured deals I've had, like how a group of 70 companies was trying to get financing from us, and how I was calling them on their bullshit about their financials after cross-checking the consolidation. About 50% of it was bullshit I made up on the spot based on real projects I've had in the past. 

This afternoon they called me in for interview #2. 

I think my by far biggest take from this is - if you actually have marketable skills, companies will try to hire you, regardless of the ""company culture"" and other bullshit that is now all over the media. 

Good luck in your job search!"
308tyq,3,2015-03-25,"My [27F] friend from university [28F] has been avoiding me, and it breaks my heart. Should I rip the Band-Aid and end it?",GreatAnotherKate,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/308tyq/my_27f_friend_from_university_28f_has_been/,"During my first year of university, I became really good friends with a girl named Felicity (not her real name). We shared a lot of the same values such as being introverts, liking the same music, and growing up near the same city, so we developed a really strong friendship. We hung out often, talked for hours, shared each other's secrets, the whole nine. We eventually found an apartment together during the first year of school, and decided to live together until graduation. Unbeknownst to me, Felicity was put on academic probation after our third year of university, and I didn't find out that she was not allowed on campus until about two weeks before our senior year! Shocked, I called Felicity on the phone that night, and she claimed that she didn't realize that she wouldn't be able to return to school. I was upset because I didn't believe that Felicity was being honest with me, but I didn't make a big deal about it. In hindsight, I don’t think our friendship was ever the same after that.

I went back to school senior year, failed miserably at making new friends, and in general, had a dreadful year. I gained weight because of my stress eating and lack of exercise. The economy crashed that September, and despite my good credentials and experience, I didn't graduate with a job offer. Felicity and I still stayed in constant contact, however.

I couldn’t find a full-time job by graduation, so I had to move back home for a while. Luckily, my hometown is near my industry, so I swallowed my pride and found a retail job at the mall in addition to working two unpaid internships and freelance gigs to keep my resume fresh. It was a very difficult time in my life, so I decided to withdraw from friends and partying to focus on my goals. Felicity knew that, but despite my busy schedule, I made an effort to call her regularly and stay in contact. University let her return the next year, so she was able to graduate in 2010.

Eventually, I lost the weight and found a full-time job in my field. But as time went by, I noticed that I was the only friend making effort to maintain the friendship. I would call her, and she wouldn’t answer. I would try to make plans, but she pretended that her phone was malfunctioning or whatever. We still were able to communicate, but I felt funny about that. Another year later, I was finally able to move out of my parents’ place. I unintentionally found an apartment 30 minutes away from her, so I figured that Felicity would be a bigger part of my life. I guess not. We would occasionally hang, but only when I made a grand mal effort and initiated things.

I didn’t push things because I knew that Felicity was depressed. But after all these years, she’s working a dead-end job and still living at home. I, on the other hand, have received multiple promotions and have a more financially comfortable lifestyle as a result. But I never cared about that stuff – she supported me during sad periods in my life, and she’s such a marvelous person. I miss her friendship, and it hurts that she doesn’t seem to value my presence. Most recently, she was there to listen to me cry when my ex dumped me. I just would like a chance to be there for her – I would be more than happy to hang at less expensive places, or cover the bill occasionally. I’ve been in her position before, so I know how hard it is.

I don’t really have any friends in the same town now – my best friend got married years ago and moved out of the country. My other close friend just got engaged, and I know that she’s leaving me soon. But Felicity hangs out with her best friend all the time. I’m trying to make new friends, but it’s so hard!

At this point, I’m unsure whether I should continue pursuing this friendship. I get the sense that she’s intentionally fading away, and I don’t know why. We’re both very prideful people, and I don’t know how to address this issue. What should I do?

TL;DR: I became very good friends with a girl I met in university. We stayed in touch during hard times and I value her friendship. But almost ten years later, I am doing much better than her financially. I regularly call her to talk, invite her to visit or do low-cost things, but she always has an excuse not to. We have never had an argument, and I don’t know how I could’ve slighted her in any way. Is this friendship worth saving, or should I cut my losses and move on?

I have been diagnosed with PCOS for about 3 years. When i graduated college (2011) i was 130lbs and in great shape and had no symptoms. I since then had gained 35 pounds and CANT shed it. I have literally tried anything and i am getting increasingly more frustrated. 

GYN said i should take metformin, but after reading everyone's horror stories about it i am really afraid to try it.(although the instructions say if you have vomiting or diarrhea to stop taking it immediately and consult your doctor, which i wonder if people actually did?) I have a schedule that isn't really conducive to having stomach issues (work full time, 2 days a week internship and grad school classes at night). I also know that people only say something about metformin if they have had a bad experience. Does anyone have any good stories? Did anyone have NO side effects at all? Im too afraid to take the risk!"

We used to see each other often and once in a while fool around. 

When she got into her relationship with her boyfriend [20 M], she stopped contacting me. She told me that her boyfriend didn't want her talking to me and I respected that since I didn't want to cause any dramas in her new relationship.

Recently, she broke up with her boyfriend and now wants to be friends with me. The issue is that my girlfriend [22 F], call her Kat, loathes Alex as she was my ex. I haven't told Kat that I've been talking to Alex again.

I've been talking to Alex for 2 weeks now and have gone out to lunch with her once. Everything seemed normal and I enjoyed it. Last week, I spoke to Alex about the boundaries of being friends. I told her that there can't be any physical interactions and that our relationship is nothing more than friendship. I wanted everything to be clear so that it wouldn't jeopardise my relationship with Kat.

Should I tell Kat that I'm talking to my ex and that I've set boundaries or keep it a secret? If I tell Kat, there's a possibility that she would want me to cut Alex out of my life again. 
   
**tl;dr**: Best friend/Ex-girlfriend broke up with her ex and has started talking to me again. Current girlfriend hates my ex. 

**update**: Broke it off with Kat. The relationship was going downhill and I couldn't see myself being with her anymore. I just completed an internship with one of the largest engineering companies and was just about to finish my engineering degree while she finished her arts degree last year and hasn't found a job. Kat confessed that she was seeing another guy for the past 3 months so I guess I don't feel that bad. I can say that I don't miss my relationship with Alex but it's nice that she's there for me now. I guess it was meant to be. Thanks Reddit!"

# Skutle ble bøtelagt for narko-sopp
### *Stortingsrepresentant Erik Skutle og fire andre Høyre-politikere kjøpte hallusinogener og cannabis i Amsterdam, ifølge forelegget Skutle har vedtatt.*

Skrevet av Rune Christophersen, rune.christophersen@bt.no

To av politikerne sitter i Bergen bystyre for Høyre.

Skutle ble i tillegg bøtelagt for å ha kjøpt og brukt cannabis og/eller marihuana en rekke ganger over en periode på ett år, både før og etter at han ble stortingsrepresentant. Det fremgår av forelegget, som BT har fått innsyn i.

## Magic mushroom

Amsterdam-turen skal ha funnet sted 21. til 24. februar i fjor. De fem politikerne skaffet seg i fellesskap noen «jointer», samt 10-15 gram hver av narkotisk trøffel-sopp, ifølge forelegget. Soppen, ofte kalt «magic mushroom», inneholder det narkotiske virkestoffet psilocybin og virker hallusinerende.

\- Det var en privat tur, sier en av bystyrepolitikerne, som sier han har erkjent overfor politiet å ha handlet dop i Amsterdam.

Skutle ble valgt inn på Stortinget høsten 2013. 25-åringen er vararepresentant for statsminister Erna Solberg

## - Jevnlig bruk

Han skal ha ervervet og brukt cannabis og/eller marihuana jevnlig fra januar 2013 til 27. februar 2014, da han ble pågrepet.

Innholdet i forelegget har ikke tidligere vært kjent. Da saken sprakk i mediene, uttalte Høyres parlamentariske leder at Skutle i politiavhør innrømmet å ha brukt hasj ved én anledning. Skutle selv har ikke villet svare mediene på hvor ofte han har brukt narkotika.

For to måneder siden fikk stortingsmannen en bot på 10.000 kroner for brudd på legemiddelloven og straffelovens narkotikaparagraf. Skutle vedtok boten, men erkjente ikke skyld. Dermed unngikk han offentlig rettssak med full bevisførsel.

\- Jeg har vedtatt forelegget, uten å ta stilling til skyldspørsmålet, slik straffeprosessloven åpner for. Det var for å få saken ut av verden. Det tror jeg folk har forståelse for at jeg ønsket, sier Skutle.
Slapp straff

De to bystyrepolitikerne slapp straff, og fikk påtaleunnlatelse mot å delta i Utekontaktens «Tidlig ute»-prosjekt.

Den tredje deltakeren på Amsterdam-turen fikk i likhet med Skutle et forelegg på 10.000 kroner.

\- Jeg har vedtatt boten, og anser meg som ferdig med den saken der, sier vedkommende. For den fjerde er saken ennå ikke avgjort.

Skutle vil fortsatt ikke svare på omfanget av sin narkotika-bruk.

\- Jeg har erkjent overfor politiet at jeg har brukt cannabis. Det har jeg vært åpen på overfor politiet, og i offentligheten, siden dette ble kjent. Jeg har fått et forelegg på 10.000 kroner, som er som forventet. Det har gått nesten ett år, og det å få lagt saken bak seg er en stor lettelse, sier han.

## Partiet ikke informert

Leder I Hordaland Høyre, Liv Kari Eskeland, sier hun ikke visste hva Skutle ble bøtelagt for.

\- Jeg har ikke etterspurt innholdet i forelegget, og har ikke vært kjent med det før du forteller meg det, sier hun.

\- Endrer dette partiets syn på saken?

\- Jeg kan ikke si at det er ting der som... Det begynner å bli en stund siden vi diskuterte det. Vi fikk en ganske åpen redegjørelse fra Erik da det blåste som verst. Jeg ser ikke at det du forteller forandrer noe.

\- Du sier dere fikk en åpen redegjørelse fra Skutle, men han fortalte ikke om innholdet i forelegget?

\- Nei, vi har ikke vært kjent med det.

## - Nulltoleranse

\- Hva synes du om det han er bøtelagt for?

\- Vi har nulltoleranse for bruk av narkotika. Dette har vært en politisak. Vi har ikke drevet intern etterforskning i partiet, men vår holdning er klar.

\- Hvilke konsekvenser får dette for ham?

\- Han er stortingsrepresentant, og det vil han være ut perioden. Han har fått et forelegg, og nå når innholdet er kjent vil vi gå gjennom det. Men jeg ser ikke at det endrer saken.

\- Hva gjør dette med hans mulighet for å bli gjenvalgt?

\- Det har jeg ingen formening om.

## - Spurv med kanon

Skutle selv vil ikke svare på hva han har fortalt partiledelsen.

Hans advokat, John Christian Elden, skriver i en tekstmelding til BT at han gjerne skulle sett at politiarbeidet ble utfordret.

\- Etterforskningen var å skyte spurv med kanoner og bruke politiressurser og telefonavlytting ukritisk.

\- Hvorfor vil han ikke, som stortingsrepresentant, være åpen om hvilke lovbrudd han mener å ha begått?

\- Han har som alle andre krav på et privatliv, selv om politiet prøver å hindre det. Bagatellmessige bøteforhold er ikke folkeforlystelse i Norge, skriver forsvareren.

Wasnt that simple however.  The spatial join worked, but some of the segments dont match up correctly?  Like I think the problem is that the spatial join may have joined 2 segments to one in certain locations and they should be seperate and one to one. 

My supervisor said I should use the Feature vertices to points tool?  Or maybe write a script that does something like this?  But honestly Im a little lost.  The GIS technician works in a different office so most of the time I talk to him on the phone, and he comes in every now and then to check my progress, Id like to have something to show him so I was hoping you guys would be able to help me out here.  Thank you. "
3096q6,0,2015-03-25,Feeling stuck in a dead end software consulting job. What career move will bring me closer to landing a software engineering position?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3096q6/feeling_stuck_in_a_dead_end_software_consulting/,"**tl;dr: Current job pays well, but stunts my growth as a software developer. My exit strategy is either to go back to school or patiently look for another job while working on personal coding projects. Which makes more sense?**

A little bit about myself. I graduated from an engineering school about 10 months ago with a BS degree in mathematics. I'm probably not your typical aspiring CS dev, but I have been coding in some capacity for the last 4-5 years. I am by no means great at it, but goddamn it, I work hard at expanding my knowledge of software development.

In my junior year of undergrad I got lucky, and landed an internship with a physics lab on campus. This was an awesome software experience for me. For one, I got to work with an amazing software engineer that had phenomenal work ethic, a solid academic background, and experience with his own start-ups.  He helped me grow a lot as a software developer, and in the year that I had him as a mentor, I learned more than I have during most of my undergrad. 

The internship came to an end, and I started to look for a full time job elsewhere (the physics lab was not going to offer a full time gig to some snot-nosed undergrad). After a couple of months of searching, and attending various career related events I got two offers, both from software consulting companies. Without knowing much about software consulting jobs, I accepted an offer from the company that offered to pay me more. In hindsight, this was a dumbass move on my part, but I couldn't have known any better at the time. From what I could gather during the interviewing process, it seemed like a job where I would be writing code all day long.

Fast forward to today. I have been with the company for about 8 months, and let's just say that it took me way too long to figure out that this job is not centered around writing code. To make matters worse, the code that I have written is typically a variation of pre-existing code. My biggest issue with this is that I am not learning the ins and outs of the API at my disposal. This is particularly frustrating because I have gotten a slap on the wrist for trying to use the framework of the language. 

So...in the last couple of months I have started looking for a new job. My current goal is to find a software engineering position with a scientific computing group. Needless to say, I have thus far come up dry. I am still remaining patient, and calmly waiting to make my next move. In my mind there are two career paths that I can take from here:

1. I quit my job and go to grad school to do CS research. 
2. I tough it out with my current company while working on personal projects until I find a job where I get to write more code.

Which path makes more sense if my end goal is to land a code-heavy software engineering position?

3. What cities outside of Copenhagen or Denmark should we definitely visit before we come home?

4. Last, any advice you have on the Champions League Final and going to Berlin for it? (I know tickets are very expensive but have heard its just as much fun to just be in the area)

I've lived in the same state (Ohio) my entire life, other than an internship last summer in Louisiana. I have until tomorrow to decide whether to accept a job in Houston and pick up my life and move to Texas, or to accept a job offer in the Columbus, OH area.

I guess I'm asking how other people who have been in this position (stay home or leave) have dealt with the decision, what they ultimately decided, and why.

To compare the two situations for me:

- Job-wise the job in Houston is better and has higher pay (and lower taxes) and better benefits, but the job in Columbus is still good and the pay and benefits are still great

- Socially, I have a few friends that have recently moved to Houston and are excited to do things together. For Columbus, I've been dating a girl there (it's not serious) and I have a few friends still there, but most of my college friends have either moved away or are planning to do so very soon.

- Family-wise, my parents, sister, and both sets of grandparents all live within a few hours' drive of Columbus. At the Houston job, I would make enough money/have enough vacation to visit maybe 2-3 times per year.

- Finally, I've lived in Ohio all my life, so I'm pretty comfortable with the culture and climate. I spent a summer in Louisiana so the heat and humidity don't bother me much, but adjusting to the Texas culture might take some time. I'll admit it, I'm a yankee.

Obviously, I have to make this decision myself, but does anybody  who's been in this situation (or who lives in Houston) have any advice?

I don't really know the man that offered the internship well(Don't even know his name), he just goes to the church that my family goes to(I don't live with my family currently, live on campus, and I'm not a churchgoer), and during an event while he was leaving he asked me what my major was. I said Computer Science and he offered an internship if I need one. That was almost a year ago.

So I was wondering, how exactly do I bring it back up that I'm interested in doing that this summer? Like.. find out his name.. call.. then what? How would that conversation go? Or maybe try and meet him at church? It just seems kind of rude to just go up to him and say ""Hey a while back you offered me an internship opportunity, is that offer still available for this summer?""

So, any advice? Thanks.

309fuf,6379,2015-03-25,How Reddit Was Destroyed (ver3.0),[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/,"**UPDATE: WITHIN 30 HOURS OF MAKING THIS POST, I WAS SITE-WIDE SHADOWBANNED ""ACCIDENTALLY"", I AM NOW UNBANNED (See *new* point #14 for details) _________

1) **The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.** 

This took away the only tool for communicating *with* reddit *about* reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.

2) **The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**

I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious [campaign to filter him out of the election](https://archive.org/details/HowTheGovernmentAndMediaCheatedRonPaulDocumentary).

3) **Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**  

I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be ""approved"". Someone named [Victoria](https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=3110&amp;seid=111) is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.

There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. [Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/)

4) **The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.** 

All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. ""Feel good"" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions [""Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?""](http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lisa-mr-burns-runaway-train1.jpg) From brand new accounts that *never* posted again.

[Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city!](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html) I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! ""Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are *never* to be included in our yearly stats!!!""

[Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy) **Protip:** the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.

5) **Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.** 

What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.

Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.

Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media. 

6) **Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**

We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if *anyone* agreed with you.

7) **Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random** ^‿^ 

No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.

And speaking of the female demographic and ""gender discrimination"" being represented, that happened around the time [this person](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ellen+pao&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) took over as CEO of reddit.

8) **You are posting too much, please wait...**

It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing ""well"", then you get benched.

Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment. 

A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have [shadow-banning](http://www.webanswers.com/technology-computers/internet/web-sites/shadow-banning-on-reddit-997916) on a website that claims to support free speech.

9) **[Reddit is not a meritocracy](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/).**

**tl;dr**: **Your votes do not matter.** The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a ""head-start"". As we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this [amazing comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6kofo) that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. [They actually gave that user the boot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/) How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!

10) **The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.**

Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. [Nope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/)

11) **[Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/304uk6/the_reddit_trend_towards_banning_people_from/)** Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the *exact* same way about complex geopolitical events.”

12) **All of the proper ""checks and balances"" are now in place.** 

R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the [Two-Minutes Hate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate) from George Orwell's 1984:

&gt;a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.

But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!

Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, [the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/reddit-ddos/). Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the ~~manufactured~~ consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, **without any other evidence**, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.

And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.

13) **Online guerrilla tactics.**

When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https://voat.co/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?

Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. [Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE.](https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/rupert-murdoch-and-vice,6483) And once you have the customer, [it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones](http://oursocialtimes.com/70-of-companies-say-its-cheaper-to-retain-a-customer-than-acquire-one/). So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.

14) **Shark Shank's Redemption** (title credit to: u/Iridium777)

So I made this post and it went viral on r/conspiracy reaching +3500. I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer ""be found"". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban. 

So I made a new account and made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30hy5r/i_wrote_how_reddit_was_destroyed_and_it_went/) about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:

&gt;It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.

I have no idea what ""vote brigade"" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a ""vote brigade"". 

Anyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of ""yeah, our bad"". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban ""accidentally"" within a day and a half of my most viral ""How Reddit Was Destroyed"". 
…………………………………….


It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.

Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet.

309gp7,5,2015-03-25,How Reddit Was Destroyed (ver3.0),conspirobot,conspiro,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiro/comments/309gp7/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/,"poster: **[shark_shank](/u/shark_shank)**, [original conspiracy link](/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/)

-----------------------------------

1) **The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.** 

This took away the only tool for communicating *with* reddit *about* reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.

2) **The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**

I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious [campaign to filter him out of the election](https://archive.org/details/HowTheGovernmentAndMediaCheatedRonPaulDocumentary).

3) **Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**  

I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be ""approved"". Someone named Victoria is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.

There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. [Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/)

4) **The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.** 

All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. ""Feel good"" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions [""Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?""](http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lisa-mr-burns-runaway-train1.jpg) From brand new accounts that *never* posted again.

[Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city!](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html) I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! ""Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are *never* to be included in our yearly stats!!!""

[Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy) **Protip:** the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.

5) **Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.** 

What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.

Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.

Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media. 

6) **Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**

We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if *anyone* agreed with you.

7) **Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random** ^‿^ 

No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.

And speaking of the female demographic and ""gender discrimination"" being represented, that happened around the time [this person](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ellen+pao&amp;amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all) took over as CEO of reddit.

8) **You are posting too much, please wait...**

It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing ""well"", then you get benched.

Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment. 

A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have [shadow-banning](http://www.webanswers.com/technology-computers/internet/web-sites/shadow-banning-on-reddit-997916) on a website that claims to support free speech.

9) **[Reddit is not a meritocracy](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/).**

**tl;dr**: **Your votes do not matter.** The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a ""head-start"". As we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this [amazing comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6kofo) that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. [They actually gave that user the boot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/) How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!

10) **The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.**

Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. [Nope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/)

11) [Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/304uk6/the_reddit_trend_towards_banning_people_from/) Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the *exact* same way about complex geopolitical events.”

12) **All of the proper ""checks and balances"" are now in place.** 

R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the [Two-Minutes Hate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate) from George Orwell's 1984:

&amp;gt;a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.

But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!

Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, [the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/reddit-ddos/). Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the ~~manufactured~~ consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, **without any other evidence**, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.

And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.

13) **Online guerrilla tactics.**

When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https://voat.co/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and, at the time, was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?

Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. [Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE.](https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/rupert-murdoch-and-vice,6483) And once you have the customer, [it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones](http://oursocialtimes.com/70-of-companies-say-its-cheaper-to-retain-a-customer-than-acquire-one/). So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.


…………………………………….


It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.

Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) syndrome and this manipulation has encouraged the retard masses to become their [useful idiots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot).

**I believe this can essentially be boiled down to not just greed, but controlling and manipulating the information that the millions of people see on a daily basis. Reddit gets billions of views. [Manufactured consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) is very real and doing it through social media is the gold standard because people are hard-wired to value the opinions of their peers.**

Is Cyber Security a big factor in the world of Software Engineering and how much would it really help me?

About a year ago, I was working as a business analyst at a software company and just starting to teach myself development. I didn't have a CS degree and made my way into the business side of things, but I decided I wanted to be a developer after about 1 year of doing business analyst work. 

An employee at my company (at that time) and I had an idea for a startup. We went to some meet up events. We gained interest out of pure luck, but in reality we didn't have anything other than an idea.

A startup incubator brought us in for an interview and gave us a tour of their space. They told us we were a great fit, interviewed us separately, and then left us with ""we just have to draw up the paperwork"".

I was so excited. I was going to work for myself, I was going to have an opportunity to work on development all day every day, on my *own* thing! But in the end, the deal fell through at the last moment. It was crushing. 

***Anyway***, my partner came to the conclusion ""Fuck them!"" and made them into his enemy. He never spoke to them again, and when he'd see them at events in town he would give very dirty looks. 

I on the other hand remained professional and tried not to take it personally (even though it did feel personal at the time). I met again with the guy who rejected us and asked him for feedback. I then continued to grab a cup of coffee with him once every few months to catch up and stay in touch. 

***Last week I got an internship offer*** from that *same guy*. It was out of the blue, and I didn't even apply. Just ""hey, I know you're trying to be a dev, want an internship?"" I haven't even *started* my CS degree yet (I begin in May, going back to school) and I already have an internship offer where I'll be working with some very relevant web technologies. My ex-startup idea partner? Still in the same spot and he burns bridges with LOTS of people. 

I chose NOT to burn bridges even when I really wanted to, because at the end of the day ""business is business"" and you can't take things personally. I remained professional, kept in touch and continued to show interest and drive, and in the end a good thing came my way. 

**TL;DR** Never burn bridges unless you absolutely have to. You never know what the future may hold.

Please direct me to past posts if you know of something that I missed that would be relevant.

I'm graduating in December 2015 in the Midwest and interested in working in public accounting. My spouse has received a job offer in Seattle in an unrelated field, and will be starting in August. We are both *extremely* career focused so while it will suck to be apart, we're excited to be going to the place we want to be (by family, more interesting than our current location, etc.)

My background: I'm a nontraditional MBA student with a BA in English. After graduating with my BA, I worked five years in an accounting clerk position that I fell into due to a friend recommending me for an interview with his company (with absolutely no accounting experience) and worked my way up and up and up until I was getting paid the max I ever would at that company (obv without cost of living increases.) They paid for me to take accounting classes at the community college in town while I worked 50+ hours a week. I got a certificate in accounting (whee.) They offered me the Accounting Director position, and I knew that there was absolutely nowhere I could go from there at that company, and I knew that I couldn't transfer to a similar position at another company with a non-business degree. So I took the leap to the MBA (with Accounting concentration) program so I could take the undergrad courses I missed out on (as pre-reqs for the MBA accounting courses.) It doesn't seem to have held me back to be a nontraditional student. I'll be eligible to sit for the CPA at the end of December, my GPA is high (I got a B in a marketing class and that's it) and I'm holding down a tax internship at a national public accounting company (not Big 4) while taking a full course load and being a GA so my tuition is waived. I feel like these things will (hopefully) demonstrate that while I was flighty in my undergrad, I'm very set on being an accounting professional, extremely adaptable and really hardworking. I've always gotten stellar reviews in every job I've ever had, from washing dishes at a restaurant during high school onward. They seem to like me at my current internship, though they're extremely busy because of the season so I haven't pushed too much for feedback. The few times I've asked if I'm doing okay or on track, I've gotten positive responses about my hours billed and my work done.

Edit: **TL;DR:** I'm non-traditional, but will be CPA eligible with a great GPA in accounting by the time I graduate.

*Questions:*
1) I'm in the smaller college in the Midwest, so there won't be recruiters from Washington at any of my school functions. When should I start applying in Seattle? I'm willing to fly out when necessary for interviews in the fall, but I'm kind of a planner (it's what's kept me sane/succeeding while being full-time at work and getting my certificate in accounting, and while working two part-time jobs while getting this MBA) and I'm not sure how soon I should start applying places. 
If not until the fall, should I put my spouse's address in Seattle or mine in the Midwest?

I really like where I'm interning, and I get the impression that they might offer me a summer internship or associate position. I'd love that, but since I'm leaving in December, I'm just unsure that they'd be willing to train me/have me take up a spot and then have me transfer to another office across the country. 

2) Should I work on my CPA in the fall? I can apply to take it provisionally and just not get my scores until I graduate. Obviously I wouldn't get reimbursement then, but maybe I'd be more employable? I'm really torn, as the place I am now is full of associates that don't have their CPA. I have no problem with being entry level, I really want to learn, so would a CPA make it seem as if I was overqualified while simultaneously not having enough work experience? 

Thanks for any advice. I feel like I'm Jessie Spano from the caffeine pill episode right now..."

I need advice.,dangnicefelines,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30amzz/me_25f_with_my_friend_26f_asking_me_to_be_her/,"This is long. tl;dr is at the end. Thanks in advance if you made it through this.

Julie (26F) and I (25F) were best friends throughout high school and even for a bit after high school. Julie always craved attention and got herself into a lot of trouble when we were teens. A lot of her stories that seemed unbelievable were unbelievable because they simply weren’t true. She made up a lot to get attention. After high school, I really started to grow up and my patience for Julie’s attention seeking ways started to dwindle. 


Julie and I both got into relationships in my final year of high school (not hers, because she had dropped out by then). Mine was with a guy who was a year older than me, we met in high school. Julie’s was with a guy ten years older than us. We were both 17 at this time. 


After high school we both moved around a bit, we stayed in touch but certainly weren’t as close as we once were. I went to University and moved away from home but eventually moved back to my home town with my boyfriend (the same one from high school), around the same time that Julie and her (at that point) fiancé (the same guy who was 10 years older than us) moved back to town. We were both 21 at that time. 


We started working in the same place, which became a problem. I had a car, Julie did not. I was very committed to going to work every day because if I didn’t, I couldn’t make my rent. Julie didn’t even show up for half of her shifts because our job was “the worst job in the world”. Her fiancé was working two or three jobs to support them and their five animals in their two bedroom apartment. At this same time Julie ‘apparently’ started a relationship (read, sleeping with) with one of the older MARRIED men at our work. This was another story that I just couldn't believe, so I just tried to ignore it. 


Julie ended up getting fired from this job, which was a relief for me. It was hard to be at work at the same time because she would just want to chat or slack off with me. I didn’t love the job, but I needed it. Plus no matter what job I have I’m going to do my best. I’m a people pleaser and hate to disappoint my employers.


I ended up going back to College three months after starting the job, Julie had been fired by then. I kept working while being in College. Her reason for being fired was because the place we worked was ‘unfair’ and not understanding of her ‘condition’. Julie was a very large woman who weighed around 350 lbs and had a handful of health issues resulting from her weight. 


A couple of months after I started school Julie told me that her and her fiancé had broken up. They were still going to live together. But ‘he just wasn’t going anywhere with his life’ and she had ‘big plans that he just couldn’t possibly be a part of’ plus she was online dating and looking for her ‘prince’, she wanted a ‘rich guy who could take care of her and treat her like the princess she was’. I couldn’t believe it. Her ex and her continued to live together and he continued to pay for her and work two or three jobs to support her and himself. That autumn Julie had many stories for me which consisted of her finding a bunch of guys to sleep with in their ‘fancy cars’. Throughout this I just worked on getting my degree and staying focused on MY life.


Christmas Eve rolled around, Julie had stopped seeing all of her 'princes' and her ex decided to propose again. They were engaged again. Set to be married in July. I asked her why, what could have possibly changed from only a couple of months prior? She said she loved him. So it was wedding time, seven months later. *sigh* I asked how things that big could have been resolved, but she said she knew what she was doing. I trusted her and left it alone. It was her life, not mine.


Throughout this time they got into a lot of arguments. Julie wasn’t working, but she also wasn’t doing much of anything. Her fiancé would go to work and come home at the end of the day and the place would be trashed. Julie was ‘too sick’ to clean. He got frustrated when she said that because she made him dinner, he had to clean up. The place stunk and was filthy. 


Time goes by and it’s wedding time. I was still in school, had no income as I was working an unpaid internship and I was the Maid of Honor (actually the only member of the wedding party), for a wedding that even her own mother didn’t support or even end up coming to. All of her family lived far away (5+ hour drive away) and NO ONE was involved in the process. I went with Julie to look at dresses, I was with her to find her jewelry and her shoes. I helped her plan the cupcakes she wanted to have at her wedding.


Also, this was a wedding that was a 2 hour drive away and mostly a ‘pay for yourself’ event.  Dinner at a very fancy restaurant, but you had to pay for your own meal which certainly wouldn’t be less than $50 a plate. I can’t say I was a great Maid of Honor, but mostly because I was broke and had no help, plus I was 22 and honestly didn’t have any idea what I was doing. I did my best, I made the cupcakes for the wedding, I did the brides hair and makeup on the day of, I helped her get dressed, my boyfriend took most of the pictures for the wedding, I helped with the bachelorette party, but there was no shower. I couldn’t do it on my own and her family wasn’t involved, something I still feel bad about.


Anyways, this marriage lasted a year. Maximum. Julie went and got gastric bypass surgery, then decided to go back to school so she moved those 5+ hours away to be able to live with her extended family. She left her husband and all of her pets here. 


One month later she told him she was leaving him. They were getting a divorce. She didn’t love him. One month after that she met someone new. Two months later she was engaged to him. 


Julie married this new guy (15 years older than us, with three kids aged 9, 12 &amp; 13 who she calls “her kids”) in November (a year after they got engaged), but is insistent on still having a wedding in August because ‘she deserves it’. She **deserves** to have the wedding dress and the gifts and all the attention because her first wedding and marriage was so terrible (her words). He doesn’t want to. He has been married before and would be happy the way things are but Julie is adamant. And as the past has chosen, what Julie wants, Julie gets.

Since Julie moved away and split from her husband her and I haven't seen much of each other or really talked very much, we've slowly been losing touch and I am 100% okay with that. To me, it's a friendship that has run it's course and we are both in different places in our lives. I just wish it could die a natural death....

As an aside, I got married to my boyfriend from high school last year. We eloped, so there was no fancy wedding but our families threw us a couple of parties.  Julie got mad because she wasn’t invited to one of the parties and made me feel bad about it, despite the fact that I didn’t even throw the party. After that guilt trip (three weeks later) some girlfriends through me a bachelorette weekend. Julie didn’t come. She was ‘too sick’. 


I just received in the mail a cutout that says “Will You Be My Maid of Honor, Again?” and then a sheet with all bridesmaids names, my name as MOH and families members names with their contact numbers. I am already listed as the MOH despite not saying yes yet. Then it says “When throwing a shower or bachelorette you can do so at my place, just contact my husband!”.


To reiterate, Julie lives a 5+ hour drive away, I no longer have a car (don’t need one right now) plus I genuinely do not think that we are best friends, or even really friends, anymore. When we spend time together I come away from the get together frustrated or irritated. This friendship has been one sided for so long that I just don’t think I can take it anymore. 

What I do know about Julie’s life right now is mostly from the never ending ‘feel sorry for me’ Facebook posts and blog shares which are clearly just calls for more attention. They're about how her ex-husband was the worst person and treated her terribly. I was a pretty huge part of her life during that time. Sure, it’s always possible there were things that I didn’t see, but I lived around the corner and was always there. I certainly saw things way differently then they’re being described now. Plus, I know the things that Julie has made up in the past for attention.

I'm so sorry for the long post, I've never posted on here before. I am just a total people pleaser and hate confrontation and disappointing people. So I’m either going to make myself irritated, miserable and broke, and do this, or I’m going to have to deal with disappointment, confrontation and the end of a friendship, and not do it. I need some advice, either if I should or shouldn't do it. And if I shouldn't some advice as to how to break the news...

My mom personally feels like this is a really good time to cut ties with Julie because I have always cared more and put more into this friendship then she ever has. I agree that it's a good time to cut ties, but I'm a chicken shit and need some more input from less biased sources.


   
**tl;dr**: I was maid of honour for attention seeking friend’s first wedding three years ago. She has since been divorced and remarried and is now having a huge extravagant wedding because “she deserves it”, wants me to be maid of honor again. I don’t want to but don’t want to ruffle any feathers. "
30anvt,2,2015-03-25,"Me [19 M] with my SO [20 F] of 5 months, left her because she started stripping, feeling really bummed out",muckfichigan123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30anvt/me_19_m_with_my_so_20_f_of_5_months_left_her/,"I met my girlfriend in November 2014, we both go to the same university and she was stripper at the time working weekends, but it didn't really bother me because the relationship was very young. About 2 months in, her job started to really upset me, it was around this time that we became much more serious. 

Anyways, I told her that it while it would be unfair of me to ask her to quit stripping for me, it was causing me a lot of problems with jealousy and anxiety, so I felt it was best if we broke up. She then told me that she didn't really enjoy stripping anyways, and that I was more important, so she would have no problem quitting. I was very happy about this, and the we stayed together.

The relationship went well, although we did run into a rough patch dealing with an ex of hers, and we fell in love pretty seriously. About three weeks ago, she went back into work for one night because her sister was in town and wanted to see her dance, which I found pretty strange. It was around this time that I found out that she had given out ""extras"" to men at a club she had worked at in a different city over the summer; she had an internship in this city and worked in the club on the weekends. Apparently, she had allowed customers to finger her, come on her, etc. We weren't dating when she had been doing this, but she is working the same internship this summer, and it raised a lot of concerns for me about STDs, not to mention I am in no way on board with my girlfriend allowing any guy to do those things for cash.

It was at this point that I told her that I couldn't be with her if she was stripping. I'm not a jealous person, but I would think that this would bring it out in almost anyone- I couldn't stomach the thought of her giving lap dances and more to anyone that wasn't me, regardless of whether it was her job or not. She told me she probably wouldn't go back, and everything was going well until this Sunday.

We were talking on the phone, and had been making plans for the upcoming weekend when she told me that she would be going back to stripping. This really caught me by surprise and when I asked why, she told me ""Its just what I feel like doing."" I reiterated how I felt about her stripping and she told me that it had ""nothing to do with you."" This made me feel awful.  

I ended up breaking up with her, but I've been absolutely devastated since then. This really blindsided me, since I had assumed she was done and knew how much it upset me. There's nothing wrong with being a stripper, but it's not really relationship-appropriate. Like I said, I'm not a jealous type, but dating a stripper will bring it out in almost anyone. I just feel as if this isn't how you behave with somebody you truly love. 

I think if she really cared about me, after a certain amount of time in a relationship, she would drop the work to better the relationship. Maybe after 5 months or so, it would be reasonable to say that if she was really serious about the relationship, she'd be willing to admit the line of work is not really conducive to a healthy relationship. 

I didn't ask her to leave behind a career, there are plenty of other ways to make money that wouldn't hurt me so much, but I really was in love with her, and I guess I had assumed that she would prioritize me and our relationship over stripping for other men. I guess I could use some outside opinions on whether I was being unreasonable, (I really don't think I was), and advice on how to move on.





tl;dr: Girlfriend started stripping and I left, I've been really devastated since then"

**Who I am**: 21 years old, male, moving to DC on May 16th to intern at an office in Dupont Circle. I'm very outgoing and looking for somebody to hang out with / go to bars with / exist with after work and on the weekends. I'm very neat--I'll make sure my shit isn't lying around all over your house.

**Who you are**: early-mid 20s, male or female (don't really care), also outgoing and wouldn't mind making a new friend over the summer. You're driven, not addicted to any controlled substances, and follow the work hard / play hard mentality (though nights with Netflix are absolutely okay and encouraged).

**What I'm looking for**: my own room, located in DC itself. I'm not too picky about location, but the easier to get to Dupont Circle, the better (bonus points if you're on the red line). Preferably in a location within walking distance to shops, bars, restaurants, etc.

**How much will I pay you**: depends on your room / where you're located. I'd like to stick around $1,000/month, but I can be a little flexible either way. I'm happy to put a security / reservation deposit down before moving in.

**Other things**: Would like a parking space, but definitely not required. I have a dog, but I can leave him with friends for the summer if need be.

If you or a friend may have a room available, please message me and let me know. Thanks!"

I liked the place very much, professional culture, good hours, good pay (A little boring, but its a software engineering internship so what can you expect) and at the end, they told me that I'd be welcome to come back next summer. So during fall semester, thanks to Linkedin, I saw that my old manager, who had originally interviewed me last summer, had become the Software Engineering Manager at a much larger well known company. He also, about 2 months ago, emailed me, explaining that he had moved companies, and asked if I'd be interested in a summer internship at the big company. I said yes, and he told me to apply and he would try to get my resume through for an interview. Because this obviously wasn't guaranteed, I also made contact with the small company I worked for in the summer. They remembered me and were very nice, but said that I would have to fill out another application. I did, and received an email from the new manager, who I knew and had worked with last summer as well, saying:

Good Morning -----,

Received your application and am happy you're thinking of rejoining us this summer. As I need to plan activities, I'll need to know what day your semester ends and when you'll be available.

I emailed him back when semester ends and what day I'd be able to start.

So about a month later, I followed up telling him I was still interested and would like to know what the interview/hiring process is for returning employees. He emailed back

Good morning -----,

I have already started the process with HR. I expect to see you on May 4th (the date I gave him). If you have any questions please contact HR or myself.

What I was hoping to find out was whether or not I should be expecting an interview or if I would just get back to work. I didn't want to keep emailing him and sound overbearing so I decided to just let it ride until closer to the date. However, a few days ago I got a call from the large companies headquarters, saying they would like to interview me. The interview is with my old boss who was very easy to interview with before so I'm decently confident I'll do fine and may even get the gig. However, my question now is, have I committed myself to the first company already? If I don't take the big internship, what if I get there on May 4th and it's just an interview and I may not get the job. To be clear, I don't have a written offer with pay and schedule details. If I did, I would know that they're expecting me to work on May 4th. My question now is, where should I go from here. Obviously try to do well in the big interview, but if I get a real offer (pay and schedule) do I take that and risk burning bridges with the first company who might think that I'm committed to working for them?

Thanks for any advice!

30be5p,8,2015-03-25,Everything is falling apart with my(22F) sister (24F). She hates and judges me with all her being and said that she won't have to ever see me after 2 months.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/30be5p/everything_is_falling_apart_with_my22f_sister_24f/,"Let's call my sister Emily. We grew up together and always had this love hate relationship even since we were very little. Then we ended up going to the same college living in the same dorm. We had different roommates though. During this time, she dated a guy who went to a different college but would visit her often and stay in her dorm room for a few days every time he came. Seeing my older sister do that, I figured she was accepting of that so I started letting my boyfriend (who lived on the same dorm floor as me) sleep over in my room. A few months later, Emily and the boyfriend broke up. He was overly obsessed with her, was manipulative, and Emily wasn't comfortable with it. Fast forward 2 years, we got an apartment together. This is when things started getting shitty. I started dating my BF right now (let's call him Jake) about a year ago. She never liked the idea of me having a boyfriend and absolutely hated the fact that Jake would stay over at our apartment occasionally. After about 3 months of me dating Jake, Emily started giving hints to my parents that I sleep with Jake in our apartment often. Now my parents would NEVER be okay with the idea so instead of talking to me about it first, she started ""threatening"" me by almost telling mom and dad. That freaked me out so Emily and I had a talk about how Jake and I will hang out at our apartment but he won't stay overnight and I am allowed to stay at his apartment overnight. It was like my parents living with me giving me guidelines to live my college life. But I had to deal with it so I accepted the deal. Despite our talk, Emily would still tell my parents how she never wants to have kids because kids these days are out of control and the things they do disgusts her (dating, premarital sex, sleeping together, etc.) which would make anyone think that she's talking about me doing all those things. She kept on doing that so I started allowing Jake to stay the night since Emily had broken the deal already. With all this tension in our relationship, she singed a lease to a different apartment starting next year and I am getting another roommate to live with starting next year. 

My parents don't want us to do this because they think siblings should live together but Emily does not want to. I never had a problem living with her but she does. She wants me to follow her norms, her beliefs, and if I don't, I'm filthy. When she had a guy over to sleep in her bed, it was fine but it's not okay if I do it. She says that she learned her lesson and that she doesn't want me to have a shitty experience like her so she's trying to protect me. I feel suffocated by the way she tries to control me. Being able to live on my own, I was expecting more freedom. Plus, I am an adult too. I know what is right and what is wrong. But she thinks she knows better and tried to control me which I can't handle. Because of this, we've only been saying a few words here and there when necessary to each other. It's like we're not even sisters. It makes me sad but every time I come home from Jake's or after Jake leaves our apartment, I can sense absolute pure hatred towards me from Emily. She looks at me with the most disappointed look and looks away if I see her. 

Today, she was on the phone with mom in her room and I was sitting in mine. Mom was telling her how she only has 2 months to live in this apartment and with me because she is interning for this company in a different city. To this, she said that she can't be happier that she never has to see my face again and that she is happier about that than the fact that she got a good internship for the summer. I was hurt. 

I don't know if it's my fault for ruining the good relationship I had with Emily before I started dating Jake or if it's just her being too controlling. I feel guilty and judged. Should I just ignore her? How do I handle this situation and her dirty looks towards me so that I don't feel guilty and sad every time I see her? Anyone in a similar situation? Any suggestions?

tl;dr Sister hates me and gives me disgusting looks because I have a boyfriend and said she can't wait till she never has to look at my face again."

30brnf,1,2015-03-25,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Pegging, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/30brnf/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_pegging/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I'm 25 and about 6' 1"" with dark brown hair and steel gray eyes. I'm a hard worker but I still know how to have fun. I spend a lot of my spare time reading.. One more thing, I'm a wizard. But being a wizard is not all it’s cracked up to be. I have to spend long hours with my nose in moldy books. It takes a long time to master different areas of magic. I know mostly conjuration spells. Most wizards only stick with one area but I plan on learning offensive and defensive magic. So far I have learned a couple of miscellaneous spells that are really helpful. I work as a student of sorts in a large office building in a secret top floor dedicated to the International Magic Federation or I.M.F. I am currently trying to learn as many defensive and offensive spells as possible because i unleashed a demon of insurmountable power. 

 It all started about a week ago. I had gotten there much earlier than the rest of the staff because I wanted to practice some summoning spells.  I had gotten a very old spell book from an ancient library. I was trying to practice summoning beings. I started with a gnome then after successfully completing that I summoned a djin and then I came across a spell that had no description. It didn't have a title or say exactly what it summoned. It had an dark aura about it.That should have been enough to tell me not to use that spell. My gut told me to close the book and throw it away but I was anxious to test my skill. So, I did the worst thing I possibly could. I spoke the spell aloud closing my eyes and concentrating hard on the text. And lucky me it worked. 

The lights suddenly flickered off and the sun peering in the windows quickly faded away. I couldn't see my hand in front of my face. Then the voices came. Well that's the best way I can describe the sounds. Sounds of terror, pain, and torment ripped through the air. It was as if the air itself was screaming in my ears. But there was one noise that differed from the rest. A sound like a huge oak being ripped out of the ground. It cackled with a sickening joy. It's voice seemed to rattle with power.  I blindly ran to the general area I thought the door was at. I was horribly mistaken. I bumped headlong into a wall of flesh. There was no telling how big exactly It was but it was definitely muscular. It had dry almost reptile-like skin. I wasted no time inspecting it further. I turned around and ran the other direction. I bumped into plenty of things on my way across the room. Slime blood and grime covered my shirt that had been mostly shredded by a particularly spiny fiend.
 
My face smacked into an air vent. Knowing that this would be my best chance of escape I ripped of the cover, wriggled into the tight space and started crawling. 



Chapter 1
I crept through the air ducts trying to be as quiet as possible. But I knew it wouldn't matter how hard I tried. It would hear me and It would continue to pursue me. I came across a vent. I kicked it open and immediately wished I hadn't. Three fully grown boargronks stared up at me with bulging black eyes.

Their ugly dark green faces splattered with the dried blood of their previous victims. Short stubby tusks protruded from their mouths like mandibles. Their pig snouts seemed at home on their wretched faces but the tentacles hanging from their backs seemed out of place. Had the legion of demons already spread this far? One of the boargronks let out a sharp squeal and hurled a pitchfork at me. The other two bent over to pick up their weapons. (A spear made of a sharpened broomstick and a rusty pipe.)  I didn't wait around to see what they had planned for me. Right about now I was wishing I had studied defensive conjuration spells. 

I came upon another vent. I kicked this one in as well although not without checking the rooms contents first. I fell onto a big oak conference table surrounded by leather chairs. It must have been on about the 30th floor. I could estimate by looking out the window that was the east wall. I scurried across the table and over to the window. I pulled a small blue knife from my shoe. This had been found in an egyptian tomb and was enchanted with many magical properties. I didn't even know everything it was capable of. In one fluid movement I jabbed at the window and jumped out without a moment of hesitation. 

“magnus avis volare!”

I summoned a pair of wings to aid me in my descent. I had only flown twice before. I flew a few blocks and landed hard on the roof of a gas station. I climbed down a maintenance ladder and quickly made my way to a car. I snapped my fingers and the doors unlocked. Most spells have to be spoken aloud but with a lot of practice simple ones can be merely thought of and then initiated with a physical action.

“ignire nent moveret”

A quick charm and the car came roaring to life.  I pulled out of the parking lot much to the discontent of the owner. 
 I got onto a freeway and whispered an auto pilot spell.

“Auto coegi iuvencum”.

This had proven to be very handy to a busy wizard such as I. I conjured a big leather bound book with rotting pages. I flipped through it until I found something that fit the description of what I had encountered. I knew the name of It now. Xondeviar. Just whispering the name brought an uncomfortable chill into the car, but I continued reading. I had to know exactly what I had done. 

 Xondeviar is an ancient demon lord. It was locked in another realm because it tried to destroy the human race. It has an army of demons which I also unleashed and he can control people's minds if he gets them to eat his DNA. And no metal can penetrate his skin. Great. He has an army, controls minds and guns are useless on him. My car swerved to the left to avoid hitting a minivan. I grabbed the wheel, discharged the autopilot spell and headed in the direction of my old mentors house. 

I knocked on the door and it opened by itself before I was even done knocking. 

""Come in Jack.""

His voice was quiet but penetrating like he was speaking to my brain instead of my ears. Simon was a master in the area of sight.  He saw a lot of things and this made him very knowledgeable. He was about twenty years older than me but he was still in great shape. His dark red robe made him look like he was posing for a painting in his high backed armchair. 

"" Hey, Simon I need some help”.

“I know that and you know that I know that”.

“So you know what got unleashed”.

“Of course I do”. He didn't seem upset.

“What do I do now?”.

“Well, we, as wizards, have two choices watch as the demon you unleashed destroys the world or kill it before it has the chance.”, he said matter-of-factly.

“But I thought it was sent to another dimension because it couldn't be defeated?”.

“Thats where youre wrong. It was sent to another realm because that was easier than defeating it. And now without a single magician trained in that area of expertise and so many young minds indulging in the art of offensive magic it would be easier to kill it.”

“Well then i guess we should alert the I.M.F.”.

“You don't have to be a seer to know there is a powerful demon with a legion of monsters running a muck in your college of conjuration”.


 

Chapter 2
 My name is Kora. I’m 24 and about 5’ 7” with red hair and blue eyes. I grew up on the streets in London until i had enough money saved up for a plane ticket to the U.S. Here I started my own company that became so successful that I was able to sell it and retire at the age of 22. One more thing, I’m a sorceress. I have always had a knack for magic, that is practically what kept me alive when i was living on the streets.Now I work as a student of sorts in a large office building in a secret top floor dedicated to the International Magic Federation or I.M.F. I’ve been able to learn spells fairly quickly. I am certified in restorative and defensive spells and am currently working on creating my own spell. I hope to write one that will be taught all over the world, something that will put me in history books. I’m glad I learned so many defensive spells because I’m fending off a bunch of demons in my office. 
It started out as a normal day. I was tirelessly slaving over my work. I was about to have a sip of tea when a drop of black slime splashed into the cup. I looked up and was so startled by what I saw that I fell out my chair. 

“ignis tueri clypeus!”

 As I shouted these words my jaw began to vibrate and fire bloomed from my outstretched hands shielding me from the monster leaping from the ceiling.The spider-squid turned to ash as it impacted the shield of flames. I muttered, ”flare frigus extinguit”, and the flaming remains were extinguished. I saw three boargronks charge out of a broom closet and rush towards me. They used their tentacles to throw aside anything that stood in their way, including my unpaid intern who had been cowering behind a chair. I yelled, “mutare locum evanescunt!”, and the three monsters turned into puffs of smoke. 



















this is unfinished. Im looking for feedback before moving on. Let me know if you like it, what you migght change, what you might like to see later in the story, or interesting concepts you think i should include."

From the email they sent me, it seems that the screening interview is just going to be behavioral questions, but I could be completely wrong.

But for the technical interview, I have no idea what they are going to ask. Are these questions going to be coding problems like the interview questions they ask at Google, Microsoft, etc. (for example, ""reverse a string"" or ""find the lowest common ancestor of a binary search tree"")? Or are they going to be more like knowledge-based questions based on particular programming languages? Or something else?

30c07q,1,2015-03-25,Traveling alone,akaryi,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/30c07q/traveling_alone/,"Hey Reddit,

I really really want to see what the rest of the U.S looks like beyond my home state where I've lived and go to school my whole life so I'm trying to plan a trip around the country this coming August. I will be starting off from Fort Worth, Texas where my summer internship will be and at the end of that, I plan to ride the Amtrak train using a rail pass towards the West Coast. My intentions are to stop along the major cities that Amtrak services while checking out some of the famous landmarks and any other worthy places to visit as I happen to come across. I'll be riding the Amtrak through California up to Washington then towards the East Coast along the Midwest Coast, passing through Chicago all the way back to New York.

Problem is that I don't really have much friends who can readily come along with me so its going to be a solo trip which makes me terrified to be honest. I've never done something like this before so I'm wondering what are your suggestions to go about doing this? How easy is it to meet and get along with strangers especially on Amtrak? I was thinking about staying at places on Airbnb but I've heard mixed reviews about it being a bonding experience and more being just business as you're paying the host. I want to be able to hang out with new people, go on adventures, learn how the locals live, take pictures and the like. I looked into couchsurfing as well but it seems like these days, the reviews about it have been going downhill and of course, I do want to be as safe as possible. 

I guess my biggest concern is not being able to meet people to have fun with and end up just walking around by myself which is perfectly okay, don't get me wrong but I do want to end up making new friends along the trip!

Let me know your thoughts, thanks!"
30c12s,0,2015-03-25,Back to square one,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/30c12s/back_to_square_one/,"I had a fuck buddy for almost a year. I know this might sound hard to believe, but I was literally in love with him. He was the type of guy that I liked before I had even met. and the sex was just amazing.

I knew that he was hooking up with other people, but I wasn't really jealous because I still had sex with him a lot. He had told me a few times that he's not a relationships guy and his #1 priority was his career/school/etc. Well, one day, my friend saw him walking around with another girl, and she told me. This was just a few days after we had sex. I didn't want to jump to conclusions but it bothered me so much because I didn't want him to just end our relationship without even telling me why. I figured that if he wanted to actually date someone, he should at least give me some closure and end the relationship. I couldn't handle not knowing, so one night, I got really emotional in front of him and that was the night that we ""broke up"". He was really comforting and nice to me, and he felt really bad. He told me about how he knew he was an asshole, and this always happened, and he's not capable of having relationships, and he's fucked over so many girls, and that I didn't deserve to be treated the way I was by him, etc. 

It was sad but I was starting to get over it. Then a few weeks later, I found out he had a new girlfriend (the same girl from before), and I realized I wasn't over it at all. I can't even count how many times I cried about it. For almost six months, this was constantly on my mind. 

However, I still pushed through and I still tried to do things that made me happy. I have talked to and slept with other guys (haven't found a special connection yet though). I exercise regularly, I'm confident in the way I look. I made advancements in my career. I'm having so much fun with my friends. I also got offered two super well paying summer internships. I was finally finally finally starting to feel like myself again, and like I didn't need him. I told myself that maybe in a few months, I would maybe talk to him; if it's meant to be, it will be, but for now i wouldn't worry about it. This was just a few weeks ago. things were looking up..

Then, after having literally no contact/communication with him at all for 6 months, last week, he texts me. I replied and tried to get a hold of him to see what he wanted but he never replied. I asked him today (because it was really bothering me) and it turns out it was just a drunk text and he was horny. He's still with his girlfriend, so I'm assuming she was out of town or something. 

For some reason, I feel so disgusted and even physically sick just thinking about this. He is fully aware of our history &amp; how I felt towards him at one point. I'm sure that if he wanted to cheat on his girlfriend, he could have picked anyone else....he's not unattractive at all and he knows that. I put so much effort into getting over him over these past several months and didn't talk to him once. I never once ""drunk texted"" him. It killed me to know he had a girlfriend but I at least had the satisfaction that he was happy and I respected his relationship so I didn't want to interfere. I wish he hadn't texted me because for some reason it's causing the feelings to resurface. This whole week I was wondering why he texted me (though I was 90% sure...I just had to hear it from him to make sure). I feel like I'm back to square one and it's gonna take me several months to recover from this blow :( 

This is just a vent but any advice/thoughts would be appreciated. "
30c3e5,0,2015-03-25,Bf(24m) of a year asking me to move in with him...I'm(26f) hesitant,hellotoots,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/30c3e5/bf24m_of_a_year_asking_me_to_move_in_with/,"We met in grad school and are both currently working at the same company as interns. Being interns, we both don't have the best pay but it's better than minimum wage. 

I'm currently living at home with my parent and he is too. Unfortunately, his family is planning on moving in the next month or so to another city hours away. If he moves with them, he will be quitting this internship and it's looking like we'll be breaking up (since he is strongly against any LDR).

Lately, the only talks about him staying here have basically boiled down to ""I can't afford to live here on my own and I'm mad that I feel like I'm taking all the financial risk in not moving with my family while you sit back at home not worrying about rent."" He doesn't want to live with random roomates, he doesn't feel he has good enough friends here, he only wants to either live with me or live alone by himself.

I try to put myself in his shoes money wise, and if my numbers for budgeting aren't too far off, I can live off of the same income by myself and still have about 300 dollars to spare. I could probably save more too since I personally would consider living with random roommates to save for a bit.

I have never lived on my on, outside of my family's house. I've grown up in a frugal household and I'm confident that I wouldn't be a horrible roommate (can clean, cook, laundry, basic stuff). Right now, I'm mostly concerned about saving money so when I do land that job (which may require moving to the opposite side of the country) I'll have enough saved to comfortably move without having to empty my account. 

I still pay for gas, some groceries, credit card bills, etc. on my own, but I'm saving a lot living at home now. It's hard to logically justify spending money to move only 10-20mins away from home. On top of that, I feel the need to be close to home in case there are emergencies. My parents do not read or speak english well so I constantly go through their mail to help them look at bills, or fix miscellaneous problems.

We have been dating for a year, but I'm not at the point where I feel like moving in together is going to progress our relationship. Honestly, it feels a lot like there has been this pressure of move in with me mostly because he can't afford to live alone and refuses to live with roommates (people he doesn't know).

I'm not sure how to approach it. I've tried talking with him (for the past few months now), but it always ends up him viewing it as I don't want to take any financial risk by living at home, and he's taking the entire burden. I even did research every few days to help him look for something affordable. I'm not opposed to moving in with him, I would just rather it not be under these circumstances where I feel I'm only needed cause I can provide money.


Can anyone share some advice or experiences with this?


TLDR: I want to save money living at home and being close to my parents. I also am not sure if moving in together is really the ""next step."" It doesn't really feel that way. If I don't move in with him, the chances are very high that we'll be breaking up (I would like to avoid this).

Edit: thank you all for the insight. It's definitely given me more to think about."
30c3t5,11,2015-03-25,Dog at my new Internship growls and barks at me when I talk to it's owner,numb_doors,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/30c3t5/dog_at_my_new_internship_growls_and_barks_at_me/,"Title says it all. I started my new internship last week and at first the dog was ok, it smelled me, I let it smell my hand, pet it, scratched it's ears etc... everything was fine. But every time I would talk to it's owner, the dog would run up from it's bed and growl and bark at me. Sometimes I'd have to go on errand runs and when  I come back, the dog would growl and bark at me when I'm at the door. Everytime it barks the owner would be like ""heey stop its ok shes your friend"" but nothing really assertive. 


Is there anything you guys can suggest to me? I feel very uncomfortable. I'm just starting out this new job  learning the ropes and everytime I talk my boss it would bark and growl like it's calling me out. It's a young dog, and I think it's very protective of it's owner and very territorial. Probably not socialized well since it is in NYC and the owners don't seem the type to bring it to a doggie park every few days.  

When I was there, I was the only 'new' person in the office so I didn't see how the dog would react to other strangers. Do I just have to wait for it to get used to me?  Is there anything you guys would recommend me doing? I don't think i can train this dog or give it treats since its not mine, but I feel like if it keeps doing this I'm going to have to quit since I don't feel comfortable working in a place where I could be bitten or be interrupted by a over protective territorial dog."
30ci45,3,2015-03-26,"CMV: Temperance Brennan (from TVs Bones) is either a poorly written genius, or a well written moron.",Curlaub,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/30ci45/cmv_temperance_brennan_from_tvs_bones_is_either_a/,"Temperance Brennan, (nicknamed ""Bones""), is presented to the viewer as some sort of hyper-intelligent, ultra-rational, ""pure"" scientist. Within the first few episodes of the series, she is shown being very proficient in martial arts, the spanish language, and she has three Doctorates (in anthropology, forensic anthropology and kinesiology).

First of all, none of those is an indicator of intelligence. A PhD, for example, does not mean you are any more intelligent than anyone else. Its more indicative of hard work than intellect.

Second, she frequently says or does things that are either illogical, irrational or just stupid.

Example, there's this episode with an underground community of homeless people in the sewers and they're trying to find this hidden treasure that some dude was killed for. Booth, Bones and Goodman are all standing around this hologram of the sewer tunnels and Goodman is like, ""Hmm, inductive, deductive or reductive?"" Referring to how their reasoning will proceed. Bones selects deductive and they start trying to figure out where the treasure could be. Booth comes up with a totally legit and helpful idea and they reject his idea because it was inductive reasoning, not deductive, as they had agreed. Wft? They're not playing Jeapordy, they're trying to catch a killer and they're going to turn away helpful leads because they're not phrased according to the essentially arbitrary criterion you set three seconds ago? Morons.

Example, Bones' intern, Zack, is looking at some dead guy and he's like, ""I guess his number was up... I never understood that phrase, by the way. Your number's up. A number can't be 'up' because quantifiable values are blah blah blah blah blah blah."" Booth is like, ""How do you listen to this all day?"" and Bones is like, ""I find intelligence soothing."" That's not intelligence. He's not super intelligent just because he can't understand common colloquialisms. If he's so smart, can't he just take a wild guess at what it means? Like when you're waiting around somewhere and your number is called, meaning that it is your turn to undergo whatever it is your waiting for. This kid is working on two PhDs simultaneously, and you're telling me he's never sat in line at the DMV? And Bones sees this inability to connect the context in which this phrase s typically used with a common, real-life experience and she thinks this is intelligence?

Example, Bones is shown giving a TV interview for a book she wrote. Later in the episode, she meets some lady for the first time and the lady goes, ""Oh, was that you I saw on TV today?"" and Bones is like, ""How am I supposed to know what you were watching on TV today?"" Seriously? You can't just assume that by the very fact that's she's asking, that, Yes, she saw you on TV?

Example, it is a pretty common theme in her personality and social interactions that she is ""too literal"" and this is often portrayed when somebody uses a metaphor or something and she *invariably* does not understand it. Being literal, to the extent that Bones is, is not a sign of being rational or intelligent. It is a sign that you haven't evolved enough to have achieved abstract thought.

Example, her ""rationality"" is totally inconsistent. There's this episode with a voodoo curse and this voodoo priest is like, ""Hey lady, you've been cursed,
 and Bones is like, ""I dont believe that. Religion is irrational."" Then, like 30 seconds later, Booth is like, ""Man, I don't believe in all that voodoo stuff,"" and Bones totally flips and goes, ""Well, now hold on a second. You only feel that way because modern judeo-christian views khsblhb;suj;us;jvsj db."" And then later on in the same episode she flips right back to, ""Voodoo is bunk.""

Another example of her inconstancy is her view of Psychology. Once they introduce the character, Sweets, the Psychologist, she frequently gives him a hard time about how Psychology is a ""soft"" science and Sweets isn't a real scientist and blah blah blah, and yet Bones frequently makes use of theories of human nature and behavior when trying to solve crimes, the roots of which are Psychology. 

Now, I know it's addressed later on in the series that Bones uses logic and rationality as an emotional shield, but as pervasive as these problems are, it seems that she's not just emotionally distant. She's a moron. In fact, this aspect, that her ""intellect"" is just a guise, seems to be a subtle admission by the writers that she is not actually all that intelligent. She's just wearing a mask.

If this is not the case, and the writers are genuinely attempting to write a genius character, then they are doing a poor job. That being said, let me just put out there that I do not mean that as a shot against the show or its writers. Strangely, I actually really like the show, but I'd be willing to bet that no one on the writing team for the show has three PhDs, nor are they hyper-rational, purely scientific geniuses. They are attempting to write a character with which they have no personal connection, so the shallow nature of the character will come through.

In other words, she is either written well as a moron, or poorly as a genius.

I have tried to be as supportive as i can when it comes to this doubts. However she has express that they are getting bigger. What can I do to help her overcome this doubts or bring some kind of resolution to them. 

Taking a break has been an idea if so how long should it be and what should be the goal/desire outcome?

Other solution which although is sad is there would be to have a break up.

The money can potentially be amazing, but I'll need another 2 years before I can start making some good money. I'll sit in class or in my internship and day dream about computer programming and ways to improve the inefficiency.

What would you do if you were in my shoes. Finish the degree while continuing to  volunteering at hospital for experience and hopefully a job? Then change careers? Am I being a fool by abandoning a 35k masters degree that potentially has good job prospect? It's just so difficult to get experience in health care. At least with programming I can get experience by practicing and working on projects. 

My mind is so scattered. I have regrets about this masters program. My true love is in computer, technology, and programming. I've done codecademy and Khan academy and loved every second of it. 

[Edit] Sorry for the rant. 

Edited 3.27.15: Thank you everyone for the amazing answers and insights!"

30d9xw,9,2015-03-26,Seeking financial assistance while out of work due to surgery/complications from surgery,Pynkpyg1234,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/30d9xw/seeking_financial_assistance_while_out_of_work/,"Hello Reddit!

I posted back in the fall seeking assistance for my parents to fix up their home. I was not at my 90 day point, so I could not seek anything but advice.

I am a 5th year senior due to graduate in May with 165 credits (only need 120 to graduate) because I transferred and the school had no program I could fit neatly into. My parents have had a really hard time in retirement (dad) and not being able to retire (mom). The one thing I know would destroy them is if I don’t finish this semester. At this point, it may be a dead body graduating May. 

At the same time I was hoping to help my parents fix up their house, I was diagnosed with carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome in both arms. I was scheduled to have surgery on Nov 3, 2014, but I pushed it back to Dec 15, 2014, so I could finish the fall semester and not disrupt my academics. At the time I had a 3.9 gap and was still hoping to preserve it. So the semester ended with a literal bang ( cracked my head open in class trying to open a window, needed seven staples and may have a brain injury, who could tell haha) and I had the first surgery on my right arm. It was successful and then 2 weeks later I had my left done. That was Dec 29, 2014. This was when the trouble began.

I knew that something was not right, I had a lot of pain and numbness that was not present in my right arm after surgery. 6 weeks out and the EMG test said the ulner nerve in my left arm was WORSE than before surgery and declining. The only options were to live with it and lose the use of my left arm or get another surgery or wait until the summer. I had to make a choice knowing that any choice was not ideal. I was also prescribed gabapentin and that was making me googly eyed so I had to get this resolved for my sanity. I was becoming increasingly suicidal because I couldn’t function or work. I had not worked my one of two jobs since october when the symptoms  got really bad (worked as a route setter for a rock gym in PA and at the university I attend) The stress has been daunting and Camus would agree that this shit is just absurd. 

So I schedule the surgery for March 2nd and the the friday before surgery, Feb 27 2015, I get a letter form my insurance company (IBX via ACA in PA) that my wife was kicked from our coverage effective March 1st! I was losing the subsidy and cost sharing, so surgery on tuesday would be not $40 co-pay, but $700 co-pay. 

As a college student, with a joint income of less than 15,000 a year, this was a disaster. I had to postpone the surgery and spend the next week trying to figure it out. PA expanded medicaid in 2015, so last year in PAwe were not eligible for Medicaid but this year we are. In Dec when we applied, there was a mistake on PA’s side and we were denied mistakenly, so we were put back in the plan we had or reenrolled automatically. 

After waiting close to 5 hours at the public assistance office, and not taking no for an answer, I was able to get answers and found out they had messed up. We could have gotten benefits since the new year, but better late than never. So we now have insurance via our Access card until we get our insurance cards from the state.  So I thought everything was going to be settled. I scheduled the surgery for Mar 12th 2015, and they went in and found that the original transposition had kinked the nerve and was causing the issue. They did a sub muscular transposition and hoped that would fix it. (still to soon to tell, but the 2nd degree nerve damage takes a while to heal) 

I know nothing about malpractice, but I do know that i was worse after surgery and they confirmed that the first surgery had a complication/mistake. I don’t think I could sue anyone to begin with, but I know it would make my wife feel better. 

Sooooo:

I have 1 month left of this, my last semester, and I am still messed up, can’t work and financially am on a conveyor belt, where I see at the end, getting crushed by the rock crusher (of student loans and rent) at the end  of Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom.

We have rent enough for April and May but then the savings is gone. I am asking for financial assistance to get us through the summer, while my wife finishes her masters degree. She has an unpaid internship in the summer and needs it to graduate. I don’t know when I could route set again, if ever, and I am also a musician, and may never be able to play guitar(can only play Em and A right now) or piano. I am trying to put a show together to get out of the rock climbing industry (route setting/belay slaving) but I am not at my best right now, and I am a full-time student with all these medical problems right now.

I have a gofundme

Here are my two websites that talk about me and what I have been trying to do/accomplished

www.riggitup.org

www.adamfoizen.weebly.com

It never hurts to ask and at this point I have nothing to lose

Thank you!

TL;DR  2 surgeries w/ complication led to 3rd surgery; lost income from 1 job and full time student, need help financially to get through the summer until my wife graduates and I can get back to work, need to graduate so I can help my parents (original assistance post back in the fall) and not kill them both in one fell swoop. They need to see me graduate, while they are here on earth. "

Sorry if this is kind of long. I'm a junior undergrad studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering. 

My gpa is ~3.27
I have one semester of research experience, but that sort of ended awkwardly so I'm hoping to move on past that. 

Right now I have an opportunity to do unpaid Java development for Android apps in a lab on campus over the summer. I'll need to work part time somewhere else to make ends meet, of course. 

My question is this: without any significant internship experience (my only internship was unrelated IT work), should I consider doing a senior thesis just to have something on my resume? 

I'm not sure about grad school. I was planning to take the GRE's just to keep getting a masters degree as an option. 

Would a thesis project be worth the addition time and stress? 

Should I be worried about doing unpaid summer research and start looking for something else last minute? "
30dq8v,1,2015-03-26,I [23/M] got a job offer and will have to move away from my [23/F] girlfriend in June,taway626,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/30dq8v/i_23m_got_a_job_offer_and_will_have_to_move_away/,"Some backstory, my girlfriend and I first met in college and have now been dating for almost 4 years. The past 1.5 years have been a sort of long distance relationship. I am staying and pursuing my MS and she has been working at a fantastic job 2 hours away. This hasn't been a problem for us, my family and friends live in the city she works and I live in the same city as her parents. We see each other every weekend and thats how its been for the past 1.5 years. 

Now I'm about to finish up my degree and have been on the job hunt for the past few months. I had only been looking in the city where she works and had a few interviews but with no luck. Then, this opportunity came up for an opening at a company where it has been my dream to work. I applied (just because I felt I couldn't pass up the chance) and sure enough I ended up getting it. Now, it's officially just an internship for the summer, but from what my (now future) boss has told me there is a very strong chance for it to turn into a full-time job. This is located in a neighboring state and is about a 2 hour plane flight.

I accepted their offer and informed my girlfriend the next day (which was a week ago). That did not go well. We have been talking about it since and some days she feels better while others seem like a total panic attack. We have done something similar before where I had a summer internship on the other side of the country , and although that sucked, it wasn't too difficult to make it through that. The only difference is that had a guaranteed end date. Once it was over I was coming back home to start grad school. Now, there may not be an end date which is what worries us both.

There is no way I want to end things and from what my gf has been saying, she feels the same way. We have brought up potential outcomes about her moving to where I could possibly be or me turning down the full time offer and returning home. All of which would mean some pretty big sacrifices/compromises from us both. Any advice an questions we should ask each other, things to say, or general comments would be greatly appreciated. And yes, we have discussed marriage/a proposal but both think we are too young and wouldn't have that big of an influence on the current situation."
30dqim,1,2015-03-26,Nothing in life prepared me to watch my parents struggle.,tro_wa_wei,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/30dqim/nothing_in_life_prepared_me_to_watch_my_parents/,"We were lucky.  My parents always had work while I was growing up.   

We had to move a couple of times so they could find work. I remember my mom's side ventures to make some extra money aside from her main job. Amway, sewing, tutoring...  And during the worst of it I remember my dad working graveyard shifts at a 7eleven while still working a day job.  I remember visiting once late at night while he was at the register and thinking ""That's my dad! I can just take this Flinstone's push-pop and not even pay for it!"".  Yeah, 4yo me learned something that day.  

They were educated. They both held college degrees through all this.  They eventually found decent jobs and settled in for a good 20 years.  We never went without food or Christmas presents. We were fortunate.  Then, just as I graduated college, the economy tanked. My dad got let go, just like that.  He had to take some managing job that involved traveling. This company ended up sending him to Libya to supplement a construction boom and train the locals so they could take over the positions after a few years. He actually took a liking to his new environment. And my family got split up.  My mom was suddenly alone and I never liked that.  

That's when they discovered my dad's cancer.  It was a strange stroke of luck, believe it or not.  It was such a rare kind of cancer that his work medical plan covered almost all of the expenses.  They flew him out to this nice hospital in New York to have it removed.  It was super ritzy.  We all met and stayed with him during the surgery and part of the rehabilitation. There were some iffy moments but after about two weeks they let him go back to the hotel.  It took him a while to get used to his missing chunk of muscle fibers. But eventually he got the hang of it.  And that's when the revolution happened.  

Libyans overthrew Gaddafi and all hell broke loose. The company evacuated its housing and staff as quickly as they could. Everything my father left behind when he left for his cancer operation was lost. But he was healthy, he was safe, home and unemployed.  

People his age just don't get hired in this economy.  So he stayed home taking small jobs here and there but they barely come around. Maybe once every 5~6 months, if that. He never got used to being out of work.  It really shows.  And the burden was shifted to my mother.  It's been that way for over three years now.  Taking care of her own dying parents and being the bread winner in the household.  Now she just found out she's losing her job in a few months.  

People their age just don't get hired in this economy.  They've been aggressively job hunting for years. Nobody calls back. They're educated, experienced, professional... old.  

Nothing ever prepared me for this.  I'm the family fuckup that will always live paycheck to paycheck.  I'm what that weird, depressed teenager turned into.  This is the best I could do. I fell for all the bullshit my for-profit college sold me and went for that $75,000 four-year degree in a field that doesn't really exist.  But at least they had internships, right?  Heck, they even had a ""Career Placement Department""!  They loved to use the term 'hiring freeze'.  It took me a few years but I'm finally stable and paying back my loans. I love my job and my simple life. I'm happy with who I am.  I deserve where I am.  But my parents did everything right.  

Nothing in life ever prepared me to watch them suffer. I feel so utterly helpless.  I live outside of the country so I barely even get to see them anymore.  I miss them.  I don't know where I'm going with this.  I just needed to get things off my chest.  This just wasn't the news I was expecting to hear when she called to say 'Happy Birthday'."

My lifestyle's changed a lot since I found a job and moved out. I exercise often, make my own meals, and feel healthier overall. No more of my mom's weird diets or being force-fed large amounts of food. I was at my heaviest when I was living at home, stressed out and depressed.

I stepped on a scale after three months and discovered I was significantly lighter. Before, I was pushing 160 lbs (slightly overweight for a tall female like myself) and now I'm at a manageable 140-142. 

I called my mom later about it, telling her I lost somewhere around 20 lbs. She said ""So what are you know, around 140?"" (yeah, she's knows my weight) Laughing, she added ""How about making it 135?"" 

What?! I've been obsessive about my weight and appearance because of my mom, and that's what she says to me?

Okay, she apologized after. She was sorry. Then she congratulated me, but this whole thing is bothering me.
I'm sad that so much of my (and my mom's) happiness is directly related to my body mass.

I came here for advice, and suggestions on which build path to take. I really (sorry) don't want suggestions on better windows pc's for the price, etc.

I have 3 Routes I can take for the MacBook. Assume money is not a problem, but is being considered.

Option A)

My best friend bought a laptop for his new internship in Ohio. He bought and customized a MacBook with a 3.1Ghz processor, 16GB RAM, and 256GB memory, and it has Retina Display. He bought it around Christmas time, with no applecare warranty and it is in like new shape. Turns out he quit the internship for the company, and will be working for a new company in New Jersey that is supplying him with a custom windows PC and he doesn't need the MacBook Pro anymore and wants to sell it for moving and traveling expenses. He is giving me a price of $1,400. 

Option B)
MacBook Pro, New, through a company perks program.
My uncle works at a business which as a perks program, which offers discounts for buying Apple Products.

This option is 13inch Screen(as are all options, sorry if I forgot to mention) with 2.7GHZ processor, 8GB ram, and a 3 year apple care warranty for 1650. It has 256gb Storage.

Option C)
This MacBook Pro is customized, fully loaded.
13 inch screen, 3.1GHZ i7, 16gb Ram, 516gb storage, Retina Display, with 3 year apple care warranty for 2300 bucks.

My dilemma is I want a powerful workhorse Mac, but unsure which option makes the most sense for me. Do I NEED the applecare warranty? Are the upgrades worth the price or can I get by with 2.7Ghz and 8gb RAM? Storage really isnt an issue because I have multiple external hard drives. 

Is the price worth the upgrades? (I.e. 2.7 -&gt; 2.9 - &gt; 3.1Ghz processors?) (8gb-16gb RAM??)


Thank you for any help or input you have. I have no problem buying the one from my friend because I have seen it and it is in great shape, but there is something satisfying about opening and buying a NEW product that feels more correct because of warranties etc. If I am going to be dumping this much money into something I want to make sure I am getting the best and most for what I am paying.

I am a BME Major like him and let me say this. BME majors have the hardest time finding jobs. If you go to the career fairs every semester, there are only 2 companies there for BME which really don't hire you unless you're a 4.0 student with a couple internships and research under your belt. 


BME isn't like IT or CS. IT (just using this major as an example) majors could just walk into any company looking for a job and get it, whether it be a good one or bad one. 

BME on the other hand is extremely different and you've gotta understand that. The problem with BME is that we compete with MechE's. And obviously there are way more MechE's than BME's. If you check any BME focused company (Like Stryker), half of their Engineering staff have a degree in MechE.

I am a sophomore (going on junior) international student studying in the US majoring in Computer Engineering. Recently I applied for internships in my home country, where I'm returning during the summer, and got two offers. Company A manufactures electronics, and their HQ is situated in the state I currently study in, so I could possibly try to intern with them again next year (will be staying here then). The branch in my country, however, is very far from my home. Initially, I asked about accommodation and they told me that they would not provide any, so after a week of consideration I declined the offer. 

Company B is a pretty big consulting firm and is located very near my home, and they offered me an internship in software engineering. However, their US branch does not hire international students for their internships if I wanted to in the future, but I accepted their offer (nothing signed yet, supposed to be receiving an offer letter soon) because I thought I could not work anything out with Company A due to logistics. Suddenly, Company A replied offering me free accommodation at a hotel for the duration of the internship.

As a CompE major, will interning in manufacturing be a lot more beneficial compared to consulting? Also, since I have already accepted Company B's offer, will it look very bad to rescind it now? My family is not supportive of Company A because I am going all the way back home and then leaving them again (though I can manage a few trips back to my city once in a while), and they do not like the idea of me living alone in an unfamiliar state (plus crime rate in my country is... uncomfortably high). However, Company A expressed an interest in potentially hiring me after graduation.

Reading what I wrote, accepting Company A sounds a bit like a no-brainer, but I would really appreciate some input from more experienced people here. Thank you very much!"

I will be interning in the Bay Area until December. Afterwards, my girlfriend (in grad school) plans to fly over and ride with me back to Kentucky (our home state). 

**Date/Length:** It will be around December 17th or so, and we would have up until the next semester of college started (around January 15th). I understand that weather may cause issues during this time.

**About us:** We both love national parks, historical attractions, museums, and great food. I've only been to Nevada/California/Arizona (for a week total). Other than that, I've not been to any states between Missouri and those. She's been to several more out west than I have, including Wyoming/Utah/Colorado/Arizona. We are absolutely willing to zig-zag on the way home. We don't plan on limiting ourselves to the fastest routes east. We would much rather see as much as we can. 

**Budget:** I should have quite a bit in savings after my internship, so money shouldn't be an issue. She and I have been together for 5 years, and this is really the first big trip we will have had together, now that school is wrapping up. So, I want it to be as enjoyable as possible.

**Specific Questions:** I do have a few direct questions about the trip:

1. Do the national parks in the southwest generally operate during this time period? I'm just too unfamiliar with the winter climate of that area to make a judgement.
2. Are there any locations in the Midwest you would recommend?
3. What cities would you recommend visiting? Which would you advise against?

I really appreciate any tips!"

30emgt,2,2015-03-26,Just found this sub and things are maybe making a little more sense...,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/30emgt/just_found_this_sub_and_things_are_maybe_making_a/,"TL;DR: 25, moved back with parents. Don't have a say in what I eat, drink, do, wear or how ""my"" room looks like. Guilt tripped over almost all of these. Don;t have a career my mother wants me to have. Wanted to get things off my chest. I'm sorry about the huge wall of text.


Wow, where to start. Reading some stories it's nothing compared to some of them. I just need to get some things off my chest, hopefully this is the right place to do so (finding this sub made me realise that I might possibly be dealing with Nmom and I might in fact be a normal person).

 I'm almost 25 and recently I moved home. I lived abroad for around 8 years (since I was 16 - I went to a boarding school, then 4 years at university, 1 year masters and 1 year doing a diploma unrelated to my degree) and only came home for holidays. Wow, I already feel bad for even starting to write this, is it normal to feel this way?…

My parents are, in many ways, the best thing that happened to me. I was adopted by them at 1 month old, and it's probably that fact that always overrides everything else and makes me feel worthless about complaining. They gave me great education and opportunities. My father is an amazing man, and in many ways so is my mum. Just not… all ways I guess.


I always thought my mother liked controlling things. Everything needs to go *according to her plan.* There is always a plan for everything, how the day looks like, or the weekend. Or what I will wear. Or eat. Or how tidy my room will be. I was always home for short periods of time and I knew that in a week or a month I'd be away again so I thought it was a lesser evil to not argue with these things - I had plenty of ""freedom"" while not at home. 


I guess I first realised something wasn't exactly right when I was choosing my university degree. I always wanted to draw. I felt I was a big child in many ways so I wanted to illustrate books and maybe make comics for kids. Well that wasn't exactly the hot shot career that my mother had in mind. I listened for weeks about how unhappy she was about it, though never directly, it was always these small *jokes*, or rather passive-agressive comments. 


So in the end I went for a degree in finance. But just a measly degree in finance wasn't enough, if I was gonna do something I didn't want to do at least I was going to aim high (mom will be happy!). I got into a very selective programme with an 18 month internship in the largest auditing company. Well, they were both proud and happy and for a while I thought I was too. Except within the first month of the internship (during my second year) I knew I can't do it. Hours were insane, I slept 4-5h a night maximum, often had to travel for 6h a day… Within a month I told them I was going to drop out of it at the end of the semester and change to normal degree. I will skip the comments that ensued. I went through with it, and ended up doing fine on the normal degree and masters. After that I decided to pursue art after all and applied for a diploma, I got in and my parents agreed to finance it like the rest of my education (I really am lucky). To this day, I hear about what a shame it is that I am not in finance, and how I am always going to be poor, I won't make it as an artist etc. Yes fair enough, I don't have a job yet but I'm trying, and things are looking up. I do work part time as an accountant as well. But ""art is worthless, it's not a job and so on.""


As soon as I get a job I will move out because living here has made me so miserable… For instance, my mother loves sweets and food and eating all the time. I've always had issues with food, went through an eating disorder and food is a big issue. Yet my mother wants to control everything I eat, or rather, she is forcing me to eat (even though I'm overweight!). Ex: mother brings cake to my room. I say no thank you I'm trying not to eat sweets. Queue guilt trip about her buying it specifically for me etc etc. I feel bad, so I eat the cake. Hate myself a little bit more. Same with everything else. She gave me too much soup and I was feeling a bit sick that day. Tell her I can't finish so I'm gonna put it back. She brings another plate out, I think all is well. ""Oh it's a plate for you to be sick into, finish your soup."" …?????


So many more examples to give…. I can't wear what I want. I don't look like a girl in what I want to wear, no one will ever want me, who would want someone looking so trashy and bad? My room is not *MY* room, it's a room in the house (her house) and thus I don't have any privacy. She has a say in where everything is on shelves, opens my wardrobe and has a fit because it's messy. One weekend I was making breakfast for the family and used eggs from a different pack (which was a couple of days fresher, but I didn't know). The other ones were not about to go bad anytime soon. There was a fit for over a week how I do everything I want, I never listen, I should always ask her etc, you can imagine. Over some eggs…. Apparently I did it ON PURPOSE, obviously to make her angry or whatnot.


We have a dog and I walk it once a day. Borrowed her shoes once and stepped in some poo by mistake. Told her I'm going to the basement to wash it. Huge argument: ""WHY did you do this?? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you wearing my shoes? Why did you step in it? You ruined my shoes, did you do it on purpose?!""


When I was moving back home I asked if we can have some talk about rules, living alone for so long I have my own way of doing some things and I don't want to get in her way, hoping we can just coexist. 


**The only rule there is, is that this is my house and my rules apply.** 

I didn't even know what to say. I don't feel like my own person. I feel like a property, and while my situation is nowhere near as bad as some people's and it makes me feel bad for complaining I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you for making me start to realise that I am a person and I can have an opinion. Often  though I feel like I owe them. If they didn't adopt me, what could have happened? Where would I be? I owe them all the huge opportunities they game me. Then I start thinking that I should be more grateful to her for taking time off work and raising me, and therefore maybe she has the right to demand some things. The circle closes, I'm back to square 1 - maybe I'm just really whiney and ungrateful.

Either way thank you for letting me vent here and I hope for all of you things will get better!

I made a few friends with my co workers, but my questions is how can i become more out going and social with my boss and other coworkers?"
30eonp,2,2015-03-26,My ex [20F] &amp; I [22M] recently broke up. Still some passion and desire but we're in a confusing place.,BurnTreesPlease,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/30eonp/my_ex_20f_i_22m_recently_broke_up_still_some/,"This is going to be super hard to type out because I don't even know where to begin but I'm going to try to get all the important information in. There are two main issues which I will detail in the paragraphs below. My ex and I had been going out officially for almost 2 years now (would have been 2 by June) but had been hanging out and casually hooking up for over 3. We were our firsts for most things and it was a strong relationship. No fooling around, lots of passion and devotion.

We're both in school currently and we met right before she went to college and I had been of school for a while because of a suspension. I've always had trouble moving forward with things like this not because I didn't care but because the intimidation of failure and obstacles that stood in my way always discouraged me quite a bit. It made me consider if I had chronic depression because after my suspension I was severely depressed and couldn't do much with myself. But when I met my girlfriend she was a light in my life that motivated me to work hard.
One thing that has to be known is my ex is extremely motivated and driven. She is so passionate in every part of her life it's such a beautiful trait of hers and it motivates me to do the same but doesn't come as naturally to me. Fast forward a two years we've been together for a while and I finally had a few jobs under my belt, a little bit but not much volunteer work and started up at a local community college with plans to transfer after I got my AA or when I felt comfortable enough to be in university. My girlfriend wanted me to start looking for internships because I was 22 years old with no relevant career related experience. At the time I was still technically a freshman and no one wants to hire a freshman in the Chemical Engineering field because I assume the lack of skills required to be competent and effective in completing tasks. She was adamant on this though and we reached a time where we almost broke up because of that. She assumed that I didn't care enough but it was just because I wasn't finding any position with which my credentials were deemed useful. I explained this to her relative to my situation and she suggested I volunteer more for my eventual transfer and so I obliged.

Fast forward a few months after this conversation and my life hits a grinding, pitiful halt. I just finish my Winter 2014 term with all A's however I was terminated from my job because I couldn't make the hours they were asking of me (really unreasonable like 2:30pm - 12:00am sporadically during the week, it was valeting. Sometimes out of state), my car was past inspection and couldn't be inspected until we fixed the muffler we knew was broken but I didn't have the money for it and my parents didn't want to spend that kind of money on me since I had no job and was only in community college, and I couldn't reapply to school once again because I was broke and my parents didn't want to spend that type of money on me if I had no prospects. This bothered my ex but she was understanding and said I should just work and save up some money to pick the pieces back up for next term. The next 3 months I looked for a job but honestly not as hard as I could have because like I mentioned earlier the task seemed very daunting and I was discouraged but still tried. My car was out of commission and my parents wanted me to take a job that was close enough to not need a car to get to which was impossible because we live in a large suburb and the only way anyone around here gets around is with a vehicle. So 3 months pass and the term ends. My ex seemed a bit strange but I chalked it up to her being so busy with finals which was about 70% of the issue.
She gets home for spring break and I finally found a job that was suitable for my current situation and I'm excited to finally be doing things again and get my life moving. We hang out and go out to the city and have a blast. It was a great night and I know she had a lot of fun. The next day in the middle of her giving me a blowjob she stops, asks me a bunch of questions about what I've been doing to move forward and even though there were improvements like me being ready for school in May and me having a job I still was having car issues and not volunteering (only because I had no car. I am a part of the Red Cross so I could pick up hours if I had a way of getting to my destinations). She immediately became turned off and I could tell something was up before I left and walked home. When I get home I get a bunch of messages via facebook and I could tell where we were headed and I was so scared of losing her.

We officially broke up the next day for two reasons. Her wanting me to move forward with her so we could establish ourselves together in life and the other which I'm about to detail. There were moments when we would have petty arguments, sometimes knowing it was stupid but one might get offended instead of transitioning to the ""i don't give a fuck' phase and just being normal again, it would take a little playful banter from either person to get us to be normal with each other again. It had been getting better over the months and by the time we broke up it wasn't as bad as it had been because we were making efforts to tackle the problem. everything had been so good and we made many improvements but it wasn't to say it might happen again, it happened a lot less though. Pretty much a nonexistent behavior.

Anyway when we broke up the first issue was highlighted the most and then partially of the second and she just kept talking about how she felt. She said we needed to time work on ourselves. It's not like she wanted to break up, she still very much wanted to be with me but she said she felt like it might not work out in the future. We were officially broken up but she said we had a possibility in the future but not to hold her to that because she isn't one to define the future and that she still loved me and wanted to be friends. There was a lot of crying on both sides and I didn't want to split up but I love her and cared about what she felt so I conceded so she could have a chance to do her thing. She said things like it's not you it's me (which I know is kind of BS because if I had been moving forward more consistently she would have been more content), saying how these weren't thoughts she had they were feelings she couldn't shake, how confused she felt, and some other things that aren't coming to mind. She also mentioned how she isn't looking for another relationship for a while so I feel like I have time if I really work hard.

We talked after the matter, mostly me trying to figure out some important information without all the heavy emotions clouding what was going on. What I could get from her which gave me hope was that she still loved me, still wanted to be in contact and be friends and potentially wanted me to come visit her in Washington D.C. when she's there for an internship. She is such a confusing person though and I don't know if I am holding on to something futile or if since she clearly gave signs that there is still an us that I should do what I know I need to do to make her have a potential change of heart. Right now I'm sitting on the idea that as long as I do what I need to do that there will be a highly probable chance we can be together again since she is still clearly involved mentally and actually wanted us to have space to grow since that's what she said. At the moment to move forward I plan on continuing work and collecting money, fixing my car ASAP, start school up again (in May), and eventually more consistent volunteering (when I fix my car) as well as working out just as an icing on the cake.

I guess what I'm asking is if what would you guys do if you were in my situation? And what questions would you ask her to better understand what she's thinking and what 'me and her' mean to her? How much time would you give before asking any truly important questions. Should I be the one to bring up one day after getting my shit straight if we should be together or should I wait until it's her idea? I'm just so lost and confused and don't know how to approach this situation for the outcome I desire and she may potentially desire. I just want help in every aspect and sense of the word, if anyone could provide advice or insight or even ask me questions to help them help me, it is all welcome. Or even if anyone has been in a similar situation before and how it ended up? Hopefully this isn't too long to get some help.

TL;DR Me and my gf broke up because primarily because of where I was at in life but there are hints (I think) she still wants us to be one some time in the future. Advice on how to move forward so that I don't squander or ruin the potential chance I have at rekindling this relationship? Strongly advised to read the whole thing because it contains pertinent information"

I'm an upperclassman at U of M, Ann Arbor looking for an internship in Detroit this summer. I'm particularly interested in data analytics and customer facing technical roles. 

I have two previous internships, and experience working with SQL, VBA, R, C++ and more programming languages. I also have work experiences on campus, and a very impressive resume to back all this up (Eagle Scout, high school valedictorian and more). 

I've found an internship for the summer, but I *really* want to work in Detroit. I think I want to live in the city post grad, so a summer here would be awesome to get to experience for a summer before looking for full time employment. 

If you think you may know something that would be a good fit, shoot me a message or reply to this. I can get you a copy of my resume and provide more information. 

Thank you very much for reading!"

Combined (me and 3 other interns from the company) have a total of $6,000 for the summer.

We've gone through internhousing, craigslist, latitude38, sfhousing, and a bunch of other websites looking for a place... but the ones that aren't in extremely sketchy areas or stupidly expensive are definitely scams.

We're looking for a 2 - 4 bedroom space, preferably with a kitchen and bathroom, fully furnished. We're all flying over for the summer, so we're packing as light as possible.

We're all from the east coast, and I guess monthly rent there just isn't as expensive as in the city, because everything we're finding so far is at least $1000+ a month per person, which is just ridiculous to us (we pay $250 - $500 at most back home), and our stipend would cover all us for *maybe* 1.5 months (out of 4 months)... we don't make enough to spend another $2000 out of pocket on just rent, we need $$$ for transportation, food, university fees, etc. Shit's expensive. :/

Any suggestions, advice, etc?

Thank you! :)"

This is basically a timeline of how I got to where I’m at as a 30 year old (where I was, what I did, and what’s next). 

It is long, but I have provided summary items in each section about living, spending, and other tidbits of wisdom gained through my journey. I'm open to any questions your have also!

**18 Years Old**

* Graduated high school in the top 20% (not great, but didn't have a lot of focus back then)

* Started community college for a one year stent to complete some of the basic college classes.

* Since 16 I had been working for a commercial maintenance company, making decent cash money for a teenager

* Most of the money was not saved, but would definitely have looking back

* Living: parents' house

* Top Pay: $7.50 cash


**19 Years Old**

* Applied and was accepted to renowned 4-year University in Texas (home state)

* Planned to attend medical school

* Living: 650 sq.ft one bedroom apartment

* Top Pay: $13.00 cash on weekends when available

**20 Years Old**

* Met my future wife in front row of organic chemistry (running joke is ""we had chemistry together""). She was automatically accepted to medical school from high school as long as she kept a 3.5 GPA in undergrad.

* Top Pay: $13.00 cash on weekends when available


**22 Years Old**

* Graduated with a decent GPA

* Applied to one medical school (the one to which my wife was accepted)

* Did not get into this medical school. What did I expect?! The probability of getting accepted period is low, the changes when applying to ONE school is slim.

* Without additional school to attend, I took a job at Home Depot as overnight freight/inventory stocker. A few months later Home Depot changed their model or stocking and moved into the receiving department to unload trucks and manage inventory.

* Top Pay: $10.50 at Home Depot

**23 Years Old**

* Married!

* Home Depot was pretty terrible to work for. Store Managers and Assistant Managers were lackluster in both interpersonal skills and business acumen

* Fellow employee at Home Depot transitioned into position at Best Buy. His description of the work seemed pretty cool, so I quit Home Depot and began work at Best Buy. They pay was almost identical to that of Home Depot, but much easier in that I basically just explained and sold computers and cameras to customers. 

* Being interested in business, applied to masters program for health administration and was accepted

* Top Pay: $10.25 at Best Buy

* Living: We bought a VERY small two-bedroom house

**24 Years Old**

* Quit Best Buy and began my masters program

* Took out student loans to cover living expenses and school. We had to cover both my masters program and her medical school.

* Top Pay: $0.00 

**25 Years Old**

* Through the masters program, I had to participate in a 3 month internship to broaden my perspective on the actual day-to-day operations in health care. The school wanted me to relocate to another city, but with a wife I refused and had to find my own. It ended up being a very wise decision, as I spent close to 6 months with the organization I chose and led to a job (see next)

* Top Pay: $0.00

**26 Years Old**

* Through doing well at the internship, I was given an opportunity to trail blaze a fellowship program with the same organization. This was basically a paid extension of the internship with additional responsibilities

* Top Pay: low $50k

**27 Years Old** 

* Successful in fellowship, hired on as manager of business intelligence (new position)

* Top Pay: $60-70k

**28 Years Old** 

* Wife was accepted to residency in San Antonio. We moved there, and I commuted for a few months until I found a position in San Antonio.

* NETWORKING. I would not have found the position or been considered had I not known people in executive positions in the current and future company. I can't stress this enough: do good work that gets noticed, be friendly, and the people you work with could provide avenues to career progression

* I took a pay cut moving into the new position, but this was necessary to get into the organization and be close to my wife (who was also newly pregnant!)

* Top Pay: mid-$50k

**30 Years Old** 

* Now at 30, I have been promoted multiple time in the same organization (loyalty is valued in business!)

* I devote 7% of my income to company matched 401k

* My student loans are paid off and working on wife's from medical school

* Are now into second year of sending the IRS a check for additional taxes…higher salary = higher tax bracket 

* Never had credit card debt. We pay off each month. If you MUST use a credit card, the AMEX Blue Cash has given us pretty significant statement credits. 3% cash back from grocery stores (except Wal-Mart), and other percentages you can research yourself

* Sold the truck I had been driving for a Civic Si (a little more fun, MANUAL! ...and gas economical) 

* We’ve closely tracked our budget and have been able to moderately save (outside company retirement account)

* I have begun using the money ratios method to calculate my future savings/investment/spending needs

* Top Pay: low six figures

* Living: quite large 4 bedroom house in gated community

**Biggest Life Lessons**

* Be smart about your education and career choices

* Network, but sincerely. It's obvious who's being a brown-noser

* Keep NO credit card debt

* Live frugally where appropriate...buy items for the quality they provide, not the name recognition or perceived quality. On that note, DO research on even the small things.

* I use Mint for tracking my finances. It saves SO much time not having to track multiple bank accounts, investment accounts, student loan accounts, mortgage account

* Buy certified pre-owned cars

* In your career, find your niche and keep yourself uncomfortable...research and try the new and unexpected. Learn from others and continuously improve 

Other than what’s above, I’m open to any questions you have about my journey or other personal finance/career matters.

30fojl,1,2015-03-26,"Help phrasing ""I met famous people and sometimes wrote blog posts about it""",[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/30fojl/help_phrasing_i_met_famous_people_and_sometimes/,"Right now I am in a paid internship program in the education department of an art museum. I help run activities for families and kids in the galleries, conduct tours of exhibitions, and sometimes work directly with big-name artists. As part of my program I have had experiences with four artists, but the experiences are so different that I'm not sure how to phrase them:

Artist A is well-known in the art world. I was selected from a class I was taking at the museum to work with interns to design a maze in the museum as part of a performance piece she did. (I was not actual intern of the museum at this time. I was taking a class there and my instructor recommended me.)

Artist B is probably the most famous living artist, extremely well-known in and out of the art world. As part of the program, me and the other interns got a tour of his studio by him. During the tour, we got to ask him questions, etc. I really want to name-drop Artist B on my resume because of how renowned he is, but I really didn't do any work stuff during the visit, except be professional and respectful to him.

Artist C is up-and-coming in the art world, but not well known. This was another group studio visit where we spoke with the artist. Afterwards, I was asked to write a blog post about the visit that was then published on the museum's education blog.

Artist D is very well-known in the art world. I worked with four other interns in the program to conduct a video interview with him at his studio. Together we did research about his work, prepared questions, and went to the studio with the head of museum interpretations to conduct the interview. The interview will be on the museum's website within the next few months.


So all of these are very different experiences. I feel like my work with Artists A and D are the most impressive because I worked with other people and had a big role, but Artist B would be an eye-catcher and my experience writing the blog post for Artist C shows that I'm a good writer.

I have an internship in Lexington this summer, so I'm looking for a place to stay from around May 15 to the end of August. The closer to Lexington the better, in general. I wouldn't want to stay much farther out than Somerville.

Ideally, I'd like to have some cool (clean) roommates who like hanging out sometimes, and not spend more than $1000 each month total (including utilities). I need to have a parking space. I don't mind if my roommates have pets. I'm more than willing to take on my share of the responsibilities as long as everyone else does also.

About me: I'm a 23 year old male engineering graduate student. I'm generally a homebody -- I'd usually rather chill at home with a friends (or at their home) and just shoot the breeze than go out, but I do manage to go out infrequently. I like playing and listening to music (at reasonable hours), I enjoy a good movie/anime/HBO show, and I'm very often hacking away at something on the computer.

I took the job because I thought it was business-related and I was offered a good starting salary (~53k).

The problem is this is not what I want to do at all. I am finding as I research more and more that if you do not do internships while in school you are pretty much screwed in your career. I had a job that paid pretty well during school and was almost FT, and I didn't want to quit because I was stupid and wanted money. I didn't save anything from that job (other than my 401k plan) so it was basically a waste.

Are there any websites or services that assist in finding post-bacc recent graduate internships? I mean real internships, not commission only ""financial advisor"" internships. Doesn't have to be huge firms, but I'm talking for reputable firms where we actually are able to be hired on for a FT salaried role afterwards (similar to lots of internships for juniors and seniors)

 Literally everything I find wants you to be enrolled, and not only enrolled, but in the EXACT major relative to the field you're in. I wish an advisor had actually advised me of this phenomena. I would have majored in finance and not international business (I love traveling and other cultures and wanted to work internationally for a while)
If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it and I hope this post gets replies. Hopefully someone can help us recent grads with similar issues.

**I am willing to quit my current job in an instant and take an internship if it meant that I was able to work full time after the internship in finance. I think many people would quit if it meant they were able to get relevant skills and not be pigeon holed**"
30fxqm,0,2015-03-26,Ad Agency Pros of Reddit: I need your help,amazing_blazing,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/30fxqm/ad_agency_pros_of_reddit_i_need_your_help/,"Hey everyone,

I am a 24 year old Strategic Communication Graduate Student at a school in Central Texas (not UT) who works (almost) full-time in media buying/planning that is currently going through a severe Quarter Life Crisis. My ultimate goal in my professional career right now is be an Account Planner or Strategic Planner for a client I care about at an agency who's culture reflects my ideals. But I'm starting to cave and feel hopeless.

I took a job as an assistant media buyer out of undergrad just as something in the industry that was flexible as I worked through graduate school, and I feel like this is hindering my chance at moving into Account Planning because agencies see my media experience and ask me ""What are you doing applying for planning/strategy when you're in media?""

I had an interview at an agency in Austin where I was moved into the second phase of interviews, but the agency never even contacted me back after the interview to inform me I wasn't selected. Seriously - two interviews within a week and they didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I wasn't selected. I had to text my friend who worked there and got me the interview to ask her what was up and she said they hired two new people. Is this common?

I'm not sure when I made the decision but somewhere in my sophomore-junior year of undergrad (I attended a not-so-great school for Mass Comm/Advertising) I made the commitment to work in at a full-service agency. I'm not sure if it was the culture, the work, or the illusion that working at a big agency with big clients would make me feel successful -- but I'm pretty god damned passionate about advertising and dedicated the past 3 years to getting the experience needed to transition into full-time agency work.

I am a native Austinite (Austin, TX for those unaware) and I am dead set on getting a job here, but I'm starting to consider at least getting work in Texas. I've applied to every major agency in Austin (GSD&amp;M, Latinworks, McGarrah-Jessee, Proof, etc.) at least once, and most of them twice for internships since undergrad. I've had SVP's try and put a word in for me and I literally cannot even get an interview. It's extremely demoralizing and I've punched through drywall multiple times in frustration after being told I'm not qualified enough for a media internship even though I'm in graduate school and have 1 1/2 years as an assistant media buyer. 

I have been doing (in my opinion) awesome research in my graduate courses on strategy, brand image and awareness, event sponsorship, I could on... -- basically all things applicable to the industry.

I work 40 hours a week and am a full-time grad student in Mass Comm/Strategic Communication with an intense passion to work in an agency, and I can't even get interviews for internships. I study on my own time account planning, agency trends, overall advertising trends, and consider myself very knowledgable in consumer insight. And still, I can't even get an agency to wag a finger at me. Is this just Austin, or what am I doing wrong?

Sorry if this is kind of jumbled and incoherent, I'm really stressed and just feel like I need someone to tell me this is normal and that I'm doing the right (or wrong) things.

I feel as though I really need an industry mentor -- someone to look over my resume and experience and tell me what I'm doing right or wrong or just tell me to keep going or to just quit. No one will give me any feedback and I find it literally impossible to believe that undergrads applying for internships have more experience than me. Like I said, I've tried my best to get people inside of various agencies in Austin to hype me up... so ""having an in"" definitely isn't working for me and is starting to feel pathetic.

Someone tell me what to do. I'd be happy to send you my resume, grad research, etc. if you just PM me. I'd love for ANYBODY to give some feedback."
30fy1j,3,2015-03-26,Finish college or take job,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/30fy1j/finish_college_or_take_job/,"I am 2 years into getting my IT degree, but I had an opportunity to apply for an internship at my college.  I didn't realize I had to look for my own job and this part freaked me out a little because I couldn't find any IT related jobs in my area. I submitted my resume to a few places and closed off my search...

The next day I get a phone call from someone from an IT recruiting firm, Modis, saying that they might have a few help desk jobs that I meet the requirements for and that they would like to meet with me to discuss them.  I agree, because what do I have to lose?

I get there and we discuss the jobs, and find out that I am pretty well qualified for a few jobs (I have some previous experience in IT prior to starting college), and the pay is WAY higher than what I thought I would even come close to. But they are full-time ""contract-to-hire"" jobs, so an internship with them most likely wouldn't happen.  I don't think I would be able to go to school full time and maintain a job full-time, so really it is just one or the other. They offer to ""represent"" me for these jobs and will send them my resume and set up an interview if I agree to let them.

Now, I'm a little confused as to what would be my best option here.  I mean, I go to college so I can start a career, but a career may have just fallen into my lap.  Should I take one of these jobs and forget about college for now? I figure I can always go back if things don't work out, but I guess I just can't get over how easy this was to find a job that pays a lot.

So I guess I'll leave a tl;dr here heh, because this is longer than I intended:

1. Have any of you had experience with Modis, or a similar IT recruitment firm?  If so, how was your experience?
2. Should I drop school and take a well paying IT job?

My college experience was a nightmare in itself. I went to a top-50 private school with extremely risk-averse tendencies and an obsession with looking good on paper without any substance. I took 1.5 years off after freshman year because I told a school therapist I was suicidal, and when I was ""voluntarily"" committed she told me I had to leave because I was a ""liability"". I was the older side of 19 at the time, and my life has been a downhill spiral ever since.

Upon my return, I had one good semester, but the next semester I decided to take some hard science and math classes to improve my credentials. At the same time, a student hanged himself in my building, and it led to an administrative ass-covering shitstorm. Needless to say, in my classes I had the typical sophomore experience, and the repercussions were severe. 

I was called into my RA's office and asked a number of questions about my mental health, my academic performance, and my home life. The next day, I received an email saying I was called into my academic adviser's office, where she informed me that she already made an appointment for me at the counseling center, got up, and personally escorted me to his office across the street. I shit you not. 

Yes, because a random student killed himself, I was required to go to therapy sessions without prior knowledge and consent. And how my adviser got this information about my health, I literally had no idea. The therapist I saw was head of the counseling department and spent my appointments asking roundabout questions about my condition, peppered with irrelevant rants about the lack of funding he receives from the administration. He suggested taking another leave of absence, but if I returned it needed to be through the counseling center, because ""I don't know what academic services will say"", and he also suggested that I drop out and pursue my musical interests, since college might not be for me. 

I was afraid to seek treatment for my illness in any capacity after this series of unfortunate events, and my condition worsened progressively. Last semester of university, I could barely get out of bed or attend my classes, I failed two of them for failing to complete assignments and graduated by the skin of my teeth with a useless humanities degree and no internships. Panicked, I went to academic services again to let them know that if it weren't for their misconduct I would have declared disability and been able to receive an extension, but I was afraid to. I was then told that the counseling center had since been ""restructured"" (the therapist I had was fired) and that the school wasn't liable for what happened in the past, two years ago. My asshole of an adviser also made sure to call my professors in advance to badmouth me so there would be no chance of getting a grade change to Incomplete from them, and then call the counseling center to make sure they knew my professors couldn't stand me and not to bother with writing a doctor's note to help my case.

Where am I now? I'm holed up in an apartment here in my old college town living on my parent's dime, completely alone, on meds, and barely able to function let alone hold a job. My family won't let me move in with them because I ""have to be independent"" and ""people live with depression all the time"". I struggle daily with suicidal thoughts and I have nowhere else to go. 

I just don't care anymore."

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

30ge14,1,2015-03-26,[Suggestion] Soul Wars for Runescape Oldschool,xThargor,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/30ge14/suggestion_soul_wars_for_runescape_oldschool/,"**[Suggestion] Soul wars for 07**

To put it in a nutshell: I’d like to make it possible to take the minigame “Soul wars” into OldschoolRuenscape with a few modifications to the RS3-version.


&gt;######## NOTE: You have to be a member to play this Minigame ########


You want to go fighting and having fun with some friends or solo?  However, you are not willing to risk all of your expensive gear by going into the wilderness? In that case you will be pleased to join the Soul Wars minigame:

  
**1.     Soul Wars explained for lazy People**

If the term ‘Soul Wars’ doesn’t mean anything to you, you should check out [Runescape’s Wiki](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Soul_Wars). 

The minigame is basically an overall fight between two teams, who try to take control of 3 objectives (Soul Obelisk and the two graveyards) and gather so-called soul fragments at the Soul Obelisk to lower the Slayer requirement (noted as ‘Avatar Level’) for killing the enemy Avatar. Your Team wins the game by getting more Avatar kills than the other Team.  

You will not lose your items when you die (like in the duel Arena).

 
**2.     Soul Wars: in depth** 

So let’s go into detail: 
Soul Wars requires team cooperation, operating with different roles, to succeed as a whole. To play the game you can work on lowering the level of the enemy Avatar, keeping your Avatar alive, or trying to capture key points. If one role is lacking, the entire team will suffer.

You can enter the game by selecting the red or blue barrier or just clicking on the ‘random’ portal (castle wars style). A game starts with at least 10 Players in each Team. You will be able to get into the active arena up to 15 minutes before the game ends. If you do not manage to get inside in time, you have to wait for the next game to start. Contrary to the minigame ‘stealing creation’, there will only be one active game at a time. A game will take 20mins. 

Once the game has started, you want to take control of your sided graveyard and start getting ‘soul fragments’ by killing 2 different types of monsters (some for ‘low-level’ guys and some for the ‘higher level’ ones). Those fragments are required for lowering the Slayer requirement (Avatar Level) for killing the enemy Avatar. 

The Avatar Level starts at 100, so high-level players can’t go soloing the Avatar without having control of the Obelisk for at least once. The Avatar level can also get higher again by burring bones at the Graveyards.   

For taking fast and secure control, you will need some of your teammates to defend the Objectives and kill the ones from the other team, because you cannot take control if even one of them is inside that area. The Soul Obelisk, another capturing objective, has to be controlled in order to use the fragments for lowering the Avatar’s slayer level requirement as mentioned above. 

To win the game you must kill your opponents Avatar and naturally defend your own. 

After a game has ended, you will receive 'zeal points' based on your Team’s performance within Soul Wars; 3 points for a victory, 2 for a draw, and 1 for a defeat. You can trade these in with Nomad for different rewards:

-	**Experience** in Combat related skills, such as: Attack, Strength, Hitpoints, Defense, Magic, Prayer, Range and Slayer) 
-	**Charms** of any color
-	**Pets**
-	**Gamble** (risking 2 Zeal points that you have acquired and will randomly give you an item for them in return)


**3.     What we need to change at the current concept of Soul Wars ( or probably the reason why you read this article about soul wars )**

Soul Wars made a great addition to Runescape pre-eoc. On certain worlds, this minigame was so popular that there were constant clashes between high leveled and organized clans, wars could rage on for hours, days even weeks and months.

Offering exp rewards that rivaled those of some of the most intensive alternative training methods that existed in the game, it was a great way for players to train and inspired a new sense of community, clan loyalty and competition in the game, which for many players was one of their favorite ways to enjoy Runescape.


**So why hasn't it returned yet?**


*Bots/Afk:*

As far as I am informed, the overall fear is Botting and AFKing in pre-EOC’s Soul Wars. Most players became active because of the activity bar, which kicks you out of the game after it is empty. Nevertheless, burring a bone every 30sec shouldn’t be enough to keep that bar positive! 
There need to be active fighting with players or monsters and burring bones should only fill that bar, let’s say, every 4 minutes. Soul fragments, on the other side, should fill up the entire activity bar, you are only able to use all of them at once anyways.   

----&gt; Every 4 Minutes you have the chance to burry 14 Bones (so you cannot stay ‘active’ with only burring Bones you have to fight or at least contribute soul fragments to the Team) 

*Splashing:*

Splashing is a very popular mage training nowadays, so there should be a special rule, making it impossible to afk-splash in Soul Wars. That rule is simple: Your activity bar goes down when you do not hit anything for a certain time. Considering low-levels fighting against maxed outs, your bar should be at 3/4 after dying. 

*‘Bad Team’* 

People keep complaining about teams full of low-level players who cannot defend or attack properly. A 40 Combat level requirement, as Pest Control currently requires should be enough for having skilled teammates. 

**Possible variations**

Let’s try to get some new and good old content within Soul Wars

 
*Runes:*

I was thinking about the possibility to get in-game only runes, buyable with zeals by Nomad. Those runes would not affect the prices at GE, since they are for Soul Wars only. Nomad shouldn’t sell the ‘normal’ runes we have, but rather the ‘stealing creation’ elemental runes. 

*Kills:*

We get fragments for killing monsters but not for having a good PvP fight against a high combat level? Kills should be worth 1 or 2 soul fragments. 

*Chat:*

Why not having a Team intern chat, as a clan chat? It should not be in the clan chat window, rather a new section so players are still able to stay in their private Soul Wars CC.

*Potions:*

Special potions who remove Freeze / stun effects from spells and ZGS that are limited to Soul Wars only (like NMZ's Overloads). Either buyable with zeals or free-for-all at the potions table in game. 

*Adding skilling into Soul Wars:*

Like building defenders (walls), you’ll have to cut special trees that only exist in Soul Wars. Fletch/craft them into special planks and build them with your Construction skills. 

*Hybrid armour:*

Adding the Hybrid armour within Soul wars and the other minigames to get the full set. 
‘When playing in minigames, you will deal additional damage against other players. Note that in Castle Wars this damage bonus does not stack with the Castle Wars armour sets. Whichever set provides the biggest damage boost will be the set that provides the bonus.’
Hybrid armour is untradeable.


**Questing**

Soul wars would also be essential for Nomad's Requiem, a great quest in my opinion. 

Nomad's Requiem is a Grandmaster quest, featuring an investigation into the activities of Nomad, the creator of Soul Wars. At the time of its release, the final boss fight was considered to be the hardest of any quest in the game, a title which some consider it still holds.

*Soul Wars was a unique game and combined so many others into one fun way to train and team up with other players. My goal is to get Soul Wars to the poll stage, and if you were one of those players that loved the intensity of clan's battling for control of a world, or just played socially for fun and exp, please leave a message of support.*

I'm an econ major and I was talking with some friends, and they say that 54 is useful for internship oppurtunities + personal knowledge.

However, I've only taken 16B here and I got a 5 on the BC exam during high school.

Am I gonna be really far behind everyone else if I go into 54 with JUST 16B?"
30ggl8,5,2015-03-26,Past Amazon Interns - Tips on how to perform well?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30ggl8/past_amazon_interns_tips_on_how_to_perform_well/,"Hi,

I will be interning at Amazon in Seattle this summer and would like to spend some time preparing to make sure I am productive and perform well during my time there.

Could any past Amazon interns share what are the main programming languages and frameworks used at Amazon? (Is it mainly Java across all teams?) Any specific tool I could benefit from learning before going there?

Also, how could I maximize my chances at gaining a full-time return offer? Should I keep spending time preparing CTCI type questions? Is it mainly based on what work you did there?

I haven't worked on big projects yet so I don't want to feel lost and just not know how to do anything when I get there.

Any comment is appreciated! Thanks!"

---------|----------|
Can we have the ability to sell BH Emblems to the GE? | They will look into it, but it'll probably take a bit.
Which Achievement Diary was the hardest to make? | Western and Morytania. Trying to find things in Morytania was hard because the content is as old as 2002-2003 and three different people developed it with no organization. The Western Diaries were hard because of how messy the Ape Atoll, Pest Control, and so many other areas code's are.
Can we have the ability to Price Check all the items in our bank at once? | It's a big job, it'll take awhile, but they'll work on it.
Will Zeah have it's own diaries? | Yes.
Will any of the diaries become F2P accessible? | John C wanted to make Lumbridge/Draynor F2P, but because they first started designing them F2P wasn't a thing, it was too late to go back and redesign them. They'll work on something for F2P.
Will any of Zeah be F2P? | To be discussed. 
Can the skill outfits like prospector and Achievement Diary armors be merged together? | Varrock Elite armor functions as a prospector top, other than that, no achievement diary armor is better than skilling outfits, so you don't need to worry about them being replaced. Plus, you don't need to wear most of the armors to get the benefits.
What's the new Achievement Diary emote going to look like? | You'll hold out a diary, and on each of the corners of a diary you'll have a green, red, blue, and purple gem to represent the different difficulties of the diaries and to show that you've obtained them. It floats out and expands to the size of a table and a vortex appears with different aspects of the diaries that you've completed being sucked into the book until eventually it climaxes and get's so cluttered that the book snaps shut. After that, it reduces in size once again and drifts back into your hands.
Are any of the rewards up for change? | There's a thread open in Feedback/Suggestions that you can post on. 
Can you make the Fountain of Rune F2P? | Maybe.
Add other F2P worlds? | If they're needed we can add more F2P worlds. 
Australian servers? | Mat K is talking to some people next week about them.
Items kept on death based on GE value? | Will be polled. 
Add clan chat features like calenders for event reminders? | Reach would like to add a clan feature, this would probably be included. 
Can we see Mod Ronan opening up another 1000 Barrow Chests, but with 14 KC? | Sure.
Can you add more use to the Soul Rune? | New diary spells use soul runes. Maybe more on Zeah.
New Runes? | Probably not. 
In the GE if two people are buying the same item at the same price who gets the item? | Whoever offered first.
While you had previous designs for the Varrock Diary armors, but why did you choose black and purple? | Mod Ghost went into a thing about colors schemes. TL:DR It just works well together.
What do you think about burning down trees in farming patches to remove them? | Sure.
Is there anything we can do to manage the drastic drop in prices of resources since the GE came, such as iron ore? | There have been loads of items that people have kept around in their bank since the game began that they just never got around to selling. With the GE, people just dumped these huge quantities in. They aren't going to instantly react to these price changes, because they are expected. They will be watching prices over the next few months, and if something doesn't change, they can try to adjust things to recover prices. When GE first came out, even up to 6 months later prices were still all over the place. It's going to take awhile. Perhaps quicker because there's no trade restriction, but it's going to take time. It's only been a week, give it the time it needs.
Karamja gloves don't suit the new reward kits, can we get new ones? | Give feedback, it will probably be fixed.
Partyhat sets and Mask sets for GE? | They will come. God Page sets, too.
If you won the lottery, what's the first thing you'd buy? | Mod Mat K answered with Jagex. John C would waste it. Ghost and Reach would probably save it and spend the interest.
Where'd you come up with the design for the wilderness sword? | It's based off an Aztec weapon. It's more of a trophy weapon, which is why it was chosen for the diary reward.
When will we get dangerous clan wars? | Never.
Bounty Hunter/PVP timer to attack someone who steps into a safe zone? | Sure.
Will we ever get an in-game clock? | Sure.
Since the disconnections have subsided, can we see PK worlds reverted to UK worlds? | Sure.
Could we have all family quest gauntlets as a reward from diaries? | Sure.
Can we see the Onyx Ring (i)? | Wilderness rings do similar bonuses, probably not. John C would like to make it useful. They'll probably make the Onyx Ring remove the white dot on the map.
Can ultimate ironmen use protect item? | No. 
Destroy options on looting bag drop items in them instead of delete the items? | No. It could be abused. 
Is it possible to see our history of loots from old clue scrolls? | No it hasn't been kept track of.
Can an achievement diary reward increase the size of the looting bag? | It could, but there might be some technical issues.
Horses? | You can't ride them, but they can make them.
How did the ecumenical keys drop rate work with new diary reward? | 3, 4, and 5 have the same drop rates.
What's your opinion on spicy stew shakers being tradeable? | It's a quest item, not becoming tradeable. 
Can we have the ability to charge black masks? | The charge is useless. Why? 
Gilded to become F2P? | They'd prefer to keep it members only. If you're look to risk fight, take a stack of cash.
How did community feedback play into the design of the diary armor? | Not much, people generally liked it. 
Prayer renewals? | Sure, but there's been a fair bit of herblore content recently. 
Ectotokens tradeable? | No.
Why is there a bat on the Morytania legs? | It's the coat of arms.
Any updates on rooftop agility on the GE? | Soon.
Moving Varrock teleport to GE? | Will be polled.
New obsidian armors such as bows and arrows? | Sure. Sounds cool.
Bonus effect for full diary armor set? | What could it be? The gear is already highly useful.
Does the upgraded void look different from normal void? | It was void with a gold trim, it was updated today to look like elite void.
Did the oldschool team get larger with the F2P release? | Interviews for new QA intern will start next week! Mod Mat K has been talking to Mod Pip regarding new members if they're needed.
What's required to be a new QA? | You have to live in Europe and know Oldschool. Other than that, there's nothing much really. ""We hired John C, so anyone can get in really."" -Mod Mat K    Lel
Instance to Kraken? | Tweet Mod Ronan what the price should be.

30gix0,6,2015-03-27,2 weeks post-op BEAUTIFUL!,toxicwastedump,pilonidalcyst,https://www.reddit.com/r/pilonidalcyst/comments/30gix0/2_weeks_postop_beautiful/,"Hi everyone!! I'm brand new to reddit and wanted to share my story of this awful cyst.. I've read alot of the posts on this subreddit and am shocked at the amount of people who have been dealing with this issue and who continues to deal with this issue to this day!!

April 25th 2014 - Friday night was when I started to feel a slight pain on my tailbone. I assumed it was from sitting for too long or I had bumped it on something. I would feel in the area and felt tenderness with a slight bump, no sinus tract so there was no drainage. I attended a friend's wedding on Saturday the 26th with my SO at the time. The pain increased but I continued to ignore it and didn't tell my SO in fear of being embarrassed. Fast forward to Sunday night: SO leaves and I am home alone... The pain has intensified and the bump on my behind has become more defined, so my friend (currently an RN, was a care partner at the time) comes over with some needles she snuck out of the hospital in an effort to stab this sucker. I took a few shots of vodka and let them settle before attempting to poke this lump on my backside. An hour later, all efforts fail and my pain has only increased more. Friend leaves and I spend hours trying to alleviate my pain (hot bath, warm compresses, ice the area, stretching, attempting to sleep) before giving in. Unable to walk and sobbing from the immense pain, I call another friend at 1AM and beg him to take me to the hospital. 7 hours later, I have my cyst drained, pain has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY, and am on my way home with extra gauze and antibiotics. I take extra caution the next two weeks to get my packing changed out at student health everyday and keeping the area clean. Seems to have solved the problem.

Fast Forward!

December 26th 2014 - Friday night, I feel a familiar pain in my backside and immediately begin worrying. I am at my mom's for winter break and tell her if it gets worse, I am going to the ER to get it drained before the worst of the pain begins. I spend the day laying on a heating pad in hopes of bringing the cyst to a head. Saturday afternoon, pain is manageable but worse than Friday night. I head to the ER and wait hours before getting called back just for the woman to tell me there's nothing to drain. OKAY, my exact words were, ""Fine, I will be right back here tomorrow evening, watch"". Lo and behold, I am at the ER 24 hours later, Sunday night (basically EXACTLY 7 months after first flare-up) in immense pain, sobbing and laying halfway on the hospital bed waiting for the doctor to come in and cut this beast open! She numbs me, cuts me open and instructs me to go home and get some rest (it is 6 am at this point). I am not packed this time, which is strange but this doctor said she doesn't believe in packing, whatever! I am just glad to have this thing drained and have the pain gone!!!

I see my PCM (primary care manager/doctor) a few days later and get a referral for a surgeon within my network. I have my evaluation February 16th in which he clears me to have the surgery done! Surgery was scheduled for March 13th!

March 13th 2015 - I arrive at 7:15 am to have this taken care of once and for all! I am nervous but happy to have this done. I had a spinal for this surgery as opposed to being asleep (my anxiety was through the roof already, being asleep would have made it 100x worse). I get my IV put in and all my prep done before the ER nurse comes in and injects my IV with a medication that made me high as a kite in like 30 seconds. Arrive in OR, many doctors and nurses around but I can't understand anything they are saying. I am sat up on the bed with two nurses in front of me while 3 or 4 are behind me injecting my back with HUGE needles (the kind they use for epidurals) in order to make my body numb from the waist down. Next thing I know, I'm on my belly, moving my head from side to side due to being so out of it from this medication they gave me. Noises are all jumbled together along with the voices of the doctors and nurses. All is done, I am moved onto my original bed and wheeled into recovery. Of course, I'm blind as a bat because I couldn't wear my contacts and they had my glasses somewhere inaccessible, so that was frustrating. I sat in recovery with 3 male nurses (all VERY nice and happy to listen to my stories-one called my mom in the waiting room and said he knew I was a northerner because I wouldn't stop talking!) for approximately 45 minutes-hour before going to another room where I would eventually wait for the numbing to wear off. The spinal literally numbs EVERYTHING. I couldn't even pee for an hour because this medication makes your bladder ""go to sleep"", haha. The nurses were incredible and I had a very pleasant experience before being discharged when everything woke up and I was able to walk again!

March 27th 2015 - Healing has been extremely frustrating. I was prescribed Percocet for pain, Docusoft (mild stool softener), Zofran (for nausea), and 800mg ibuprofen. I stopped the Percocet after 5 days because the constipation was too much for my preference!! I don't like not being able to use the bathroom, but in fear of tearing my incision, I opted to stick with the ibuprofen. Starting last week, there has been a grey-ish, green-ish substance on the gauze that I pull out. Upon internet research (and doctor's information), I have found out it is normal, it is called exudate. There was some slight bleeding this past weekend that really scared me. I had a follow-up appointment 3 days ago and he is extremely pleased with my healing progress! He said the exudate is normal, the bleeding is normal as well. To quote, ""I wish all my patients listened as well as you do!"" This was a HUGE RELIEF for me knowing that everything is healing properly and in a timely manner. I am now taking Tramadol (seldom, when I deem necessary) and Amoxicillin (I now have strep throat, wonderful...) with occasional Zofran for nausea. He said my incision would NOT tear, unless I was just completely stupid about my actions and forced it open somehow. Using the bathroom would not tear it either, which has been another huge relief for me! I have taken 2 weeks off my internship and am going back tomorrow. Doctor said I can do my normal activities within my comfort level and still keep caution.

The depth of my wound has significantly decreased in these 2 weeks of healing, I couldn't be more pleased!!! My incision was approximately 1.5 inches long and 1.5-2 inches deep (I never got an accurate measurement, this is estimated based on my first few packing changes). I am happy I got this surgery done now instead of waiting for the situation to get worse and the cyst to grow bigger! 

I hope this helps anyone who is contemplating surgery or just has general questions about pilonidal cysts! My experience with surgery has been scary, annoying and positive!! I am hoping everything heals up perfectly and my chances of dealing with this problem again are slim to none!"
30gnpu,2,2015-03-27,My boyfriend's [M22] mental illnesses and insecurity are taking a toll on me [F20]. Is it time to end it?,thrwwy34567,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30gnpu/my_boyfriends_m22_mental_illnesses_and_insecurity/,"My bf and I have been together for a year and a half. He is a great guy, he treats me incredibly well, we work well together most of the time and have very similar personalities. He has all of the good traits I would ever need in a guy. We read each other's minds all the time, and he has taken the time to really understand me and love me despite my rather closed-off and guarded personality. I am deeply, desperately in love with him. So much of our relationship is incredibly close to perfect, but with his caring and gentle nature comes insecurity, anxiety, and instability. 

He has generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. Both of these conditions affect him on a near-daily basis, and have gotten in the way of him (and me) seizing opportunities, spending time with friends, and doing well in school. This semester, he has almost completely stopped going to classes and there is a good chance he will flunk out. He's very motivated when it comes to real-life jobs and internships, but the possibility of him failing his classes and losing his funding (through his parents) is something that I, as a Deans list student, can't cope with. He has made minimal efforts to reach out to teachers and student accessibility services even at my urging, and it may be too late to do anything for his grades.

Also, his anxiety has caused him to feel more insecure and jealous in the relationship as time goes on. He has become more and more upset when I spend time with male friends and has asked me many times if I've ever cheated on him. He was always a little jealous, interrogating me every time I spoke a guy's name, but recently he has taken to calling and texting me non-stop when he knows I'm with a male friend and being angry with me if I don't respond right away, even when he ignores my texts for 5-10 hours on a near-daily basis. I have never been anywhere close to unfaithful and he hasn't been cheated on in previous relationships. He often tries to emotionally manipulate me into staying home with him when I try to go out with friends and we now make up for almost 90% of each other's social interactions. 

His bouts of depression are also becoming longer and more frequent. He has thoughts of suicide, though he swears he would never act on them, but there was an incident a year ago when the police found a half-burned suicide note of his that he claims was written when he thought he might OD on a pain medication, tramadol, which he has had several bouts of addiction to since we've been together. I am worried that his addictive personality will or already has led him to use weed, tramadol, and our relationship as a crutch to support his codependency and need for instant gratification. He absolutely hates himself and this low self-esteem and insecurity could lead him to self-harm in the future, and is impacting or relationship severely.

His neediness and clingy-ness sometimes smother me, he has frequent sexual dysfunctions and has for the most part put minimal effort into my needs or pleasure, and he owes me hundreds of dollars which I have seen barely any of in the year since he first borrowed from me.

I hate so much that he is so insecure, unreliable, and unstable because I could really see us working out long-term, but I'm afraid that these are issues that will only get worse with time, especially since he refuses to take his anti-anxiety meds or see a therapist regularly. Whenever I try to confront him about some of his issues, he gets beside himself with anxiety and I end up dropping it, unresolved, to comfort him.

What should I do, people of reddit? Is there anything I CAN do for him? We are (as of 2 days ago) on a break, at my urging, to try to sort some of these issues out with ourselves. I am currently trying to decide if we can try to get back together after an extended period apart, or if I just need to call it quits. Help!

TL;DR: My great relationship with my bf of 1 1/2 yrs is in jeopardy because of his untreated anxiety and depression, his insecurity with himself and the relationship, and an addictive, self-loathing personality.

Good idea?",Psnmushrm6,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/30gs3q/i_want_to_be_a_film_editor_after_high_school_but/,"I'm in my Senior year of high school right now, and I think I'm pretty good at STEM related subjects, especially math. I got accepted to UCLA, UCSD, and UC Berkeley, all for Computer Science, but I really just want to have a career in film, hopefully as an editor/VFX artist. I'm aiming to go to UCLA because I think it'll be easier for me to find stuff like internships for film companies there, but regardless of the school I decide on, I'm going to make CompSci my major because it'll probably be more useful than a film degree down the road.

Is this a good idea, to divide my attention between the two? If so, what other things should I do to get my foot in the film industry while pursuing a CompSci major? Any other advice would be stellar too."

---------|----------|
Can we have the ability to erase typed text by pressing escape? | There's been loads of requests for what escape to do. We can do two different things: Create a menu where you can choose hot-keys or we would probably end up making the escape key close menus as it seems more popular for the escape key.
Can we have a quest that unlocks the ability to run your own farm/livestock? | Animal Husbandry was an idea for a new skill, but there would be a huge amount of stuff that would need to be introduced for it to come. Mod Mat K would like to tie it into the farming skill, but it's not a priority. 
Can we get mighty banshees? Normal ones are boring! | Ash said for the slayer update he would like to introduce higher level versions of the current low level monsters like Banshees.
Mega-ring that is combined of all rings, such as the DKS rings? | It would be very powered. They could make a version of it that has a maintenance cost, perhaps removing rings occasionally, but the community probably wouldn't vote it in. They were planning to add a second ring slot, but it was never done.
Void deflector without void conquest? | Sure.
With the new slayer update, can we see special challenges like Jad and Kalphite Queen? | We'll probably see it.
Can you revamp Castle Wars rewards system? Lower prices, give at least one ticket if you lose, etc? | We can do the losing ticket. Mod Mat K recalls it being polled, but he's not sure. They'll look into it.
Will you ever reconsider repolling Rigour and Augury? | Yes. They just haven't gotten around to it. They said they could add it through the Bounty Hunter shop.
Could Scorpia get a kill counter? | They can add the demi-bosses to the Ring of Wealth.
Will you ever be polling the Dragon Platebody? Upgrade from the Dragon Chain? | It was discussed in a slayer update, but the community didn't want it so it wasn't polled. It will probably come with Zeah.
Can we have the ability to revert our achievement diary rewards to the lower tier gear graphics? | No. Ghost essentially said it would be similar to overrides if you had say a Fally Shield 3 that looked like a Fally Shield 1, so he'd prefer to stay away from that.
Currently the Varrock Armor bonuses work great with granite but not with sandstone. Can sandstone be added to this benefit? | That's probably a bug. They'll check it. If it's meant to just do granite then they can add sandstone.
Can General Graador drop Ourg Bones? | Sure.
Can we get a clan bank that can be shared among clan mates? | They want to but it's going to have to come with a clan update, which they also want to do. 
Would it be possible to speed up how fast pets can walk? They can almost never keep up. | NPCs can only go one speed, which is walking. It would have to be fixed via an engine update.
Any news on the new QA position? | Nope. 160 have applied. Someone has been chosen for the summer QA intern. They'll be introduced when they start on June 1st.
Can we speed up the attack speed on halberds? They're supposed to be agile and fast weapons. | Maybe.
Can we buff items that are useless, like some barrows items? | Sure.
Can the accumulator work with bolt racks? | Yes.
What's your opinion on having potion flasks? | It's a huge programming job, but if the community wants it, sure. Ash is skeptical the community will want it.
Can the crystal halberd be changed to work on corp? | Yes. John C would also like to add the dragon halberd spec to crystal halberd.
Can we have the ability to store more cannonballs in our cannons? | Code is very easy, but there's a worry that it would cause long periods of AFK training with ranging.
Can the clan wars minigame teleport be made available to f2p? | Yes.
Will we ever see off-hand weapons? | Probably not.
Could we imbue ultimate ironman armor with armor like rune? | Sure.
Can we get a filter for the quests we have requirements for and the ones we don't? | Sure.
Can the berserker necklace effect apply to the obby rings and obby staff? | It would be cool, but Twitch chat didn't seem to like it.
Will you be adding any additional rewards to the achievement diaries? | There will be a few things polled to be added, such as the Varrock teleport re-location.
Can we have the option to clear private chat? | Sure.
Can you poll giving a slight buff to the xp gained in the resource area to increase traffic? | It would be nice, but it depends on what's causing people to not go there currently. Mod Mat K will look into it when Ian can work on making data hooks work properly in the game.
Can you merge chompy hunting with hunter? | Since it's a requirement for the quest, you'd have to be able to kill them at 1 hunter. It wouldn't be worthwhile to introduce.
With commands like ::toggleroof, are there any other possible commands such as ::quickhop330? | Commands like ::toggleroof are client based and not specifically server based, which means it can't make you switch worlds. Ash would like to introduce world hopping.
Can ironman get mage/range armor as a choice, instead of just being given melee armor? | Ghost loves the idea, sure.
Anvil near Armadyl area? | Mod Mat K said no because it would cause a bot problem. Ash said it would be cool.
Can we have a toggle which allows us to fill up our inventory with columns instead or rows? | No. Huge re-coding would have to be done.
Why are there packs of vials and no packs of other things like bowls and jugs of wine? | At the time they were dealing with vial bots. It can be updated.
Ring of stone to remove your white dot on the minimap? | Ash looked into it but it would also remove any options on your character. It probably won't be done now unless Ian updates the engine.
Can you still drink prayer pots while you're being speared? | You'd have to make the spear completely unstall all actions. This has been polled and it failed. Ash would like to rewrite it and make it more clear, and re-poll it.
White dragons have been discussed before. Any updates? | Adamant and rune would be preferred. White dragons would be a cool idea to add some lore. Since Third-Age is created from white dragonhide a cool idea would be to make white dragons drop third-age /s
Can firelighters become less useless? Perhaps fires could drop gems according to the color lighter used? | That would be an interesting idea.
Search for friends option? | Ash would like to have an option to filter friends and tag them but it's a pretty big job so he hasn't gotten a chance. 
Will achievement diary requirements ever be changed? A lot require defence. | Probably not. Plus, the community would more than likely not vote for it to be changed.
Can we have a no weapon switching option in the duel arena? | Sure. Ash could update the duel arena interface but it would take a few weeks. Once again, there are more important updates. They'll try to touch on it this summer. Mod Mat K would like to add a feature to assist 0% commission stakers. 

**High Rated, Unanswered Questions from Reddit**

Oh wait. I can't do this anymore because Mod Archie deletes his QA posts. I guess last week he didn't delete it in time, which is why I was able to do it.

If anyone wants to send me a screenshot of the first 10-15 top questions I can sort it out weekly. Otherwise, sorry, but can't do it anymore!

There are no ""positive"" stories about the Palestinians showing whatsoever. 

That a broadcaster abuses its mandate in this way is quite disgraceful."

This coming June and July I'll be taking my internship as a part of our curriculum. Tanong ko lang po sana kung saang company maganda yung learning experience for interns. Allowance isn't my priority, pero it would obviously be nice to have some.

So far nakapag-exam/interview na ako on azeus, accenture, and aestrea. I still have orange and bronze, hp, ibm, and couple other companies on my list to apply in. I am asking this since balita ko may certain companies daw na, not to put things indelicately, pero nagpapa""timpla lang ng kape"".. Of course, that's probably an exaggeration but I would still like to hear any first hand experiences :)

Edit: I am a Computer Science undergraduate"
30hdrr,1,2015-03-27,"As of April, I'll have a year of 'professional software development' under my belt. Should I be seeking junior/associate levels of positions?",narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30hdrr/as_of_april_ill_have_a_year_of_professional/,"I'm noticing a lot of college/intern related posts this morning, so perhaps mine will be out of place. I guess I'm in a weird position considering I'm 25, didn't graduate with a strict CS major, and have worked for a year as a software developer in a shitty financial institution (you can dig through my history to see my workplace concerns) on top of having intern experience as a software engineer at a Fortune 500 place that I didn't want to work for.

My question is: with a year of experience, what should I be looking for? Sure, I'm seeking out positions that either list 1-2 years of experience needed or not list any years at all. I'm applying to Big 4 companies as well since I would like to have a name on my resume everyone can recognize, which would help out in any future employment endeavors. That and I feel working at one of these huge companies will help me become a better developer.

That said, my final goal is to become a professional developer that makes cool stuff people use. I've more or less touched on some of this goal in my life after college minus the cool part, and I don't think developers should be treated like chattel (see my history again lol).

I'm also looking for relocation to fulfill another goal of mine - to live outside my home state for at least a year. Thankfully, as a developer, there are numerous opportunities that offer relocation. The issue here is they normally want people who have years of experience or are fresh out of school - two things I'm not. I mean, yes, I have a leg up on college grads on paper but they'd still be a better investment since they can be molded easier. I consider myself young since I graduated back in 2012, but I'm no spring chicken I guess.

I recently had a phone interview with Amazon, which surprised me despite all that I've described. I dunno if anything will come out of it though since I didn't complete the problem in the interview despite, as my interview put it, I was on the right path in thinking recursively as well as name dropping the proper data structures needed while noting key design choices.

Side note: In regards to the Amazon interview...chances are I won't get it. However, that interview made me extremely happy since it sort of put into perspective things to work on in my spare time. However, I was able to understand the interviewer completely when he asked me CS related things, which I was so excited about because I've come to understand them. A year ago, I wouldn't have been able to confidently code anything on Collabedit or straight up determine a problem could be solved recursively, much less realizing a hash table would be a good solution to a given problem.

As someone who studies outside work and during downtime, that sort of gave me hope I can land a gig somewhere that has me solving problems instead of being a code cruncher who's told to copy and paste nonsense.

30he4m,3,2015-03-27,My best friend isn't who I thought he was.,jxl4202,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/30he4m/my_best_friend_isnt_who_i_thought_he_was/,"Quick backstory, or maybe not so quick. I met my friend my freshman year of college and we became friends immediately. We had all the same classes as each other and studied all the time together. We hung out all the time and played sports, worked out together and eventually I can to call him my brother. 
The summer after our sophomore year of engineering we went on coop, which is like a paid engineering internship. Somehow by chance we ended up applying and receiving a position at the same company. We lived together over the summer because it was closer to work and it was going well for a while. Then throughout the summer something changed and I began to hate him. He would undermine my work at this company and always try to take all the projects for himself. It sounds petty but I was trying to gain experience too. We eventually drove separately to work which seemed silly but I couldn't stand to be in the car with him. After summer semester was over we went back to school in the fall and our relationship healed after not seeing each other every moment of every day. We still took the same classes and did stuff together but I had the freedom to leave. 
This brings us to this spring semester. We received offers to come back to the same company for another rotation. However he had gotten his own apartment during the fall so he didn't want another rent to pay so he was going to drive. I still live at home so I figured I would drive also so I didn't have to pay. We live about an hour from where we work so it's manageable. 
But this hour long drive is why I am here typing this. 
This semester started off very well with us getting along and each of us getting our own project and driving together and talking about anything during these rides. But as time went on the mornings started to get rough waking up and driving an hour. So he started to sleep while I drove to and from work. I asked him if he would drive a couple times but he said he didn't want to because he owns a truck and I own a small car with better gas mileage. I thought that was reasonable so I asked him if he would try to stay awake with me so I didn't get as tired when I drove an hour each way. Driving ten hours a week takes its toll when it's out in the country on a straight road. He told me he had no reason to stay awake and he was tired. So this upset me a little bit. When the time came I asked him for some gas money and he said that he had bills to pay that were more important. We had been working a whole month now and I know he had money to give. The drive is 60 miles each way so we figured it to be about 4 gallons of gas each day since I get around 30MPG. So that means it would be like $4 per day, so $20 per week, which I thought wasn't unreasonable. After I asked him to pitch in for gas he reverted to his old ways undermining me at work and telling the engineers at the company i wasn't doing my part and that I was wafting commonly time. I talked with them and explained I was making progress on my projects and I was doing good work. They saw what I was doing and told me to continue what I was doing and try to just seperate myself from him. I followed their advice but I still have this inner hatred for someone who is supposed to be my best friend and brother. 
Thank you I just really needed to get this off my chest. Any advice is welcome. "

Weird, dramatic dynamic with supervisor",piratecombatboots,SocialEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/30hprt/help_weird_dramatic_dynamic_with_supervisor/,"I’m interning in the fashion industry and I’m confused about my supervisor’s behavior. I’m female and in my early 20s, my supervisor is in her early 50s. Initially I assumed she hated my guts but now she is all over the place.

First, other members of our team compliment me and tell me I’m doing great job, that I’m one of their favorite interns. 

My supervisor, in contrast, goes out of her way to find as much fault as she can. She frequently shouts and tries to break me down over minor things like using too much hand sanitizer (wtf?). She will go Jilian Michaels on me, invading my personal space, shouting and berating me. Occasionally I can’t help but cry, at which point she asks me to come into her office to speak about the “issue”.  Sometimes she actually tries to make me feel better but it usually goes along the line of “you’re doing A, B, C, and D wrong. But you do E right, so there’s some hope for you.”

The first few weeks she was a pure cunt but now her behavior is changing. It's odd. When she isn’t being horrifically mean, she teases me for little things, including my appearance, but not in a personal or hurtful way, just in a stiff and awkward way. Last week for example, she teasingly pointed out there was a single small thread unraveling near the bottom of my black cardigan (literally no one else would notice). A few days later she asked “did you know your nail polish has chipped a little on your left pinky?” It was barely noticeable. She'll tease me about the way I phrase certain things, or my movements. Again, it's never hurtful, just awkward/stiff

She’ll also ask me tie my hair back in a ponytail when she sees me wiping down the counter so it’s more “comfortable” for me, which I found odd. She will touch me occasionally, and then find an excuse for why she is touching me, e.g. “i had to touch your shoulder a minute ago to make you move because you were standing in front of the conference room” I feel like she’s highly observant of everything I do and makes an insane amount of eye contact, both while watching me and speaking to me, and it feels extremely domineering at times that it’s uncomfortable. 

She generally has a cold personality (towards everyone) but occasionally expresses moments of tenderness, such as calling me pet names, letting me have an extra day off, or giving me food. She doesn’t do this for any other intern, but she’s also MUCH nicer to them. She’s blunt towards them but would never freak out on them like she does with me. 

So it’s very confusing now. She treats me like shit and seems to despise me at times, but spends a lot of time focusing on me. She is the most cruel towards me but then has moments of uncharacteristic tenderness towards me. Initially I was terrified of her but at times now she makes me feel safe which is really bizarre considering how much she emotionally abuses me. Now I’m worried I may have Stockholm Syndrome.

I’m curious if someone can shed light on what exactly is the dynamic here? Even though I’m living it everyday, I can’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe I remind her of someone from her past? Or a daughter she never had? Most importantly, **is there a way to change this dynamic in a positive direction?**

I will probably require lots of therapy once this period of my life is over. 


**Edit:** and in case anyone asks, I can’t quit because 1) my survival depends on it, i’m in a new city without any support and I need to pay bills and buy food, 2) a lot more new opportunities will open up if I complete this internship even on a semi positive note"

Career advice?",Hiding_in_the_Shower,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30hw1y/graduating_in_the_summer_dont_enjoy_programming/,"Hey everyone, i'm graduating at the end of this Summer with a CS BA and frankly scared out of my mind about what I'm going to do. I'm not a proficient programmer, but I do enjoy working with computers.

 I don't have an internship lined up yet but I've done 4 at a company named SAS in different fields, however none were very technical and the only experience I got was company specific UI's and learning how people interact in a business environment. I got the jobs because of family that works there.

I don't enjoy doing large programming projects like i've done in most of my classes. I've liked my database class and my networks class more than the others. I'm moderately proficient at UNIX. I can do most of the programs on CodingBat.com for Java and some C++, but they're generally intro level programs anyways that are solved in 10 lines or less.

What are some good fields i'd be good for in the CS world that aren't essentially Software Engineer's and high-level coding jobs, and how do I apply to them? I've been both fortunate and unfortunate in that i've had 4 internships ad a good company, but they were all heavily influenced by the fact that I have (high ranking) family at the company. I'm trying to get a job/internship somewhere else now, without piggybacking on family.

When my internship ends in 3 months, I hope to stay in this city for at least the next 2-3 years. I really believe God is calling me to be here. The main issue is, I will need a job in order to stay. I have found work at an English School. They have already all but guaranteed me the job. It's really a perfect fit as well. Nearly all the teachers are foreigners, and so they are well experienced with all the paperwork and red tape required for getting foreigners to work here. Besides this, the benefits are incredible. They pay for my ticket to and from China, housing, and have a very nice monthly salary. The only thing is, this school only operates on weekends. There is also only one Catholic Church in town (at least open one. If there are any underground Churches, I would have no idea where to start looking). As far as I know, there is only one Sunday mass (I'm out in the boondocks of China, so there are not as many Catholics here). Would I be permitted to take this job even if it means habitually missing mass? I wouldn't be missing the ENTIRE year either. We do have some breaks and get American holidays off.

I am looking into other jobs as well, the only thing is, going through a Chinese source from the classifieds would be much more troublesome. I worry about the red tape and other such regulations, especially if it's with an organization that does not have as much experience working with foreigners. Not to mention, I have clinical OCD which often manifests itself as scrupolisity, and I worry I would become too anxious about searching for and exhausting ALL possible job opportunities to make sure I can get to mass. I worry I would keep second guessing myself and thinking ""YOU DIDN'T LOOK HARD ENOUGH! KEEP LOOKING!"" and would end up as an exhausted ball of stress. Besides this, another part of me just doesn't want to have to look because this job has already been offered. But that's obviously not a good reason. 

In short, taking this job would be extraordinarily convenient and give me fantastic benefits. But I realize that our faith is about sacrifice, after all.

I should mention, I believe the Church has a morning Saturday mass, but since it is not a ""vigil"", I'm not sure it would count.

Any and all advice appreciated, especially from any priests on here."

30ie4h,9,2015-03-27,A note on the career of a screenwriter and the industry itself.,NikkoKing,television,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/30ie4h/a_note_on_the_career_of_a_screenwriter_and_the/,"I have spent the past year pursuing a career in the field of screenwriting. In that time, I moved to LA, finished a TV writing degree at UCLA, dipped my toe in internship, and realized I wasn't right to work for this industry. Having said that, I believe I have a responsibility to impart some wisdom to others who may want to become a professional in this industry.  
  
Before I go further, I want to make something clear: **I'm not trying to scare anyone, but these are some of the hard facts of the industry**
  
First off, the biggest thing I realized, and this is true for all highly-competitive fields, **if you are not 100% committed mentally/physically/psychologically to the craft and the track to become a professional, you're wasting your time**. All facets of the entertainment industry make for a fantastic hobby, but to pursue it professionally requires a near lifetime dedication. The truth of it is simple, if you wish to become a professional in the industry, you will need to do the following:  
  
**(Move to LA)**  
  
**(Commit 60-80 hours a week at least to your career, be it working or sharpening your craft)**  
  
**(Be willing to live in less than favorable living conditions for a considerable amount of time)**  
  
**(Sacrifice a majority of your free time to go towards your career)**  
  
There are probably some more things to add to the list, but you get the point.  
  
Let's break it down some:  
  
**Move to LA**  
  
This is a no-brainer. Your only other option is maybe Vancouver, but if we're being realistic, your chances are probably better in LA (not to mention it costing about the same)  
  
**60-80 hours a week**  
  
This is what really scared me. I knew when I came out here I would have to work my ass off, but it's a whole new monster once this lifestyle is in effect. Your schedule consists of working 12 hours a day with 2 hours of commuting on average, getting home to eat quickly, sleep and repeat. And if you're serious about moving up the ladder, you're going in on Saturday for sure. Which leads to the next point:  
  
**Less than favorable living conditions for a considerable time**  
  
You may be working like a horse, but you get paid like one too. You'll be making just enough to support your working lifestyle, but you can bet you'll have roommates until your well into your thirties. One of my coworkers I interned with has been writing professionally for 7 years, in his thirties, and is STILL interning while scraping by with small writing jobs just to pay bills (He does a lot of that WHILE at the internship). My boss at the same internship, a creative executive for the production company which does the show POWER makes around 25K a year. He works nearly 14 hours a day, can barely support himself, and is also the personal assistant to the CEO. He currently lives with roommates.  
  
**Sacrificing free time**  
  
This is also obvious, but you have to look closer to realize how much of an impact this takes. You'll be working so much for so many years that you may not have time to go home for the holidays for a few days. My boss told me this past year was the first year he spent Thanksgiving with his family since he was in college. Apart from the vacations, you'll need to squeeze in time for exercise, so late night gym sessions will probably be a thing. And if you like gaming, playing on a sports team, or anything that takes quite a bit of time, chances are you'll need to give it up for a chance to move up the ladder.  
  
All of these points round back to the previous overlying fact, **you must be 100% committed if you're serious about this**. Going 80%, 90%, or ever 99% won't cut it, you'll end up working like a horse and it won't get you anywhere.  
  
The reason for me leaving is because I have an opportunity to think about what I want to do with my life, make good money on a part-time schedule, and live independently while being able to do the things I enjoy. I may come back to LA one day to pursue a writing career, but I can't say when that'll be.  
  
If you wish to pursue a career in this industry, take warning: Know what you're getting into and be willing to literally sacrifice life to this industry in order to reach your career goals. This is not for the faint of heart."
30ihe9,3,2015-03-27,A note on the career of a screenwriter,NikkoKing,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/30ihe9/a_note_on_the_career_of_a_screenwriter/,"I have spent the past year pursuing a career in the field of screenwriting for the past year. In that time, I moved to LA, finished a TV writing degree at UCLA, dipped my toe in internship, and realized I wasn't right to work for this industry. Having said that, I believe I have a responsibility to impart some wisdom to others who may want to become a professional in this industry.  
  
Before I go further, I want to make something clear: **I'm not trying to scare anyone, but these are some of the hard facts of the industry**
  
First off, the biggest thing I realized, and this is true for all highly-competitive fields, **if you are not 100% committed mentally/physically/psychologically to the craft and the track to become a professional, you're wasting your time**. All facets of the entertainment industry make for a fantastic hobby, but to pursue it professionally requires a near lifetime dedication. The truth of it is simple, if you wish to become a professional in the industry, you will need to do the following:  
  
**(Move to LA)**  
  
**(Commit 60-80 hours a week at least to your career, be it working or sharpening your craft)**  
  
**(Be willing to live in less than favorable living conditions for a considerable amount of time)**  
  
**(Sacrifice a majority of your free time to go towards your career)**  
  
There are probably some more things to add to the list, but you get the point.  
  
Let's break it down some:  
  
**Move to LA**  
  
This is a no-brainer. Your only other option is maybe Vancouver, but if we're being realistic, your chances are probably better in LA (not to mention it costing about the same)  
  
**60-80 hours a week**  
  
This is what really scared me. I knew when I came out here I would have to work my ass off, but it's a whole new monster once this lifestyle is in effect. Your schedule consists of working 12 hours a day with 2 hours of commuting on average, getting home to eat quickly, sleep and repeat. And if you're serious about moving up the ladder, you're going in on Saturday for sure. Which leads to the next point:  
  
**Less than favorable living conditions for a considerable time**  
  
You may be working like a horse, but you get paid like one too. You'll be making just enough to support your working lifestyle, but you can bet you'll have roommates until your well into your thirties. One of my coworkers I interned with has been writing professionally for 7 years, in his thirties, and is STILL interning while scraping by with small writing jobs just to pay bills (He does a lot of that WHILE at the internship).

30iqvt,10,2015-03-27,What are my options if i'm interested in ML/analytics/distributed systems? Anything math/pure CS/stat heavy?,tabtsfinance,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30iqvt/what_are_my_options_if_im_interested_in/,"I'm looking to refocus my career and move away from enterprise and web stuff towards work that I find more challenging and interesting. I'm also interested in a career track that will pay really well. 

The things I'm interested in are the more logic and theory based topics like machine learning, distributed systems, math, and CS.  I could focus on things like front end and other web and back-end dev but I find that just to be a never ending rat race of learning new frameworks all the time. In the end that stuff doesn't feel challenging enough. 

I'm 32yo, going back to school full time to finish my ugrad degree later this year. What are my options, would it be feasible at all to get work related to machine learning or analytics/prediction/AI with just an undergrad degree (from a top 5 ugrad CS program)? I have seen people on this sub mention that you need a PhD to get that kind of work. Is that true? Would a masters work? 

What other kinds of jobs are there for someone who is focused on logic/math/stats/cs? Number crunching heavy stuff. Would I find a job in the quant or algo-trading world interesting? What kinds of candidates do those jobs look for(bachelors, MS, PhD?)? 


**My backstory**

I was an excellent student when I entered one of the Top 5 cs programs in undergrad fresh out of HS, but I flunked out due to just not doing any work. I'm going back later this year, but I have to do one year of community college courses (which i'm starting Fall 2015) before they let me back in. When I re-enter my original Uni i will have all the general education requirements satisfied so I will only need to fulfill major requirements (mainly math and CS classes). It should take me roughly two years from that point to finish at the Uni. I'm worried that having only two years there will limit the amount of time and # of summers I'll have to do things like research and internships. So of my main questions is, ***what could I be doing starting now to give myself the best chance to set myself up for getting the types of work I'm interested in?***

I might have to major in math and minor in CS due to my previous grades (you have to apply and be accepted into the CS major at my school, and so many people apply that it is very competitive). I've mapped out a few possible plans, in order of my preference:

1. Double Math/CS (with Statistics electives)
1. CS major / Math minor
1. Math major / CS minor / Stats electives and/or minor
1. Math major only 

I've been/am a team lead / architect, and am very strong in .NET, ASP.NET MVC, git, SQL, and javascript. But aside from Git, i don't think most of those skills will be useful for what I want to do.

Could use some advice.,TheJessKiddin,humanresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/30itzp/at_a_crossroads_in_my_hr_career_could_use_some/,"Hi all, I just discovered this subreddit and I'm so happy it exists! Hopefully it remains active. Sometimes it's hard to find other people who understand HR dilemmas and decisions without being met with a sarcastic eye roll. So anyways, here is my situation.

I'm from a major US city and currently work at a smallish transportation (trucking) company. I actually started off in the maintenance department and when the HR director heard that I was going to school for HR, she nabbed me right away because they needed A LOT of extra help due to the rapid growth of our company that we've experienced over the past two years. This growth has been especially great for me because it caused me to learn and adapt very quickly to the mass volume of employees we had to suddenly deal with. I went from HR Assistant from 7/2013-12/14 and have now been working as an HR Administrator (in my opinion, a generalist, but there hasn't been much attention paid to internal, corporate titles since we have restructured our department) from 1/2015-present. I'm graduating with my Bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in HR in early May. My current company has expressed more than enough interest to keep me around and full time post-graduation. 

However, I like to browse open positions at other companies just to see what types of trends are developing in terms of desired experience, education level, etc. so I can kind of plan my next educational/certification goals around it. So today I saw a couple HR positions open at United Airlines. Ever since I got into this transportation industry I've thought it would be a very interesting transition to move into an airline. They posted an HR Intern position and an HR Manager position. The problem is that I feel like I'm in between those positions right now. While I don't feel qualified to be a full on manager yet for a massive company, I feel overqualified for the intern position and also worry that they will let me go when my services are not needed anymore. 

I love the idea of staying in the transportation industry and having a huge name like United on my resume and I feel like I'd have a good chance of at least getting an interview for the intern position. I guess my problem is that, do I bite the hand that feeds? Meaning, leave my current company (if United chose to make me an offer) during a pretty impressive growth period who really gave me a chance to develop while I was working on my degree? Or do I jump right into the big league and work for a much, much larger company and gain experience in that environment? I feel like both companies offer me a lot of benefits based on the respective environments, but I just hope to gain some advice with those post from those who may have made this leap themselves. 

Other info: I plan to pursue my masters (MSHR) and PHR certificate soon. Between a heavy course load at school and a massive influx of work at my company, those plans have been pushed back just slightly but not cancelled by any means. "

30j1fq,50,2015-03-27,Bad organizational culture,hatsquawk,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/30j1fq/bad_organizational_culture/,"(Throwaway account)

I work for a state organization that does supports/installs/you name it for K-12 schools.  My official title is network admin but touch on almost everything.

I'm growing increasingly frustrated because of the lack of caring that goes on on the part of several co-workers.  Email constantly down for 1000's of people, hosted sites getting hacked, etc.  Some people just don't give a shit and seem to have absolutely no interest in making things better.  Add onto that there can be blatant refusal by one or two people to do what they're told by the bossman (but yet, nobody brings the hammer down).

A few of us actually do care about the services we provide and do our absolute best.  But we're hindered by the others that I mentioned above.  You name it, and everything seems half-assed...engineers ignore or delete monitoring alerts leading to system failures, documentation doesn't get updated, projects are implemented half-assed, heavy resistance to sharing information...the list goes on.  

At what point do I cut ties and look for something else?  Unfortunately I have been here a little over 4 years (this is my second career, and my first full-time gig after school &amp; internships), I am in a small market, and I'm not in the position to do much but bring up my concerns and do the best job I can.  This may sound like a lot of bitching, so I apologize in advance."
30j4tk,1,2015-03-27,Do I take a chance and get rejected or do I move on and always think of what could have happened? HELP PLZ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/30j4tk/do_i_take_a_chance_and_get_rejected_or_do_i_move/,"

I started a new internship in January, and with that came a new romantic interest. Except intstead of smooth saililng, it's way more complicated than it needs to be and has taken up a lot of energy that I should be spending on other things for the past three months.

So there is this guy who I liked from kind of the first moment that I saw him. I noticed he was attractive, but there was definitely something deeper there that I can't articulate. It could be the way he stares at me with his deep brown eyes, I wouldn't know. One thing leads to another and we go on a date, which is unsual considering we jump into this love survey game that he records on his phone. The love survey being that article from the NY times where a scientists came up with these 30+ questions about how to fall in love with someone. We get through some of them and it's pretty great. We talk about all kinds of shit and then at the end of the date we're holding hands and he's about to kiss me and then I ruin everything by pulling away. The real reason I did that is because I didn't want to seem too desperate, I was insecure that he would be turned off by the fact that I'd kiss him in this red-lit bar in front of all of these strangers. But I should have. 

When we returned to work things were weird, but he was still smililng at me and trying to communicate, and then I think I just fucked things up more because I over analyze everythign and tried harder to play hard to get. About a week after that we went out together in a group with other co-workes and I guess I was drunk and said some stupid shit that I can't remember and he ended up saying that I was super negative and hard to be around, and that my constructed ""contrarian personality"" wasn't cute or edgy and that I should just try to spend more time alone. And hearing that from him kind of made me feel like shit, until the next time I saw him at lunch when he was smiling at me and saying my name. 

Weeks pass and it's always this weird tension between us. Like something is trying to get out but I'm not even sure there is anything. We flirt and stare at each other through our eyes and it really feels like we both want to say something but can't. And he does these things where he sits next to me at lunch when there are other chairs around, and he calls me by my first name and winks at me and blatanly flirts with me, but then he'll ignore my texts. 

I do know what pissed him off the most is that I told some friends about our date and he told me that none of them should have known. And so I apologized to him because he said so. I just don't know what to do. Do I tell him that I like him. Do I tell him that I'm afraid of rejection too or am I being insane and should I just try really hard to get forget about him? I mean I'll probably move on if I don't have to see him again but something inside of me is like clinging on to this idea that something can happen with him, that he is maybe afraid to tell me how he feels too. When we do hang out -- we ate lunch together a few days ago by ourselves and he opened up to me about some of his fears in life and I feel like this isn't something he does with other people. 

So I guess I'm just asking fellow reddit users is -- what can I do to make this situation no longer uncomfortable? How do I get to the bottom of it. How do I make a decision to move on or to talk to him in person. It's hard, man. "

So I know a bit of Java and some C, currently learning ARM assembly. Unfortunately, I don't have outside experience to have a decent resume for any internships this summer. 

I'm wondering if you guys have any tips and suggestions on what to do this summer to make the most out of my summer. Hopefully getting an internship next summer after my third year. I hope I can get a job related to computers this summer to put on my resume. 

Any advice and help is welcomed and links to any tutorials, interns, suggestions, activities, and websites would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
30j9ex,1,2015-03-27,"I'm really concerned about my sisters' weight gain, but i can't talk to her about it.",Drunkdoggie,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/30j9ex/im_really_concerned_about_my_sisters_weight_gain/,"First of all let me apologize for any mistakes in this post. English is not my first language. Also be prepared for a wall of tekst. (TL;DR at the bottom) 

My family has always been sensitive to weight gain, so my dad and I work out four times a week to stay in decent shape. We maintain a somewhat healthy diet and we keep drinking and snacking to a minimum. My sister (19) on the other hand does nothing to stay in shape. She is an emotional eater and has a sweet tooth. 

Over the past year we've stood by as she gained weight quite rapidly. six months ago she went away for two months to do an internship and when she came back she had put on about fifteen pounds. Now bear in mind my sister wasn't a skinny girl to begin with. 
My family was quite concerned about this and we decided to address the issue. So we sat her down and suggested she tried obtaining a healthier lifestyle. We offered to help her in any way we can by getting her a personal trainer, working out with her and making an appointment with a dietician to make the transition easier for her. 

The problem is that my sister is really insecure about her body type and cares a great deal about what others think of her. So when we talked to her about the weight gain it made her immediately shut down, get defensive and irrationally angry with us.  She told us to mind our own business and that she knows what is good for her and her body. Whenever we try to address the issue she gets moody and will stay so for the next couple days. 

In the last two months she has been stressed about upcoming finals. Due to this she gained about another ten pounds and we (family) feel it is getting out of control. She is now at a point where simple everyday tasks such as climbing stairs or walking for an extended period cause her to pant and feel exhausted. 

Today my dad decided he would try to talk to her about the weight gain one last time, but he felt like he needed a strategy first because previous attempts turned out unsuccessful. So he texted my mom about his plan and asked her for advice. (she is a licensed dietician) Now he has always been caring and subtle when talking to my sister, but this time he was quite direct because he was fed up with the way she has been acting. 
Unfortunately my sisters' phone died today and she decided to borrow my moms' phone to send a couple texts at the same time my dad texted my mom. My sister read the texts and immediately called my dad and started ranting and cursing about him being rude and disrespectful towards her. 
She basically told him he is a shitty dad for pushing her to do something she doesn't want to do and that he doesn't love her. She got really emotional and stated that she felt like he was, and always has been, disappointed in her as a daughter and that I (brother) am clearly the favorite because he spends more time with me. She told him she hates him and that she doesn't want him to come to her graduation. 

My dad is extremely hurt by all this and is at a total loss about what he should do next. Me and my mom can't stand to see my dad in so much pain and we're angry at my sister for hurting him so much, but we are also really concerned about her health. 
We feel like we tried everything we can, but every attempt had no effect whatsoever. We just can't get trough to her. 

This is my last resort, so i'm calling on my friends from /r/self to please help us. If you know anything we can do to help my sister we'd be extremely grateful!

30jasm,3,2015-03-27,"I'm [27/m] really concerned about my sisters' [19/F] weight gain, but i can't talk to her about it.",Drunkdoggie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/30jasm/im_27m_really_concerned_about_my_sisters_19f/,"First of all let me apologize for any mistakes in this post. English is not my first language. Also be prepared for a wall of tekst. (TL;DR at the bottom)
My family has always been sensitive to weight gain, so my dad and I work out four times a week to stay in decent shape. We maintain a somewhat healthy diet and we keep drinking and snacking to a minimum. My sister (19) on the other hand does nothing to stay in shape. She is an emotional eater and has a sweet tooth.

Over the past year we've stood by as she gained weight quite rapidly. six months ago she went away for two months to do an internship and when she came back she had put on about fifteen pounds. Now bear in mind my sister wasn't a skinny girl to begin with. My family was quite concerned about this and we decided to address the issue. So we sat her down and suggested she tried obtaining a healthier lifestyle. We offered to help her in any way we can by getting her a personal trainer, working out with her and making an appointment with a dietician to make the transition easier for her.

The problem is that my sister is really insecure about her body type and cares a great deal about what others think of her. So when we talked to her about the weight gain it made her immediately shut down, get defensive and irrationally angry with us. She told us to mind our own business and that she knows what is good for her and her body. Whenever we try to address the issue she gets moody and will stay so for the next couple days.
In the last two months she has been stressed about upcoming finals. Due to this she gained about another ten pounds and we (family) feel it is getting out of control. She is now at a point where simple everyday tasks such as climbing stairs or walking for an extended period cause her to pant and feel exhausted.

Today my dad decided he would try to talk to her about the weight gain one last time, but he felt like he needed a strategy first because previous attempts turned out unsuccessful. So he texted my mom about his plan and asked her for advice. (she is a licensed dietician) Now he has always been caring and subtle when talking to my sister, but this time he was quite direct because he was fed up with the way she has been acting. Unfortunately my sisters' phone died today and she decided to borrow my moms' phone to send a couple texts at the same time my dad texted my mom. My sister read the texts and immediately called my dad and started ranting and cursing about him being rude and disrespectful towards her.

 She basically told him he is a shitty dad for pushing her to do something she doesn't want to do and that he doesn't love her. She got really emotional and stated that she felt like he was, and always has been, disappointed in her as a daughter and that I (brother) am clearly the favorite because he spends more time with me. She told him she hates him and that she doesn't want him to come to her graduation.

My dad is extremely hurt by all this and is at a total loss about what he should do next. Me and my mom can't stand to see my dad in so much pain and we're angry at my sister for hurting him so much, but we are also really concerned about her health. We feel like we tried everything we can, but every attempt had no effect whatsoever. We just can't get trough to her.

This is my last resort, so i'm calling on my friends from /r/self to please help us. If you know anything we can do to help my sister we'd be extremely grateful!

I  haven't put in my housing deposit and was told during my tour this week that dorms are full and I would have to live in an apartment as a freshman. Can anyone voice on whether or not this will negatively affect my freshman experience? Also, would I have any luck putting in the $50 deposit and adding my name to the dorm waitlist? 

I would appreciate any advice and would like to hear from anyone who was in a similar situation, thanks!

EDIT: Also, could anyone tell me how the internship situation is at A&amp;M for Computer Science students? I am considering going to UT Dallas due to its proximity to a larger city with perhaps more internship opportunities. "

I've just been offered a position at a Virtualization Management company as a Junior Sales Engineer. I initially applied for a Business Development Representative position. But since I demonstrated a fairly deep understanding of the company's product, they decided to steer me toward the SE route. 

To give you some background, this will be my first job out of college. While in school, I worked as a Help Desk assistant doing low level troubleshooting for campus and library computers. I also had an internship my Freshman year doing some software testing for an IT Consulting company. 

The offer given to me is 45K base. Below is a list of daily job duties.

-Conduct product demos in order to demonstrate the value of (insert company name) to prospective customers
-Drive the technical processes of the sales cycle by helping to identify and alleviate customer pain points
-Interface directly with support, development, and post sales teams to better understand how customers use (insert company product) and influence product direction

So my question is: based on the job description and my experience, is this a reasonable offer? Or should I try to negotiate a higher salary, and how much? I have not signed the offer letter or made an explicit verbal commitment to the offered salary amount, so I still am in good shape to negotiate. The job will be based in Boston.

Thanks for the help!"
30jhkd,7,2015-03-27,What am I doing wrong? Entry level IT graduate can't find job,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/30jhkd/what_am_i_doing_wrong_entry_level_it_graduate/,"I finished my Bachelors in IT last may from a large university in Miami and have not been able to find a job. I have done countless phone interviews (although not many at all lately) and probably less than a dozen in person interviews in a years time. The job positions ranged from junior linux admin, junior network security, Network Support, Help Desk. I think I have gotten decent at answering interview questions. The last interview I had was my dream entry level job. I got to the final interview and did really well but still didn't get the job. 

I have no real business related IT experience, but I did an unpaid internship for a small start up of about 5 guys where I set up VPS' and installed Joomla/Wordpress and then help with designing sites for clients. Besides that, I have been building computers for people since I was 15 (more than 10 years). 

So with that, what am I doing wrong here? It feels impossible just to get my foot in the door even though I was the guy in college carrying everyone else on his back. Another question I wanted to ask is how much should I be asking for in terms of pay? When they ask me if 13-14 dollars an hour is ok I don't know how to answer that because I feel like being entry level I have no right to ask for more, but that sounds extremely low for an IT position, even entry level.

Spoiler: not people with science backgrounds.,GhostofAlyeska,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/30jnf4/ever_wonder_who_writes_fox_news_science_articles/,"I was simply curious who Fox News' science reporters are.  I wanted to know what kind of scientific backgrounds they might have.  For example, NPR's science correspondents include:

30joip,138,2015-03-27,The ghosts of Stupid User Stories past,IT_Lexicon,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/30joip/the_ghosts_of_stupid_user_stories_past/,"I currently work in R&amp;D for a small independent biochemistry lab. The company is the vanity project of an elderly professor I'll refer to as the Doctor from here on out, with several patents in an obscure corner of medical testing and research. (Hopefully that's generic enough.) 

&amp;nbsp;

As long as I've worked here, the company has had two floors. The ground floor is staffed by friendly old ladies who do customer service for our many industrial clients; the second floor is where research and development for new products happens. (Production is largely outsourced, although we do have a small fabber-shop on premises - mostly for prototyping and repairs/small orders.) 

&amp;nbsp;

I joined the company just as my old boss (let's call him Dan) was getting aspirations of leaving; he groomed me to take over his position, then bailed out, leaving the Doctor a glowing letter of recommendation for me to take over the vacancy. Considering I went from ""glorified intern"" to ""salaried lower management with benefits package"" in the span of a fortnight, I was certainly not going to complain - though honestly that should have been more of a red flag than I took it for at the time. More on that later.

&amp;nbsp;

When Dan left, it triggered a sort of upheaval. A ""Great Purging"" if you will. It was like the building itself was shaking off the dust. The entire R&amp;D department, no longer shielded from the lower floors by Dan, began getting surprise visits by people we'd never met before in our lives - all of them big names from the ground floor, who had been with the company forever but had been using Dan as their liaison to ""The Upstairs Folk"" as we were (apparently) known.

&amp;nbsp;

It was through them that I learned that our building has a third floor - a B1F. The Chasm. The Place Tech Goes To Die. I discovered it was full of ancient technology - old PowerPC Macs, stacks of printers, cables galore, Dell Optiplexes, a good half dozen Eee PCs from before Asus marketed as Asus - all of which had just been sitting down there, rotting. Apparently it was all ""broken tech"" from back before the company hired IT contractors. 

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I mention The Chasm is because part of the shakeup involved it. The Doctor discovered the basement and its trove of archaeotech; believing it all junk, he ordered it all disposed of. It all had to be out by the end of the week.

&amp;nbsp;

As one or two of the younger schlubs started sorting everything down there to be dumpster'd, I had the bright idea to make sure what we were throwing out was, y'know, *actually broken.* So on a whim I grabbed an ancient printer, plugged it into the wall, and powered it on. 

&amp;nbsp;

The damn thing booted up fine. 

&amp;nbsp;

""Alright,"" sez I, ""it could still be broken. Let's see if it prints."" I hook it up to my trusty Surface Pro 2 and let Windows Update install the damn thing. It installs perfectly. Put some paper in the tray, hit ""Print test page,"" and... it prints. Perfectly. Despite having been sitting in this basement for ""at least five years"" according to the nearest friendly old lady. The ink wasn't even low.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, what especially stuck in my craw over this whole thing? There were people on both floors *desperately in need of tech* that was simply languishing in The Chasm. Friendly old ladies on the first floor who had been asking for a printer for months. Former fellow interns who needed a computer (any computer, even an ancient one) to write reports and access online journals on, so they weren't doing *NDA-compliant work* on personal laptops that left the building to walk around a state college on a regular basis. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I decided, in the face of the Great Purging, to do a Great Reclamation. And as I worked, I began to piece together the ""problems"" that had consigned these poor artefacts of archeotech to The Chasm in the first place.

&amp;nbsp;

* An HP LaserJet 2300. Someone had switched a setting so instead of pulling paper from Tray 2 (the actual tray), it would always try to pull from Tray 1 (a single-job manual loading tray that had to be unfolded in order to use). Net effect was a printer that ""always thought it was out of paper, even when the tray was full to bursting."" Changing the setting back took all of two minutes.  
* A Ricoh Aficio 3500N color laser printer that ""nobody knew what was wrong with."" Including me, because as soon as I plugged it in and powered it up, it printed more than happily.  
* A Brother HL-4070CDW color laser printer that ""complained about being used as a network printer."" I was never able to fix that part, but it worked perfectly fine as some friendly old lady's desk printer via USB.
* A Konica Minolta PagePro 1350W that had been hooked up via Parallel cable to a Dell Optiplex tower. It had gotten jostled, which had damaged the Parallel port on both the printer and the tower - which had consigned both to The Chasm. The printer's USB port was completely fine, so it also got a new lease on life at a friendly old lady's desk.  
* The aforementioned Dell Optiplex. Everything else on the damn machine worked fine, so it got its HDD wiped and a clean install of Debian put in. It became one of my interns' research desktop with a $10 monitor from Goodwill.
* The six Eee All-In-One PCs. They were apparently spares that had ""gotten lost in the shuffle."" They were completely functional, completely untouched. Five of them were still wrapped in the factory clingwrap and had never even been powered on.

&amp;nbsp;

You may be wondering at the startlingly specific manner to which I've referred to much of this tech. There's a reason for this. After the Great Reclaiming? *All of it is still in service.* I just took a brief walk around the building and checked the model numbers on the units I know are my rescues. The OptiPlex I don't have a model number for because it finally kicked the bucket last month, but everything else on that list is still in service. The HP LaserJet 2300 I saved first now lives on my desk; its machine-spirit is clicking happily at me a foot and a half to my left as I send it another batch of reports.

&amp;nbsp;

The kicker? Every one of those broken printers had at one point been one of the Doctor's personal printers. Rather than have them fixed, he decided they were ""junk"" and had an intern ""get rid of them."" Three generations of interns had just been putting them down in The Chasm to languish, forgotten.

&amp;nbsp;

I think I'm beginning to understand why Dan quit.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** Permit ye not the Ecclesiarchy into this hallowed Mechanicus bunker, for the line between archeotech and heretek is blurry in their eyes."

So, anyway's I ordered $15.34 in food and sense I was in a great mood, knowing how a tip on a bad night can cheer you up decided to go BIG with my tip, I gave a $30.50 (all the cash on me)  tip on the $15 dollars of food (bought with my debit)

So after waiting the obligatory 45 mins for the food to shop, the delivery guy get's out of the car and comes to door with one of the most poutty expressions I have seen on a delivery driver's face ever, and knowing what kind of hell can go on at the place I just think ""Oh, He must be having a bad night or got bad tips"". After he hands me my food, almost dropping it in the process I hand him the tip:

And I quote these are the literal word's that came out of his mouth

""Oh, is that it, it's obvious you can afford more""

Now to say the least, I was obviously quite pissed about the shit he had just said to me, and I was about to start grilling him about how I was trying to be nice, and I know how much the job sucks but then he walk's away with the tip (he does drop the fifty cent's and doesn't pick it up) and somehow manages to almost hit my mailbox on the way out.

I later found out a month later I cannot get food delivered from there anymore, apparently I quote ""tried to attack a driver""

What would you guy's have done, I almost asked for the tip back.

**TLDR: Driver bitches about 200% tip, put's me on the No-Deliver list**"

I graduated from college in richmond VA in 2012 and moved back home to the DC area. Got a great job out of college in the field of my major (urban planning) and things were all good. Except for the fact that I was working public sector for my local government and quickly learned that our county (one of the most prosperous in the country) is run by the most incompetent people in the world; people that don't actually live here and dont give a fuck. 

Whatever, that paid internship was good experience and I made good loot. However, it just rekindled the addiction I had in college for the last two-three years once I got a connect at home and simply had to make the short trek to the city.

Moving forward: After annual trips to europe for several months at a time to try to get clean (Denmark, Scotland, and Spain most recently). I found myself back where I started.

For the past year+ I've work for a family owned and operated apartment complex. I'm the property manager and the owner is rarely there. I'm pretty much in charge and do what I want as long as shit gets done. It's a sweet gig minus the fact it's only 33-35 hours a week, but I'm there by myself a lot. I have my dude roll through often as well as my people scoopin from me, all while slangin apartments.

I usually do pretty well budgeting my shit for the biweekly paycheck. This time period not so much. Scooped 6 g's in less than 4 days. I should've said I just picked up the spike two months ago and haven't looked back.

I was gonna sub tomorrow and dreading it because I havent had to do that in months, but as luck would have it, I middled some shit and came across essentially a little more than a g for free.

Point of this post, fml. I'm 25, have a serious spinal condition that usually 60-70 year olds get called severe spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine) just got on the spike because it's the only thing that temporarily subdues the agonizing pain, can't save money worth shit, it's all gone by the end of each pay period, and starts all over again after each check. Have a great girl trying to support me, but has a bf and I've told her I'm into her and she even maybe into me because she wants me to move with her to nyc because she knows dc is killing me.

Pretty much it. "
30karb,0,2015-03-27,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Pegging, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/30karb/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_pegging/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else?

30kfx3,1,2015-03-27,"I'm trapped in a wasted, young life.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/30kfx3/im_trapped_in_a_wasted_young_life/,"I graduated college in December, and I have absolutely no job, friends, no support network of any sort.

My college experience was a nightmare in itself. I went to a top-50 private school with extremely risk-averse tendencies and an obsession with looking good on paper without any substance. I took 1.5 years off after freshman year because I told a school therapist I was suicidal, and when I was ""voluntarily"" committed she told me I had to leave because I was a ""liability"". I was the older side of 19 at the time, and my life has been a downhill spiral ever since.

Upon my return, I had one good semester, but the next semester I decided to take some hard science and math classes to improve my credentials. At the same time, a student hanged himself in my building, and it led to an administrative ass-covering shitstorm. Needless to say, in my classes I had the typical sophomore experience, and the repercussions were severe.

I was called into my RA's office and asked a number of questions about my mental health, my academic performance, and my home life. The next day, I received an email saying I was called into my academic adviser's office, where she informed me that she already made an appointment for me at the counseling center, got up, and personally escorted me to his office across the street. I shit you not.

Yes, because a random student killed himself, I was required to go to therapy sessions without prior knowledge and consent. And how my adviser got this information about my health, I literally had no idea. The therapist I saw was head of the counseling department and spent my appointments asking roundabout questions about my condition, peppered with irrelevant rants about the lack of funding he receives from the administration. He suggested taking another leave of absence, but if I returned it needed to be through the counseling center, because ""I don't know what academic services will say"", and he also suggested that I drop out and pursue my musical interests, since college might not be for me.

I was afraid to seek treatment for my illness in any capacity after this series of unfortunate events, and my condition worsened progressively. I lost the exactly two people I considered my friends, the rest of the student body ostracized me, and I fell completely off the radar (not that I was ever really on it to begin with). Last semester of university, I could barely get out of bed or attend my classes, I failed two of them for failing to complete assignments and graduated by the skin of my teeth with a useless humanities degree and no internships. Panicked, I went to academic services again to let them know that if it weren't for their misconduct I would have declared disability and been able to receive an extension, but I was afraid to. I was then told that the counseling center had since been ""restructured"" (the therapist I had was fired) and that the school wasn't liable for what happened in the past, two years ago. My asshole of an adviser also made sure to call my professors in advance to badmouth me so there would be no chance of getting a grade change to Incomplete from them, and then call the counseling center to make sure they knew my professors couldn't stand me and not to bother with writing a doctor's note to help my case.

Where am I now? I'm holed up in an apartment here in my old college town living on my parent's dime, completely alone, on meds, and barely able to function let alone hold a job. My family won't let me move in with them because I ""have to be independent"" and ""people live with depression all the time"". I struggle daily with suicidal thoughts and I have nowhere else to go.

I just don't care anymore. I wonder every day what would have happened if I did drop out, while I was still young and vital and not subject to the social pressure of ""letting go"" of your youth. If only I had gotten treatment and forced myself to find friends and have experiences elsewhere rather than take the cowardly path of self-denial and waste my time on trying to make a toxic environment work in my favor, because ""college is the best 4 years of your life"". 

Yes I've posted here before. It's Friday night and I have no one to keep me entertained. Tell me why I should continue living after my track record of emptiness and failure."

_________________________________

Vincent followed Mach down the halls of his mansion, still talking as they left the trophy room. “So, you think the Builders are peaceful but they made those massive sharks that attack people? That sounds a bit strange don’t you think?”

“They only attack if they’re provoked like I said.”

“But you also said you figured hu… my people would all get eaten by the first one they met.” Vincent looked to the dragon who didn’t reply and just kept walking until Vincent continued. “Because you assume we’d provoke it.”

“I have no doubt.”

“Mmh…” Vincent nodded, that sounded rather accurate he had to admit. But what if they were designed that way? He really didn’t give much credence to the old conspiracies about aliens landing on the pyramids, or abducting certain people through history but… well how did he explain his own situation? “Can we talk to the academics again?”

“Certainly, we need to meet with them to get you that new black box after all. I wanted to have a private conversation with you about my own memories and give them time to look over the data.” Mach said while leading Vincent back downstairs into the more streamlined basement.

“It’s strange knowing someone else is watching your memories isn’t it?” Vincent said, all too familiar with the caution it causes.

“More so when they’re in your head with you adding their own perspective to it.” Mach agreed with a nod. That was actually a new thought for Vincent. When he’d tried to view that woman’s memories it had been entirely strange to try and figure out what were his thoughts and what were her thoughts. It had to be especially strange for Mach who’d never gone through the process at all.

Soon they were back in the same room as before but the Academics were all focused on Zurni and Fizern instead of their terminals. Fizern was ticking points off of his fingers, two already out. “And you always seem to make this a competition between our imprints! I’m the foremost scholar on brains within the entire Union! I’m not just a neuroscientist I’m the best there is! But you don’t hear me bringing that up unless you start to question my expertise! Creature 88 might be a new species and his brain is more complicated but it still functions as one expects a brain to function! Being an expert on a species does not make you an expert on every aspect of that species!”

Zurni was huffing, four of her arms crossed as she balanced on the back two. “You don’t bring it up directly because it’s always there in your tone! Your inflection! You always think you’re better than me and won’t concede a single point to me without checking it yourself! If you just trusted me to be doing my job then you wouldn’t second guess every decision I make or idea I present!”

“My *tone*? My *inflection*? Have you changed imprints and become a language and communication expert since we last spoke?!” He couldn’t growl but he seemed close.

“I don’t need to be an expert on all communication to be an expert on your communication! Growing up with someone has a habit of allowing you to understand that they mean but aren’t saying *father*!” 

When Vincent heard her say that he burst out laughing causing everyone in the room to look his way and stopping the two xenos from fighting. Zurni looked confused, Fizern looked shocked, and Mach looked curious. Of the other three academics whose names Vincent couldn’t remember right now the stone face and praying mantis looked horrified. But the mouse? He was quite actually pulling some sort of food out of his coat and eating it with a big grin on his face. He was just loving the whole thing. “What’s so funny?” Zurni finally demanded.

“I saw this shit all the time in movies and vids, and all that. The father daughter argument crap. ‘I’m not convinced you’re ready for this!’ And then she goes all like ‘Screw you dad! I’m totally ready!’” Vincent took on a more high pitched voice to try and make it clear who was who in his mind. “And then all the other shit goes on in the movie and he’s dying but she saved the day and he says some crap like. ‘Oh honey why did I ever doubt you? I’m so proud of you. Blllleeeggghh I’m dead.’ And she cries and then shacks up with the protagonist and the credits roll.” He shook his head as the Academics and Mach went through a variety of faces as they tried to comprehend what he’d said. Except the mouse who was still grinning and eating.

“I’m sorry… what does this have to do with anything?” Fizern finally asked as he shook his head in mild disbelief it seemed.

“You guys have it fucking lucky. You’re both alive to yell at each other. She’s an adult and clearly passionate about her job, you get to be there for her. Do you have any fucking clue what I’d give? What I’d do. To have had another conversation with my dad when I was in my teens? Just one! Or what I’d do now to talk to my mom again? I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again!”

“Where was your father?” Zurni asked, always ready to find out more about Vincent.

“Dead. He died when I was young.” Vincent noted her eyes get wider as she had a new piece for her puzzle so to speak.

“He did! How did it happen? Were there any major male figures in your life after that?”

“I’m not getting into any of that.” He waved his hands in front of him to make it clear. “Not a chance. Not right now. Maybe later but not right now Zurni.” He could see her disappointment but she obviously wasn’t going to push it. Fizern however spoke up.

“Your people had movies about topics like this? Our… disagreements I mean.”

“Oh all the time. It’s something people connect to. The struggle between parent and adult. Everyone has a different relationship with the people who brought them into the world after all. It’s complicated. But almost everyone has some struggle with it. How do you make yourself different from the ones who raised you? Or how do you stay true to their upbringing?” 

Vincent shrugged and kept talking. “I always looked up to my father but I probably couldn’t be more different. I’m violent, and aggressive and a whole host of other things while he was very compassionate and kind.” Vincent smirked a little as he thought it over and then laughed for a moment. “Hell he could even sing. When he took my mom out on a date they couldn’t get into the club they were trying to get into so instead he took her to an empty parking lot and sang to her while they danced under the street lights.” Vincent trailed off as he thought back on hearing his mom and dad tell the story when he was a kid. He could just feel the love radiating off of them…

“Vincent?” Mach’s voice was distant. Oh what he’d give to see either one of his parents again. It wasn’t like he could meet them in the afterlife if he kept being cloned… “Vincent!” He finally jerked back into reality, aware that they’d been trying to get his attention for a while.

“What?” They were all staring at him and the mouse seemed to have run out of snacks in his lab coat.

“You had expressed an interest in talking with my specialists? I figured now might be a decent time before you lose your thoughts by experiencing those of another.” Mach watched Vincent carefully, seeming unsure if Vincent had already lost his thoughts.

“Oh… yes it was something you mentioned earlier. Now that I know about the Builders and what not there’s a chance that I’m related to all that, I speak your common language, I fit within the range of most species even if I’m extreme. But the worms experimented on me. They made it so I could be cloned for some reason. They obviously had plans for my use and they hate the Union.” He looked out at the various experts and of course Mach. “What if this was their plan?”

Mach frowned. “Being captured?” 

“No think about it. My people’s blood is being used as a drug. I’ve upset the natural balance of the Union. I don’t fit into the normal categories like the other species. Just like Mach said if we came into contact with that Builder shark thing we’d likely just provoke it.” He shrugged. “What if the worms knew I’d bring the Union down from the inside?”

“*No*.” Mach said with the same force he’d denied any chance Minva could be a Warden. “You fight crime. You can’t be responsible for things outside of your control. There are other forces working against you here.”

“Right but black blood started showing up not long after I did! What if the Wardens were working with the Worms? What if my species is something the worms knew about and manipulated, or shit what if they created us?” He could see the academics puzzling through what he’d mentioned but Mach plowed ahead.

“You think the worms somehow manipulated dragons into doing their work for them? We’re supposed to be the very bedrock of the Union! While some might be led astray they’d have to know the rest of us would fight claw and tooth to preserve it! You’ve delayed their plans, and strike against them at every turn! How is that part of their plan?”

Vincent had heard how confident Mach was about keeping him going before. When his past had become clear once more Mach was there to ensure he never stopped. That he got right back to work. Of course the dragon wanted to use him as a pawn but… it was the way he sounded back then and now. 

Maybe… Maybe Mach really thought of Vincent as his friend and refused to believe he was some evil pawn. “The worms can obviously get to my home planet. They know more about my species than anyone else. I’m not the only h…” He barely caught it. “There are others like me here. Forget what the Wardens are trying now, what did they want with us back then?”

“The worms are always seeking new species to reach before the Union. They’re terrible fighters on their own so they look for hosts. You’ve proven to be a very capable and hard to kill creature so maybe they were grooming you for their own army.” Zurni said which made Vincent wince a little at the thought.

“But if that’s true it means you being here is not some grand and terrible plan of theirs.” Mach was quick to add on.

“But is it possible the worms have been manipulating my people to be the force you mention? The kind to fight and quarrel constantly? To be lazy, and yet industrious? Can this Union survive the introduction of an entire race like me? An entire race that won’t fit into these easy classifications the AI relies on? The kind of species that kills over gods and will suddenly be introduced to ancient races that left behind incredibly destructive devices?”

The room was silent. Not even Mach spoke for a while as Vincent looked at them. After a moment Vincent sighed and shrugged. “Since we’re talking about crazy things here have you ever heard of a system with a small volcanic planet right next to the star, a greenhouse world, a garden world, a small rocky and red planet, some asteroids, two gas giants, and then…” He paused. “An ice planet and a dwarf?”

Mach shook his head. “Nothing comes to mind. It’s not too far off from this system in those terms however.”

Vincent arched a brow. “How close are we talking?”

“No small volcanic one like you said, but the first planet is covered in acid swamps. It might have been a greenhouse in the past. Then there’s the Farm, and then this planet. No asteroids though.”

“None?” Vincent tried to think back on everything he knew about astronomy. Which wasn’t much.

“I mean a stray one here or there perhaps but certainly not a belt of them. Two gas giants though, but nothing further out than them.” Vincent rubbed his chin. That… was that close enough?

“The Farm, does it have an unusually large moon?” Vincent asked before Mach shook his head.

“It has rings, and a trapped asteroid.”

“What about this planet? It’s hard for me to tell what’s up there when I rarely get to see the sky.”

“There are two small moons, rocky, devoid of life.”

“More trapped asteroids?”

“No, they’re spheroids.”

“Well… huh...” The dirt on the surface of this planet was dirty blackish purple. But was it always that way? He shrugged and rubbed his head. “All this is starting to hurt my head. But you said the Farm has rings? Like you look up in the sky and tons of little things hanging up there?”

Mach chuckled and nodded. “More or less.”

“I’d like to see something like that someday. Alright I’ve wasted enough time, let’s see the memory.” He climbed up on the table he’d used before, not needing any help to get the needle jammed into place.

“Are you trying to avoid thinking about all of this?” Mach asked.

“No time to talk! Let’s find out what’s on that black box! Zurni get this rolling or I’ll fire you as my assistant!” The xeno quickly scrambled over to a terminal. Vincent closed his eyes trying to end his current train of thoughts with someone else’s memories. As he closed his eyes he could feel things begin.

Alright this was a man. Unconscious. Pain in the back of his head. Some sort of old scar? Pretty bad pain. Slowly his eyes blinked open as he returned to the land of the living. Looking down he could see that his oranje, blauwe, and wit armor was all still in place. However his comm wasn’t picking up the De Vliegende Hollander. Wait. Huh? What the fuck? The what? His clothes were what color?

As he looked up he could see a Sater. They were dangerous, usually worked for the Draken, but this one had black armor and no heraldry. Perhaps it belonged to the wormen… The language was fucking with Vincent’s mind and in reality he groaned out as his brain tried to process non-English thoughts with his English ones. The Sater… Satyr wasn’t alone. There was another with him sitting at a table. “So, we’ve finally caught you. It took quite some effort. It seems the Shade isn’t the only capable member of your species.”

Vincent could sense some confusion about the term the Shade so this human wasn’t aware of Vincent. But instead of addressing it he spoke up. “Natuurlijk, de nieuwe koper die te goed is om waar te zijn, is echt te goed om waar te zijn. En ik maar denken dat alle aliens idioten zijn! Nou vertel op, voor wie werk je Sater? De wormen?”

Whaaaaat the fuuuuck? Something… something… aliens? Worms? He could tell the person understood the English being spoken but wasn’t replying in the language. The Saters… Satyrs looked to each other, for a moment before looking back at Vincent. Or… whoever he was. “Lets try this again. I know you can speak common. And I suspect you’re willing to work with us once you just tell us what your price is. That’s all you want right? Credits?”

”Je hebt echt geen idee wie ik ben, of wel? Of wat ik ben? Vast en zeker ook nog nooit Nederlands gehoord? Nee natuurlijk niet, jullie spreken allemaal Engels. Het is ook altijd zo oneerlijk. Hollywood zet Amsterdam nooit goed neer, en gaat er altijd van uit dat jullie zullen landen in wat eerst Amerika was!” 

Oh fuck this hurt Vincent’s head. Something… Netherlands… English? Hollywood… America? He could tell the person was pissed off at the Satyrs over something. Saters. FUCK. Satyrs! “Maybe it’s his head injury.” The sitting… creature in black said.

The other stepped up, slamming his fist into Vincent’s gut, making him gasp out in reality and the memory before the Satyr backhanded him. Normally that would just sting but the armored plated fist cut open Vincent’s lip. Er… the man’s lip. In reality Vincent would be fine.

He spit up at the Sater who’d been hitting him. “Is dat alles? Mijn moeder deed me nog meer pijn toen ik vroeger billekoek kreeg! Vuile klootzak, blijf godverdomme is met je poten van me af, ik word er schijtziek van jij smerige tyfuslijer! Je stinkt nog erger dan een dixie op een festival!”

That was all cursing. Just… it had to be. Vincent could sense the anger and frustration welling up within the other man and didn’t know the details but was well aware he’d been cursing them out. The Satyr at the table slammed his hands on the table. “We know you speak common! You’re just being stubborn! You’re a criminal! You have no honor so why pretend like we’re that different?! You heard our offer before but we want to make it extra clear now. You put your skills to work getting what we want in and out of the city and we’ll make you filthy rich.”

“Just your base! Work with us. Give us something to make it clear you’re willing to work! Otherwise we’ve got all the time there is and you’ve only got one life. You don’t come back like the Shade.” The close Satyr leaned in closer still to Vincent. The other human that is. Not Vincent.

“Als je echt denkt dat ik je de locatie van mijn hoofdkwartier zo makkelijk vertel,  heb je duidelijk geen idee wie ik ben. Zodra ik dood ben, ben ik weg, en is dit gewoon een leegte in mijn geheugen. Veel succes met het zoeken naar de echte ik.” Vincent could tell he wasn’t worried about dying in the least, especially as the man took the chance to spit blood up into the Sater’s visor.

The Satyr growled and pulled back his fist, only to stop as blaster fire was heard in the distance. He could see the Satyrs looking towards the door and the sounds of fighting were quickly getting closer. The man laughed up at them. “Ëindelijk! Iemand hier om je te vermoorden! Dit is m’n kans…”

There was an explosion that knocked Vincent around from the chair he was bound too. He could feel it break as he hit the ground, and likely his right wrist, but it also meant his hands were free. The man scrambled to his feet just as there was another explosion. He could feel burning, there was a hole in the wall of the room. As he jumped through it the jagged metal cut strips out of his arms and legs. Much of this was easier for Vincent to comprehend as the man acted without thinking too much.

There was some sort of ocean he could see through a window in the next room and… whoa… rings! He could see the rings stretching out away from the planet! That looked amazing! But the man wasn’t interested. He turned and began to run down some sort of hallway before he felt something slam into him from the side. There was the crunch of breaking ribs before he was slammed into the window, and then through it. The shattering glass cutting up much of his other side and back before he hit the ground.

Things became fuzzy then as if he was watching through Static. But he could feel burning and looked down, seeing some sort of oil spreading across the top of a boat, lapping at his feet. He was pinned under the bulk of a dead Rovik. The fire was getting closer. He would die slowly. Painfully. Instead the man grabbed the Rovik’s blaster and began to pull it up to his head. There was some sort of final thought…

“Hopelijk heb ik door dat de deal fout ging, en zal ik voorzichtiger zijn met mijn nieuwe kopers!” And then the man pulled the trigger and the memory became nothing but darkness.

As soon as Vincent was back in reality he sat up and patted down the crotch of his pants. The academics were staring at him in surprise but he sighed in relief. “I was just making sure I didn’t piss myself.” 

He could see the revulsion on their faces except Zurni who looked curious. “From dying in the memory you mean? Sometimes your body undergoes sympathetic muscle relaxation and you lose control of some of your body functions?” 

“I…” Vincent paused and thought it over. Was it just a physical reaction that made him do it? He always thought that the fear of ending was what made him do it sometimes. He’d died in all sorts of awful and terrifying ways. Now he suddenly wasn’t as sure. “I don’t know if it’s physical or emotional.” Might as well be honest.

“What did you learn?” Mach asked to change the subject.

“Satyr’s were trying to interrogate him… about something. He wasn’t playing along. Then… explosions and running, and fire, and death.” Vincent hated burning alive. Those two days trapped in the rubble of the factory… if the Yurvesh had tried to make him relive those he likely would have killed… someone. He would 
have fought it to the end that’s for sure.

“We were able to view it as you uploaded since this system is more efficient than the normal one you use. But we had no idea what he was saying. A few words sound familiar but that’s about it.” Mach informed him.

“You think I know? I only know one language! And that guy was speaking  Duuuugghh!” He’d tried to say Dutch but instead twisted and threw up blood onto the floor of their nice clean room. He could hear the academics gasp and squeal, the mouse fainted, the stone face rushed to the nearest trashcan to puke as well. Zurni was actually stepping forward though.

“Mind if I take a sample?”

“Dr. Zurni I feel that might be in poor taste…” Mach admonished her lightly. 

“But I want to see if this is chemically different from the normal samples.” She had a point. Vincent held up a hand and she quickly grabbed a small beaker to hand to him. He spat up a bit more blood into the beaker and then handed it back before leaning back onto the table and laying down once more.

“I… fucking… *hate* that.”

He could hear Mach speak into a comm unit. “Yes. Another clean up. More water and burnt toast.” But Vincent waved him off and stood up. “Hold off on the toast I think he wants to go upstairs now.

“Mach I need to find something. This really tears it. There are more of my kind here! At least two! Or… well that one is dead so there was two but now at least one! And if I don’t go find him and help him I might be the only one left! I know I was just talking about how perhaps me being here is a terrible thing but I have to find someone else. I just have to!”

“You won’t hear any arguments from me. I’ll do anything I can to help.” Mach promised with a solemn nod. Vincent knew that the other human, Brian was somewhere at the bottom of the City. He’d heard the reports from Frey.

“I need some gear, and I need a communication device that can patch into Satyr channels. Oh and some transportation to get me down to the Patrol HQ.”

“You’ll have more than that if you need. I’ll tell my Chief of Security to assemble a team to-“

“No! No team.” Vincent stressed. The Satyr were hunting the other human. While Mach’s were likely good guys Vincent had come across far too many bad ones already. He wasn’t ready to trust them as a species just yet. Blind loyalty didn’t sit well with him. “I have to do this alone.”

“Very well. Can you tell me why not?”

“I think the Satyr working for the Wardens are hunting another of my kind near the bottom of the city. If I take yours it can get very confusing. And since they bombed the checkpoint and we have no idea when the lifts will be open again-“ 

It was Mach’s turn to cut Vincent off. “They’re already open. That’s the only public access between Sector 1 and 2, the explosive didn’t damage the lifts. It’s been several hours. Of course it’s open again.”

“Oh.” That was actually very efficient of them but it made sense. “Alright well then I need to do some hunting.” He got up off the side of the table that wasn’t covered in blood puke. Then he paused and looked at the academics as he remembered something he wanted to ask. “Can you guys see my dreams?”

The stone face was recovered now but a lighter stone color than before. “Oh… please don’t talk about your dreams right now…”

He looked confused as Zurni spoke up. “Even I think they’re disturbing. You only catch glimpses at times. A blurry image or far away sound. In general I would agree that they distress those who watch. So we skip them. Or dare interns and grad students to watch one of your full night’s rest. Few make it.”

“Don’t even joke about that.” The stone faced said. “I hope you don’t make them watch when the figure appears.”

“The figure?” Vincent asked.

“There’s what looks to be your skeleton in a black robe with some sort of bladed weapon. It stares directly at the screen. Or… the black where the eyes should be does.” Zurni said and shrugged but Vincent could see the stone face shudder.

“No. You might think that’s black but it’s beyond that. Those are voids of darkness that can’t be fully described by the words of mortals. Within them lies something deeper… the knowledge that no matter how hard you try nothing will spare you from just ever watchful judgment. That he will be there in the end. Your end.” Her final words a whisper. “To weigh your soul on the scales.” 

Everyone on the room was staring at the stone faced academic now as she looked off at nothing. Finally Vincent broke the silence. “Someone find a way to get me a picture of that figure. I might want it soon. But for now I need to go hunting.”

I was contacted by a startup in San Jose sometime in late Feb/early March and they said they would be able to offer me a position as an intern there during this summer. I accepted the offer and stopped looking and interviewing for other companies. Their head engineer told me they needed time to design an internship program since they're fairly new to this whole intern thing and told me he would get back to me within a week let me know specifically what I'd be doing and the specific dates of the internship and compensation for me. 

It's been almost a month and I didn't hear back from them so I emailed the head software engineer to see what's up so I can start looking for housing. Today he called me to ""discuss some potential projects I could work on"" and basically went through the 2 options they had to offer and then told me that it probably won't suit me and said to contact them in a month or two for new intern positions that could open up.

Now I have nothing to do during the summer and I don't know where to even apply for internships because everything is pretty much filled. I know how important having an internship this summer is and I'm scared because all my friends already have internships. What do I do? "

**[March] GWC: Average Joes**

Many of our stories star average humans who just happen to be things like ex-special forces or closet engineers, and while we enjoy those stories, that's not what we're looking for this time. Let’s tell the story of the Average Joe, the men and women that truly make up the bulk of human society and how awesome they are, more so when they are inconvenienced by whatever troubles the xeno bring their way?

As in: nothing would ever get done without sweet, glorious coffee and may God have mercy on the xeno that destroys our favorite coffee shop with an all nighter looming over us.

**[March] GWC: Average Joes**

Many of our stories star average humans who just happen to be things like ex-special forces or closet engineers, and while we enjoy those stories, that's not what we're looking for this time. Let’s tell the story of the Average Joe, the men and women that truly make up the bulk of human society and how awesome they are, more so when they are inconvenienced by whatever troubles the xeno bring their way?

As in: nothing would ever get done without sweet, glorious coffee and may God have mercy on the xeno that destroys our favorite coffee shop with an all nighter looming over us.

“I've got to get this report filed/job finished, ALIEN INVASION BE DAMNED!”

30kvpv,2,2015-03-28,Feeling like I (27M) may be in an unbalanced relationship with my GF (25F) of 2.5 years,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30kvpv/feeling_like_i_27m_may_be_in_an_unbalanced/,"I've been feeling like I've been in an unbalanced relationship for a while but it didn't really hit me till later last year. At first I thought I was just imagining it and that it was all in my head but i thought further into our earlier relationship and i kind of just don't know anymore. 

Our first year together consisted of her living in the city and me living and hour away from the city. She had an internship while I have a full time job where i worked overtime on the weekdays alot and I would usually bus it in to visit her every weekend. About maybe 25 or 30% of the time she would take the bus to see me. Whenever we would go out, I would pay for everything like 85% of the time. (movies, dinners, museums, drinks, etc) I was understanding cause she didn't make money at the time cause of her intership. I didn't mind.

Year 2, we move in together and she gets a full time job and a part time job where she works Saturdays from 9-12. I still pay the majority of whenever we go out for dates, groceries, movies, etc. She would pay maybe 20% of the time but she did also pay half of our rent and utilities. We would go grocery shopping together, cook together, and do laundry together most of the time which was nice. 
About 8 months into year 2, it declines dramatically. I would end up going food shopping by myself, decide what we're going to make for dinner and lunch, cook, and do all of our laundry. I basically felt like i was taking care of her and I should have brought it up at that point but the holidays were around and I'm dumb. All of these chores were basically 90-95% mine. I sucked it up and figured she was working too much and just continued on...

I eventually brought up the whole cooking, grocery, and $$ issue and she gave me the response i expected about her working too much and not feeling like she has a day off. She's also pretty stressed at her job for a few different reasons. She said she understood and would try to contribute to everything except for the $$ since she was saving up for grad school.

So now... things got better for a couple weeks, then went back down. And now that she's going into grad school, I'm wondering if it will ever get better. She'll be even more stressed with grad school and its a 5 year program. Not to mention we'll both have to move to another state and I'd have to find a job that will pay equal or greater than mine. I have a very specific field of work that isn't common so thats an issue in itself.

I guess my question is, is my relationship unbalanced or am I just not seeing things from a good perspective? Are there things I haven't considered that I should? I plan on talking to my gf about this again but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this and any advice or similar situations/stories/insight would help. I don't really know what to think anymore, because i sometimes have the ""love conquers all obstacles"" mindset. what do I do?

edit - Holyshit didn't realize I wrote so much. Sorry for all this text! 

tl;dr - I feel like i do most of the chores around the house. (cooking, laundry, groceries,etc) and i feel like my relationship is unbalanced. I've talked to her about it and it got better for a bit but declined again. what do i do? am i making too big a deal about nothing?"
30kxc4,2,2015-03-28,Need advice on career,not_too,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/30kxc4/need_advice_on_career/,"Hello!

I’m not sure if this is the right sub to place this question, if there are any other subs that may be able to help with this question I will cross post as well. 
This post may be a bit depressing but please bear with me!

So a bit about myself:
I am an international student that would love to become an IT auditor after taking a few undergraduate courses that deals with the regulations for IT and security.  However due to some of the mess-ups I have made during my freshman and sophomore year, I graduated with a 2.9 GPA overall and a 3.4 major GPA with no intern opportunities.  Luckily I was able to get into the master’s program to learn more security and data related topics.  However, going through the semester I keep on getting a feeling that the masters may not be the right choice for me and should start seeking positions more aggressively than I currently am.  

If I were to drop out of my master’s program, I will be working on getting a CISA certificate which all IT auditors are required to have along with searching for jobs.  

What should I do?

Any type of words is welcome as I fully understand I screwed up so badly during my undergrad years.

Any tips for a high school senior?,MEGAPONY,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/30kxln/what_do_you_know_now_that_you_wish_you_knew_when/,"Hi everyone, I'm a current high school senior who's planning on going to UCSC. 

I don't know the exact path I want to go down yet but I want to find a start up company in the future.

I don't want to be the ""technical"" guy who does all the coding and developing but rather more of a ""hustler"" who has the idea and manages sales, marketing, company management.

However, I still want a technical background because I feel like tech skills are valuable no matter your position.

Therefore, I'm deciding between

Computer Science: http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/cmps.html

Technology &amp; Information Management: http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/tim.html

Which major do you guys think will better suit my career goals?

As for planning ahead, what I'm thinking is to do well in my classes, network network network, get internships, then work at a  VC company upon graduation to gain experience. What do you guys think? Any advice?

Sorry if I seem naive, I currently have zero background in technology so I might be using the wrong terms and whatnot.

Thank you!

I'm the sole developer right now, working on an iPhone app. The second job listed is just me taking care of the web presence of a family business. Should I change any of that to offer more clarity? Or be more brief?

One other question I have is, should I emphasize personal projects more? My personal website and github account contain a few more projects not mentioned in the resume, though I don't have anything super interesting. The best thing I could mention is a small app I have currently on the App Store.

30m127,6,2015-03-28,Help with Financial Analysis of Business?,ThrowAwayStrat,SecurityAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/30m127/help_with_financial_analysis_of_business/,"Hi All,

I have applied for a Corporate and Strategic Analyst entry level role at an international manufacturer. The role is supporting corporate dev, strategic planning and corporate communications.

I’m through to the final stages, and despite having demonstrated an interest in finance and having an internship in an investment bank I thought I made it clear that I didn’t have experience in financial analysis, only in general market research and analysing sales data. 

I’ve had two interviews where I’ve talked about my work exp &amp; uni exp and my modules taken are listed on my CV. During no point were any questions on financial analysis asked and the role is open to grads who have studied Science degrees and it’s been made clear they are looking to provide training – but they’ve given the below task.

**For the final interview they have asked me to prepare a 20 minute presentation on the following:**

1.	One slide - An overview of the business 
2.	Two/Three slides - Assessment of the financial strength of the company compared to two competitors (financial analysis and comparison of the business and market positions) 
3.	One/Two slides - An example of market research or M&amp;A analysis on any subject of my choice.



**I’d like some guidance about how to go about doing it**

For question 3 my thoughts were to use existing market research I had done for a new product development project that I did at Uni, but this was for a retail product. My other thought was doing an M&amp;A analysis on one of the competitors – but as I’ve never done one before this seems like a risky option.


**My plan to tackle part two:**


1.	Identify an existing competitor with similar products and operating in the same region(s) and, a competitor that has products that would add to the company’s portfolio. 
2.	Obtain 2013 balance sheets from their annual reports and then compare using ratios that I find online and look the most appropriate ones to present.
3.	Graph/Chart them up in a way that makes sense.


**Things I’d like guidance and feedback on:**


- My plan
- Which ratios are most important when assessing financial strength – there are ones such as: http://www.aaii.com/journal/article/16-financial-ratios-for-analyzing-a-companys-strengths-and-weaknesses.touch 
- Beyond an annual report balance sheet what data / sources should I use that are available? (At Uni I would’ve had access to many different industry/company reports)
- Any templates or examples of concise presentations which compare finance strength of companies
- Anything else I should know 
- What other questions should I anticipate?
- Do you know of any straightforward financial analysis guides that you can recommend which are useful for comparing companies?
- Which sub/s or other resources can I use to answer these questions myself or get some feedback from?


**I’m anticipating questions on:**

- Why did I choose these competitors to analyse?
- Why I chose certain ratios or tools for analysis
- How and why I’ve presented the information in a certain way

I only received the information 5 PM Friday and the PowerPoint has to be sent by Tuesday. 

I appreciate any help either here or in a PM. I’ll be checking back regularly if you have any questions or if anything isn’t clear please ask away.

I've cross-posted this to Finance Careers, I hope that's okay."

I applied for lots of different internship programs over the last few months, but only got one phone interview, which didn't pan out.

I understand this isn't uncommon as a freshman, but it's still quite discouraging, as I attend a well-known university for CS and I know of many other freshmen who were able to get internships at well-known companies for the summer, with very similar levels of experience as I have. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I just don't want to be put at a disadvantage for further internships in the next few years and for full-time jobs down the line by not having an internship after my freshman year.

I applied to a few local companies recently to see if they're interested in summer interns, but assuming that doesn't pan out, what are your recommendations for productive ways to spend my summer at home? I'll likely try to work on a longer-form personal project, as that's something I feel my resume is lacking, but I wonder if there's a particular skill-set or type of project that would prove useful in my career down the line.

Thanks so much!"

30m8em,1,2015-03-28,Macbook mid 2010 - What to do with it,[deleted],macbook,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/30m8em/macbook_mid_2010_what_to_do_with_it/,"Hi there! I hope this is the correct place to ask. I have a 15'' macbook pro from 2010 (I believe it is the mid 2010). He is well used and abused, since I used to travel with him a lot, take to university, etc. I am graduating as an architect soon, and after having an scholarship that payed for a new notebook, I bought an windows laptop for rendering and using some softwares that didn't existed for mac (and using parallels wasn't the best solution). So I used both of them in a personal network and it was okay for me. Rendered in one, and worked in other as an example.

Right now the mac is a bit dead. I need to change the battery (it doesn't work anymore off the charger), and since I live in Brazil, I'm looking for good prices or waiting for a friend to go to the USA and be able to bring me one. 

But, as I said, he is well used. Scratched, with dents of falling, and the screen part seems to be a bit loose, I don't really know the exact terms, it is not firm anymore and sometimes the screen open and closes by itseld depending on the angle that the laptop is standing. I don't really mind the aesthetics wear of the macbook, but this is annoying.

I have a HD of 500gb and 8gb of RAM, it seems that this is the maximum that this macbook supports of memory, not really su re.

So, here it is. I love this macbook, and it is much better to travel with it than my 4,5kg monster windows laptop. I don't have money right now to buy a new macbook, I'm graduating, my internship pays me... let's see, 180 dollars when I convert brazilian reais to dollars, and all my money is going to my graduation trip in october. 

But I can use some money to fix this macbook. First buy a new battery, and later buy a more RAM, etc, and fix this aesthetics and the screen part problem. Do you guys think it is worth doing this, or leaving the macbook be, and waiting to buy a new one? (probably next year). 

Where can I find guides so I can repair this issues with the screen and the others? 

And extra. I never had any problem with this baby that needed to go somewhere to be repaired. I believe he is in great conditions, I just need to format since he is full of useless stuff right now. 

Sorry about writing too much! "

(I already have an internship in Portland which will hopefully end with a job offer, so I think it's a pretty solid plan... I will likely be working downtown.)

""I want to rent an apartment in a fun neighborhood. I will be working downtown or going to school at Portland State, want good public transit options, but want to live near coffee shops and cafes."" 

They say ""A dozen neighborhoods would work."" ... ""On the east side of the river, you could live in Hawthorne District in SE, in Irvington or Alberta in NE and still live in a nice but slightly less expensive area than NW or Downtown. And all of these areas have plenty of shops and cafes you might desire. "" 

I'm living in Oregon, and visit Portland sometimes. Yes, I'm aware of Alberta and Hawthorne. So is everyone else. There is very little for rent in those areas (even compared to the rest of Portland). 

What are some of the other ""dozen"" neighborhoods that fit that bill? I don't need to live in the most super happening trendy neighborhood ever, but I'd like to get the Portland experience, if I'm paying the Portland rent... 

Some of the neighborhoods that I know about that seem like they fit the bill: 

-Mississippi 

-St. John's  

-Sellwood 

-... there are surely more. 

Does anyone have a good resource for these kinds of neighborhoods with local businesses and activity? Does anybody have a list of cute, fun neighborhoods they can list of the top of their head? 

I'd really appreciate the help!

I have an interview coming up in a few weeks with a local systems integrator which is basically my dream job. I have a high GPA, leadership experience, co-op &amp; internship, but want to stand apart from the competition with an actual PLC related side project. 

I am just finishing up a side project that is basically balancing a metal ball on a plane. The plane is a resistive touch screen which measures the position of the ball, feeds the position error to an Arduino which does the PID calcultions, and sends signals to motors which manipulate the angle of the touch screen to keep the ball centered. 

This has been a great project and I've learned a lot, but I also want some experience with PLCs since that is what is used in industry. Any tips on how/where I can get a cheap PLC + software combo would be great. Also any ideas for a good beginner PLC project would be awesome as well. I was thinking about trying to replace the Arduino in my current project with a PLC to do the controls logic. Does this seem doable?

Any thoughts/tips are greatly appreciated!"

30nq1j,1,2015-03-28,From high school to college: Identity Issues,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30nq1j/from_high_school_to_college_identity_issues/,"I've never really evaluated my personality or gave a shit about it until I came to college. In high school, I had a good group of friends that I was close too but I didn't hang out with 24/7, but occasionally did. I was more focused on success and my future, and I was the biggest over-achiever. I flew to conferences, became a serial-entrepreneur, got into internships, and held leadership positions. However, I had constant existential crises just because I never real enjoyed life that much and I didn't get into a whole lot of crazy adventures daily with friends. The friends I had were great and everything but we hung out only once or twice a month outside of school. I never had any drama concerning friends or relationships (except for a few flings). However, I had existential crises on the daily and I kept feeling lonely/lost because I never had a solid, core group of friends that we're like a second family that I would get into crazy adventures and could also just chill with. I was also way too competitive. That was why I was looking forward to college

...and so now I'm a state school kid. I was never really in the ethnic crowd in high school since I wasn't cultural at all and my culture is pretty conservative/judgemental on a lot of issues (but its great on other issues!). However, all my friends are all from my same ethnicity which really shouldn't even be an issue but theres an underlying assumption that Indians are filled with drama (and this is coming from a full-blooded Indian). Their all into Indian singing, dance, music, and their all on the Indian dance team and the ones who aren't are still super into it. They place indian music on the daily and they only want to go to Indian parties. There's also a lot of drama just because the Indian crowd here is small but everyone knows each other and there's just drama. And it might sound so stupid, but I feel like this cultural disconnect stems a lot of why I don't immediately feel super duper close to them. Like we're close and we hang out all the time and party all the time, but theres always a part of me that wishes for better.

One of my best friends (who Im not even sure I can say is so right now) is still best friends with people that have been terrible to me and another one of my best friends who shes best friends with and she's also even friend's with one guy who sexually assaulted me. Im not perfect at all and I've done bad stuff like yelling at her while I've been drunk a few times (4 this whole year) about shit she did too me. 

 Meanwhile, I joined a bunch of other clubs. I even joined a sorority and thought that was my crowd and although it kinda is, their a bit too preppy for me. Like I feel like I don't belong sometimes and I haven't best bff's with my big since she's more friends with my twin in my sorority. Unlike high school, my grades are stellar (in high school I only made As and Bs) and I'm super involved in just school. But lately, I've been focusing more on doing stuff outside of school and I've started to get more competitive again, which I kinda missed.

Now heres the huge plot twist: I came into this school knowing that I  had a conditional acceptance to another school. The school is a top-10 national, amazing school thats stellar for the program I want. It's also more me. Its also the chance to start anew. My current school is southern and conservative and I'm the exact opposite Plus, the other school has a large gay scene and thats something I really want after rediscovering my sexuality in college. 

Having this condition, I went into this school knowing that I would probably be leaving but I still wanted to make the most of it in case I decided to stay. I too my friends gradually but they knew I was on the fence about it too. Also, the school is expensive and I'm a triplet but my parents also have a fairly high income (enough that we don't get financial aid) and I've saved up over  10k myself and will hopefully be working over the summer as well. 

My issue is that I still have a month and a half till school ends and I feel lonely and depressed. I don't know who I am in life or what I even what. I don't only wanna care about success and ambition but I don't wanna just party 24/7 and get sucked into constant drama and have to debate whether I have all my friends or not. I also want to have a diversity of friends. And although I kinda do care about being popular and about my rep (which is not something I should care about but its partly why I joined a sorority) I think I just really want friends that aren't super nerdy (because my current friends kinda are. Like I love some nerdy stuff like ATLA but I'm not into pokemon or LOTR. Its never really interested me). 

I also have this constant fear that my conditional acceptance isn't going to work out, even though I fulfilled my reqs and even went above and beyond with my gpa and ECs.

TLDR I don't know who I am as a person even though I thought I would in college. A lot of shit went down in college, and I have the chance to start anew at another university thats more like me but I still have a couple of weeks here and I still don't know who I am. "

A few months ago I applied to 7 different grad programs in physics and 3 in math, and so far I got into the Math PhD program at UC Davis and am still waiting on a few decisions from physics places. I was rejected by everywhere else.


Now, I think I'd be very happy as a grad student at Davis. The location is fantastic, the research their professors are doing interests me, I would be well-funded, and the courses contain stuff that I really want to learn. But the thing is, I'm a little worried about it's ranking (Tied for #34 nationwide according to US News, somewhere between 50-150 worldwide on most other rankings). It's not that I personally care about what some organization ranks a school, but I'm afraid that most of my potential employers do. My primary objective if I got a PhD would be to become a lecturer/professor, and I feel like it's much harder to get your foot in the door in academia if you got your doctorate from a top 25-50 program than if you are coming from a top 10 one (Any of you agree?).  I'm just not sure if I would have the job prospects I wanted after I finished.


I've been musing over waiting to re-apply next fall or spring. The consensus I've heard about taking a year or two off to start grad school is that doing so is extremely beneficial. I feel like if I could do a paid internship in math or physics and retake the subject GRE that I could really improve my chances at higher-ranked programs. I'm not sure if it's common to use an internship as a stepping stone for grad school, but it might work. Or I could just matriculate on Davis right now. What do people on here, especially ones who took time off before grad school, think?


A related question: how hard is it for recent grads to find a (preferably) one-year internship in math, applied math, or physics anyway? Right now I have a 3.92 GPA, have taken graduate courses in topology and in high energy physics, completed an REU where I did a computational project in nuclear physics, and am finishing a senior thesis about cosmologies in general relativity. Think I could find something somewhere if I looked around at this point?


Okay, long post, but I have alot on my mind right now.  "
30o5ga,7,2015-03-29,"Absolutely wasted 4 years of college, my life is empty. I'm not continuing.",kareemrush21,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/30o5ga/absolutely_wasted_4_years_of_college_my_life_is/,"This might be a long post but here it goes.

So a little background: my parents are FOB immigrants who knew nothing about American culture. Because of this, they sheltered me for my entire life. This has negatively effected me. They would never let me hang out with friends because they said I can see them at school. Eventually, I got used to not going out. That was grade-middle school. Now we fast forward to high school and my classmates really started drinking and partying with girls. Once again, my parents would never let me go out. I was never comfortable with talking to girls or with drinking alcohol. I didn't go to my prom because I was so indoctrinated with not going out. I became comfortable being with myself to a fault. Add this to my parents not letting me play sports because they felt education was the most important thing so I never gained confidence in myself.

Now let's talk about college. I did not even want to go. The only school I got accepted to was a notorious party school. I really did not want to go but my parents basically forced me. I was content with working construction but my naive FOB parents didn't understand that school isn't a guarantee to anything. So I'm embarrassed to say this but I cried before packing. I was not comfortable with alcohol, girls, and I was also made fun of because of how I looked and I was tremendously insecure about it. I wasn't bullied, but I got clowned on a lot because people said I looked like a certain celebrity and they didn't mean it as a compliment. 

First day of school I already feel incredibly sad. Most freshman go through this but it was such a bad feeling in my stomach. My roomate asked me to go out and watch some sort of bonfire thing but I didn't want to. I wanted to cry when I went to bed. I know you guys are probably gonna think I'm whiny, maybe. But I am not a cryer, not at all. It takes A LOT for me to cry. I'm just trying to let you get a sense of the distress I was feeling. 

I thought maybe I could reinvent myself in college. For the first couple of days I felt alright because I hung out with some friends from high school. However, I noticed that they would never text me with plans. I thought maybe they weren't doing anything until I saw them on facebook taking pictures together having fun hanging with girls. Maybe I just oozed lameness even though I tried to mask it. I wanted my best friend to come to school with me. I'm sure things would have been different because he was my right hand man. While walking to class I heard a girl make fun of me the same way I used to get made fun of in high school. That was it. Nothing has changed. First I was lonely, now I'd have to withstand ridicule and accept the fact that girls wouldn't want to be with ""that guy who looks like ______"". Since then I went to class then went back to my room. My roomate would ask me if I wanted to go out and drank, but I always said no...pathetic.

My grades suffered and I almost failed out my first semester. Eventually I turned things around academically. My grades are the only good thing I accomplished in college. These 4 years I've probably gone out to party 4 times. Every time something negative has happened that further crushed my confidence. My computer was the only safe haven I had. I never got out of my comfort zone and I'm dying for it.

Graduation is coming up and I cannot stop thinking about how I've done absolutely nothing these 4 years. I've made maybe 10 friends in total and I only talk to 2 of them regularly. I have no real memories. I didn't have any confidence in myself to join any clubs, frats, sports teams, nothing. Even when once in a blue moon a girl *gasp* WAS attracted to me, I didn't pursue because I had no experience and was a scared punk. I didn't even get any internships which will make my degree useless because all jobs require experience now. No such thing as entry level. I'm 21 now and I've wasted my youth basically. You're gonna say ""you're still young!"" blah blah blah but I really wasted everything. I have nothing to look forward to. I'm sure my family will be better off without me. My brother and sister will be successful while I'm stuck being the black sheep. I'm not having that. I'd rather die.

Thanks for reading.

I began by being self-taught, but I have since taken a number of courses that have taught me the finer points of programming. My focus in college is Computer Engineering right now, and I'm about a year from graduating, since I spent a year on co-op with a large software/hardware company. I would love to get an internship or co-op in the Seattle area if at all possible, largely due to the concentration of businesses in the area that I find to be awesome, and what I've seen of the city makes it seem like a nice place.

When I say that I am a self-taught programmer, I don't just mean that I learned how to write ""Hello, world!"" in a few different languages. Once I began teaching myself programming, it consumed almost all of my free time for years afterwards, as I quickly discovered that I had a natural aptitude for it. I wrote a small IDE for JASS (the Warcraft III scripting language) over the course of about a week, a few months after I began programming. That IDE had syntax highlighting, a properties box like Visual Studio uses when you click on a GUI element which allowed you to modify properties of the code you were editing (like setting a function private or public), which involved the IDE having to understand the code it was seeing (to populate the box) and the IDE being able to edit the code on its own when items in the box changed. Even more interesting, it had a transpiler that took JASS and converted it into compliant C# and ran it through the C# compiler. That was nearly 10 years ago now; it feels so long ago.

Last night, I wrote a WS2812 smart RGB LED driver for an STM32 Nucleo that I had laying around over the course of about 3 hours, since all of the existing drivers I could find weren't very attractive options and I wanted to learn more about it. (Being able to succeed in so little time relied heavily on the Saleae digital logic analyzer that I have laying around; WS2812 has an almost annoyingly timing specific protocol.)

I have written apps for iOS and Android, desktop applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux, lots of command line tools for Linux, and I've even written and debugged Linux kernel modules before. I've made websites with PHP and Node.js backends, while hand-crafting the HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. I've written embedded code for several different microcontrollers, ported existing code from Arduino to NXP's LPC812 MCU, used peripherals, but most importantly for embedded development, I've learned to skim 1000+ page reference manuals for microcontrollers and other pieces of hardware, and to be able to execute on that knowledge. I've even done ladder logic on Allen-Bradley PLCs. I've used dozens of programming languages for these tasks and I'm constantly on the look out for new stuff. I can't wait until Rust hits 1.0 final, which shouldn't be long at all now.

I know it's perhaps a bit late to be looking for an internship (though perhaps not for a co-op), but please PM me if you have something. As long as I can stream Pandora to my headphones in an isolated place to write code, I believe I can write quality code to meet your needs, although I did spend a couple months of my co-op largely doing pair programming, and that was both pleasant and productive.

What would it take for me to get a job in Seattle this summer writing code?"

I currently am suspended from my university for reasons related to depression. Getting suspended from school made my loans and grants taken away, which led me in to more than $2000 in debt. I also have about $1000 debt in my credit card. I had been working for a while at a restaurant to pay off my debt, but seeing people daily was too overwhelming for me. I ended up breaking down a week ago and quitting the job. 

I am just so lost right now.. 

I feel like I should get a job, because I have so much debt and it's stressing me out... But then again, having a job seems to make my depression worse so I'm not sure what to do..

I feel like I should focus on getting an internship for the summer, because not having any summer plans for the summer is making me very anxious and causing me to break down frequently.. But then again, whenever I try to apply for positions I ended up breaking down..

There is a part of my deep inside where I just want to travel, get away from everyone and focus on myself for awhile.. But then again, I am already in so much debt without income..

And whenever I have all these thoughts I start to think ""maybe this isn't the depression.. maybe this is just me being lazy.. maybe I'm just a lazy piece of crap..."" which leads into me feeling terrible...

It's just a vicious cycle.. I am not sure what to do.. I feel so lost.. Anybody have felt similarly or went through a similar phase before?

30odr1,5,2015-03-29,I'm not doing so great right now. Can I still manage to eventually find a job or internship? Or have a part-time internship during the semester?,floatingplasticbag,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30odr1/im_not_doing_so_great_right_now_can_i_still/,"I mean, if I go by all of the other posts with low GPA job seekers it doesn't look like I'll *never* find a programming job, but I'm still worried if I'm capable. Part of my issue is lack of perspective and too high of a standard for myself.

Sometime last year I finally came to terms with the fact that, yes, I have clinical depression, and, yes, I need to get it treated and manageable asap so I can be a productive member of society. My denial and irresponsible choices lead me here today with a 2.47 GPA and a horrible transcript. I'm basically a senior, but I really don't think I should focus on doing 12-15 hours of classes every semester while trying to treat the issues that get exasperated just by being in school, so I'm planning on going part-time until I graduate. That'll probably take me another a year and a half. What sucks is the fact that I basically started school about 6 years ago (during which I briefly changed majors, medically withdrew twice, and took a semester off to work at a fast food place), so that's a little demoralizing. It'll give me much more time to manage my depression, though.

ANYWAY, I was wondering how likely it is to get a part-time internship during the semester? I don't have any personal projects right now, but I've been going through coding exercises in java as a referesher since lately I've been using C in my classes. I was thinking about making a website to use it as a portfolio for my artwork (my number one hobby and spending money creator, so it'll actually be useful), but is that a decent personal project? I don't really want to go into web dev though. I'm just kind of neutral. I was going to use this summer to solely work on my coding skills, but after seeing somewhere that it isn't too late to apply to internships I'm just going to throw my resume everywhere and hope for the best. Might as well? Unsurprisingly, I'm really unconfident right now. I was going to apply to retail positions, and then I thought that might be a waste of time when I could do tech-related stuff.

For more info, I'm at a top 10 school and live in a tech city. I'm bound to get hired if I keep trying, right? Maybe?

tl;dr: I have a crappy GPA and I'm going to school part-time until I graduate in order to wrangle in my health issues. Is it feasable find a part-time internship, or should I use the extra time for other things? Or both?"
30og8r,72,2015-03-29,TIFU by increasing factory tension between workers and management.,A_Cave_Man,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/30og8r/tifu_by_increasing_factory_tension_between/,"I am working as an engineering intern for a large skid-steer company.  The factory I work in is actually split into 2 section, the main factory contains all welding, painting and assembly.  The other half of our factory is called 'The Farm' and it is legitimetly a farm.  The farmer originally designed a new skid-steer attachment and started producing them in his barn, this kept growing and growing until he had a sizeable company going on.  Anywho, the farm is a very haphazardly assembled area, where the operators have very little contact with the engineering/management department.

They also carry a strong resentment for engineers.  When our company purchased the attachment company, the first thing they did was to automate nearly all of the cutting steps, removing a lot of the farms positions.  They also updated a good portion of the SOP's to improve throughput, with little if any buy in from the operators.

Fast forward to inventory day, everyone from the plant manager down to the paint operator helps out with inventory.  I check the list to see what section I'm in, and to my terror, I spot my name on the farm list.  My stomache drops as I realize I'm going to be overseeing the back-country, dip chewing, 5-tooth having, farm boys.  This is going to go over just dandy, with my short stature, pearly white teeth, and clean-shaven baby face.

I arrive at the farm piloting one of the companies ridiculous F-250's with the extra extra long box on it.  I hop out semi-gracefully falling/landing in the deep mud that serves as the substrate for 'The Farm'.  I can feel every eye around my glaring at me, I look up and verify this feeling with the exception of the very friendly ex-meth addict gal who has previously decided we are great friends.

Things are actually going quite well as I do my best to be relateable to the farm employees. I'm busting my ass to identify parts that were lying around, entering part counts, and clambering around the extensive racking of parts.  Finally, I can hold in my piss no more, Methy (who hasn't stopped talking or left my side) kindly points me to the gentleman's facilities.

I walk in expecting the typical restroom, but instead I find a room befitting the next SAW movie.  I stumble across the bumpy dirt floor as my eyes slowly adjust to the poorly lit room.  I first make out a large round trough in the center of the room.  Surely there has to be more in here. My eyes follow the grizzled and graffiti'd wall until they spot a few dilapitated sinks accompanied by the hand dryers where the cloth just spins around in circles.  The cloth on these is nearly as dirty and dark as the muddy floor beneath them.  I guess I'll just skip the hand washing.  There is also a few stalls in this room, but they're about on par with the rest of the room.  The type of stall you'd expect to find at a rundown Tijuanan biker's bar after a week-long chilli cook off.  

Luckily the room is empty barring myself.  I whip out my little smokey, and begin making my deposit.  Pushing with every muscle near my bladder in hopes of finishing this process before some grizzled shop worker joins me, making eye contact would be nearly impossible due to the circular configuration of the urinal.  Door #2 opens, and in walks heavily bearded, beer bellied Farmer Brown.  He looks at me, shakes his head, and mumbles something under his breath.  

""Fucking Engineers"" yup, Farmer Brown is a fan of me.  I quickly finish and decide to exit through the 2nd door mostly out of curiuosity as to where in this maze this door leads to.  I swing open the massive door as it groans like a blue whale in heat.  To my puzzlement, I am not back in the factory, instead I'm in another bathroom, this one has a cement floors and a wall lined with urinals.  This is when the realization slaps me like a 16"" dildo to the face.... I just urinated in the factory guy's hand washing sink.

**TL;DR:** 
* **1) Senior Undergrad (me) at University of Y experiences violent death of close friend that was planning to attend the same grad schools if accepted.** 
* **2) I have to make a hasty decision about where to go for grad school, traumatized and depressed, turned down University of Y offer, goes with University of X (unfunded) because I didn't want to be at the same university where my friend died or where we were planning to go together.**
* **3)Rough transition to University of X. Forced to drop a class, had to TA a class I never took (but tuition paid for semester), no time in lab to practice/observe. PI is not the greatest with communication. Onset of deeper levels of depression. Living is comfortable/secure, but really expensive.**
* **4)2nd semester: Seeing counselor for mental health, more depression. Feel like I'm getting nowhere with research. PI informs me that I won't graduate within 2 years (didn't get objectives until now). Research seems borderline PhD (I'm an MS student).**
* **5) I want to transfer/apply for grad school at my Alma Mater because I have a support system there. Parents not that supportive of this idea. **
* **6) Opinions needed; how does a transfer look to industry? Are these circumstances reasonable for considering transfer? Not planning on PhD, just MS. **

Looking for opinions to see if the norm of grad school mental misery is unique in my case....

* As a senior undergrad last year at University of Y (2014), I was in the process of applying to different grad schools. My intention was to follow a close friend of mine to whichever school we were both accepted to. However, my close friend was killed in a senseless act of violence, and this completely fucked up (excuse my french) my decision-making process. I had to make my decision about grad school within 2 - 3 months after the tragedy, and I simply wanted to get away from the universities that my friend and I both applied to that reminded me of the tragedy. I was left with University of X, with no funding for research, but outlets to release stress, my sibling attends there for undergrad, and it's an easier drive home. I made a hasty decision, clouded by depression and trauma.

* 1st semester at University of X: Even with the stress outlet that I enjoy so much, I had a very rough transition. I was forced to drop a course due to irrelevancy and difficulty, I had to TA an undergrad course that I had never taken (equivalent at Alma Mater, but still had to do the labs each week before teaching them), and I couldn't find alot of time to get into the lab. I live in a nice place, but it is super expensive for quality and secure living in this area. Also during this first semester, another traumatic event occurs related to the tragedy experienced during my senior year, and I'm plunged into another level of depression. One upside: obtained a summer internship in industry with a very well known company.

* 2nd semester: Able to get into the lab, excited about potential areas of research, but have a full load of time-consuming courses. Memorial of my close friend's death occurs starting the 2nd semester, another level of depression again. I learn that my PI doesn't have a good sense of time, and have no idea what my research will be. Shame on me for going in unfunded - there's no grant to push me/PI along on a timeline. I did professionally address the trauma I've been through, and my PI is very understanding of it. They are nice, but they are also going on sabbatical for a year starting next year. I get to meet with them on Fridays during sabbatical, and I'm not super dependent on them anyway, but I am still hesitant about how things will work.

* Self-help: Seeing a counselor for depression, but limited on visits (this is different than my Alma Mater, where I could have weekly appointments). I have tried to reach out to those in my stress relief involvement, but it's hard when I don't have much time to get to know them. The people in my lab are nice, I'm starting to get to know them better, but I don't do anything outside of the lab for fun because I don't have time (and neither do they). I refuse to go on psychological medication, since this influenced/led to the death of my close friend. 

*Re-occurring thought: I want to go back to my Alma Mater for graduate school. 
My support system is there, not only friends, but also my religious life support system. Campus is smaller, living is less expensive, and I know the faculty well in the department. Research/funding would be guaranteed, since students are not accepted unless funding is available (assuming I would be accepted). Some credits may transfer, obviously would have to start over on research.

* Opinions wanted: Are these signs that I should transfer for the sake of my mental health as well as my piggy bank? How does transferring look on paper? I plan to go into industry right after my MS. and I don't know how a transfer would look to professionals in industry. I try to keep personal and professional life separate, but they are collapsing on each other with negative effects. Honest opinions, please! No sugar-coating. Thank you!

I am a second year Computer Science student currently looked for an internship for my third year of study. 

I received an email a few days ago stating that I had been shortlisted for a paid position interview in my own university's IT sector, none of my friends on my course that applied for the position have had a response yet so I'm feeling optimistic.

However,  the email noted that I should prepare at least one question to ask the interviewer at the end of the interview, the question should be about how I can benefit the university instead of how they can help me. 

I feel like I meet all their essential factors and a good few of their desirable factors listed on the job description -- but I'm really racking my brain over what to ask them, I can't think of anything! Any suggestions? 

Thanks in advance."

As the title says, I'm trying to enter the industry and get my get wet. I'm interested in anything medical related to programming/software development to cooking. If I could find something encompassing those three, even better. Hahaha. I don't have internship experience under my belt but I have done done lab work and many team projects. And, I'm always willing to learn new subjects to challenge myself and grow.

Here are some of the projects I've  done through my currriculum:

* HIV Detection Platform for Low Resource Deployment  (Currently working)
* Electroencephalography (EEG) Lab
* Coffee Spill Burn Injury Simulation in Matlab
* Arduino-LabView Based Pulse Oximeter Prototype
* Laser Focusing Algorithm in LabView 
* Programmed a spatial sensor with C and Matlab to measure subject's head respose
* Water purification through UV Radiation

* In addition, I've taken introductory courses in programming for python, C/C++, and java.

Forgive me in advance if you guys find this annoying or selfish. I'm just getting a bit antsy and anxious about post-grad life in three months. I've been applying to the openings I found online and thought I give reddit a try as well. When I look at those job qualifications, most of the time I feel inadequate. Does anyone relate?

 If you guys have any idea of openings, start ups, and internships. I would very much appreciate to lmk. 

Thanks for reading my post. "

So I'm 20 and I'll graduate from my bachelor's degree in software development in France in a few months (late june).  It's some kind of sandwich degree where I got to work for 5 weeks and then go back to school for 3 weeks, and on again.

I've wanted to go work in the USA for a long time now (I've had an internship in Canada last year and went to the USA some time, loved it), but I don't know exactly how to reach to the companies there, and what to say to make them want to hire me rather than any american person with a bachelor's degree.

I don't know if it works any differently than France on the recruitement or anything, if any of you guys happens to know, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

If you need any extra information I'd be glad to answer!

Thanks a lot for your help!"
30ouu0,1,2015-03-29,Physics undergrad in UK to Computer Science Masters in US,randomnessisthebest,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/30ouu0/physics_undergrad_in_uk_to_computer_science/,"I'm in my final year of a three year BSc in physics from Imperial College and I'm really keen to study computer science, computer engineering, any kind of tech subject really, in the US. This year I already tried applying to four schools: Georgia tech, Cornell, Brown and UCSD, all for subjects of this type. However I got turned down from Brown and haven't heard anything from the others, and it's been over 2 months since I applied.

I believe it's unlikely I'll get offers from any of them. Whilst my grades are OK, (average 68, so GPA of ~3.6) I have very little knowledge of computer science and little programming experience because of my physics background. I have used python and am familiar with object oriented programming but that's about it. The only internship I've done was in physics research with little technical exposure. The academics I go to for references are physicists and only know about my ability concerned with physics.

I'd like to try applying again, this time to more schools. But how can I make my application more convincing with so little experience in computer science? (Honestly I'm really more interested in computational methods within science and engineering, but find it hard to find courses like this). I want to get a 6 month or year long internship in this field to make me more convincing, but again landing an internship like this is hard for a physics student.

Sorry this is so long. I'd really appreciate any advice, no professor I know is really familiar with this and I feel like there isn't much guidance out there. I think I made a mistake applying to courses I clearly didn't have a chance with and I really don't want to make that mistake again. Please help!"

Right now I'm leaning toward NC State for a couple reasons, the main ones being that I may want to minor in ECE and I like that there's a school of engineering. 

1. How's the program? Is it rigorous? Do you learn a lot from the classes? Is it a mix of theory and application, or mostly theory? 

2. How are the research opportunities? I'm interested in natural language processing.

3. What's the ""culture"" like? Is it full of passionate students who work on their own projects in their spare time? 

4. How is it getting internships? Jobs? Has the university's ""rank"" hindered you at all? I see UNC is ranked higher, but I've visited both departments and it seems NCSU has more opportunity/industry connections. 

5. Is it difficult to major in CS and minor in ECE? 

Apologies for all the questions. Any information you can give me will be helpful. 

Edit: Apparently there's not an option to minor in ECE, so instead, how much overlap is there in courses? I don't want to double major but I am interested in learning some of the subject. "

If you meet all of the criteria that I request in this post, then there should be no reason why I don't respond to you.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a bit to see what I get. Thank you!"

30pof5,4,2015-03-29,"Me [22F] with my best friend [22F] of 8 years, her boyfriend [22M] flashed her mother[46F] and she still wants him back.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30pof5/me_22f_with_my_best_friend_22f_of_8_years_her/,"My best friend [22F] has been going through a rough time lately. Her father [50M] is going through chemotherapy, and her mother [46F] is taking it extremely poorly (ie. breaking down and etc). She finds it too painful to sleep alone in the bedroom she shared with her husband  ever since he was admitted to the hospital and sleeps in the living room. 


Meanwhile, her boyfriend has been interning in a media firm for the last 2 months and has been telling my best friend some very dodgy things about his internship, like how he has to work from 9AM-3AM on some weekdays, and how he also has to work on the weekends. This sounds like complete bullshit to me and I have raised it up to her, but she completely brushes me aside. 


The boyfriend stays in my best friends' house and has been staying there for the last 2 years. They have been in a relationship for 3 years. 


Despite it all, he has been constantly complaining to my best friend about how tough his internship is, breaking down and crying, telling her he can't do it, all that drama while my friend has to deal with taking her father to the hospital for his chemotherapy sessions. Because of his purportedly long internship hours, he has barely visited her father in the last 4 months since her father's cancer relapse.


4 days ago, she told me her boyfriend came home at 3AM after work. She said he was dazed and seemed ""out-of-it"". He went to take a shower and wrapped a towel around his torso. While he was changing, she woke up from the noise and he told her he would be going downstairs to get a glass of water.


He didn't change into more appropriate clothes despite knowing her mother sleeps in the living room. After getting a glass of water, he sat down on the couch, a few feet away from her mother. The noise woke her mother up and she asked him if her daughter accidentally locked him out of the room or something since it must be weird for him to be sitting there at 4AM. 


Instead of responding like a normal human being, he lifted his towel and showed her mother his cock. Her mother immediately went upstairs and talked to my best friend about this, and told her father in the hospital about it despite him being weakened from chemotherapy. 


He is now banned from the house. 


His way of dealing with it was breaking down and crying, telling my friend things like he doesn't remember how it happened, his mind drew to a blank, and that he wanted to break up because he didn't deserve her after all that he has done. Eventually this led to my best friend telling her boyfriend that she will give him space to ""find himself"" before they continue their relationship.


Nothing about this seems right to me reddit :( I've tried talking to her about it but she is extremely defensive of her boyfriend. Is there anything at all that I can do? 


**tl;dr:** My best friend's boyfriend flashed her mother while her father is going through chemotherapy and she somehow thinks it is still a good idea to date this guy. "

30q2j9,8,2015-03-29,SO [23/F] and I [23/M] work in different cities and can't agree on place to live.,capeofhorn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30q2j9/so_23f_and_i_23m_work_in_different_cities_and/,"My girlfriend [23f] and I [23m] have dated for two and a half years and want to live together. We’re struggling to agree where to live, and the ensuing fighting has left us in a nasty stalemate. 

**Background:**

Our hometowns are 20 to 25 minutes apart. She lives in county A, and I live in county B. After graduation, she got a job in a city almost an hour away in county C. She did the commute from county A to county C for a few months and eventually moved in with a coworker to be closer to the job. Meanwhile, I stayed at my parents’ place and did an internship that had me driving all over county B. The distance wasn’t bad, and we often saw each other when she visited her parents. Eventually, she moved out of her coworker’s apartment. The roommate wasn’t bad, but my girlfriend wasn’t happy and moved back in with her parents, returning to the 45 minutes to an hour commute.

In January, I scored an opportunity for an internship with a high probability to turn into a dream job in county D. My girlfriend and I talked about it, and we agreed to find a place between her work in county C and my work in county D if the job happened. 

During my internship, I’ve made a bunch of new friends and fell in love with the city I worked in. My girlfriend, on the other hand, didn’t hang out with many people at home because she lived with her parents. She’s social but is usually exhausted from work to go out and is content hanging with her parents or me. She has a lot of friends in our old college town four hours away.

**Here’s where things get iffy:**

I recently received an offer to stay at the company. However, my girlfriend recently told me she wanted to find a place close to her work. She’s up for a promotion, which gives her the power to set her own schedule, and wants to work 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. This means she’ll drive in rush hour traffic. At my company in county D, I can go in a little later. However, metropolitan areas of counties C and D are notorious for horrendous traffic, so my commute wouldn’t be that great. 

The city my girlfriend picked had her less than 15 miles (20 to 25 minutes in rush hour) from her work and more than 35 miles (40 minutes to an hour, depending on the traffic) from mine. I understands she wants to be close, especially after doing the long commute, but I didn’t think it was fair one had to drive further than the other. I suggested we find a place in Middle City. The location gives us a nearly equal commute time and distances are nearly even. 

She didn’t like it. One point she brought up is she would need to take toll roads to get to work and preferred to take the freeway. She also said Middle City was too far for her and would rather live as close to her work as possible. I disagreed, and so began what has become a weeklong fight about where we want to live. 

During one conversation, she said she felt disappointed that I wasn't trying hard enough to be with her. This infuriated me. I was already willing to move away from county D to live with her in county C, yet, to her, that wasn’t enough. I told her I also had friends in county D from work and didn’t want to be nearly an hour away from them. She shot that down and told me I should stay in county D because it seemed I would happier in county D. That's not the case. I was also concerned about the future of our relationship because we have been in previous fights about this topic, and I’ve been under the impression that if we didn’t move in together, we wouldn’t be together anymore. I brought this up, and she got upset, saying I was suggesting we should break up when that wasn’t my intention. I was only wondering if she thought our relationship would be strained if we had to continue living separately. 

I recently asked a realtor for help. My thinking is my girlfriend might be more swayed on the realtor’s picks than mine because I don’t think she trusts my judgment. I waiting to hear back with some listings. 

My girlfriend has a type A attitude (my way or the highway). I’ve succumbed to things in the past, but I knew I had to stand up for this one, even if it has led us to an uncomfortable fight and us not talking for a couple days. I’ve offered what I and multiple people believe to be a fair compromise: find a place between our work. She’s concerned about traffic, but I’ve told her she wouldn’t be the only one dealing with it. I think she's not use to dealing with so much resistance from me and is upset she can't get her way this time. Regardless, she's a wonderful person, and I love her.

Am I in the wrong here? 

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I got jobs in separate cities, and we want to live together. I suggested a compromise with finding a place halfway. She won’t agree and prefers we live closer (far for me) to her work.  

**UPDATE:** Thanks, everyone, for your comments. Unfortunately, we broke up. I'm fine and need time to heal. She was a wonderful woman, and I hate how this ended. PM me if you like to chat or send some advice about the next step. I'm looking for my own place now in the city and hoping to start my new life here."

I love her. I do. I'm going to see her tonight, and we'll probably have a good time. It's just... things have been stale. They have been stale for a long time. I've been thinking about breaking up with her for probably the last 4 months and have flip-flopped a million times. 

We occasionally talk about it, but only shortly. Only to say things like ""We should do more fun things."" I know that. We should, but you know sometimes I do like the comfort of my life. 

Our talks have gotten stale -- our futures do not match. I'm a Junior business student... expecting to graduate early in December. I have an internship this summer and expect to be in the working force by next year. We currently go to school in PA, but I want to go somewhere else after college... I would really love to go to California. That's where my brother lives. 

She is a sophomore pre-med student. She is really smart... and everything is about school for her now... and will be for years to come. She has to worry about school and tests and assignments so much more than me! And I totally understand that. She studies about 500x more than me and it's totally understandable in her area. She got pre-accepted to a medical school coming into undergrad and has to maintain a high GPA, so school stresses her sooo much more than me. 

It seems a lot of our conversations is me trying to calm her about school. I totally understand she's stressed and all... but I cannot really empathize. I've never really been in that situation. I try to help her as much I could. Last semester was the same. I've been thinking ""Look, if school is so important (as it should be!) then maybe you shouldn't have a BF because it takes up your time!"" She's also more busy than I am. I do a good amount of things on campus... she does everything on campus. Volunteering, sorority, student tours. She's always busy. We don't get a ton of time together.

But I've also thought... ""I don't want to break up with her because it'll create even more stress for her!"" 

I do love her. I do care about her. I don't know if I am in love with her. Last night we went out and had fun and didn't always talk about school and work and whatnot and we were with mutual friends and it was great! 

We didn't have sex afterwards though. Our sex life is very very poor. I really don't think it's one-sided either. It's just like whenever either of us spend the night with each other we just both cuddle and go to sleep. Maybe some kissing and whatnot. 

We've only had sex twice this month. And both times were mediocre at best. 

But. She's a great person. She cares about people. She has a great sense of humor. I don't want to hurt her. 

This other girl lives on the same street as me. She knows my girlfriend as well, they are acquaintances. It started out innocent. Her house (full of girls) would come over and hang out at our house because she is a good friend of one of my roommates. We would get drunk, play drinking games, w/e. Then they would go home. 

Nothing would happen. 

One time I invited her over. We watched a shitty movie with our house. I was sitting next to her. I put my hand down in between us. She did the same. We were touching hands underneath the pillow and that happened the whole night. 

Since then it's gotten worse. I've never ""crossed the line"" per say. Me and this other girl have never kissed. However, we always touch each other in seemingly ""innocent"" ways. We play with each others hair at times. In the moment it doesn't seem as bad. Typing it out I know it's gone way too far. 

One night we both ran into each other coming home from a night out. She invited me over. I came over. When we were looking each other I saw the look. I know she wanted me, and I wanted her. We flirted, I left. Nothing happened, but the sexual tension is high. We've had 'funny' conversations with her and her roommates about sex and whatnot. I am attracted to her. 

I've been browsing this subreddit a lot. And I've seen this scenario come up multiple times. Sometimes people break up with their long-term gf for the new fling. After the fun sex stops... they realize they miss their long-term gf. I don't want that to be me. 

However, I'm only 21. When I think of stuff like... ""marriage"" with my current gf, I don't see it. I want to do new things whenever I leave college and I don't think I'd get married for a long time. 

I know there's always a ""grass is always greener"" aspect to this. I'm horrified that I'd make the ""wrong"" choice and regret breaking up with her. 

I don't know what to do. I keep telling myself ""I will never kiss (or more) with this new girl as long as I still have my GF."" But is what I'm doing really that much better? It's not. I'm being a dick. 

Writing this out makes it easier. It makes me think more and more that I should break up with her. I feel as though I've tried to give it chances, it just hasn't worked. 

She'll be devastated though. This will come out of nowhere for her. I would definitely cry for a long-time and always question myself if we end up breaking up. I know the easiest, and laziest, solution is just to keep course. But I've been doing that for too long. But, maybe it can be saved if I tried a little harder... Idk.     

Thanks for any responses 

   
**tl;dr**: Love my girlfriend, relationship getting stale. Like new girl, think sexual activities with her would be fun. Scared of breaking up consequences. "
30q5zi,0,2015-03-29,How can a dismissed misdemeanor affect my job/internship possibilities?,hungryforpasta,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30q5zi/how_can_a_dismissed_misdemeanor_affect_my/,"First off this is my first post and I have only been familiar with reddit for a few weeks now. I hope this is the right place to ask for any advice with my question.

I am a college Freshman hopefully majoring in Finance and I recently made a huge mistake. The short version of the story is that I was walking home drunk one weekend and ended up being arrested and charged with misdemeanor public intoxication. I wasn't causing any problems for anyone but the officers decided I was putting myself in danger by walking home intoxicated. I know I made some very stupid decisions and have accepted responsibility for them.

Last week my charge was dismissed conditionally as long as I stay out of trouble for one year and complete some community service hours. After talking with a Lawyer I learned I will be able to have my arrest record expunged but any background check will show a dismissed misdemeanor on my record. 

I know this isn't the end of the world as long as I stay out of trouble but I have always wanted to work in a city like Chicago or NYC for a large company. I am worried that with a competitive job market my app might be immediately thrown out based on this one mistake. So my question is how will this affect any summer internships I apply for in the future and how it will eventually affect getting hired at a large financial institution? 

Also I am not familiar with internship applications so do they even run background checks?

A few further notes: I had a first semester 3.7 gpa and this semester looks to be quite similar, I attend a top ten business school and am involved in an investment club. "

Finding it harder and harder to log in and test this product with the blatant cheating.  Sure, they're banning a person here and there... but largely it remains ineffective.

you think with 1mil copies sold, they would have some sort of anti-cheat or at least a few interns devoted to banning.

30qfof,0,2015-03-29,Need help making a College Decision (UIUC vs NYU),Triocheesy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30qfof/need_help_making_a_college_decision_uiuc_vs_nyu/,"So I'm a senior in high school in upstate New York (I count as a international student because I moved from Singapore during my freshman year of high school) and I'm having a really really really hard time deciding between these two colleges (Narrowed it down). So far I got into University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign (Mathematics and Computer Science joint major) with no financial aid/scholarships and I'd have to pay about 49k to attend it per year. I also got into the Computer Science program at NYU Polytechnic school of engineering (I might want to transfer to the one in the college of arts and sciences because of the location) with a 22k scholarship so it comes down from 63k to about 41k per year.

So the dilemma is that UIUC is a better school for computer science at least than NYU. UIUC also has a huge greek scene and it's a pretty good party school, something that I look forward to. The college town is good, and the campus looks pretty good (I haven't visited, can't really visit). It's also kind of far from NY, which is great, I wasn't really planning on staying in-state. I originally planned to go out of state and away from home.  I'm going to go based on assumptions here since I don't really know that much about the location but as far as I know there isn't that much of an exciting start-up culture near UIUC and it'd be hard to find internships and I'd get bored during the summer.

The thing about NYU is that it's in NYC. There's SO MUCH TO DO in NYC. I'll never be bored and because of the start-up culture, I'm sure they'll be ample opportunities for me to do something during the summer, possibly find an internship too. NYU is also 8K cheaper, for me at least, than UIUC. The cost difference isn't that much of an issue, but I'm just worried that since I'll be in NYC, everything will be expensive. There'll also be more opportunities for networking and I'll be at the heart of everything. Also I plan to minor in finance or economics (I'm thinking of pursing comp sci in the financial sector, so being in NYC helps even more) and since NYU has a good business school, I feel like I'll be getting more bang for my buck. I'm also concerned if there's a big social/party scene in NYU, haven't really heard much about it. Another concern is that I kinda like nature-y stuff. Going on hikes/exploring. I'm wondering if I'll find opportunities to do that in NYC or nearby areas?
 
I'm going to visit NYU sometime this weekend. Unfortunately I probably won't get the opportunity to check out UIUC's campus, but I've heard nothing but good things about it.

I'd appreciate it if any of you could shed some light on any of my concerns or misconceptions or just offer some advice in general to make this decision easier on me.

30qm44,1,2015-03-29,Help me and my friends with our dream ultimate road trip!,psurdy,roadtrip,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/30qm44/help_me_and_my_friends_with_our_dream_ultimate/,"Hey friends!

So me, Brendan, and my three friends Billy, Phil, and Spencer,  are all freshman in college. With the summer coming up, we really want to take advantage of the summers that we have left. With each of us looking to attain internships next summer, this seems like the best chance that we will ever have to do the ultimate USA road trip, starting in NJ, and looping around the west coast and coming home.

About the guys

I (Brendan) am currently a freshman at Penn State (University Park) and I plan on pursuing a career in marketing. Billy is a freshman at Stevens Institute of Technology and is in a 5 year program to get his Masters in mechanical engineering. Phil spent his first semester getting a worldly experience in Spain. He studied at the University of Salamanca and is still in the decision making process about where he will end up next year. Spencer is at the University of Delaware and is majoring in economics. We all grew up together in a small town in New Jersey.

What we need

In order to do this trip, it's  going to take a little bit of gas, food, and some places to stay. We want to make tons of stops along the way and be able to see some really cool places. We want to head to places like the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Mt. Rainier, and Mount Rushmore.

Here's the Kicker

We need a reliable vehicle to get us from point A, around the country, and back to that point. Part, if not most of the funds raised would either go to buffing up one of our cars to be able to make the trip (all are close to having 200,000 miles on them), or buying a car that we just use for this trip that we would donate back to charity upon the completion of the journey.

What your Donations Will Do

Any donation, no matter how big or small means the world. If we are able to reach our fundraising goal, each one of our donors will have contributed to what will most likely be the greatest experience of our life. We will most likely create a blog to showcase our adventure, so the link will be posted at a later time if you care to follow along with us.

Thanks for all of your support in advance,

Brendan

Read the rules for the /r/personalfinance subreddit already - so hopefully I don't break any rules!

Anyway, as you can see from the title, I'm a young adult seeking to get my finances in order. I hope to get out of this post relevant and up-to-date info as much of what I find online seems dated.

Here's a little about me. 21 years young, junior studying mechanical engineering, extremely disciplined (regarding spending money and sticking with goals), tentatively have job waiting for me after graduation with a starting salary around $60 to $65k (spent last summer with the company and I'll be returning this summer). Also, I receive no financial support from anyone except myself and the government via grants and (unsubsidized) loans. 

Currently I owe 14k in loans (all with interest rates below 4%). I have an emergency fund of $2000 which I saved from last summer - in the event of an emergency I'm sure my family would help me out, but I don't want to be dependent on them. Anyway, this summer I expect to bring in ~$10000 after taxes (haven't done the math for total living expenses for the summer). Through scholarships that I have received and my internship, I am hoping to avoid taking out additional loans and graduate with at MOST 14k in loans. 

I am seeking advice as much relevant advice as possible. Here are some questions I have currently:

* should I focus of expeditiously paying my loans back (reminder: low interest rates) or start investing in stocks, mutual funds, etc, or ""enjoy"" freedom of being young and travel/go to concerts/all around enjoy my youth (sister and friends say I should enjoy myself more but honestly the only things I splurge on are healthy foods and gym clothes haha)

* buy new (not literally new, but more reliable) car - not sure if I want to purchase outright or make payments/installments (to build credit score more)

* uhm yeah that's all I can think of

If there are questions you think I should be asking, please do me a huge favor and answer them anyway. I know just enough about personal finance to know that I don't know nearly enough! 

Thanks for the help and advice in advance =)"
30qw4o,4,2015-03-29,To what extent can a professor speak of your academic performance to others?,jaiuneidee,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/30qw4o/to_what_extent_can_a_professor_speak_of_your/,"Hi all. I attended an event last month, and met the CEO of a local startup. He seemed to like me, gave me his email, and encouraged me to email him about an internship position for the summer. So I did, and he cc'd a recruiter who set up an on-site interview. I did well on the technical questions, was personable, and got alone well with the interviewer. He concluded the interview with 'You did very well. I like you, the 'CEO name' really likes you, we'll be in touch.'

4 days later I got an email saying it wouldn't work out. I asked for feedback and received no reply. (Originally everyone was answering me immediately) I did a bit more investigation and found out the son of one of my professors works at this company in an upper-ish role. I'm confident my professor told his son about my performance. I didn't do that well in his class, and I really don't think this professor liked me. 

Is it common for professors to advice on hiring decisions in this way? Is it ethical? Is it even allowed? This professor is also in charge of the CS curriculum, and as graduation is looming (next year) I will surely need to speak with him at some point, but I really, really, don't want anything to do with this guy anymore. I don't think it was fair of him to speak ill of me, as his class was the only one I under performed. Does anyone have any thoughts on this ?

tldr; met CEO of company, got along great. he set up an interview, went great. Found out son of professor whose class I did really bad in works at this company. I'm sure the professor advised against hiring me. Now they won't even follow up with feedback."
30qxo6,1,2015-03-29,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Long Term) (Anal, Pegging, Superheroes, Role Reversal and Body Mod)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/30qxo6/22m4f_multiple_prompts_long_term_anal_pegging/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I am a Computer Science student here at VT. So let's say I just kind of do below average (2.6-2.9gpa), do the bare minimum to graduate (no minors or extra classes, maybe I choose the KID degee track), and am involved in minimum extracurriculars (dining hall job), and do only 1 internship over a summer. I know I'm not headed towards a job with Google or Amazon, but are my opportunities severely limited? Do you think I will make much less than the average CS grad? Perhaps I didn't learn enough and companies will not offer me a job?"

I wish to ask about the flexibility of focuses, specifically which would leave one most prepared to pursue employment upon graduation. Additionally, while known for being a tech filled area, are the available internship opportunities in Irvine open to student's who have yet to graduate, allowing for such opportunities in the summer, or is there a tendency to require until the end of senior year?

Furthermore, a significant issue brought up is the shift from a Java based program to a curriculum centered around Python for core classes in recent years. Has this shift improved the preparation of students entering the work force? And are there any upcoming changes in the curriculum that will aid in filling in previously empty gaps in necessary knowledge (multi-threading / database management ) ?

Having a chance to hear responses from current students and their experiences in recent years attending and studying CS would be invaluable in making my decision to attend next year. "
30r8uo,107,2015-03-29,[OC] One Bad Morning Cycle,HammondCheeseIII,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/30r8uo/oc_one_bad_morning_cycle/,"Commander-in-CEO Vresha Prawn had no particular liking for interns, thinking to himself as he strode the corridors to his mothership's main bridge. They were shrewd, whiny, conniving, and terrifyingly... ambitious at the worst of it. But, for the most part, Prawn despised them for their incessant meekness and whining. ""We could use THAT as a source of power..."" Prawn thought to himself.  As a Solartarian, his species was well adapted to service the cold recesses of the Galaxy. Able to breathe with very little oxygen, as well as possessing a strong exoskeleton, their crews piloted the majority of the Galactic Council's mining ships, strip-mining gas giants, planets, moons, asteroids, and even the occasional dwarf star for energy. 
""An Ever-Growing Galaxy needs an Ever-Growing Workforce!"" was the motto of the Solartarian Mining Corporation. They were given exclusive contracts by the Council to do mine in the Western Spiral Arm... if, in exchange they provided ""equal opportunities"" for every Council species that applied for a job.  Why the SMC  had forced Prawn to work with weakskins like the intern who summoned him TO HIS OWN BRIDGE was beyond his comprehension. Always whining about the gravity, the heat, the lack of oxygen, or nitrogen... so... meek, it made him physically sick. 
As the little Cenalite began to open its mouth, Prawn suddenly shifted two of his compound eye stalks to the sector number on the holoboard- Sector 047. 
Prawn suddenly tensed, as a distant memory stirred in his spinal brain, and a thought snaked his way to his mandibles. Something about that sector... was it a biological weapons dumping ground? A sanctuary? He couldn't recall. 
""Is that a notification from... Sector 047?"" Prawn asked, in a tone similar to the coldness of deep space. 

The intern swallowed its fear, and raised a head to glare at Prawn and his six different compound eyes. 
""Why... yes... sir. One of our mining ships went down in the area after making... erm... well... contact."" 
Prawn showed no emotion. 
""S-s-sir...?"" 
""Continue... Intern."" Prawn growled, his mandibles clicking slowly together. ""What exactly... Happened, to our ship?"" 

The Intern collected itself, and continued. 
""Well, our mining ship arrived in the area, and followed standard galactic procedure by stationing itself in high orbit for 2 Galactic Standard Rotations, as per my calculations and orders. Like you asked me to carry out. I... well...may have miscalculated, because that's when they hit the satellite."" 

Prawn's antennae twitched. 
""A... satellite? The planet's abandoned- we use it as a chemical waste depository! IT's just reaching the point where we can harvest the bacteria for energy, isn't it?  Did it his a small meteorite, or their moon, or..?"" 

The Intern suddenly grew very, very worried, and started to exhume its fear pheromones. Since Solartarians have no sense of smell, this did nothing but anger the rest of the decks crewmen.

""N...no, sir. IT was a satellite, containing manufactured metals, high traces of silicon computers and... living... things. From an exceedingly bountiful planet below.""
Getting no response but the same emotionless glare from Prawn, the Intern continued. 
""Our last probe's data is extremely outdated, according to the mining crew's report. It turns out that our probe recorded data in the interior of only ONE of the planets continents- and an entire civilization has sprung up in less than... well, 5,000 years, sir!"" 
The Intern stopped, and anticipated a response from his superior. 
Still, Prawn gave no response. 
The Intern cleared his throat, growing ever more nervous. 
""This... new civilization is advancing far faster than any of our neighbors, or any species, for that matter! After scanning some of their global communications network, they've actually gone from powered flight to space travel in... in less than 100 of their years!"" 
Prawn suddenly interjected, but only moved his mandibles in response to the Intern's fact. 
""What... kind of space travel?"" He rasped. 
""Rudimentary, of course. Nothing outside of their own solar system, save for a small probe. The crew thought it belonged to sentient creatures in the system's Gas Giant, but... they found nothing."" 
Prawn gave the closest Solartarian equivalent of a smile to the Intern, and said, ""Then it's settled. Order the crew to initiate orbital strike protocols, and bury the civilization. They obviously can't shoot down our craft, and even a few hundred of our soldiers armed with our bioweapons should be enough to take their largest cit-"" 
""Actually, sir, the signal sent from the mining ship was a distress call."" The intern interrupted... nervously. 
Prawn suddenly shifted his whole body, arching to his full height to eclipse the small creature. 
""Excuse. Me?"" He nearly whispered, with a tone that could frighten an entire army into committing mass suicide (Which Prawn had actually accomplished twice before) 
""Well... Sir... it turns out that... that... the creatures, called ""Humans"" are actually resistant to all of our biological weapons. Because... we used the planet as a biological weapons dumping ground. Their plagues called 'Black Death,' 'Influenza,' and 'SARS'  have all come close to destroying them but... But  they failed. Miserably, actually. It strengthened their immune systems, and... well... they killed any of our ground crews who tried to land."" 
""KILLED? With WHAT, exactly? Our personal shields are impenetrable! How did they...?"" 
The Intern continued, answering Prawn's question with a shaking-so-furiously-that-he-could-barely-pronounce-his-words-sort-of-tone ""With... kinetic weapons, sir. Pieces of lead fired by expanding gas from metal and plastic barrels. They tore our ground crews to shreds. What's more, they're... poisonous. Some of our grounds crews died from just TOUCHING them, since most of them are COVERED with our own biological weapons residuce! And... they brought down the scout ship."" 
Prawn nearly feinted. ""They... what?""
The Intern continued. ""They brought down the scout ship with... nuclear weaponry. The weapons only brought down the shields, of course, but they've been perfecting these systems for almost a hundred years for passing into high orbit... and... they brought it down.... mostly... intact. That's how we were able to receive the  the message in the first place.""
Prawn started to rub his eyes with two of his legs. ""This can't be happening... this can't be happening... this can't be happening..."" Prawn gave the Intern one last desperate glance, and uttered in near hysteria, ""Was the message at least on a private frequency?"" 
The Intern sighed, and with dismay and regret, replied, ""No, sir. It was a public broadcast.""
Prawn collapsed to the floor, almost in the Solartarian-equivalent  tears, and bawled, 
""You're telling me that these... these overly-violent 'humans', have managed to not only massacre an entire scouting ship of miners and some of our finest mercenaries, but are also resistant to almost all of our weapons and diseases, are poisonous upon contact by any of our personnel, and to top it off, they now have a WARP DRIVE!?"" 
The Intern quickly interjected, stating, ""And now the Galactic Council knows we've been praying on pre-warp civilizations and weapon deposal sites for easy mining operations. Would you... like a drink, si-""
The Intern was cut short as Prawn quickly and effortlessly separated his torso and legs from each other, spilling blood all over his bridge. 
""You. Other intern."" 
A small Zephron stepped forward, just out of reach of Prawn. 
""Y-y-yes, sir?"" He asked, nervously. 
""Draft my letter of resignation. Send it to my chamber terminal. I'll be busy preparing my last Will and Testament.""  
As Prawn stormed out off of his bridge, he muttered to himself, 
""I do despise interns."" 


On another note, the last intern, (who rose the rank of Captain of a mining vessel shortly afterwards) Thraldin of Zephron had often wished he had taken Prawn's lead after the first reports of Humanity's bold steps onto the Galactic Stage started to filter in through the galactic networks several months later. 
As he sat in his office, listening to one of his interns read off the last stock reports of that day while the Human Standard Starship ""Washington"" bombarded his home planet, he couldn't help but mutter to himself, 
""I do despise interns.""

30rcxe,16,2015-03-29,81 days and Blessed!,ReLivingLife,NoFapChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/30rcxe/81_days_and_blessed/,"Hey all,

It's been a hot minute since I've been on the NFC board... I won't forget how much the good Christians active on this subreddit helped me so much in getting off the ground this last time around. I just wanted to share my testimony on how GREAT and amazing God has been in helping me through this process. And how fitting that he called me to start so close to the Lenten season. God is good!


So, I've just gone 81 days without P, M, O, PMO... the whole 9 yards. Frankly, I'm done with Porn. I feel like I have been given the gift of strength to put that file on my mind’s shelf for the foreseeable future, and it feels fantastic. Not that it’s ever going to be eliminated completely. I rarely (once every few weeks at this point) get a flash thought about something to do with pornography, but it usually passes just as quickly as it comes.  I love the almost supernatural peace that’s come over me, a feeling that I just don't want to ever return to it. Control, with regards to pornography, isn't even an issue in my mind any longer. Now, this is the 2nd time that I've made it past 80 days. My previous record was around 120 days, about a year and a half ago, before I discovered NoFap and related stuff. I decided to start PMOing again out of sheer boredom, not knowing the full consequences my actions would have. I will say this, we're all very different in how we respond to PMO withdraw, but from my experiences, there is certainly hope of getting to a point where it's actually moderately easy to get through those painful first few weeks, and into the smooth waters. Seriously, once you’re here, pornography becomes a choice… no longer a compulsion. It’s so worth the struggle!!

What’s truly worth it, is the peace that comes from walking in God’s word and ways again. In these last 80 days, God has blessed me tremendously… like I’ve never been blessed before… it’s given me even MORE personal evidence that the Holy Spirit is alive and active in this world, and in our own lives if only we let him in. Major things have happened: I basically killed the GRE, acing the writing section (which was ironically from getting some good writing practice from posting on Christian NoFap back in January),  got into a nationally ranked top-25 graduate program, found the perfect internship with a major government contractor just 20 miles down the road recently… and could even get a crack at working on one of the most important scientific experiments in the world this summer (I won’t disclose it for privacy reasons, but even if you know very little about science, I promise you’ve heard of this place).

In my opinion, the answer is all in getting closer to God. Seriously, I didn't have the strength to do this properly from within (that is, the only reason I succeeded was having a room-mate physically present most of the time for the first month, keeping me from PMOing), and I don't think many of us really ever do, without Him. 

It's pretty much that simple... accept him, walk with him, be humble... and the rest falls into place.



I posted a load of my personal tips and experiences on another topic, regarding ADHD, if anyone's interested:

See you in another 90 days! I'll be praying for you all on the subreddit.

For the past year and half I've been actively looking for an internship that can help me gain knowledge on the field I'm in. My background is health care and insurance ( call center ). I have not been able to get an internship with anyone. My experience in the IT field is personal and educational. As I know how to build and manage websites as well fix my own hardware. My Resume is well documented and I haven't had a any negative outcomes in previous Jobs. Even though I am a little concerned as to why companies won't give me a shot at it. I am 28 years old and I have the passion, courage and desire to do this as it always been my dream. I certainly wouldn't want to do a post internship because it wouldn't make much sense. So I am wondering what I'm I doing wrong to be rejected over and over. From my understanding internships are so we can learn. But if I don't have the experience they won't give me the internship, but if don't get the internship how will I gain the experience ? "

But it requires government security clearance and I do have a drug history,Random_mob2015,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/30rttt/i_just_got_offered_my_dream_internship_position/,"I'm not really sure what to do. I really want the job but am worried that I'll get denied security clearance, and the internship is contingent upon that I get approved. I've never been in any legal trouble, I have no sketchy international relations and have a clean slate. The only thing I'm worried about is my personal drug history. I will be entering my 3rd year of university and have done experimenting during my time here. For the past couple years I've smoked marijuana frequently and have experimented with a variety of drugs. Including lsd, shrooms, cocaine, xanax, and adderal. Besides adderal I only did each of them like twice over the past few years. Furthermore, there was like a month this past winter where I sold marijuana to my friends while I was home on break. I know questions about these will come up on a polygraph exam so I'm very nervous about it. I know polygraphs can be inconsistent and can be beaten (like the toe -thumb tac trick?). Am I better off being honest on the exam and hoping for the best? Or should I take my chances as the exam failing and getting inconsistent results somehow? I haven't done any drugs the past month in hopes of bettering my chances. I don't think I would be examined until summer as well.
It sucks that this is even an issue. I'm no threat to our government and am a good kid. I'm in a fraternity at a major state university.. I am just trying to have a good weekend and experience new things."

*Written by /u/CurryThighs, who is too busy fighting Dragons to post today!*

What happens when you adapt a home-made [Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons](/r/dungeonsanddragons) campaign played by colleagues at work (Does that technically make it 'work-made'?) into a series of video-games and novels? You get the fantastical and expansive world of Nirn! This is not your grandmothers fantasy story...

'The Elder Scrolls' is a videogame series (Most notable installments are Oblivion, Skyrim and Elder Scrolls Online) created by Bethesda Studios. It began as a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign they used to play around the office back in the day, and decided to adapt it into a fully-fledged RPG video game! The series began with Arena, and gained popularity, spawning four sequels, six spin-off games (four of which existed on pre-smartphone mobile phones) aswell as two novels with many more planned! Not to mention the enormous online community that /r/TESLore belongs to.

I'll give you a (not so) brief description of the world of Nirn, the setting The Elder Scrolls:

A double-mooned, inter dimensional, strife-ridden (slightly overpopulated) planet filled with all manner of magical folk. From 'Argonians' to 'Sload' to 'Imperial' to 'Dunmer'. Not to mention the lesser beasts such as [Spriggan](http://images.uesp.net/9/9c/SR-creature-Spriggan.jpg), [Ice Wraith](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/522709621553926288/EC02A5C38DA53EE077B6D7F50ABACA7121C5F5AB/), [Atronach](http://i.imgur.com/Q08PHv7.jpg), [Scamp](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130730223046/elderscrolls/images/e/ed/Scamp_Online.jpg), [Clannfear](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131016104033/elderscrolls/images/f/f9/Clannfear_\(Online\).jpg), [Dremora](http://images.uesp.net/thumb/0/06/SR-npc-Dremora_Caitiff.jpg/600px-SR-npc-Dremora_Caitiff.jpg), [Daedroth](http://www.hdwallpapersimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Daedroth-Elder.jpg), [Chaurus](http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/932262-1328383946.jpg), [Falmer](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131111214949/elderscrolls/images/9/91/Falmer_Soldier.jpg), [Hagraven](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/aliens/images/a/a2/Hagraven.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120629152344), [Riekling](http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/588387-1361061735.jpg), [Netch](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121116072215/elderscrolls/images/f/f6/Dragonborn_Screenshots_6.jpg), [Lurker](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130206164817/elderscrolls/images/c/c3/Dragonborn-trailer-14.PNG), [Draugr](http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/51874-1-1394228751.jpg)-

Sorry, I got a little carried away there...

Aside from the multiple sentient races and various monsters and animals, we have great heroes, magnificent deities (Which it is possible to become!), pure-evil demons, multiple planes of existence and even a dance called the fishstick. Everything is so meticulously made to create a truly magnificent world! The history is steeped in politics and wars, great rulers, magical and religious conquests, betrayal and triumph. I could write thirty pages on what makes this universe so great, but it would barely scratch the surface.

If you like fantasy, magic, worldbuilding or even metaphysics, then you should definitely check out The Elder Scrolls. It's got everything you could ever want, and more! It may seem a little overwhelming at first, but once you've gotten used to it, I'm sure you'll love it! And this really is the best place to learn!

The folks over at /r/TESLore go above and beyond the call of duty when discussing ANY topic pertaining to the world of The Elder Scrolls. There are people there that could detail the different moon phases and the effects each one has on the sentient race of cat people, the Khajiit. They hold great debates to discern which political party really has the best intentions and who is most likely to come out on top. 

[One of the largest debates out there at the moment](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2byvy8/newbie_here_is_talos_actually_a_god/) is whether or not one of the Gods can truly be considered a God? The story goes that a great ruler died and ascended to Godhood for his heroism, but years later a fascist group of racist Elven-Supremacists decreed worship outlawed. Some of the subreddit believe this is a just treaty, whilst others believe it blasphemy!

Now, while I love talking about Godly heroes, [enough about me](https://thehostages.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/thor-winking-thorsday.gif?w=750). I'll hand you over to the deities behind the sub itself! The /u/TESLore mod team answered a few of my questions!

&gt;##1. Tell us a little bit about yourself!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: Hi! I'm Xeno. I have an oddly long and hard to pronounce real name, but Xeno works fine. I'm /r/teslore's Community Manager and Text Archive guy and have been on the mod team since the subreddit was about half a year old, I believe. I'm also a proud Seattlite and an amateur worldbuilder and writer (Shoutout to /r/worldbuilding)

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**:I'm just someone who had the awesome luck of getting to moderate a subreddit all about his favourite fictional world.

&gt;##2. How did you find The Elder Scrolls?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: Unlike about 90% of /r/teslore which played ES since Morrowind I only really gave the series my attention when the enormous wave of hype preceding Skyrim's release was everywhere on reddit.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**: When I was 10, my best friend showed off the cool new video game he had. Before long, everyone in the class was playing it. That game was Morrowind! The fad died down after a while but I just never stopped playing.

&gt;##3. Do you have a favourite installment of the series? (Any platform)

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: I do think Morrowind is the superior game in the series with its writing and design, but admittedly I've played Skyrim way more and it's still my personal favorite in the series.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**: It's gotta be Morrowind. ***[Morrowind](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/tx8d4/head_down_to_the_dock_and_ill_show_you_to_the/c4qifiu)***

&gt;##4. And a favourite period of Nirns history?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: Purely because of a series called ""Through Eastern Eyes"" by /u/Blackfyre87 , I'd say early to mid 4th Era. Lots and lots of interesting developments there.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**:Either the late Third Era, since we've seen so much of it, or the Fifth Era, since the little we have seen of it is crazy fun. That said, I think the Fourth Era is going to tell us some awesome stories.

&gt;##5. Do you have an area of expertise within the Lore?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: I do! I used to be /r/teslore's professional Argonian and Black Marsh freak, but the title has relatively recently been usurped by /u/IceFireWarden.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**:Telling people to read the FAQ.

&gt;##6. What draws you to the expansive world of Nirn?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: Well the writing is one thing, but I think it's the lore community itself that has maintained my interest in the world with its countless discussions and simultaneously ridiculous and ridiculously interesting theories.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**: Nirn is weird. TES looks a lot like a typical fantasy on the surface, but digging deeper, you find out how strange it can really be. And strange is good. The lore is all about paying attention to that.

&gt;##7. If you had created The Elder Scrolls, which areas of the Lore would you have expanded on or improved? In what ways?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: More Argonian and Black Marsh lore is always exciting. Really the thing that would most excite me is if Bethesda gave /u/IceFireWarden's Uutak project some love and shown us more of the islands between Akavir and Tamriel.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**: TESIV: Oblivion played it *way* too safe, its lore was so bland. And that's a real shame since there are so many interesting avenues it could've explored -- Cyrodilic culture, Daedric culture, Mankar, Ayleids, the Towers. If I were in charge, I'd have had /u/mojonation1487 cover the [Camorans/Mythic Dawn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1qp202/he_that_enters_paradise_enters_his_own_mother/), /u/Voryn cover the [Ayleids](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2a9pi7/on_the_ayleid_realms_telepe/), Cyrodiil would be a jungle, and Colovians and Nibenese would be super different.

&gt;&gt;And I'd definitely have put more wasabi and snow whales in Skyrim, that's for sure.

&gt;##8. Do you feel all installments of the series (cross platform) have stayed true to the Lore? If not, how do you feel about those that have retconned the established information?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: I could pull up 20 threads saying that each and every TES installment contradicts the last one wildly and could also pull up another 20 threads explaining why the TES world is simply evolving and not linear in terms of time in the first place. We've got a statement in the Lore Community, ""Boring and Therefore Wrong."" If something new is contradictory and honestly boring and uninspiring, disregard it. If something new is contradictory but interesting and inspiring, view it as the greater truth and build upon it.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**: See my last answer! Generally though, the games do a great job. Retcons suck but they're sometimes necessary.

&gt;##9. Lastly, what advice would you give to an aspiring Lorite?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xenoposeidon**: Well I wrote up a whole guide for New Scholars that can be found in /r/teslore's sidebar, but if I'd have to shortly summarize it I'd say this: Research on your own, ask questions, and be open to other people's opinions and theories. Most importantly, though, take your time.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Prince-of-Plots**:Make use of the resources available, ask tons of questions, keep an open mind. It was overwhelming to all of us at first!

I don't really have anyone to talk to in person about this.

I'm a senior in college and about to graduate, and reflecting on these last few years. During my freshman year, I was absolutely clueless on how to interact with people. I didn't even understand that men were physically sexually attracted to women, which led to a lot of awkward situations. I did meet some girls, but always felt a strange feeling of being intimidated around them (socially, not academically). I was so afraid of fucking something up, and this feeling would become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Somewhere around my 2nd/3rd year, I definitely felt something was terribly wrong. I was losing all of my internships and friends. I started going into therapy and obsessively reading about social skills, autism, and so on.

But, as my knowledge began to grow, I felt opportunity begin to slip away. Unlike at 18 or 19, opportunities to be around people seemed to dwindle. Like people expected you to have your friend group already at that age, and some solid experience, and a reputation, and your shit together. And here I am, perpetually floundering and starting from zero, trying to figure out all this social shit people learned when they were 13.

It's almost like the 1st year and maybe beginning of the 2nd are the only years that matter. 

And it's not just college. I just feel like in general, the younger years are when everyone is laying the foundation for their friendships and life, while we aspergirls are clueless and bullied. Then, once we gain maturity and are able to swivel ourselves around socially a bit, it's too late. 

I see groups of girls around my age hanging out together, or pictures of weddings where the bride has a ton of bridesmaids, and I know I will never have that. It hits something primal and makes me want to break down and cry. I berate myself endlessly for not having whatever ""skills"" they have to make such a life for themselves. But when I'm around these people, I don't know how to communicate with them. I barely have any friends and feel terribly lonely.

Does anyone else feel like this? Or used to feel like this and got over it? Or has become a more successful ""late bloomer""? Is this type of stuff even worth worrying about?"

The other night the power was out for the whole building, and a few days ago once the power was restored and the elevators were back up and running I called it up and low and behold as I walked in to the elevator this box with a laptop and this dog statue was sitting in the far right corner. The box was labeled, """"junk, do not return to owner"""". I took the laptop and box with me to my car and later when I got home I opened the laptop and running was a notepad software already open and with the following written in it**
                   
- Hello me, I’m just going to be writing this little journal here on the laptop so I don’t get bored, I like to write and I figure if I type down my thoughts and stuff it’ll help me feel less lonely and give me something to do.
    
- I’m awake now yet somehow the sky outside is dark again. For the past few days I have been exhausted due to finals week at school, but now it is summer and I look forward to resting. I have no classes and did not get an internship like I had hoped so I am stuck home for most of this summer. This past semester left me exhausted and on the last day of finals I came straight to my apartment and collapsed on my bed only to wake up at 11 at night, I’m up now browsing the web reading articles and playing little games, the night sky looks quite peaceful from my window but I feel a bit lonely now that the semester is over. I have a very small amount of friends because I like to keep my circle small. I have 2 good friends and that’s it, the only problem is that they are out of town back home to their home towns up north while I am stuck here alone.
    
- I am writing this because I am lonely, I just need to type to myself to get out all these thoughts swirling in my head, I woke up around 11 P.M. so I stayed up until now, it just turned 3 A.M. I made some ramen noodles and now I’m just staring out my window into the dark sky. I wish I had cable but I cut back on things like cable and eating out to save money. My apartment has a Wi-Fi hotspot for its residents to use so that’s cool. I’m going to just watch a movie online or something, I don’t even know if I should sleep again or wait until it is night time. The dark sky still makes it seem like night but it’s just very early in the morning.

- Well, I stayed up until almost 5:00 in the morning and fell asleep, I woke up today at 2:00 in the afternoon to a rainy day. I’m staying in today, it’s pouring out and the lightning is bright and frequent. As I ‘m sitting here at my computer the lightning flashing from outside made something in my peripheral noticeable. To my left as I type this there sits a statue of a brown dog with big round black eyes, I forgot I even had this statue until the lightning lit up its eyes making it very noticeable. This statue is a small little piggy bank, shaped like a dog. Oh yes I remember now, it was given to me by my mother and once belonged to my grandfather. The dog sat with its head tilted giving off the creepiest sad puppy dog look I have ever seen, and its eyes were indeed lifeless and a bit disturbing. I’m trying to ignore that it is even here but those big black lifeless eyes are hard to ignore, I feel a bit bad that those eyes were the only pair of eyes besides my own that I have seen since classes ended.
    
- I feel kind of strange, my body aches and I have the chills, I believe I am about to become sick with the flu or something, I really hate being sick, I wanted to get out tomorrow but I feel terrible. I’m also starting to feel even lonelier, I might call my friends later to see what their up to, but for now I’m just going to lay down. I’m up again and again staring at me from my left is this dog statue. I still feel sick and it’s now 12: 26 midnight. I hate waking up to the dark sky, it feels…wrong. I keep looking up over at this statue and hoping it won’t be staring at me anymore, it is watching me intently as if saying to me “I am here if no one else is.” The more I think about it, I have spent more time with this statue, fixed in its gaze more than I have with my own friends throughout the year because of how much I stay home rather than go out. I still feel sick and I could really use some company, this dog statue isn’t really doing it for me.
    
- I fell asleep in my chair and woke up with this throbbing headache and the power being out, it is 2 a.m. and I feel tired and sick, but most of all I feel lonely. The power is out but my laptop still has a good amount of battery power. I hear faint music from the other side of my wall. There is a really old lady who lives in the apartment next to mine who loves to play these old records on her record player. She is playing a weird old song, I have no idea what the song is called but the dark room and the gleaming eyes of this statue are not a good mix, I need to get out but I feel very sick and have no energy. The song playing through my wall is quite a somber song, I decided to go ask what the name of the song was, mostly because I needed some sort of human attention, ANY human attention, I walked out of my apartment into the dark hallway, it was the first time I have seen the hallway not lit up by lights, it was strange to say the least, it was only lit by the emergency lights above the door leading to the staircase. Anyways, I went and knocked on her door and she answered it seeming both surprised but strangely happy to see someone, I just told her I was checking to see if her power was out to even though I was well aware the whole building or at least this whole floor was without power. After a bit of chit chat I asked her the name of the song playing, she told me it was a song called “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence, and told me it was her mother’s favorite song. She invited me in but I declined citing that I didn’t feel too well and I wanted to go back to my place and lay down. So now I’m sitting here in the dark again with this damn statue staring a hole through me, I’m not going to move it because once I move it, I will have given in to the fact that an inanimate object has spooked me to the point where I think its eyes are actually “watching” me rather than just being a set of fake eyes with no real function. The moment I move that statue is the moment my fears of it become real and it no longer is just a statue, instead it’s something that can cause me to be uneasy, something that can cause me to become frightened.
    
- I fell asleep again but this time in my computer chair, I awoke to the same set of lifeless black eyes staring at me and the sound of a record skipping repeatedly, I’m going to wait about 5 more minutes and if it’s still skipping I’m going to go over and check on the old lady next door to see if everything is ok.
    
- I’m freaked out right now, its 4 A.M. now, last I typed here I said I would wait 5 minutes then go check on the old lady next door. Well 5 minutes went by and I went to go check on her, I went to her door and knocked but there was no answer just a skipping record echoing through the door, feeling as though something were wrong, I decided to try the door and it was unlocked. I looked into the apartment, it was dark with one single candle flickering in the hall way and a skipping record steadily sounding off in the darkness, I walked in and over to the living room area and saw another candle and the silhouette of the old woman sitting in an armchair next to the skipping record. She was sitting straight up in a recliner chair with her arms both resting on the armrests, I could only see her outline and could not make out any other details besides her silhouette in the very dimly lit room. I called out to her and she was unresponsive, I walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder and realized she was not responding at all no matter how much I tried to get her attention, I rushed over here to my apartment and got my cell phone and called 911, after I called 911 I waited with her in the dark living room. I took the needle off the record to stop it from skipping and sat there alone with her, in the very dimly lit room, I sat for a few minutes then something happened that creeped me out more than I have ever been crept out in my life, the old lady turned her head to her left and said in a voice that I didn’t recognize to be hers and said “Don’t you remember the lonely nights Mortimer?”, after that statement from the calm and deep voice not matching the old ladies voice from when we spoke earlier, the lady’s head turned ever so slowly back straight forward almost mechanically. Miss are you okay I asked, but no response, Miss are you okay I asked again this time placing my hand on hers. Once my hand touched her skin I snapped my hand back because of how ice cold her hand was, I was about to inform her that I called the ambulance to make certain she was okay when I spotted something very unnerving. There sitting on the table next to the record player. Ever so faintly I could now make out the figure to her left, I guess my eyes had adjusted to the dim light of the room enough for me to see it now. This “It” that I could now see was a statue of a brown dog with big black eyes staring at her as she sat in her chair, it was facing her much like the one I owned faced towards me. I thought that this is merely a coincidence that she had the same statue piggy bank of a dog like I have, I even got up and walked over here to my apartment to make sure my statue was still here and sure enough it was and still is. I couldn’t even sit in that living room anymore I stood at the edge of the dim candle lit hallway and waited for the paramedics to arrive, they arrived and after a few cycles of CPR she was pronounced dead at the scene.
    
- As I sit here and type this my own “watchdog” or rather “watching dog” sits to my left burning its lifeless gaze right through me, it is 5 A.M. and still dark out and the power is still down. I can’t believe the old lady is gone, I can’t believe she might have died while I was still in the room with her, I feel strange. Maybe, I could have helped her I don’t know…everything is getting to be a bit too much for me right now. I have so many questions that no one will be able to answer, why did she speak to the statue?? Why did her voice sound so strange? Oh lord, did she really die that moment while I was in there with her??? WHY did she have the same eerie dog statue as I do? This is definitely going to keep me guessing for a long time to come. I still refuse to move my statue, I will not give in to silly irrational fears. If I move it, it wins…However, Just the statement “If I move it, it wins” is a sign I have given in to fear already.
    
- Ok I’m back at it again, I laid down to try to sleep at around 5:15 but was woken up by a strange faint noise from the other side of my wall. The noise turns out to be music, not just any music but the same song from before, the same song the old woman had been listening to before she died. I heard it loud and clear now, it was “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence. I sat up and rolled my eyes at this situation, I’m weird like that, when frightening things happen I kind of get upset that it is happening in the first place, almost like it is an inconvenience to me for something frightening to be happening to me. Then as I turned my head I was frozen stiff, I didn’t want to move because from my bed I could see that dog statue and those big black eyes staring at my computer chair as if it was waiting for me to sit so it could peer straight into my soul like it always does. I finally mustered up the courage to grab my laptop from my desk and bring it to my bed, I’m typing this with that damn dog sitting in its spot while that record plays, well its skipping now and I wish it would stop…Wait it did stop…and now the song is playing again. I’m finished with this journal and I’m getting out of this apartment. I’m done typing and I’m done feeling trapped.
    
- Ok so my getaway plan was foiled, I was walking and something pulled me back, not something physically pulling me back, just something inside me engrained deep into my psyche that told me I just couldn’t go another second without solving this mystery, I had to go into the apartment, I had to try to get some closure and also I had to stop that music from playing, I just had to! I walked over to the old lady’s door, it was surprisingly still unlocked even after the paramedics left. I walked in there and fumbled in the dark and turned off the music. As I was leaving I felt my hand brush the top of something. I adjusted my hands to the object and felt the coarse and hard object between my fingers, I knew it was her dog statue. I don’t know why but I grabbed it and left the old lady’s apartment and came back here to my own apartment. Now I am here with two of those statues. Her statue however was heavier, like it had something in it. I turned the statue upside down and noticed a round metal cap, I guess a place where any money stored in the statue can be retrieved. I popped open the cap and took out an assortment of old coins and a single picture, a picture of a little girl and a woman, and inside was a note that was scribbled frantically on the back of the picture. The note reads, “I need no friends because you watch over me, now and forever I am in your gaze because now and forever your eyes are the only friends for me.” This was strange, I didn’t understand it, I was now compelled to investigate my own statue, now I must admit what I found in that statue was indeed strange to me but not as strange as what I found inside my own statue. Inside my statue was a picture of me when I was about 5 years old, there I sat smiling and happy, and behind me sat the dog statue staring as it always does. I am confused and frightened, I do not know what any of this means and I don’t ever remember this picture being mentioned to me by my mom, this statue that belonged to my grandfather before he passed on has always been in my possession since as long as I could remember. This will be my last post, I’m going to head out, I have to get out of here and away from all the
    
- lo Hello,
    
dabit deus his quoque finem
    
- I am back dear journal and I must say I feel silly for being afraid this entire time. I have no need to be afraid, you see Mortimer is my friend. Mortimer watches over me, his eyes are all the friends I need. I’m going to turn off my computer so I can be alone with Mortimer, he enjoys the dark and I will enjoy it with him. He tells me to find a friend for him, I think I know how to pass on his friendship to the next lucky person...


        
    **Below is a link to a picture of the dog statue I now have, I don't know what to do with this stuff. Is it a joke?, I do remember the ambulance coming to the building and looking out my window to see someone being carted away in a body bag up on a stretcher, I was kinda freaked that someone had died but didn't worry about it too much, I don't know anyone in this building really so the owner of this stuff is unknown to me, This dog statue does give off a strange vibe though...**

From what I've read, the quality of acne scar treatments depends highly on the doctors themselves. However, being a bit of a cynic, I'm finding skeptical of most of the reviews I'm reading. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places (yelp &amp; yellowpages), but I'm having a really hard trying to find a specialist for acne scars. I would be really grateful if the kind people of SCA would guide me in the right direction...

I have moderate ice pick and mild boxcar scarring with enlarged pores on my cheeks. I'm Korean but pretty dark, type 3-4 on the fitzpatrick skin tone scale, with an olive undertone so hyperpigmentation might be an issue for me (idek). I have a history of vitiligo and I'm scared that it might flare up. I'm looking to spend around $2k on the treatment, possibly more if I feel really convinced. I'm not sure what kind of treatment I'm leaning towards, but Fraxel and microabrasions seem hopeful. I don't think my scarring is too horrible, and I'm really hoping to have close to flawless skin after a few treatments. Am I being unrealistic? 

I hope to get the treaments done in DFW area in Texas (where I'll be for the summer), but I'm also open to finding a place in Boston or even NYC if I have to. (I go to school in New England.) Does anyone have recommendations? Also, even if you might not have specific recommendations, do you guys have any telltale signs of a competent doctor? I've been trying to look for doctors who say they specialize in acne scars, but no one has really popped up for me. I'm reading about these qualifications but I really don't know the second thing about how the world of dermatology works. 

Thanks for reading!! I'd really appreciate any kind of feedback."

i hope you can clear something up for me,
i have an exchange server with a private IP, it uses a public certificate for OWA and works fine if i do a portforwarding
but if i use a reverse proxy with the same certificate (same public IP) it does not work anymore


as soon as i use a self signed certificate for the proxy it works
am i not allowed to use the same certificate on the OWA and the reverse proxy?

if the proxy does do a DNS lookup for the OWA it resolves to the intern IP address of the exchange server

30t25t,3,2015-03-30,Late. First Day of Work.,fights4love,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/30t25t/late_first_day_of_work/,"My first day of work as a cable guy and I'm fucking late. Let me explain why.

I live in nyc and usually take the bus/train to work. I recently was hired as a cable guy and the location is sweet. It is only a small bus ride to work. Only 1 hour. Hell, I even have a bike that I can ride to go to work.

It sounds great right? Here I am with a new job and easy commute.  It should be smooth sailing but just one small thing. The bus I take is usually packed and I have to carry my work tools to my locker at the job. Once I bring in my tools however the bus ride/commute should be no problem. 

Instead of fighting on the bus for space with my tool bags I decided to ask my old man for a ride. Just this once I asked him to drop me off at work. I ask him 3 days in advance and remind him the night before.

Morning of my first day on the job I'm excited and eager to go. Wake up early, had breakfeast and all that. But wait a second, it seems my dad has another appointment.  He promised to take my sister to school. My sis is in college and currently doing an unpaid internship at some public school. 

My sister is such a pathetic annoying piece of shit. She is 24 and never had a job. She is fat and lazy and depressed.  Do not get me wrong I'm not hating on depressed people (hell, we all been there) but she feels the need to let everyone know every 5 seconds that  she is depressed. If you offer to help her loose wait she doesn't want your help. She is the type of person who only drinks soda/juice and is constantly eating junk food, yet complains about her weight problem

When I found out that there was a small problem I was still calm and collected. It's no biggie I said. I suggest to my dad the he drops me off first and then drop her off, as I am actually getting paid and want to start off on the right foot. She protest. No biggie, we can drop you off by a bus and you might only be late a few minutes if at all. Apparently this was a problem because the bus did not take her right in front of her school and she did not want to walk.

Now I'm getting pissed. She has a fucking unlimited bus pass and is begging my dad to take her to her internship which is a smaller commute when compared to mine. At this point I know I was going to be late.

Long story short I end up reaching work 40 mind late due to a bunch of bullshit.

This job has a 6 month review for a pay raise. Now I'm here wondering if I will make the cut because of being late 40 minutes on my first fucking day. I was only late 1 time while I was in training by 2 minutes. I figured I can talk my way out of being late for 2 mins but how the hell can I explain being late for the better part of an hour on my first fucking day?

Now I feel like I have to bust my ass even more so to pass the 6 month review. Now I feel depressed.....Fuck."

The guy before me made an attempt with zipties, but people just cut them since they needed to move cables around more than they originally allowed.

I've been doing a paid internship at this location for a while now, I have basically 0 cable management experience outside of what went into building my desktop. They've ordered some velcro cable ties, and I was handed these yesterday: http://i.imgur.com/YrICUkA.jpg

This rack is typically used to build our servers before they get shipped out to customers, so servers move around a LOT. I'd like to do it well enough that it stays neat/easy to use, but I don't really know where to start. I'll have a period of about 4 hours where everything in the rack can be unplugged, after that I'll have to go through server by server and ask the various servicereps in charge of the various servers permission to turn them off.

Side note: is it safe to have the whole rack on one outlet? It seems wrong to me, but I don't know the average power consumption, they're usually just idling 99% of the time. There's also no rails on anything, nor are my coworkers likely to use them."

Some quick info:

* Currently in Texas panhandle
* ~2 years professional technical experience, including 2 internships
* 1.5 years in developing applications using VB.NET/VisualStudio, SQL/SSMS; generated reports using Telerik reporting software
* Interested in broadening my skill set using different technologies in an entry role (Java / mobile in particular), but very open to further developing current skills
* Coursework experience: Java, C, C++

I'm currently a software developer in the financial software industry, and I'm excited to move to the next phase of my career! Summarizing my experience at my current position, I am the main developer for the conversion of an in-house billing system from VB6 and MS Access to VB.NET and SQL Server. 

In my spare time, I like to play piano (Chopin anyone?), eat, workout, sing karaoke, and learn new things. Most recently, I started learning Android development. I also like to volunteer, which is a quality I look for in a company. My latest service was with Junior Achievement, where I was able to teach a lot of middle schoolers about finance basics and making positive life decisions. Fun stuff! 

I love to learn and hope to find an entry position where I can broaden my skills. I know that with my experience and passion, we'll be able to get the ball rolling with minimal time spent getting me up to speed. 

If you have any questions, job leads, or want more info, please let me know via PM!

I kinda felt like she stuck out like a sore thumb since she wasn't defined by any sort of culture other than libraries and puns, seemed markedly younger than the rest of the cast, i guess i figured she'd just vanish into the background or something and that Emily would sort of be the only intern that got promoted to main cast.

But when Claire came out to Marten I was pretty psyched because I figured this meant we'd get to know more about her, that we'd get to see an author who has touched on polyamoury, bdsm, genderqueer, etc without relying on stereotypes handle a trans character without making her seem like a token or something. (like,  it was cool to notice little details like the fact she hasn't had a laryngeal shave that i'd totally overlooked originally). I felt like her relationship with Marten felt a little forced, but chalked that up to my having been an ardent Doraten shipper who was still bummed about how they trainwrecked.

i think i first came to this subreddit when her and Marten first had sex, mostly because i was curious to see how people would react and was super excited to see how super excited everyone else was
(http://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/2uy9mx/2891_you_and_me/)

So what the hell happened? How did things go from hundreds of positive responses to so many of us wanting to throw our laptops out a window when we see a strip with Claire in it? Is it just her? Is it her + the changes in art and storytelling? Are we all just really pissed off that Jeph called this sub toxic? Has she just devolved as a character over time? Is it all of the above?

I ask mostly because I just went back to read the reactions to them getting together vs the reactions from last night and I was really surprised at how we as a group seem to have gone from ""team Claire"" to ""oh god not Claire"" pretty quickly.

30tsyz,3,2015-03-30,(20) Male struggling to come to terms with end of long relationship with emotional abuse,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30tsyz/20_male_struggling_to_come_to_terms_with_end_of/,"Hi Reddit, 

In late January my relationship with my best friend and my girlfriend since high school ended. It was going to end anyway in June, as she told me in August that we would break up in ten months, so to an extent I guess I should have seen this coming (again not realizing I didn't want that). 

She had been emotionally distant, had withheld affection, as I later learned she had been lying constantly, and generally had been ignoring me for months; we hadn't kissed in four months and she wouldn't see me over winter break. 

I found out that she had been cheating on me for eight months beforehand and immediately got into an open relationship with the guy once we broke up. I've been absolutely devastated since this all transpired. Our mutual friends have completely stonewalled me, so it feels like I've really lost three good friends, not just one. 

For a little background, I am a sophomore at a college I hate and have been totally isolated at; much of my free time I had devoted to her and as a result never really made friends or had the time to join clubs. Now I am alone, depressed and physically unhinged by all of this (I can't eat, sleep or focus). 

My finals are all in the coming weeks and I do not know what to do. I've talked to my parents and they have been supportive, but it has done nothing to help my mental state. How do I get over this? 

She was furious that I blocked her on social media and that I told her we couldn't be friends (this before I found out about the rampant cheating), and I am still not sure if I should contact her or not. It seems like she never realized that this breakup was not mutual and that it was very hurtful. This all comes with the loss of my dog Anna, who my family had for over ten years and with the anxiety of hearing back from internships as well as colleges I applied to for transfer. 

I feel like I am losing my mind and I really don't want to sink back into a deep depression. A few close friends have tried to help me, and to an extent it has worked, but it has not really fixed my broken heart. Any help would mean so much to me. Thank you. 

TL;DR; confused on how to move on in life after horrible breakup "

Dealing with some drama with one of my sisters-in-law lately and her skeevy, loser, pervert of a boyfriend which is causing stress. 

The place I do security at is pretty much all shut down this week so that job won't be giving me any stress this week like it has in the past few. My office assistant job is still **fricken awesome!!!!** and I am still on the hunt for a full time job.

I've registered for two classes for the summer session, Accounting 1 and Economics (turns out I *love* Accounting, much to my surprise.) and that will leave just two 2 credit classes I have to take my final semester (my executive assistant internship and Administrative Professional Development) and I'll take an Accounting 2 just for the fun of it. 

Since my last two semesters will only be part time that is why I'm looking for my first full time job ever because I might be able to actually have it work out. 

How are all you?"
30tuos,5,2015-03-30,How do I [24M] tell a friend of 10 years [25F] I have feelings for her,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30tuos/how_do_i_24m_tell_a_friend_of_10_years_25f_i_have/,"So here is the deal. I have this friend, we met in the 10th grade. We will call her Susan. So when I met her I was introduced to their ""clique"" group of about 5. At the time, Susan had just started a relationship with someone in the group, and I didn't want to get in the way if that. So I set my feelings aside, settled comfortably into the friend zone, and moved on. I dated someone else for a few years. Then Susan and her boyfriend went on and off for a bit. When they were off I was with someone, when they were on I was single. For the most part I buried and hid my feelings for her. Sometimes they slipped out. At homecoming my senior year, I accidentally called my girlfriend at the time 'Susan' right in front of Susan, and got punched in the stomach by my girlfriend. Bummer... Looking back, that's kinda funny.

Anyways, we slowly lost touch for the most part after highschool. We would send a 'hey how ya doin' text every couple of months and we saw each other a few times but that's it. 

A few months back, not knowing if she had a boyfriend or not, I asked her to dinner, you know, to catch up. She said yes. We sat at the bar of a nice restaurant and just talked about everything life entailed over the previous 3 or so years. It was great. We were there for about 4 hours just talking. About a half hour before we left I got up to go to the bathroom, came back, her boyfriend is in my seat. I didn't really care. ""It figures"" I thought to myself. She seemed a little irritated about it though. So we talked after that night and she told me the relationship was not going well, he didn't have time for her. We went to dinner a few weeks back and it was again, great. 

So earlier this week I text her:

M: ""hey how ya been?"" 

S: ""are you in town"" 

M: ""nope, not until easter""

S:""darn""

""I'm single""

""Oh well""

""Our family isn't doing anything for easter, so we are doing a friends thing if you wanted to come over""


So yeah my jaw dropped. I told her I have some family things I need to do on easter but would still like to come over.

I asked her if she was doing OK and told her to hang in there, she said ""thanks, I'm glad I have you"".

Then...

M: I'll be home Saturday night if you want to hang out.

S:*of course* I do, just text me.

So at first I think ""I'm totally in! She totally wants to be with me, who just comes out with "" I'm single"" like that?!? She has to have feelings for me right? But then I start thinking....maybe I'm just sooooo deep into the friend zone that she doesn't even consider me in the realm of possibility as a partner and didn't think twice about saying she is single, she does come to me with relationship problems after all :(.

I know! I'll just text her to see if she is eager to text back .

M: did you watch that game?! (She is an alumni of a school who just made it to the final four)

S: yeah

M: how was your weekend?

S:

Nothing. No reply. Nadda. Zilch.

So now I'm lost and have no clue where I stand.

She always shows affection towards me, always has. She used to get in fights with her boyfriend in highschool over the way her and I acted around each other. ""Its nothing"" she would tell them. But I would wonder....""is it?"" I just don't know what that affection means.... 

FWIW, I don't think I could ever just make a move and go in there and plant one on her, but I want to talk to her about it....

But, there is a huge Matzo Ball hanging out here....shortly after highschool I went to her birthday party, and met her cousin. We dated, for 2 years. We broke up, just didn't work, nothing mean or nasty. Honestly the best break up i ever went through. But that could...ahh....complicate things. They are not very close, but still....super weird.

So I ask you reddit, what do I do? I haven't slept in 3 nights.

-Shut up and move on?

-Risk eternal embarrassment and bring it up, ruining the friendship potentially?

Or apply for a passport, leave my whole life behind and move to Canada?

**tl;dr** I'm crazy about a girl and she might like me back, been friends for 10 years and at one point dated her cousin.
 
Edit: I'm finishing my degree at a university about 2 hours from where she lives, 5 classes and an internship before I'm done. Will likely do my internship back home.

If you meet all of the criteria that I request in this post, then there should be no reason why I don't respond to you.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a bit to see what I get. Thank you!"

- Financial Services
- International Tax
- Private company services
- State and Local tax
- Industry services
- State and local tax with a financial services focus

I have no idea what group I would like to be a part of, but the deciding factors for me would be workload, earning potential, and transferability to future jobs. If somebody could give me a quick rundown of each or maybe their experiences with any of them, it would be greatly appreciated!

I graduated back in December as a Finance major with a 3.7+ GPA at a lesser known university in Illinois. I haven't really gained any experience yet. I've only had a couple of interviews for some Financial Analyst intern positions but no offers. I'm currently in grad school to make up for the lost time, but even then it feels like a waste.

The only extracurricular activities that are sort of relevant were that I've been in the university's investment club, and a research project for the CFA Institute. I also was a student tutor for a year.

I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever find anything at this point. I'm up for looking into other options (as long as it's not sales), but could anyone give me some sort of ideas of where to look or how I could build up my experience in the meantime?

Any advice would be appreciated.

30ucg7,64,2015-03-30,II: The Emails,ArguablyCivilServant,talesfromthejob,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/30ucg7/ii_the_emails/,"

When I started working here, and by that I mean being paid actual money to show up instead of showing up randomly as an intern for a day or two, I started by doing emails. It wasn’t like I’d write emails to important people or change lives through my writing. What I would do, and still do, is read them. Every day. I’d log into Outlook under my official’s credentials, go through his inbox, and read the hundreds of unopened emails we get every day. All of the complaints sent in by constituents- all the requests for new legislation, asking for his support for this bill or that resolution, would be ignored by everyone. Everyone but me. It was my job to read them, file them away, and try to reply back in the voice and opinion of my state representative. 

There are a lot of these. They’re sent in by computers, really, so technically they don’t count as constituent emails per se, but the websites that send them are political organizations which people sign into and give permission to use their name when sending letters asking for support or opposition of laws in the state. So although they’re almost always the same, generic, walls of text that no one cares about, they’re always recognizable as inhuman. And we get these. Every day. 90% of the emails in the inbox every day are these. 

Sure, we get emails from constituents that are written out carefully, with time taken to make them personal and seemingly intimate. “I voted for you last cycle, and I did this year as well” some read. It’s nice to show support. Others simply say “I vote and I will remember your decision on this!”, warning the elected official, supposing he read them, of course, of the impending retribution he will face should he not abandon all previous positions in favor of this one single issue. 

Here's the fun part- I have to reply to these emails. The grand irony of this all is that every single email, from the Governor right down to the constituent farmer who lives in Bumshart, Nebrahoma (Credit: The Oatmeal), is addressed to my elected official. He will never see them. He hasn't opened his email in around three or more years. I think the one time he did was the day after it was given to him by the state after he won his first election. Since then he waves it off like it's a bag of toxic waste. 

Now when I reply to these emails, I have to not only form an opinion on behalf of my boss, but I now also have to *sound* like him. The trouble is how do you reply to an email in the voice of a condescending asshole without coming off as an asshole in the first place? 

There is a light at the end of this torturous tunnel. Thankfully, all of these constituent emails and issues are filed immediately into a tidy little folder never to be seen again, titled ""Handled"". Job done. 

So at the end of every day, I look at my pristine work inbox, now cleared, and realize, that many people today have contacted an elected official of the State gov't with hopes of getting their point across to the man they were told would listen to them and weigh their opinions when voting in the legislature. I regret the lie that I have to tell many people- in his name- that *I thank them* for contacting *my* office, and for giving me their opinion. ""I'll"" be sure to think of it when I'm voting next. 

Noticing my few hours are up in the day, I close Outlook, log off the state computer, turn it off, and head home. This process repeats every day. My chief of staff looks at the inbox the next day, pats me on the back and says ""good job in keeping it clean.""

30ugy7,1,2015-03-30,Should I do the 5 Year BS/MS in CS at my university?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30ugy7/should_i_do_the_5_year_bsms_in_cs_at_my_university/,"Hi everyone,

I currently attend a 2nd tier UC in California (think UC Davis/Irvine/Santa Barbara), majoring in Computer Engineering. We have a program here where a CE/CS major can do a 5 year BS/MS in Computer Science. I'm currently a 2nd year and to get into the 5 year program, I have to apply next Spring (of my junior year) where I'm evaluated based on my GPA, GRE, letters of recommendation, and essay. 


The average stats to get into our 5 year CS program is a ~3.5 GPA, 162/170 on quantitative (167/170 for those doing the 2 year MS in CS). My GPA is around a 3.1-3.2 currently, and I'm planning on studying for the GRE this quarter (working 40hrs/week at eBay this summer). I'll also need to start to push myself more to increase my GPA as close as possible to 3.5 by next Spring. 

Do you guys think a 5 year BS/MS in CS program would be worth it for me, or should I go into the industry? I've heard an MS will help me get a leg-up in jobs, starting salary, and lateral moves within the company I work at. Also, I've heard having only a BS can bottleneck your salary, particularly in the higher ranges?

 I'm eventually looking to get into management. In fact, I want to try to get a PM internship position next summer. Regardless of the MS in CS, I plan on getting an MBA after working in the industry for 4-6 years. I was thinking of maybe doing the 5 yr program in CS, and then MBA. If I don't get in, just go to industry and do MBA later. Thoughts? "
30uhff,3,2015-03-30,Getting into CS with Econ.,dj_ee3,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/30uhff/getting_into_cs_with_econ/,"Hi guys, 
Here is my story: I am playing with computers since elementary school. Building websites, trying to program, setting up servers and different kinds of hardware/software. When I went to High School I choose it specially to have a signature program with computers. 9-10 grade I did web design/development and loved it! 12 grade I was full time web intern at my HS.  I also did computer science 1 and AP Computer Science 11 &amp; 12 grade. I liked the CS but in the AP class my scores were low. Still I didn't give up went to community college and eventually transfered to CS major in my university, University of Maryland. Then something horrible happend. I attempted to take the exemption exam for intro to CS since I took it at HS, and I read a intro to Java book over the summer, I did poorly and didn't get the exemption. I also struggled a lot in my Calculus 2 class. I eventually got scared that maybe I am not smart enough to finish the CS program so after 2/3 weeks doing CS at UMD I switched my major to econ. I choose econ because I like it. Its easy &amp; fun for me so it seemed like the correct choice. 1 year I did econ not really thinking about CS, but then a friend from my home country told me that his university is uploading all of its CS lectures in youtube. I started watching and got hooked up to CS again. I did their intro to Javascript intro to php and intro to Java clases. I also started going to hackatons with people from my university, they said that they don't care about my major and I can join them so I decided to do it. Now I feel like I made a big mistake switching majors. I like econ, but my passion for computers and programming is bigger. The questions that I have are: If I stick to doing the university lectures online and build several projects do I have chances at securing a CS job with my econ degree? Also if I do well with econ, will schools consider me for masters programs in computer science. If you also have any other advice regarding what should I do, I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance!"

I hope this is the proper place to ask this type of question. I just need some quick guidance from someone who is experienced in dealing with employers/potential employers.

So about a month and a half ago I was contacted by a company that was interested in having me on board as an intern this coming summer. We chatted via email at first, they sent me some problems to solve (or rather see how I would approach them), and said that they were pleased with my responses. 

Afterward, we scheduled a phone interview and I think it went quite well. My contact there and I seemed to get along, and he seemed to be interested in what I had to say. At the end of the call, he asked if I could send himself and his boss a formal email outlining what I am interested in getting from an internship, which I completed promptly.

...That was about four weeks ago, and I still have not yet heard anything back from them. My contact there did tell me that they have been extremely busy, as they are a startup.

Since then I have been trying to be patient and await a formal email or phone call from someone at the company, however as it nears summertime, I'm growing increasingly worried that if I do not get accepted into their internship position, I will have nothing to go on for this summer (although I have been applying to other internships... though nobody out of the ~50 other places I've applied to have responded, or immediately rejected me). I'm also worried that if I get accepted, I will have minimal time to get all of my summer arrangements in order as I would have to re-locate (for the summer) to the city that the job is hosted in.

I emailed my contact last Monday, just politely asking what an acceptable time-frame would be for me to expect a response by. I have not yet heard back from him.

So, my question is -- would it be inappropriate of me to call him (since I do still have his number) to make sure that he received my email? How should I word the question as to not come off as an ass? 

Please and thank you!"

As a preface, everything I'm doing here is legitimate and I'm an intern for an IT firm.

So, I recently had to work with a user's Dell Latitude E6520 (running Win7 Professional) that had acquired the ""Verification of a KnownDLL failed"" BSOD. It was impossible to run the startup repair utility successfully, there was no system restore point available, all other bootup options failed, and I was ulitimately tasked with giving it a whack. My colleagues and I determined after much work that the OS was corrupt, so I copied all of the files over to an external HD and we did a clean install of Windows using a multi-OEM-compatible disc that we had on hand. Turned out beautifully. Transferred all of the files over to a just-in-case folder on the laptop and copied everything necessary to the desktop and documents. We packed it up and re-deployed it to the user (who is a state away).

Well, I made a bit of an oversight. I didn't grab the product keys for all of the software that was on there (which was really just Office and Adobe, but still important obv) when we did all of this and deployed the laptop. We did Jellybean the OS product key previously, at least, but it was the keys for everything else that I didn't get. Panic ensued. Luckily, I happened to have those files on the external HD still, so not all was lost yet. Literally. Thank god. I tried a few product key programs, though, and they turned up dry; no hives, no matter what targets I chose. After poring over many more articles, I came across an article talking about the ""tokens.dat"" file, and how it's a file that holds software product keys that Windows encrypts. And I even managed to find it. Hallelujah.

While the article that pointed out that file did get me one step closer, however, it did not actually specify the kind of program that could actually grab those keys, which brings me to my ultimate question: Does anyone know how I can convert that file into something usable? Or are there any suggestions to refine what's probably poor Jellybean/Keyfinder/ProduKey-usage on my part? Any help at all is extremely appreciated!

TL;DR: I need to pull product keys from files that I grabbed off of a broken hard drive and I don't know if it's time to give up or not."

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Basically there is a little asshole named Dalton who is going to do something bad, and he wants me to know he's going to do something bad. I'm not a cop anymore so my options are limited but I am getting more and more sure that this is serious. 

I finished up an early shift at Wal Mart today and since I knew it would be a couple of hours before I could brace Dalton himself I spent some time at the gym. Did some low rep/high weight sets (for example 3-4 reps at 240 on the bench press) hit the shower, composed myself.

I got in my truck, an Escalade I might lose in a couple months, and drove around until I saw Dalton walking down the sidewalk probably headed home from school. I rolled up on him and hopped out. 

Little motherfucker was grinning at me. He's always really made my spidey senses tingle ever since I busted him the first time years ago. Realized as I walked up I was saying The Lord's Prayer in my head over and over. 

""Hey there, officer,"" he said with a smile.

""Well hey there, Dalton,"" I said, although I'm worried my voice broke a little. Fucker was standing there wearing khakis and a pink polo shirt with a little whale on the pocket. Expensive back pack. Putty colored boat shoes. Crisp haircut. ""Gee, you sure look a lot different than last time I talked to you.""

""Yeah, well, everybody goes through a rebellious phase. When they're young. That's when you want to do it, right? Get in trouble when you're young, get it out of your system so your adulthood isn't full of failure and disgrace."" He chuckled. ""You look different too...last time I saw you weren't you wearing a cop costume?""

""A uniform, yeah."" Motherfucker.

""Riiight."" Bastard sighed sympathetically. ""Well, what can I help you with? I'm afraid my dad isn't hiring any new security guards, as far as I know.""

""Had a little chat with your little butt buddy Justin.""

Dalton grinned at me. He took out his iPhone and started playing with it absentmindedly. ""Yeah, he told me. Kid has a big mouth, tells some whoppers. Unlike me, I'm afraid he might spend his whole life in this sinkhole of a town. Can't imagine what *that* would be like.""

""Cut the crap, asshole"" I wanted to grab him around the neck but I didn't. I'd end up in jail. The state's attorney is one of his dad's golfing buddies. I stood there and clenched my fists. ""I know you're planning to do something bad and I'm not gonna let it happen.""

He shrugged. Kept playing with his phone. ""Justin is a dumb fag who tells dumb stories. That's all I'm saying.""

""How is Justin? You two still buddies? I thought snitches got stitches?""

He put the phone to his ear. I could hear ringing. ""Yes, hello police? This is Dalton Peabody...no no, Dalt Jr...yeah, Skip...yeah listen one of your ex officers is here right now bothering me. He's a big guy and I think he might be on some kind of drug like roid raging or something? Anyway he's starting to make me feel really weird....oh you will? Thanks!""

Little shitbird winked at me. ""Snitches get stitches,"" he said as an afterthought, ""but pawns get a pass. Sometimes pawns get promoted. That's a chess reference, you don't get it now but it might make sense in the fullness of time. Well, get along lil piggy, the real cops are on their way.""

I'd had enough. My hand instinctively went to where my pepper spray would have been. To be honest I'm lucky I *didn't* have any weapons on me or I'd be in jail right now. Little cocksucker was right though, I did have to get the fuck out of there. I walked back to my truck with all the dignity I could manage.

""Oh and officer?""

I shot him a look. 

""Don't you think all that 'our Father' bullshit is a little passe' in 2015, and a little desperate coming from someone so disgraced? Oh and don't bother getting in touch with me again, as my father says to interns he interviews 'I'll be the one getting back to you, real soon.' ""

I could hear sirens, they were in the distance but close enough it was definitely time to mosey. "
30v03t,1,2015-03-30,Need help with my job search (expecting graduation august 2015),AGENT___ORANGE,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/30v03t/need_help_with_my_job_search_expecting_graduation/,"Hey all.

I'm fairly new to this subreddit but these past couple weeks i've been lurking quite a bit in hopes of gaining some useful knowledge i could apply to my job search.

Some background info:
I'm currently a senior expected to graduate in August 2015 with a degree in accounting from a top 2 program. Unfortunately, I ran into some issues and my major gpa is sitting at a 2.84. However, I did have a summer internship at an international branch of KPMG.

My question is, what types of firms/companies should I be targeting? I'm kind of thinking about the job search like the college application process. Ex. having a couple safety schools, target schools, and reach schools. I'm not sure which firms fall into these categories though other than the fact that the BIG 4 and bigger public firms would definitely be a reach.

Any help would be appreciated."
30v2f2,1,2015-03-30,My (20 M) list of relationship issues with gf (19 F) - wondering if we could still work it out,yes285,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/30v2f2/my_20_m_list_of_relationship_issues_with_gf_19_f/,"This is going to be a long post. But it's basically what I'm going to go with when I have a talk with my girlfriend. I just want some feedback on possible wording, other stuff etc.

I've been thinking of breaking up with her, but I want to list the issues and try to have a reasoned discussion before ultimately making that decision. Perhaps I haven't given her a chance. We are both college students, me a Junior her a sophomore.

I do love this girl, but I feel the relationship going stale - here are my reasons - from most important to least important IMO.

1 We have different long-term goals

a. I plan on graduating next spring, and moving somewhere fun (maybe west coast, maybe Chicago, maybe NC, maybe NY, maybe where I am now), and have no idea where I’ll go. This summer I’m doing a very interesting internship about 3 hours away from where she’ll be. I will see her some weekends, but not every one. She plans on staying her, going to grad school for another 6-10 years to become a dentist.

b. End Result – I think that if we stay together we are just headed towards a long-distance relationship which I have always sworn myself against

2 She is always busy

a. She is in a harder major then me, is in sororities (one social/one professional), has a scholarship where she has to maintain a very high GPA, is involved with the group that does prospective student tours and has a large group of acquaintances that she always tries to see. A lot of times she has to wake up early on weekends too.

b. I am in a certainly easier major – I am majorly involved in one club on campus but that is it for the most part. I do have more free time. I have a good group of very close friends that are usually the same that I hang out with most nights.

c. Look, I completely understand why she is busy, that doesn’t mean I am necessarily OK with it.

d. End Result – We probably only see each other 1-3 times a week, and usually we only sleep together (not necessarily sex-involved) 0-1 times a week.

3 We never go on ‘fun’ dates

a. This was brought up by her early on in the relationship and I have worked on it a lot, however it still gets brought up. She complains that a lot of our dates are just ‘dinner’ and then we go home. Well yeah that’s what I can afford! But – she does love plays and I have taken her to multiple plays (of which I am not that entertained) and movies and what not, but to be fare it is rare and a lot of time I don’t put nearly enough effort into dates than I should.

b. But truth be told my most fun nights are staying in, drinking shitty alcohol or whatever, watching the room, laughing telling stories, playing beer pong. Like not only is that much much cheaper, I just enjoy it a lot more than she does. Also, going back to the earlier point a lot of times she is too busy to hang out with us

c. End Result – Resentment from both sides

4 Our Sex Life is Terrible

a. When we originally started dating our sex life was… OK. It was never great or anything. We have definitely fallen into a malaise on both sides. We probably have sex... maybe like 2-3 times a month, and it could be less at times. It just comes back to the fact that she’s always busy, so she’s tired, so when we sleepover we’ll just sleep

b. The thing is, is that I’ve kind of become comfortable with that and kind of just understood it as is. This is her first sexual relationship and I feel as though I am providing a bad example to her as to how a relationship’s sex life should be. I have hinted at things occasionally, but like she doesn’t shave down there, and that’s her choice I would never force her to do anything, but like I would enjoy it more if she did and I don’t feel comfortable doing oral without her shaving which leads to her not giving oral which leads to just bad sex when it even happens. Maybe I’m being too judgmental at times? Maybe I should push sex more?

c. End Result – Rare sex, and when it happens, not good sex

5 I’ve never been that friendly with her friends

a. Look, her friends are fine – nothing wrong with them – I can get along with them perfectly fine, but I’ll never be friends with them. They are sort of like ‘typical sorority’ types that gossip a lot and talk about girly stuff and all and that’s fine! Really no judgement. But my GF will complain to me that I’m not that social with her friends and I really don’t understand how I could be. I’ve always been polite, never mean, have tolerated them even when they are annoying, never complained, but she wants me to be like friendly with them and I don’t have that type of “preppiness” in me! I can only fake it for so long with that type.

b. Also, when we are alone, or with my friends, my GF is a lot more laid back, casual, kind of like I am – however she still is more preppy and whatnot than me and that’s fine that kind of helps me too, I don’t want to become too laid-back. However, when we are with her friends she becomes more like her friends. It’s making me think that maybe she’s sort of suppressing her real-life personality with me, im not sure.

c. End Result – I’ve never been that friendly with her friends, she resents me

6 She is alllwayyyss late

a. I know this is more of a pet-peeve than anything, but I’ve tried to work on it with her and its really never gotten better. I have learned to accept it, but she is the most late person I know. When I say ‘meet you at 7’ she arrives around 8. Sometimes she’ll say I’ll be over in 30 min around 9pm, then she’ll get to my house at 2:30 am. And it’s like what are we going to do then? We sleep, and then she usually has to wake up early and go home.

b. When I’m with her I see her do it to her friends as well. We’ll be arriving at a dinner place and a friend will call her from a place 15 min away and she’ll say “yeah I’ll be there in 30 min.” It’s like she doesn’t understand that dinner itself will take at minimum 45 min, then another 15 min to get there, and that is absolute best-case scenario. Like one of my biggest things is that I always try to arrive on time everywhere I go and it is annoying.

c. End Result – I get consistently mildly annoyed. I believe I could deal with it on its own if needed

7 She is a horrible texter/communicator

a. This by itself would be fine. I’m not the best texter myself. I have friends who are terrible at it, it’s understandable. But this, combined with her being busy, and her being late, leads to combination of incredible annoyance.

b. We have gone over 3-4 days with no communication at all, because when I text her I don’t expect a reply for at least 4-6 hours and sometimes not at all

c. Once again, she isn’t doing this maliciously, I’ve been with her – her friends will text her a question or something she’ll read it and then just put her phone away and just not respond.

d. End Result – We never have any sort of ‘text/call conversations’ and this combined with the lack of seeing each other leads to just little communication between both sides

Saying all of this, when she and I are together, we usually have a really fun time. She is the ‘perfect girl’ – smart, pretty, intelligent. I love having conversations with her about stuff she knows and I don’t. I love asking her questions. I love hanging out with her, laughing at similar things. I do really love her, I am just unsure if I am in love with her anymore as well.

Is this relationship salvageable? I plan on talking to her about this in a similar, systematic way, does that seem like a good idea? Is change possible?

**tl;dr;** compiled list of issues with relationship -- wondering if it is salvageable.

* Page 219 - CG asks for an overnight recess to prepare for cross of Jay. She says she only recieved 120 pages of Jay's statements 

* Page 220 - Judge scolds Urick for not having a witness ready to go when CG asks for a recess after dumping the discovery tapes on her so late ""I'm trying to get this case concluded within my vacation time and the jurors' vacation time and other scheduling"" 

**Overall Impression:**

This one may have had the worst redaction job yet.

Generally the defense didn't get much traction. CG tried to say Cathy was lying to McGillivary, or McGillivary was lying about what Cathy said regarding when Jay &amp; AS showed up at her apartment. It certainly didn't read like a good line of questioning.

The State was stronger, notwithstanding Jay's direct testimony leaves several question marks. For example:

 1. Jay says AS tells him he'll loan the car to Jay on the 12th. This is contradicted by AS on Serial who seems to come up with the idea in the morning of the 1/13 after giving Stephanie a present.

 2. Jay says he went to Cathy's to wait for AS to be done with track, but the cell pings put him at his house for the calls around 5pm. For this reason it seems much more likely that he collected the shovels at this time, in my opinion.

 3. Jay says AS picks up a shovel off the porch and makes a threat to snitch on Jay for dealing. In my mind this seems contrived, while Jay picking up the shovels while waiting for the post-track call seems much more likely.

 4. Jay says he didn't want to get his grandma in trouble. The grandma story was here, in trial, and it wasn't new from the Intercept interview.

 5. Jay uses the pronoun 'him' in apparent reference to Jen. It seems possible that he is referring to Mark.

 6. Jay says AS gave Stephanie a ride to Jay who had her car, after school. 2 days after 1/13 wasn't a school day - it must have been 1/19 or later.

CG pulled the plug on Jay's cross and Urick didn't have another witness lined up. CG was going to listen to recordings that were provided to her that day apparently, overnight, to prepare for cross examination of Jay.

The judge cracked wise a few times, asking CG to hurry so they'd finish this millennium, and an alternate juror asks if she can help the defense, which I read as a joke.

Let me know if there's anything else that you found interesting or funny, along with a page number. Thanks!

I have been lurking in this subreddit for a while, but there has not been a clear cut guideline of what kind of actions I should be taking to become a consultant. I know there is no one right answer to this, but there should be things that I can do to prepare my consulting career.

Besides joining recognized student clubs, doing extracurricular activities, getting high GPA, networking, internships, what should I be doing as an undergraduate business student?

I would love to be one of you guys on this subreddit one day. 
Thanks.

FYI, I will be Junior at UIUC this Fall majoring in Management with concentration on Entrepreneurship. "

I have 3 other roommates, so it is 2 people to a room. Me and my friend live in room A, while the other two live in room B. Room A has a balcony. 

Our landlord told us last week that he would be showing the apartment to some potential tenants for next year. Yesterday we received a message that he had seen evidence of drug use in room B. He told us that this was in violation of the lease, and threatened to call our parents (we're college students). 

I have smoked in the past, but have not smoked in the past 30 days due to upcoming drug tests for internships. My paraphernalia is at a friends place, and I have no weed in the room. Before moving in, all 4 of us decided that if someone wanted to smoke, they should be doing it on the balcony. 

My roommate in room B smokes as well, and leaves his bong/grinder/weed out in plain view. We have told him multiple times to hide it, but he continues to do this. This is what my landlord found. In addition to this, he continually smokes weed in the bathroom, even though we have told him to smoke on the balcony. My other roommate in room B is an athlete, and has never smoked weed in his life. 

Our landlord hasn't mentioned eviction, but what can I expect? Can me and my roommate be held responsible? Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR: Landlord found drug paraphernalia in my apartment. Not mine, and it was in another room. "

Advice much appreciated",potprogrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30vjuv/looking_to_cut_and_run_after_8_months_on_the_job/,"I feel like this is a pretty common story in this industry, but it's a bit unique, since I have a certain location in mind that I'd like to find a job at. 

Basically, I switched majors to CS in college, worked my tail off to catch up and become reasonably competent by the time internship season began, and landed an internship at this company. Great! After the internship, they extended me a hard offer with a 30 day deadline to accept. I really wanted to shop around after gaining that valuable internship experience, but it would have been foolish to turn down my only offer, so I accept. 

Fast forward to now: I've been working about 8 months and just want to leave. The pay is decent for the Midwest, but I hear horror stories about how terrible raises are at this company, and it's clear that it isn't in my best interest to become a ""lifer"" or stay more than 1-2 years at this company. Management is not that great- they don't value their employees and let new engineers languish working on borderline pointless grunt work. It's one of those ""churn and burn"" companies that rely on getting a ton of people fresh out of college and don't value experienced employees whatsoever. 

But mainly, I want to get out of the Midwest. I have my heart set on Colorado- I've visited several times, my fiance loves it, and luckily there is a very dynamic software job market in the Boulder/Broomfield/Denver area. I accepted my current job simply because I needed a job after college- I really don't like the city that this company is based in.

My main questions:

1. What should I keep in mind about being discreet during this job hunt? I certainly don't want a recruiter contacting my current company and tipping someone off
2. Any tips for hunting for jobs in a different city? Denver is a pretty long drive from where I am, so I would probably need to fly there
3. Any job hunt suggestions in general for that 2nd job after college? It's been less than a year since I graduated
4. Any feedback on Boulder and Denver specifically?

Thanks."

I'm looking for a laptop suitable to college. I had a MacbookPro Retina for three years and it crashed last semester, I now use a chromebook (becasue it was cheap and easy) and love it.

I'm now looking at summer internships and possibly needing a more substantial laptop. I don't need it immediately, and after the dissapointing ROI of my Retina ($2000+ for 3 years), I want something with a little durability. I also have a chromebook for day to day use in class, so it wont be quite so actively used.

The ideal game I want to play is Dark Souls II close to full settings.. That level is about right, and hopefully a comp that can play DSII will be good for a decently specked game for a few years.

My budget is around $700. I could go for more for higher quality, by nothing above $900. At the same time, I would like something cheaper, obviously.

Thanks in Advance!"

30vs89,33,2015-03-30,Mom threatening to disown me if I don't break up with my boyfriend of 8 months.. help,ej14097,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/30vs89/mom_threatening_to_disown_me_if_i_dont_break_up/,"This is my first post here, and I'm pretty nervous about making my story public like this, but I didn't know who else to turn to.

I was born in South Korea but moved to the US when I was 10. Yes, I did spend the first 10 years of my life in Korea, but I mostly identify myself as American because I did most of my growing up in this country.

This story starts when I was merely 16. I got my first boyfriend then, and my mom disapproved so much that she threatened to disown me/not support me in any way (mostly financially) if I didn't break up with him. The boyfriend eventually got fed up with it and broke it off. Although I was only 16, that was my first love, and I just couldn't help but think that I got my heart broken for the first time not because of something I did, but because of something my mom did.

Flash forward, and now I'm 22. I go to a decent state university, my GPA is 3.9 with a double major, have a paid internship, and volunteer at a local hospital. I used to live on campus the first 2 years of university, but my mom missed me too much that she decided to move to where I was to live with me. Although I wanted to enjoy the uni life, I'm not much of a drinker or anything, and I thought it wouldn't be so bad to have her there and have home cooked meals every day. My mom admitted that I never made her worry about anything and that she was so grateful. We were like best friends; I told her everything about my life, and she told me everything.

Trouble started 8 months ago when I met this great guy that I absolutely loved from the very first moment. Fortunately he felt the same, and we started dating shortly after. However, I could not quite tell my mom, fearing that the same thing that happened with my first boyfriend would happen again. I kept it a secret and inevitably lied to her several times about hanging out with him.

2 months ago, I decided to finally tell her, and she did not take it well. Her main reasons were that he was too short (5'5'') and that his family was not rich. From then on, I got really defensive when the subject came up, because it seemed like she only had negative things to say about him. For example, she would say that the way his eyebrows were shaped meant that he wasn't a good listener, and that I would be frustrated for the rest of my life. Another was involving some drama with a third person, who had talked behind my back; my current boyfriend had told me about the rumors the third person was spreading, and I was able to confront him and resolve the situation. However, from this story my mom believes that my boyfriend has a big mouth, and that that is not something a guy should do. It did not matter if I mentioned any good things about him; she brushed it off saying I do not have much experience in life and therefore do not know what I'm talking about.

This tension has been there for the past 2 months, and it kinda blew up 2 days ago when she found out that I have been lying about hanging out with him. She told me to stop seeing him or she would not support me financially anymore. She confiscated my phone so I would not be able to communicate with him anymore, and my wallet so I could not spend any money buying food with him or taking the bus to school. She almost confiscated my laptop too, but I told her that I needed it for school, and she let me keep it.

Just now, she found out that I was talking to him through Facebook and told me to deactivate it. I thought it was ridiculous how much she was trying to control my life. When I refused to do so, she said she would confiscate my laptop as well, though I need it desperately for school work. When I told her so, she said she would not allow me to go to school either; if I leave for school tomorrow, I would not be allowed to come back home. I was planning on living on campus next year since she finally decided to go back to Korea, but now she is saying that I would not be allowed to go back to school next semester either if I do not break up with him, and to cancel the housing application that I already paid for. When I refused to do so, she threatened me that she would go to school herself and embarrass me publicly so I would not be able to go to school anymore.

I know she can be so ridiculous sometimes, but I'm just not sure what to do in this case. I really love him so much, and I cannot imagine my life without him. At the same time, family always comes first, and I do need my parents' help financially (Dad is taking mom's side). However, if I were to give in and break up with him, I feel that she might think she could control my life, so I am trying to stand up for myself. She is giving me a series of ultimatums, and it's driving me crazy. I just do not know how this could be solved except by me breaking up with him; it seems like I will never get her approval. What do I do?

tl;dr Asian mom not allowing me to go back to school or support me financially if I don't break up with my boyfriend. What do I do?

EDIT/UPDATE: Thank you so much for all your encouraging words and kind advice. I did not realize this many people would actually take the time to read this long post and care about me. I did not back down; I stood my ground, just like a lot of you have told me to. I told my mom that I did not want to lie to her any longer, and that I am going to keep seeing him. Although she told me that she still did not approve of the relationship, she said she would let me choose what to do with my life. Maybe someday I'll regret not listening to her, but for now she has accepted my choice and that is all I can ask for. I'm glad I could end this post with a happy note! Again, thank you so much for your words! I could not have gotten through this without all of you."
30vv5b,1,2015-03-30,"Wisdom of a post-graduation travel loan if I'm in a good-potential, low-cash situation",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30vv5b/wisdom_of_a_postgraduation_travel_loan_if_im_in_a/,"I'm graduating from college this May.  I already have a job lined up (starting in mid-June) making a bit north of $100k.

I was on full financial aid at a private school, so I have no student loans.  I'm living on my summer internship income, but that will just barely get me to the end of the year.  After May expenses, I'll have &lt;$1k to my name.  I have two rewards credit cards that I pay off every month, and my credit score is ~720.

Slight twist where I'm subletting in a lower expense area my first three months, so I'll have a chance to save up for security deposit and initial costs for NYC rent, which is where I'll be living after that.

I have never travelled internationally, and I'd really love to join some friends going Europe for about three weeks right after graduation.  It'll be a pretty budget-conscious backpacking affair, but in expensive cities (London, Amsterdam, Paris, etc.) so I think a reasonably safe estimate would be $1500 for flights and $2500 for everything else.

Clearly though, that's $4000 I don't have right now.

**Would it be a bad idea to take out a personal loan to do this trip?**  I think I would be able to repay in ~6 months max, so I wouldn't end up paying much interest on it.  However, I just have an aversion to debt, and my gut is that it's always a bad idea, even though it seems pretty reasonable in this case.

Through Upstart (any thoughts on them?)  I can get a $5k personal loan at 7.99% APR for 36 months.  From my research, that looks pretty good, but I'd want confirmation of that.  I also confirmed that they have no penalties for paying it off early, which is obviously what I plan to do.

Thanks for your advice!"
30vwlf,47,2015-03-30,II: The Emails,ArguablyCivilServant,talesfromtheoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/30vwlf/ii_the_emails/,"When I started working here, and by that I mean being paid actual money to show up instead of showing up randomly as an intern for a day or two, I started by doing emails. It wasn’t like I’d write emails to important people or change lives through my writing. What I would do, and still do, is read them. Every day. I’d log into Outlook under my official’s credentials, go through his inbox, and read the hundreds of unopened emails we get every day. All of the complaints sent in by constituents- all the requests for new legislation, asking for his support for this bill or that resolution, would be ignored by everyone. Everyone but me. It was my job to read them, file them away, and try to reply back in the voice and opinion of my state representative. 

There are a lot of these. They’re sent in by computers, really, so technically they don’t count as constituent emails per se, but the websites that send them are political organizations which people sign into and give permission to use their name when sending letters asking for support or opposition of laws in the state. So although they’re almost always the same, generic, walls of text that no one cares about, they’re always recognizable as inhuman. And we get these. Every day. 90% of the emails in the inbox every day are these. 

Sure, we get emails from constituents that are written out carefully, with time taken to make them personal and seemingly intimate. “I voted for you last cycle, and I did this year as well” some read. It’s nice to show support. Others simply say “I vote and I will remember your decision on this!”, warning the elected official, supposing he read them, of course, of the impending retribution he will face should he not abandon all previous positions in favor of this one single issue. 

Here's the fun part- I have to reply to these emails. The grand irony of this all is that every single email, from the Governor right down to the constituent farmer who lives in Bumshart, Nebrahoma (Credit: The Oatmeal), is addressed to my elected official. He will never see them. He hasn't opened his email in around three or more years. I think the one time he did was the day after it was given to him by the state after he won his first election. Since then he waves it off like it's a bag of toxic waste. 

Now when I reply to these emails, I have to not only form an opinion on behalf of my boss, but I now also have to *sound* like him. The trouble is how do you reply to an email in the voice of a condescending asshole without coming off as an asshole in the first place? 

There is a light at the end of this torturous tunnel. Thankfully, all of these constituent emails and issues are filed immediately into a tidy little folder never to be seen again, titled ""Handled"". Job done. 

So at the end of every day, I look at my pristine work inbox, now cleared, and realize, that many people today have contacted an elected official of the State gov't with hopes of getting their point across to the man they were told would listen to them and weigh their opinions when voting in the legislature. I regret the lie that I have to tell many people- in his name- that *I thank them* for contacting *my* office, and for giving me their opinion. ""I'll"" be sure to think of it when I'm voting next. 

Noticing my few hours are up in the day, I close Outlook, log off the state computer, turn it off, and head home. This process repeats every day. My chief of staff looks at the inbox the next day, pats me on the back and says ""good job in keeping it clean.""

**Tl;dr**: Teamwork, and communication prevails! A pretty good ending to a total shitfest.

-------

For the sake of continuity, I will continue to use the character references I did in the past, but in retrospect, they're pretty dumb. Also, I wrote a *lot*. This is a narrative of what went down over the course of six months, so if you enjoy gigantic walls of text, you're in for a treat.

------
Character references:

* **Gohan**: My significant other of ~~3~~ 4 years 
* **Chichi**: Gohan's mother
* **Vegeta**: Gohan's brother

------

Hey r/relationships, it's been about six months since all the stuff from the first post went down. A lot has happened on my side of things, as well as Gohan's.

I wrote the first two posts with Gohan's approval, and I had him read them to make sure they were fair before they were submitted. The reception of both were not surprising, but I would be lying if I said Gohan was happy when he read through the comments. However, the second post gave Gohan the confidence to stand up for me, and stand up he did for the next few days.

Meanwhile, I spent those few days reeling from all sorts of emotions. Despite the support I received from the community, from Gohan, and from my friends, I was upset and worried, but I told myself that the situation was out of my hands now and that the most I could do now is be supportive, and see what unfolds.

At first, Gohan relayed messages to me about what was happening on his side. He had limited options in communicating with me, since Chichi spent most of the day screaming at him, but during those times, he expressed how stressed and conflicted he was on what he should do. 

I did my best to be as supportive as I could, and helped him talk through things so he could be able to make a decision without too much of my influence. However, my patience began to dwindle, as did my confidence. Aside from those two things, Gohan didn't really talk much about his actions, and I am ashamed to say that I was doubtful that he did anything aside from just taking the hits. 

In my mind, it made sense. Near the beginning, Gohan did hide our relationship from Chichi, and even lied about us still being together at one point. As well, the way Gohan described situations involving Chichi throughout his life painted a picture in my mind that he just sat there and let her get her way.

At the end of those few days, I wasn't able to get in touch with Gohan. In the morning, I sent him a few messages, and his replies made it sound like things were getting worse. Then, there was silence. I couldn't get in touch with him. No replies, no phone calls, no online activity from him whatsoever. I got anxious, and gradually became more and more worried about what could have happened. 

In my perspective, anything could have happened at that point. Maybe Chichi finally broke Gohan down, maybe she kicked him out, maybe he ran away, maybe some physical might have happened. It drove me nuts.

Then way late at night, he called me. He sounded exhausted, but he told me what happened. Chichi and Gohan had a major yelling match, that ultimately ended with her threatening to never talk to him again unless he apologized. When I asked him if he apologized, he said that for the sake keeping peace until he left for his internship, he did. 

I never knew the struggles and the amount of fighting he did for me, so with the picture I painted in my mind in tandem with what he described, I came to the conclusion that he never fought for me at all. I was absolutely furious. I started flipping out at him, and demanded why he did that, and how disappointed I was. Gohan, emotionally drained, chose to end the conversation early, and went to bed.

I spent the rest of that night going back and forth between crying, and raging. That was the last straw for me. I was done. I felt disrespected, and felt that the entire relationship was for naught. I was really close to ending the relationship right then and there in the worst way possible, through text. 

However, by some stroke of luck, I chose to vent to two of my best friends before I clicked send. Both initially reacted differently to the situation, but ultimately gave me the same advice: ""Stay with Gohan"". 

Mind you, before they became my best friends, they were Gohan's childhood/close-ish friends. Thus, they had a pretty good understanding about us individually, and as a couple. 

At the end of night, I was talked down from breaking up with Gohan, but instead to empathize with him more and try to feel what it is like in his shoes. Thankfully, that worked and with some tea, and some nice relaxing music, I pulled myself together.

The next day, I spoke with him, and told him everything. He was understandably upset at me, but we worked through it and miraculously survived until he left for his internship.

-------

At some point between then and the internship, Chichi had promised to not intrude into his personal life anymore, and to only talk about me when he himself brought the topic up. As well, she promised to be less overbearing, and contact him on a more predictable basis. That was a pleasant surprise for all of us, but I still didn't trust her to uphold it for very long.

While Gohan was working abroad for his internship, I was at school, so I was sufficiently distracted enough to not worry much about things. I still saw my counselor on a regular basis, and with all the support I had, I honestly didn't really think too much about it.

While that was relatively resolved for the time being, another unfortunate event popped up for me later in the fall. Halfway through October, I was told that my mother was diagnosed with terminal stage lung and lymph cancer, and that she only had a few months left. That pretty much ruined the rest of my semester, and I went through that downward emotional spiral again. Thankfully, I was quick to start the paperwork for accommodation for my courses, and left the term relatively unscathed grades-wise.

--------

Fast forward to the beginning of the current semester. Gohan returns to school, and for the most part, Chichi surprisingly kept most of her promise. She never brought up the situation, nor did she ask much about us aside from how both of us were doing (""I'm/we're/she's fine""). Gohan and I talked a lot about what had happened, and eventually, it came to light that he wasn't being that passive at all. Once I learned about how hard he fought for us as a couple, and how much he stood up for me, I apologized profusely, and we hugged it out. That picture I painted in my head has disappeared, and I feel really confident about the two of us, and relaxed about what may happen in the future.

Heeding the advice of my counselor, I chose to spend this semester taking a break to allow myself to see my mother as often as possible, and to save my GPA from further harm. Despite the odds, my mother opted for chemotherapy and ultimately, it has been working. The tumors have reduced in size, and I'm actually starting to feel a bit hopeful about how much time she has left.

As well, things have also been going down a surprisingly good path with Chichi. Initially, I made the decision to only open up the possibility of speaking to her after seeing how she reacts to the progress in our relationship (e.g. moving in together, engagement, etc). Vegeta gave Chichi a book about emotion management, and she was really receptive to it. 

Throughout the term, she has expressed to Gohan about how ashamed and embarrassed she was about how she reacted, however a week ago, she apologized about her behaviour (none of that ""I'm sorry, but..."" BS, an actual apology). 

Now, I'm still not entirely open to speaking to her immediately, to Gohan's slight dismay, but I adjusted my decision to facilitate the process faster. Because of the way Gohan and his siblings run their relationship with their parents, they tend to leave a lot of details out of their private lives. Similarly, Chichi actually doesn't know much about us, nor much about how dating works in general. She probably thinks that as soon as she leaves her son unsupervised with regards to love, he'd end up making extremely foolish mistakes and ruin his life.

So, I told Gohan that if he wanted me to warm up to the idea of me speaking with her much sooner, he'd need to have a heart to heart with her and tell her straight up about the details of our relationship, and direction that it could be going. I personally did this with my mother at the beginning of our relationship (including the dreaded sex talk) and continued to keep her up to date, so she trusts me 100% in all that I do, and I *want* to believe that it might work out similarly on his end. I don't think this talk will happen immediately, or all at once, but we'll see how things go.

With regards to how we're doing as a couple, things have gone back to the way they were before, if not better. I think this hurdle has brought us closer and stronger together, and I know for certain that my worries about history repeating itself will not happen, definitely not on my watch.

Thanks for reading!

Speech by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the Fifth Asian-Pacific Congress of Cardiology Delegates Dinner at Shangri-La Hotel

(13 October 1972)

Mr. Chairman, Professor Charles Toh , Baron Professor Lequime , Sir Kempson Maddox , Distinguished Specialists, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am overawed to find myself in the presence of so many eminent heart specialists. It’s a daunting prospect to have to talk to some 500 people who, even as I speak, will run their professional eye up and down me, checking my age against my weight, height, the amount of alcohol I may be showing, either on my countenance or lack of crispness in my speech.

The reason I am here, of course, is that your Chairman gives me an annual check-up to see whether the old ticker is degenerating faster than it should. Every year, we go through the routine: electrocardiogram (ECG) lying down; ECG sitting up; ECG, after going up and down steps at a certain speed for several minutes; ECG to discover how quickly the pattern returns to normal after this exercise. Each time I leave a little encouraged. He knows I am suspicious. So he never tells me that all is well. His is the subtle approach—a quiet nod, and a hum of satisfaction as he runs through the stream of paper graphing my heart-beat, and the very audible asides to my general physician about an athlete’s heart. It gladdens mine. He knows that I read up all the medical articles in magazines ostensibly meant for more than just the average layman. He knows I cut out saturated fat— lean meat, preferably beef, only selected parts of mutton and pork, and that only occasionally. Even in vegetable oils, some are to be avoided like coconut, which is saturated.

Yet despite all this hotch-potch collection of dos and don’ts from articles and tips from friends like Professor Monteiro, I had all this while laboured under a grave misconception—that the heart should never be strained, that as one gets older one should be careful not to push the ticker too hard. So violent exercises like badminton and squash are to be eschewed. More leisurely ones unlikely to induce cardiac failure like golf or swimming are for me.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew joined then United States Vice-President Mr Spiro Agnew (right) for a game of golf at the Bukit Golf Course back in 1971. (Photo courtesy of SPH)

Then one day I was playing golf with a surgeon friend. He had read up the latest on aerobics. He said the heart should be pushed to its uttermost limits to dilate all the arteries throughout the body and in the heart itself, and to increase the pulse rate to its maximum, for as long as possible. It will improve heart muscle tone, and after a few weeks, the lethargic feeling will go. I asked him if he had tried it out himself. Well, he said, running on the spot for him, bringing his knees as high up to his chest as possible, that was difficult because he was well in his 50s. So he walked on the spot. But he assured me that he had got quite a few friends who had complained of feeling lethargic and slothful to run on the spot, more and more minutes each day, and now they are almost bursting in song with a spring in their steps. None have dropped down dead. I asked him whether they were his friends or his guinea-pigs. He countered that it was the results of experiments by a Canadian heart specialist. He recounted a case of a Canadian pilot who was invalided because of heart problems. After one year of aerobics he had his pilot’s licence and status restored.

This sounded convincing. So I tried it, but cautiously. I walked on the spot. Nothing happened. So I began to run, but gently, on the spot. Still no ill-effects. So I increased it day by day. Then one day after a round of golf, I ran for five minutes. Before that I got my surgeon to take my pulse rate. He said it was normal, 70 plus. After five minutes ‘Marvellous, 140’. After three to four minutes, back to 70 plus. Marvellous! Young man’s heart was his verdict.

If only I had known earlier, I would have been younger at heart all these past years!

My belief: life is better short, healthy and full than long, unhealthy and dismal. We all have to die. I hope mine will be painless. As de Gaulle said, ‘Never fear, even de Gaulle must die’, and he did. And how lucky—heart failure during sleep.

Of course, it is preferable to die at home in one’s bed—not in a motel. Just think of the embarrassment to one’s children, all the gossip that the extra excitement of unaccustomed company caused a defective heart to falter.

When I was a young man, I considered the various professions that might be satisfying and fulfilling. I ruled out medicine. It was too noble. The oath of Hippocrates—to keep alive a patient as long as possible.

Sometimes, as I cast my mind back to my teenage years, I wonder, perhaps, whether I should not have been a doctor. Never mind the nobility. It’s a marvellous profession, the Hippocratic oath: everything should be done to keep the patient alive. Patients are kept alive longer with tremendous leaps in knowledge, breakthroughs in both medication and surgery. And, of course, it creates more demands for services of doctors. Like the car, so the body. When the carburettor gives way—repair or change it. When the piston rings wear out—change them. When the pistons get too small for the cylinder bore—grind-bore the engine block and put bigger pistons. If the piston block cracks, put in a new piston block. Better still, take the whole engine out and put a brand new one. Then door-hinges give way—change hinges, if necessary, change doors. Constantly repaint and retouch. With every passing year, it becomes more expensive to keep the car going. So beyond a certain point—I think the third year, it becomes more economical to sell the car and replace it. Now in America, the economics have been worked out one stage further: don’t buy a car, lease it for two years.

If only one could do that with life! There is no point in owning a decrepit body with daily deterioration making it ever more expensive to stay alive. But you cannot change the human body. So it is good for doctors. Your heart timing is wrong, they put in a timing device. Then something else like the kidney gives way, in which case a kidney machine will keep the patient alive for years and years. But for what purpose?

Then transplants, just like spare-parts in cars, and cortisones to prevent rejection of transplants, and sterile conditions to avoid infection which with cortisones will be hard to detect. It is a marvellous never-ending process. Each discovery prolongs life and moves the degenerative failure to some other part of the body.

The medical profession is the biggest and best trade union of all unions. It is a closed shop in all countries, and in some countries, even when you cross state boundaries, they make you become an intern or a houseman for many years before you are allowed to practise on your own. Every breakthrough in medical science prolonging life creates more patients, as degenerative failures take place in some other part of the human physiology. And now geriatrics and gerontology have become respectable, but not yet lucrative branches of medicine because pensioners get poorer with galloping inflation in so many Western countries.

So knowing this, the medical profession now promise, or hold out the prospect, not only of prolonging life but of prolonging youth. This is an entirely different proposition. That means the man or the woman can work, and make the money to pay his medical bills, which his pension cannot afford him to do.

Tonight, I have a unique occasion of some 500 heart specialists as a captive audience. Can I say that the kindest thing you can do for me—if ever I have a partial cardiac failure or a stroke—is to let me die as painlessly as possible. Nothing is more pitiful than to have stroke after stroke after stroke, with each one, both physical movement and intellectual capacity reduced until one becomes a vegetable.

One evening at dinner last year, I had a morbid discussion over coffee. My guest had coffee and liqueur. I stuck to my wine. We discussed the right to die—euthanasia. He was a very high-powered American executive. He had thought the whole question through. He said, ‘But after the first stroke and when the time has come to make the decision, one finds life is still sweet. And you will not make the request to die’. I said, ‘In that case, make the request before the event’. He said, ‘You will withdraw it when the event occurs, or you may not be in fit mental condition to exercise your judgement’. I countered, ‘In that case, let the decision be taken by a close relative or a friend’. He said, ‘A close relative? God forbid, he is after your money! He may believe he is in your will’. I said, ‘Then a friend’. He says, “He may be such a good friend that he believes, despite the fact that you are only 30% of what you were, it is still worth giving you that 30% and he will keep you alive’.

There will never be a final solution to the problem of life and death, other than death itself. And whether it is philosophy or logic or medicine or morality or law, we are all human beings with human imperfections, both as individuals and as societies. And Singapore is an imperfect society. But I hope, despite all the imperfections, you have found some pleasure in having come here."

Again. You should say no, but you know you can't, even if you wanted to. It just feels too amazing, even if you hate yourself afterwards.

let's rewind a little bit. You were living the perfect life, or so you thought. Married, Kids, good job it couldn't have gotten better, but.. at the same time, maybe the last few months or so thigns started happening, the sex is uneventful, if happening at all, but still life was good. But then a wrench got thrown into the mixture. 

that wrench would be me. the saucy little minx who has turned your life around to be amazing, but at the same time, far from. 

The next few questions are, who are we? Am i the student in your class? the shy girl who seems invisible? or the popular out going girl? perhaps the principal and the goth/rebel girl?

perhaps you're my coach. Perhaps you're the town sherrif and I'm the daughter of someone influential/rich in town, or the town drunk's daughter? 

Maybe you're the mayor having an affair with an intern? Perhaps the neighbor who succumbed to the wily temptress nextdoor. Or the boss's daughter you could loose your job for. 

Those are just some of my basic ideas, if you have any that you find fun, or would like to suggest, let me know I'm open to any ideas :P

I'm open to all sorts of kinks/fetishes, likes and so on, im just not that overly into bdsm, i dont mind it minorly. I do enjoy my character ending up pregnant though, ive got a bit of a cum fetish :P

I there are any celebs, porn stars, models, jailbaitish etc youd like me to look like/play as, let me know, send a name or link or whatever"
30wi0h,1,2015-03-31,How do I negotiate pay for an internship?,kal11polis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30wi0h/how_do_i_negotiate_pay_for_an_internship/,"Might be kinda late, but right now I have two offers for summer internships in San Francisco, and I need some help negotiating them. I've searched this subreddit, but it seems like most of the advice is geared towards full-timers with actual leverage. 

Company A is a small startup that's raising its Series A round right now. They're offering me $7500/month. 

Company B is a mid-sized startup that's currently growing really quickly, and already has a decent amount of VC money backing them. I don't know exactly how much they'll be offering me, other than the fact that it'll probably be considerably lower than that.

Neither company covers housing, but they both have the requisite Silicon Valley startup benefits, like catered lunch, ping-pong tables, etc.

For a few reasons, I'd rather work at Company B. Is there a reliable way to go about negotiating with them, though? 

Thanks!"

30wq0i,1,2015-03-31,3/30/15,UnrelentingWobbuffet,MyDayMyThoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyDayMyThoughts/comments/30wq0i/33015/,"Friends, I think I'm starting to go crazy. I believe that I'm developing a psychosis of some sort; a lot of the time I catch myself thinking things that are a complete disconnect from reality, my sleep patterns are completely messed up, I have no motivation to do anything, and I'm just thinking a lot of messed up shit.

I don't really want to say it but I said I'd treat this as an open book, so here it is. Had thoughts of suicide flickering through my mind again today. Just so tired of everything, and I feel trapped again. It seems like I have to be part of the rat race, the scramble to get internships and jobs and be successful and so on so forth. I don't know what I want to do. I feel lost and alone, and I feel like I'm the only one who really feels like this. I mean, that can't be true, I'm not some special snowflake, but it seems I can't really find anyone who resonates with me.

I have serious trust issues now. I'm paranoid that stuff is going on behind my back that I don't know about, and I don't even know where my self-esteem is anymore. I've been trying to delude myself into thinking that this hasn't been an issue, that they're just random thoughts and not really characteristic of my thoughts, but it seems like they've spread like a cancer and now I'm just tense and scared and afraid and alone all the time.

I can't even go to sleep because of the dreams. I took a nap today, and she came back. And my mind twisted up a whole lot of things and I'm really scared of what I saw in there, and I don't want to close my eyes because I don't want to go back to that place. I'm sitting here with my eyelids heavy and my entire body is tensed up because I'm exhausted but I can't get any rest because whenever I do I lose a bit more sanity.

My friends tell me just not to think about it, to stay busy and do other stuff and keep my mind off it. A lot of my mind is consumed by it and I just don't want to think or function anymore, I miss the times when I was normal and smart and I didn't have to reserve a certain amount of my processing power to torture myself every waking moment and even in my dreams.

I'm planning on going to see a counselor or psychiatrist soon I think. I can't go on like this much longer, I know it's just a downward slide and I can't afford that right now. God, this was such a mistake. So many mistakes and I don't want to clean them up anymore and maybe I'll just let them fall to the floor and start over again with an empty board. Just let all the pieces go.

I'm trying to help myself but in another form of a twisted joke it seems I can't even do that anymore. You'd figure it's kind of paradoxical, the lower you go the easier it should be to help but it doesn't really work like that, I just keep going lower and lower and trying to reach up but there's nothing to grab hold of.

I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough, I'm sorry that I'm not the person who I'm supposed to be. I did my best. I won't do anything stupid, I'll do my best to find help before going that far because that's something you can't really turn back from but it's looking more and more tempting by the second.

I hope my parents aren't reading this; if you guys are, please don't worry about me. Everybody did what they could the best way they knew how, and we've said and done things we don't mean. Don't blame yourselves. I'm only 18 years old and I have so much that you guys have provided for me and I'm already giving up on it all. I just want to stop feeling that tension in my shoulders for a bit.

Thanks for everything that all of you have done for me. I really appreciate it, and I'm sorry if I've hurt any of you. I didn't mean to, and I hope you can forgive me for my weaknesses."
30wr46,3,2015-03-31,"Pay deduction after tax, is this correct?",Retterkl,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/30wr46/pay_deduction_after_tax_is_this_correct/,"Firstly apologies if this is going in the wrong subreddit, I've had a brief look around and this seems to be the sort of topic posted here. 

My girlfriend has been working at a company in London for 3 months now, the first two months were spent as an intern and she now has a full time contract. The intern wage was set at £500/m, and at the end of the two months she was granted a £1000 bonus due to her good work. After this she was put on salary to earn £22,000pa. 

However there was some problem with the bonus. Instead of giving her the bonus in one go the company added £500 to her second months paycheck to make it £1,000. Naturally you'd assume they'd add on the other £500 to the next paycheck, however they accidentally added £1,000 on to the next paycheck.

This now meant that base pay was £1833.33, taken up to £2833.33 pre-tax. 

This is where things now get tricky. They saw the mistake and contacted my girlfriend, saying they are deducting the pay, post-tax. This means that she's been taxed on the rate of £2,833.33 down to £2,044.50, and they have then deducted £500 for her final pay of £1,544.50. 

Now I'm pretty certain that this has been worked out wrong and has taken money from her due to overpaying National Insurance, and that the £500 should have been deducted from the pre-tax pay. However we emailed their accounts with this information and they sent the reply:

*Hello
No sorry this is correct-we have to deduct the £500 from net salary otherwise you would get tax relief on the advance made (duplicate payment).* 

Note, this is the end of the tax year and any tax can get reclaimed as she has not earned enough to be paying tax yet. However student loans and national insurance will still be gone forever.

Are they just covering tracks and have got it wrong, or am I missing something?"
30wz9f,2,2015-03-31,This is what I expect my resumé will look like at graduation. Questions:,financemayne,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/30wz9f/this_is_what_i_expect_my_resumé_will_look_like_at/,"So this is what I expect my resume will look like when I graduate next May (2016) from a somewhat highly ranked (top 40) business school (private California university).

My questions:

1) People have told me having a good GPA is essential to get internships, jobs, etc. but right now I have a 2.4 GPA and am currently working my 3rd internship while many of my peers with high GPAs (3.5+) have 0 so far. Do you think this will continue to be true in the job market, in the sense that with my mediocre GPA with my 3-4 business internships I should have a solid chance at finding a high paying job in the financial industry?

2) What do you think of my resume so far? Given my GPA, and the fact that I don't go to a target school, I'm fairly certain BB Investment banking is not feasible. However, what about investment banking at a middle market bank or boutique bank? Then after a couple years, if I perform exceptionally well, I could transfer to a higher paying position? 

3) What career path do you think I should take, given my resume, to have the highest income? Corporate finance, hedge fund, private equity firm, investment banking, wealth management, financial consulting... you name it? Any ideas?

4) Should I take some of the stuff that's not very relevant to business off of my resume? Or does it help paint a picture of who I am to the employer?


Thanks for your help, this sub has been amazing resource for me!

30wzem,2,2015-03-31,Moving to the US from the UK - J1 Visa,csquestionman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30wzem/moving_to_the_us_from_the_uk_j1_visa/,"I'll be graduating in May 2016 with a BSc Computer Science from a good UK university (currently on a 4.0 GPA) and would love to move to the US for a year or two to work as a developer. I will try to go the H1-B route first but with it being a lottery there's a considerable chance that I may miss out.

I can, however, quite easily obtain a J-1 graduate visa to live and work in the US for 12 months (extendable up to 18 months AFAIK) following the completion of my degree. The J-1 allows me to enter the country before finding work so there is the added bonus of being able to apply for positions while residing in the country and the employer would not need to sort out/pay for a visa for me.

Anyway, my questions are:

* Would it be difficult to obtain work as a graduate on a visa like this?

* Would potential employers be put off by the fact that I can only stay for a finite period of time or is demand for developers high enough that it wouldn't matter?

* Is there such a thing as a graduate ""internship""?"

I'm a fourth year Education student - I'll be finishing up by degree before the end of April. After completing my internship in December, I realized how much I struggled with covering all the curricular content. This was due to numerous factors - too many difficult assignments for my students, as well as complex topics that I needed to reteach. Looking back, I'm trying to figure out how I could have taught all the material my students needed to know, while using less class time and not weighing them down with homework.

This is also the question I'm posing for my Inquiry into Assessment class. If any of you have some spare time and would like to offer your teacher-ly wisdom, please take a glance at my survey! You can answer whichever questions you want, or if you would simply like to comment your thoughts below, that would help as well. 

I appreciate any tips you all have to share! Thanks in advance! :)

Lately, I've been trying to think what I could do to improve this and any suggestions would be appreciated. 

- In the case with getting exams out of the way as I've seen many people suggest, I get exemptions for the first 8 or so throughout my course so I don't feel taking these privately is a good use of my time, and I probably won't understand the later exams until I've progressed further into my course.
- In terms of improving other skills I am planning to train myself with R/Matlab/SAS, hopefully this summer.
- For extra-curriculars I'm captain of a sports team and plan to immerse myself in the Actuarial society's events next year. 

However, I feel the lack of experience puts a big hole in my future job applications (including second year summer internships) and if you could, please tell me what part time jobs/voluntary roles I should pursue  that employers may call ""relevant"". (I am set to volunteer in Ghana this summer, and have worked in 2 charity shops so far). "

I'm not affraid about thirst three interviews but I feel bad about the last one.

I got call from last company. I asked them if they know that I have no experience and all I wanted is internship. 

They said no. 

So I told them that I can try my best as full-time employer. 
They told me thats fine and I will have a phone interview with their technician.

For all those years I never had a jobs as a teen, even I tried to applied the supermarket jobs.. got accepted as they put me first as intern, month later they kicked me out already..
I have been trying to find suitable jobs in decades since I have diplomas, but every time I have been reading it always said ""css and html"" in which I never got to learned about this.. That made me already wanted to dropped down that apply.. (plus as how I got the diplomas is actually pure luck since my exams was the worst that I ever did) As how my art goes.. When I look at the others of their artwork I began to realized that I'm not that talented person at all since I'm always stuck at one thing, even that I tried to inspired yet I became to hard on myself.  As for support, perhaps it's my selfish way, but I never felt much supported from my family and friends since mostly I never heard so much compliments from my art work.. Even they said it's good.. later on they want to fixed something that I learned to not trust on them.. The only hope of what I did is putting them in public, but I only get very few.. Therefore as for this art world is impossible..  


As for the support of my autism, I mostly felt neglected from them and even I cried for help is turning into void..
I tried to do volunteering job, Altough I got one but I have a feeling that my reputation went downhill because of lately getting to deal with my depression and insecurity (and also I felt less recieving projects from them that made my challenge not enough) and 3 months not heard from me..

I'm having a lot of stressed lately for not getting cash while my parents did the health insurance and not helping to support of my family.My mother did most the job and also dealing with her finances and me as I did a crappy job as a housewife... So you can tell me I'm the worst human being that I ever exist..


The worst part is that my ID card will be ended this year on July...


Through out of this made me quite depressed that I wonder should I ended my life already since I'm that useless..  This is my throwaway account, but hopefully there's respond to this kind of problem.. Because i'm hiding and crying in front of pc..."

Im not a neat freak but im not super dirty either, I don't plan to get crazy over the weekday because I will be working m-f 9-5.

So anyways, Im looking for a sublet for the summer that would idealy be close to Cambridge. Preferably somewhere hip/fun, the internship is paying quite generously so I can probably afford anywhere from 600-1,100 for a room. Obviously I would prefer something cheaper. Anyone know of cool places I should pay attention to on Craigslist and/or know of someone who wants to sublet their room for the summer? thx..."

We decided that if he gets the job, we'll stay until the end of his internship and if he doesn't, we'll leave after he's done with school (a week after my internship ends). Now, here's the thing: we have at minimum $7,000 in savings right now. 

He has places he can stay down in Florida, but he doesn't know about asking for a couple to be moved in. We're going to move no matter what, but I'm unsure of the job market down there and how exactly $7,000 is going to last us until we find employment.

My fiance has depression (not sure what elements this will change, but maybe some of you will know).

As I headed to take my fiance to school, she was distant and was saying things like, ""If you don't know what's wrong, I'm not going to tell you.""  I think she was going to break up with me today or sometime this week.  She said she's not been happy for a long time.

I'm always doing homework and stuff because I'm aiming towards a bright future in computer programming / software development.  I make a point to spend at least 30-60 minutes dedicated to my daughter and fiance a day. I'm realizing this probably isn't enough.

She told me some of the things I've done wrong. In the past, I'd get so angry that I'd throw things and slam doors, but I've stopped that since Christmas time. I really haven't felt any surges of anger and if even a sliver of something similar comes to me, I calm myself down. I'm very motivated and serious about not doing that anymore. (I've never physically hurt her, fyi, just scared her).

Another thing is that I might spend more or less ""enough time"" with her, but she says I'm rarely there when she really needs me. The thing is, I feel like because she has depression, it'll be hard for me to know when she's upset and when to comfort her because I could be doing homework while she just gets upset in the other room by herself at any given time.

The problem is that she doesn't typically want to talk about things like this until they're about to burst or until it's too late. I know I've done wrong, but doesn't that seem bad, too?

I also tend to get tense and achy even when she's trying to love on me because I have scoliosis. I have problems relaxing in general, and it exacerbates her feelings.

We can't pay for a therapist and chiropractor until I get my full-time position (which I'm lined up for an internship right now, and I only have 2 years of school left til I can get said 60k/year position).

What do I do so that she doesn't leave me? How can I spend a lot more time with her without sacrificing grades, etc.?

Is it already too late? Have I messed up too much already? I'm at the point of tears, and I really just don't want to lose her. She's amazing.

I had an ex-girlfriend leave me under similar circumstances and I felt like trash because I didn't even get the second chance to improve myself. (I improved all the things she had wrong with me not even 24 hours after she broke up with me and I maintain those improvements to this day. Why won't they just tell me what's wrong right away?)

I'm already going to change the things she wanted by spending more time with her and by definitely not having any anger outbursts, and I want to improve so badly, but I'm scared it's too late.. Please help, if you can. I'm so lost and feel so helpless.



   
**tl;dr**: She's given me hints on what to do better, but she doesn't like to talk about said hints until it's almost too late. Is it already too late? What can I do?"
30xp0n,2,2015-03-31,Help with second story finance options,thro111awa4,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30xp0n/help_with_second_story_finance_options/,"My partner and I have decided that instead of purchasing a home in a very expensive area, we will instead move in with her mother, who currently lives alone in a very nice area.  We are planning to add a second story to the house where we can live.  This will save all of us a lot of money and the house is in a great location where we would want to eventually retire (walking distance to the beach, can't go wrong).  

Now, my soon-to-be mother-in-law is very happy about this arrangement and she is very accommodating with what we would like to do with the house.  It will cost us approximately $110,000 to make these changes to the house, for which my partner and I will be paying for.  I have at least $50,000 cash to contribute - potentially more if needed. My soon-to-be mother in law said she could contribute at least another $20,000. My partner is still an intern and don't make much so won't be contributing.  This won't be enough to cover it, so we will likely have to get a construction loan on the house.  I wanted to see if the PF community have any ideas on what our choices are.  Currently, the house title is under my partner and her mom's name.  If my partner and I get married (which, we are this year), will I be able to take out the construction loan instead of them?  The reason I'd like to go with this route is because I am much more likely to be approved for the loan since I don't have any debt and I have a good salary.

30xqa8,31,2015-03-31,Wife is about to earn her teaching degree and is intimidated by the job hunt. Can she get a little love?,ConnorSuttree,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/30xqa8/wife_is_about_to_earn_her_teaching_degree_and_is/,"Last night my wife was venting her anxiety with regards to finding a teaching job for the fall session. She is wrapping up her student teaching semester and just went to a job fair where she came away with a handful of good contacts, but also with a good bit of ""How am I ever going to get a job when I'm up against all of these seemingly competent/confident professionals looking for jobs too?"" in her brain.

Also, as she is applying for jobs online she has to submit her score from a Gallup poll along with the usual resume, cover letter, and letters of recommendation. The poll has her freaked out because she too often finds that in answering a particular question she is being forced to choose a relatively 2 dimensional response from the list. I tried to make her feel better by talking about the fact that 1) everyone else is similarly constrained 2) you've got to trust that the poll is designed well enough that it captures a decent representation of you, and 3) all of the districts to which she's applying require this same poll, so there's no reason to go crazy over-thinking the responses or limitations.

Now, I know that I'm a bit biased, but I also know that she is genuinely outstanding as a person, a student, and thus far as a teacher. Here's why:

* For her final semester, she has been one of a small handful of students who interviewed for and obtained a paid internship position.
* In this position, she has covered for her co-op's all day absence and led the class multiple times with no issues. She has great rapport with her kids.
* She suggested and has been granted permission to provide focused lessons for 3-6 kids every day to bring them up to par in their math skills. (She's a math/social studies teacher, btw)
* She has always received high praise from her instructors, peers, and observers. And I'm talkin' no bullshit high praise. At 27 and as the mother of our 3 year old daughter, she's a few years older than most of her fellow students, so she easily stands out as being more mature and competent than they, but she's always been that way.
* She'll be graduating with honors, which to me seems pretty obvious given the above. :)

We're in the Milwaukee area, if that helps anyone with some insight. I'm hoping that a few folks can give her some encouragement as she's looking to land that first job. What'dya say?

**Edit for shameless promotion** If you vote this up to the top I'll be she'll see the topic and be all like, ""Whaaaat?! You guys are great and I feel soooo much better! Thanks!""

Even they said it's good.. later on they want to fixed something that I learned to not trust on them.. The only hope of what I did is putting them in public, but I only get very few.. Therefore as for this art world is impossible..  


As for the support of my autism, I mostly felt neglected from them and even I cried for help is turning into void..
I tried to do volunteering job, Altough I got one but I have a feeling that my reputation went downhill because of lately getting to deal with my depression and insecurity (and also I felt less recieving projects from them that made my challenge not enough) and 3 months not heard from me..

I'm having a lot of stressed lately for not getting cash while my parents did the health insurance and not helping to support of my family.My mother did most the job and also dealing with her finances and me as I did a crappy job as a housewife... So you can tell me I'm the worst human being that I ever exist..


The worst part is that my ID card will be ended this year on July...


Through out of this made me quite depressed that I wonder should I ended my life already since I'm that useless..  This is my throwaway account, but hopefully there's respond to this kind of problem.. Because i'm hiding and crying in front of pc..."

(Incredibly long, sorry)",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/30xwpw/need_advice_cant_get_my_foot_in_the_door_at_an/,"I'm sure you answer a bunch of these, but I just can't get my head around what I'm doing wrong here. 

After graduating college with a Communications/Media degree a year and a half ago, I knew exactly what I wanted to do for a career. I had, during my studies, found a love for creating strategy and copy for advertising campaigns. But I had a problem that I knew was going to keep me from getting work easily: while my fellow students were out taking internships and making connections, I was working so I could afford to live, eat, etc.

After graduating, I sent hundreds of resumes, I made follow up calls/sent follow up emails, worked with the veterans services offered to me because of the time I spent in the Marines... I did everything that I could think of. But no matter what happened I couldn't even get a call back for a phone interview. 

After 6 months, I saw a job opening for an executive assistant at an advertising agency. Hoping this could help me get my foot in the door, I applied. Finally, I got a phone call. Finally an interview, and finally a job. It was a small role at a tiny agency, but it was a start. I saw it as a way to finally start getting writing samples together, as well as learn about the industry.

In the 8 months that I worked there, I took a small sales outreach email writing role and transitioned it multiple times until the things I was previously ""sure about"" with no proof were the things I did every day. I volunteered to write blogs, I asked for a shot to write copy, I pitched our business and got us a new client. The partners were so excited about the work that we started hiring new people to expand. Having multiple designers and an assistant, I was all of a sudden running all the creative meetings and leading the team on concepts and execution for multiple campaigns. I was doing exactly what I KNEW I was capable of... but I didn't know that was what would get me fired.

As I mentioned, this was a small agency... like very small. So when I started taking over responsibilities, the partners (one in particular) had much less to do. This spiraled downward to the point where an email I sent on a day off asking for guidance on the amount of tasks they (separately) had assigned the creative team for the next week became an argument about how disrespectful I was and how it was holding back production. 

Long story shot, I'm back on the job market.

Oh well, I was unceremoniously canned through an email on a Saturday from a job I was great at and truly loved. Now that I have some experience doing low through high level stuff for an agency... albeit a small one, I should at least be able to get my foot in the door somewhere else, right? WRONG.

I feel like I'm back where I was when I graduated, except now I have an online portfolio with examples of the work I did in my old role. So now... instead of wondering if the hundreds of resumes I send out are even seen... google analytics tells me that nobody is even bothering to take a look at my work before either outright rejecting me or taking the job posting down. 

I know it has to be a problem with my approach... but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. It seems that I'm in the same boat I was in the first time around. I know I'm a capable and talented candidate who wants nothing more than to grow in this industry... I just can't even get an employer to let me in to the point where I can say that. 

How do I change my approach when they just can't get to that step of the process? How do I break the cycle of disinterest?

TL;DR: Looking for advice on how to get in the room with an employer. I don't even care about the rest. I just need an interview.

30xzj0,7,2015-03-31,"My father was diagnosed with cancer and lost everything, including his small business",yes_istheanswer,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/30xzj0/my_father_was_diagnosed_with_cancer_and_lost/,"I started a [Go Fund Me](http://www.gofundme.com/tedsfund) on my father's behalf because he'll never admit that, right now, we need some help. 

I’m going to be as short as I possibly can and right to the point.

My parents have had a really rough few years. They owned a small delicatessen and catering business in Philadelphia for nearly 9 years. That may sound grand; however, I can tell you it never really took off.

My father quit his job, took out a second mortgage, and with my mother, pursued their dreams of owning and operating a deli and catering business. Since they opened, it’s always been able to keep the lights on both at store and at home, but around six months ago, my mother and I had to find second jobs. My mother and father worked, open till close, every single day since the store opened and haven’t had a vacation since the summer prior to opening in 2006.

I've been at home on the two separate occasions when the energy company came to shut off our electricity, and the gas company to shut off our gas. My father, too ashamed to really tell me that the business was failing to make ends meet, finally admitted that things weren’t going too well;

He had emptied any savings and retirement money he had and put it into the deli.

He owed four months back rent to the landlord, and another $10,000 in other distributors and utilities. 

On top of that, my sister and I had to scrap up money to pay the missed mortgage payments at home to avoid foreclosure.

In January, my father, now 75 years old, started going in and out of the hospital for various urinary troubles, and, after several ER visits and a few weeks in the hospital, he was diagnosed with Stage 2 cancer of the bladder, as well as 7 or 8 partial blockages around his heart.

My mother worked every day, open till close, at the deli by herself with her one other employee for two weeks before my father finally decided to throw in the towel and file for bankruptcy -- which is going to cost $2,800 in lawyer's fees before officially being able to file.

Luckily, the landlord has yet to evict us, though they aren’t operating anymore; however, he may still attempt to collect the money from my parents they don’t have, and he even threatened to put a lien on our house.

James Theodore ""Ted"" Killen, has worked since he was 12 years old; from newspaper delivery boy, to sailing on oil tankers for Sun Oil Co., and leading a team of ROTC recruiters during the U.S. Army’s “Be All You Can Be” campaign. He’s seen so much through his work, and has nothing in his late age to enjoy any of his retirement. 

It hurts deeply to hear your father say that he’ll never be able to enjoy his “retirement,” and admit guilt and shame for not being able to help me purchase my first car, or be able to co-sign my final student loan to travel to Los Angeles for a summer internship program to pursue my dreams.

I am starting this Go Fund Me on his behalf, and, being someone that has a hard time openly ask for others’ hard-earned money, I’m only asking for a little to help alleviate the medical costs of his radiation and chemotherapy. His chemo (once a week) will cost $90 out-of-pocket, and the radiation will be $60 every day (5 days a week) for the 6 and 1/2 weeks of his treatment.  We’ll figure the rest out, I know it.

I wish I could do more for him myself, since he's done so much for me. I know that, given the opportunity to pursue my dreams through my internship in the summer, I can take the necessary steps to finally helping my father enjoy his retirement; though a long shot – I at least owe him the effort. 

All I'm asking is for you guys and gals to click on the link and use the share buttons for Facebook and Twitter. GFM tends to give more exposure to those fundraisers with the most donations as well as shares on social media.

If you read the story and also feel moved to donate, my family and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

I have a pretty great internship this summer, but I want to go to graduate school ASAP.  I just know if I don't keep going, I won't have any drive after being out of school for a while.  

So basically I know I want to study computer engineering.  I also know that my B.S. degree is not enough to get me into hardware work, which is what I really want to do.  My school basically made me a glorified CS and Physics major.  I want to get hands on.  

I'm trying to search for graduate programs, I just don't know what to do with all of these results.  Also, some schools don't even list the research that students would be working on, so how on earth do I get this information?  I've tried e-mailing some of the contacts, but most of them just send me a link to the SAME WEBPAGE I GOT THEIR INFO FROM!  

Sorry, I'm just overwhelmed.  I can go anywhere in the country.  I'm not limited to anywhere in particular. 

Have any of you found a way to make the search easier?  It just seems so scattered right now that I have no idea how I'm going to make a decision I can be confident in.

Sorry if this is rambling, my brain is on overdrive.  Any tips/ advice/ etc. is DEFINITELY appreciated."

I am a student from PSU studying electrical engineering and I just heard from my employer that they have selected for me to intern in Cincinnati this spring/summer (mid May to mid August). I'm pretty excited to live in a new city and experience all that it has to offer. I grew up in a small town near West Chester, PA and I have never been to Cincinnati or even Ohio for that matter. I'm looking for any and all tips you're will to give me. Some info and questions are below. I've read through most of the FAQ's and info in the sidebar, I just figured I'd make a post for more specific info.

&amp;nbsp;

**Info about myself**

* The actual location of the building I will be interning in is based in Norwood.
* I will have a car.
* I enjoy night life on weekends.
* I've never even lived in something that remotely resembles a city. 
* I wouldn't mind living with other roomates.
* I can pay up to $800ish a month for housing.
* I require a sublease of 3 to 4 months.
* I'd like to live pretty close to, or within the actual city of Cincinnati.

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions**

* What are your recommendations for housing?
* What are the ""sketchy"" (for lack of better words) parts of the city?
* What are the fun locations in terms of night life?
* What portions of the city are generally college students, young professionals, families, etc?

Nothing is worth living for. I have no friends, no social life. I am fat and ugly. Nothing excites me, nothing makes me happy anymore. I'm not sure anything ever did. All I have ever done is what other people expected or wanted me to do. And now I have nearly accomplished that, and don't know what to do next. There is nothing I want to do for a career. There is nothing I want to do for a hobby. There is just nothing I want to do.

I graduate from university soon, and I have no idea what to do next. I tried to apply for internships, but I had no idea what sort of thing I wanted, and none of the places I applied to even bothered to respond. I tried to speak with a careers advisor at my uni, but all they told me to do was 'research it'. What good is that?? I have spent hours and hours looking at potential jobs, and nothing seems even remotely interesting. 

I hate my family. They are boring, and I have nothing to talk to them about, as everything revolves around my disabled brother. It always has. My parents would rather send me to countless band rehearsals or swimming sessions than spend any time bonding with me, or finding out what I wanted to do. I spent so much time at those I never had time to work out what I wanted to do, or even how to befriend people I wanted to know. I always just did as I was told, even though I hated the bands, and I hated swimming. I hate everything.

The only thing that makes me happy is my boyfriend, but it isn't fair to put that much pressure on him. I can't expect him to be there for me every time I feel like this.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to carry on living like this, but I don't want to hurt him either, and I know it would destroy him if I killed myself. That is about the only thing stopping me. I need help."

I work in marketing at a small start-up, and this is my first job out of college. It’s actually way more responsibility than is typical, which is great but means I’m all over the place in terms of things to do. It’s partly just the sheer amount of work to do and it’s partly the fact that there are a ton of 5 minute tasks and partly that I’m juggling about separate 12 projects at a time. 

I want them to hire an intern or something to do a specific portion of my job, but my boss was pretty unwilling. They might hire someone else for our team in a few months. I’m going to continue pushing that point, but I’m trying to figure out how to handle things in the mean time.

So I’ve decided the best course of action is to just prioritize as best I can and try to juggle things. 

If I do drop a ball and it’s something my boss asks about, I’m going to be honest and say “I haven’t had a chance yet, I’ve been working on x and x.” If anyone thinks I should use a variation of that, happy to hear suggestions. 

My boss is the kind of person who uses hours worked in his presence as a proxy for how hard the person is actually working, so I know that if I’m the first to show up and one of the last to leave, he will assume I’m trying my best and won’t accuse me of slacking off.

I will sometimes flat out tell him that I don’t have time for a continuous task (for example, he asked me to set up social media accounts for a new product and I said no problem but don’t expect me to have time to post). 

And to be clear, I’m going to continue trying to see if we can get another person, but this is what I need to do for now.

It’s really getting difficult for me to keep everything straight in my head.

I need to get better at 

* Prioritizing a long list of tasks, each of which are associated with a different project

* Remember to do little 5-minute tasks (including regular ones)

* Come up with a stock response for my boss when I do drop a ball

* Be more efficient when I’m working on a task

If anyone has any strategies or tool suggestions, I would appreciate them."

Some of these guys are natural storytellers and the late night bullshit sessions we had in bars were pretty entertaining.  This one is from Clark about his buddy who was visiting.  Not sure if it was New York or Boston but I went with New York because that's where he is from. 

This is an honor, I kept telling myself.  An honor.

But I was sick in New York and living with 2 Chinese guys that didn't speak English.  We were all here as interns for the engineering exchange program.  Being back in the dorms after living in an apartment was depressing.  No drinking, no smoking, no noise after 10pm.  Fuck.  All there was to do was study and work.  

So I called Clark, the only guy I knew on the East coast.

""Naw, I 'm stuck here man.  I got 3 wisdom teeth coming out.  So no man.  But my cousin's out there...You want that number buddy?""

Hell yeah I wanted that number.  This was how I met Benny.  I was warned he could be a bit...overbearing.  But at 19 you tend to just go for shit.  So I called.

Benny pulled up in an Acura Integra all shiny and red.  He got out, grabbed my hand and then hugged me which I found offsetting but I went with it.

""So you're Clark's friend eh?  He told me about you"", said Benny lighting up a smoke and seemingly unconcerned he was double parked in front of the university.  

""Yup.""

""You're from San Francisco?  They got good shit out there or what?""

""Yeah.""

""You know any fags?""

""What?""

""You know queers and shit.  I heard San Francisco's full of fags.""

I smiled.  This was the third person I've met out here who asked me if I knew any homosexuals because I was from San Francisco.  

""Sure.""

""Alright San Fran, lets hit the road.  Clark said you wanted some stamps...Hey you're a big dude.  How tall are you?""

""Like 6'2 maybe.""

""Tell you what, ride with me, I'll show you the city, buy you lunch and toss in a couple freebies.  What do you say?""

I should have said, ""I have class!"" or ""No thanks!"", but I got in.

We drove almost 30 minutes through various neighborhoods.  New York was kinda dingy and grim looking.  Lots of old buildings decaying with new ones sprouting right next to them.  There did not seem to be much thought in planning and new construction blotted out the sky.  We pulled up to a small park.  A well dressed guy in a business suit approached the car.

""Alright man, don't speak to this prick.  Just stare at him ok?""

""What?  Why?""

""Just do it, it'll be funny.""

So I stared.  The guy came up to the car and looked inside at Benny.  

""Hi Benny, sorry to make you come out here...""

""You got it?"", asked Benny.    

""No not quite yet...Oh is this your friend?  Hi!  My name is Don!  Don Jenkins!"", said the man thrusting his hand at me.  

As instructed I just stared at him

""Ok..."", said Don, ""Look guys...""

""Coming back tomorrow Don"", said Benny, ""Don't make us get out of the fucking car ok?""

""Yeah.  Uh sure no problem..."", said Don as we sped off.

""Hah!  You see that prick?!  Told you!"", laughed Benny.

Next Benny handed me a crumpled McDonald's bag.  

""There's nothing in it.  Just put your hand in it and keep it on your lap"", winked Benny as he drove up to a group of college aged kids in front of a coffee shop.  A guy with a ponytail jogged over to the car.

""Heeey Benny!"", the guy said.

""You got it?"", asked Benny looking very angry.

""Well..."", said the guy.

Benny looked at me and then at the bag.  The guy looked at the bag and his eyes got huge.

""Yeah man, let me go get it!"", said the guy backing off.  He handed me a roll of cash which Benny took.

""Thanks!"", and we drove off.

Now I was getting worried.  This was kind of fun but getting more sketchy.  Benny didn't seem too worried about anything.  He smoked weed in front of cops, parked anywhere and screamed obscenities to people he knew on the street.  Some in greeting and some as threats.

""Alright bag trick again.  But with cash..."", said Benny counting bills into the bag, ""This looks professional.  Just hand it to him when I say so.""

""Uhm...""

""Don't worry man, we're almost done.  You'll like this one.""

The biggest white guy I have ever seen stood outside the car.  He had Slavic features and spoke heavily accented Russian English which Benny seemed to understand.  He passed a garbage bag into the car.  Benny opened it and I could see 2 handguns.  Dear God...I thought.  Benny nodded at me.

""Pay the man.""

Meekly I handed over the bag and the man accepted it without counting and walked casually away into a laundromat.

I did get my lunch but could barely eat.  In fact I had the shits from sleep deprivation, dope sickness and heart pumping primal fear.  In the dorms I did some bumps and felt better.  But hell, I never ever used that number again.

30yljr,4,2015-03-31,"Transitions, loss, and belonging",culturosity,TCK,https://www.reddit.com/r/TCK/comments/30yljr/transitions_loss_and_belonging/,"Hi everyone,
   I have been looking to connect more with other TCK's, because I find my identity to be a complicated matter and something I've been thinking about for a long time, and I really would love to meet people with similar experiences. I was born in Ukraine and moved to the US when I was 11, and I don't really identify as Ukrainian (partly because my family is Jewish and we left on refugee status). I  also don't consider myself fully American, and most of my closest friends are immigrants, international students, or other TCK's. Because I immigrated as a pre-teen, I also grew apart from my family, who have retained more of the Ukrainian traditions. I am pretty independent and am good at adjusting to new places and making friends, but I realize that deep down I often feel really lonely.

I have done a lot of soul searching and have realized that feelings of loss and belonging are really crucial for me. It seems like every time I end a relationship, move somewhere new, have to leave friends behind/etc, I open up some older wound from my earlier experiences with adjustment, loss, and transition. I don't even know how to define the term ""home"" and feel no real connection to a geographical region. I am someone who enjoys excitement while craving some stability and comfort. 

I am thinking a lot about this stuff because I am supposed to move again in July and start a new position (I am in a psychology doc program and this will be my year-long internship prior to getting my degree).  I also just had a hurtful breakup and so the ideas of loss and belonging are on my mind.

I hope it's okay to share some of the stuff here. I am just curious about how some of you deal with loss/transitions and how you find a sense of belonging. If you have similar experiences or feel like you can relate to what I said, please feel free to comment or PM me.

Thanks for reading!"

The problem I'm noticing here (and if I'm not crazy then I'm probably not the first one noticing it either) is a tendency of young programmers to quit their first job in unpleasant circumstances a little less then a year after starting it. 

The first case I can report is myself - I was working as a student over a decade ago, and when finals came I agreed with my boss I'd continue working part time. At the end of the finals both of us were dissatisfied with the amount of work I had put in, albeit in different directions. Hindsight is subjective, so I may well have been more bratty then I remember. 

The last incident (and fourth by my count, out of not so many I've watched over the years, which makes it a worrying high percentage) just ended this morning. A young programmed I imagined I had been mentoring and grooming since last spring quit messily barely a month after our startup got its first big client, and consequently just after his take-home paycheck almost doubled. The messy part was an email he sent to said client, which painted me as Satan incarnated. I'm not, and since I can't really trust Satan with the evaluation I checked with other people involved - the absolute consensus is that I'm really not, and he's... well, young and inexperienced was the nice way of putting it.

What all those cases have in common is a sudden rise in self-esteem coming from finally being able to ""get"" things and build real, production software. This leads to unreasonable demands - last summer one intern went to a series of 4-5 negociating rounds with the head of his company, asking to quit, then to work less, then to make more money, then to quit again. He asked to be rehired after a month (and was refused). Another of the guys I'm aware of quit / I fired him just after finals, like myself, and this after I had almost begged him to take the month off. Even being aware of the potential for trouble I wasn't able to avoid it.

**tl;dr:** Programmer gets hired, is hard working and eager to learn for 6 months. Becomes able to do real work, gets into conflict with management, quits or gets fired. This looks like a pattern, and I need to break it because my latest  startup is based on training young programmers. Help?

30yqo5,3,2015-03-31,Graduated a year ago and still no job.,chazilicious,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/30yqo5/graduated_a_year_ago_and_still_no_job/,"I graduated last May with a degree in computer science. I still haven't been able to secure my first real full-time job.

I've gotten kind of close! I've got to final stage of interviews with a large consulting firm a few months after graduating, but they ultimately didn't hire me. I got interviews with a local startup, but they aren't able to hire me at the moment because they don't have the budget. And finally, I had an interview with a small government contractor who was going to hire me, contingent on securing their next contract which still hasn't happened. And just last week, I had a company that was excited to interview me, but I had to stop when they didn't offer relocation assistance. I'm just not in a financial state to be relocating by myself.

I don't think I'm doing anything wrong on the applying end. I send out about 5-7 applications out a week, but I might get a email/phone screen once or twice a month (and plenty of rejections letters, if I even get those!). I've had my resume reviewed multiple times, even by professionals, and none of them suggested any radical changes. I always target my cover letters, and I've had some of them checked out too.

I took a couple of extra years in school due to depression, and my grades weren't so hot. I only had one internship which is supposed to be pretty bad for a computer science major. So, I understand I'm not the greatest candidate and accept that. I'd post this in /r/cscareerquestions, but I'm not a fan of the subreddit. It's not for people like me. They seem a bit harsh to anyone that isn't an ace student with internships under their belt. They all are ever talking about getting into Google or Amazon, and I know I'm just not of that caliber.

Reading /r/cscareerquestions, I have seen people suggest making projects on GitHub which I started doing a month ago. I've also got involved with a recruiter, but no bites there either. I've also seen suggestions about trying other fields in software development. Originally I thought of just doing software engineering or programming, but I've applied to QA/testing/analysis and consultant gigs. Still nothing.

Is this normal though? I know everybody's story about getting hired is personal and unique. You take two people, and they likely didn't get hired the same way. But I thought I was doing most things ""right."" I've got an ""in demand"" STEM degree, have a resume that I believe to be good, I can interview well, and yet I'm not employed. Is one year without getting hired normal for someone like me? Anything else I can be doing to help myself?"

I've worked on some personal projects using R and Python, mainly just doing basic regression and random forests and producing heatmaps and charts using ggplot2 for NBA basketball analytics for fun. I've also played around with quantmod. However, I am not too comfortable with web scraiping. I also know C++ fairly well because I use it for my Master's thesis project, but I've only used SQL for tutorials. 

I've learned machine learning concepts and applying them with R by going through the Intro to Statistical learning book.

I know I am less competitive than CS/Stats grads who have done internships or have phDs or have experience dealing with really large data sets. Even though I've sent out lots of resumes in the past month, I've only heard back from C++ developer roles, not data scientist roles (except for a recruiter who told me I wasn't qualified for a data scientist position because the company only wanted phDs).

What else can I do to improve my resume? Do I need to complete coursera courses? Also, would I have much greater chances of getting an interview if I focus on applying to roles in the Bay Area? What salary range should I expect for an entry-level role with my skills/background?

In addition, both companies provide fairly handsome compensation. However, neither company has provided insight as to what I will be working on, and will likely not do so until my offer deadline is up.

Given these circumstances, what would be a good approach to selecting which company to work for?

Initially I thought the position was in software development however after talking to the manager, he told me that I will initially be put into automated qa testing and if I show potential may be moved to development.

I know beggars cant be chosers, but I am not to sure what to do in this situation. This is the only internship I was able to land, however since it is 16 months long, am worried that I might not be able to move to the developer role. I have talked to a couple of friends but have only heard mixed things. 

So I was wondering if people could offer some advice on what they would do if in this situation.

Thanks a lot :)

30znkv,1,2015-03-31,Internship offer situation - looking for advice,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30znkv/internship_offer_situation_looking_for_advice/,"Hey guys. I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering major who has been searching for internships for this Summer. It would be my first internship/""real world"" experience. While I understand a very similar situation has come up (and is posted on the FAQ), I've been having a lot of trouble with my situation, as there are a few weird specifics.

Long story short, after several interviews, I FINALLY received an offer for an internship. However, there's a few issues and I'm having a REALLY hard time deciding what to do...

&amp;nbsp;

1) The job (Job 1) is at my university, which is very far away from home. I am unable to go back home over breaks (except for Summer), so I have not seen my family/girlfriend in over 3 months. (Job 1 allows for ~2 weeks of vacation time. One week would be me working remotely.) I would also not be able to get around, as I cannot bring my car to campus for the Summer. This means that I would not be able to participate in many of the Summer activities I normally enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;

2) I'm not sure Job 1 counts as a good internship experience. While it IS paid, I would hardly call it a true ""software company"" job. Basically, the ""team"" would consist of me and one other graduate student, with a professor to mentor/direct us in creating a website/web-app. (Basically, I'm unsure whether or not this internship experience will make an employer down the road go ""Ooh, let's hire him"", considering I have already completed several team-projects through school.)

&amp;nbsp;

3) I have several applications out to a (fairly large) company (Job 2) closer to home. I would prefer working at Job 2 because it is close to home, pays more than Job 1, and there would be no question about the ""quaility of the experience"" I would be getting during the internship. I feel I have a decent shot at getting Job 2, as my brother-in-law works at the company's graphic design department and introduced me to a few of the higher-ups of the IT department. However, nothing is for certain yet, as Job 2 is still reviewing my applications.

&amp;nbsp;

I have already emailed Job 2 (last week) about the status of my applications, although I did not mention that I had another offer and needed to hear back from them. The professor from Job 1 has told me that the deadline for acceptance is rapidly approaching, as he has to ""submit the paperwork to get me on payroll for the summer"" and ""has other applicants he could proceed with"". In the original offer he mentioned that I was his top choice. Were the offer from a company, rather than a university professor, I would have no issues with potentially reneging if I got an offer from Job 2.

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully that's enough information. I'm really lost on this one, guys. Thanks in advance for any help that you can offer."
