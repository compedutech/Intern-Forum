I'm definitely not a ""natural"" at programming and other ""computer things"". But I work really hard and with some help manage to make it work. 

For the past ~1 year since graduation I've worked a couple different front end development jobs. Because I'm new I tend to have a lot of questions and a fair amount of things that I need help on. I try really hard to figure things out on my own (along with google) before I ask for help, but sometimes I just need help. 

I recently started a new job and have tons of anxiety when I develop. If something doesn't work first try, I get anxiety. If I'm not familiar with the workflow: anxiety. If I need help on an issue, anxiety about coworkers discovering my ""incompetence"". 

I worry that my issues are small stupid things that I shouldn't be asking for help on, even though often they're complex and stump the person I'm asking. Maybe I have somewhat of ""imposter syndrome"". I don't market myself as an experienced developer, I'm entry level. But I always feel like I'm behind.

Do you guys often feel like this? Have anxiety with work/not knowing things? How do you deal? "
5ag2gn,2,2016-10-31,College Senior - Graduation Can't Come Soon Enough,L4D-27,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ag2gn/college_senior_graduation_cant_come_soon_enough/,"The following you are about to read isn’t extremely organized, but I tried my best.

I’m not quite sure how it happened, to be honest. Scratch that, I know the root cause of it and it is my fault.

That feeling of dread to get your meals by yourself. You quietly get your food, find a table distant from others and fall heavily into a chair. You stare blankly at your bland food served to you by the unpleasant cafeteria staff and you lift your gaze slightly. Looking over to the left, you look out onto the world as it continuously goes on. Groups of friends entering and leaving the building, couples holding hands as they stroll through the green, and others as they get into their cars to return home.

Your focus turns to the sun falling behind the clouds and the horizon, and it leaves the sky with a beautiful array of colors. Vibrant pink, red, orange, yellow, and sometimes purple illuminate the world above you. There’s a connection to the sun that just can’t compare to anything else, but it’s just a hot ball of gas floating 92.96 million miles away from you. It too is isolated from its surroundings, but everyone sees it and recognizes it. People view the sun as an energetic source of life and warmth, as some others view you. But the sun is different from you. It burns at a temperature of 5,777 K and anything that goes near it is destroyed from the heat. You leave the cafeteria and take your fifteen-minute walk back in the dark, cold world back to your apartment where you’ll sit alone for the remainder of the night. It wasn’t always like this, though.

The saying goes, “college is the best four years of your life.” That is hardly the case. College has been the most trying years of my life (so far), but I am grateful (?) for that. Unlike many other students, I graduate in three years instead of the traditional four. I took extra classes each semester so I could accomplish that, and even though the University waived those fees for me, it still had its own costs. When I tell people this, one of the first things they ask is “aren’t you afraid of missing out on the college experience?” If my college experience was anything like my first year and parts of my second year in school, I would have told them “maybe.” That has since changed.

Before embarking off to college, I was deciding between two schools. One in Rhode Island, the other, the one I am graduating from. I took campus tours and went to many events hosted by each of the schools. There was one, however, that had given me excitement about school. The atmosphere was perfect for me and the people who went there seemed like I would fit in just fine. The surrounding area was beautiful and there was much to do. Both were approximately four hours from my home. You’d be disappointed to hear I didn’t go to the school I just described.
“Why didn’t you go there!?” is probably what you’re asking yourself right now. I ask myself that same question at least once a week. One of the main reasons I didn’t go there was because the school I am currently attending offered me the opportunity to obtain my degree in that three-year span. At the time, this seemed like a no brainer. What’s not to love? If it was between two schools and one of them offered me to cut the cost of my schooling by one year, it would seem stupid NOT to take this offer.
It wasn’t until my final year that I realized this mistake.
You see, the school I am attending now has been at the forefront of yearly tuition hikes plagued by millions of young students. “It’s only three years,” I would tell myself. “You won’t be paying as much as the others that go here for four years.” The other school offered a tuition freeze all four years of attendance, meaning that tuition would not raise at all for all four years. Both schools offered me similar scholarships at the time. I guess in my nearsightedness I neglected to consider the costs of school thoroughly.

At the end of my first year and going into my second year, I had strongly considered transferring schools. I thought about the school in Rhode Island and one in my home state, only one hour away from home. Looking over the schools, it seemed like a stretch and too much of hassle. I would tell myself, “These schools may not accept many, if any, of my credits from this school” and, “it will cost me more in the long run to switch schools.” At the end of the fall semester in my second year I still thought about switching. I never did it. Why? Out of fear. I feared losing everything and having to start all over again. I would have to make entirely new friends and make a name for myself all over again.

I hate the area where my school is. There is not much to offer locally, has almost zero aesthetic qualities to it, and the people who live here are extremely rude. This may seem petty, but these are things I care about.

Not to say I haven’t met some amazing individuals at my time at this school. I have a knack, and am lucky, to make great friends where I work. My co-workers are good friends, even if I only see them at work. They lack that depth that good friends have, though. I have had a handful of others who have been there for me in tough times. My old roommate, who transferred at the end of my second year, was very close to me during those two years. We have since lost touch. My new roommates are great guys and took me under their wing for that final semester when we were all together.

I’ve met other friends here as well, all from my first year of school. They have been there for me during trying times when I needed them. My last year here has been different. We don’t nearly hang out as often as before and I no longer seek help from anyone about my personal problems or feelings. I no am no longer invited to events and lack quality time with anyone anymore.

I’ve never been a “ladies man” so to speak and haven’t had a relationship since my senior year of high school, nearly three years ago. I know relationships should not be my main source of happiness, but love has been something that I’ve longed for. My ex-girlfriend once told me that I “should never settle” when it came to my choice of college. I guess she knew better than me about my future experience.

The summer of 2016 was a transitional one for me in many ways. Now, the word “transitional” does not always mean the same thing as “good.” Not to say the summer was completely horrible, no. I had a great summer to be honest. I was in a great internship program and was surrounded by colleagues and other interns who I was able to grow a bond with. I was able to enjoy my last summer of “freedom” as a college student with many of my close friends from my hometown and high school. It was transitional in that I learned to find my strong voice and command situations. It was the first time that I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I've always been very mature for my age with my nickname being ""Dad"" or ""Gramps."" The “real world” seemed much more appealing to me than college life. Maybe it's my mindset that affected everything. It seems now that the only people who have truly cared about me live so far away and I rarely see them.

High school was pretty great for me. I was in the school’s Drama Club for all four years and was pretty good at it. I took a lot of music classes and everyone seemed to have similar interest as me. My junior and senior years of high school were great. I started an improv club that was a huge hit with the school population and was actively involved with putting on any sort of production to entertain others.

The beginning of my final year marked the negatives of this transition. I was so excited to return to school to finish my degree and live with the guys I lived with last year. There was a complete mood shift. Suddenly, I became the one who gets left behind on weekends while they go out and do fun things together. I was closer to them last year when I lived with them my second semester of my second year, but changed over the summer since the departure of my first and closest friend and roommate. It seems like they hate me now and I have no clue what I may have done to cause that.

I eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner alone every day. I don’t go out anymore with friends. I bottle my emotions. I’m just trying to get through the year, honestly. There have been many nights were I silently cry myself to sleep. I will find excuses to go home, even if takes four hours one way. There have been days where I haven’t talked to a single person. The whole day spent in silence. It’s like I am fading away from life.

I’m not one to do nothing. I have to do something otherwise I feel like the day was a waste. I threw myself into the gym more so than I ever have before. Focusing on the gym and every aspect of my fitness has taken over. It gives me something to focus on. I clean all the time. I have to maintain this mask like I have my shit together. I work almost triple the amount of hours I have worked since my first year of school. Work gives me something to focus on while making money. I finish my assignments well before they are due to stay on top of my academics. I will not let this final year set me back. In my spare time I have picked up a couple of extra hobbies that give me an excuse to venture out of my apartment into the world. I have delved into reading - anything really. I read mostly about other's people's struggles and how they overcome them. I avoid unhealthy habits because the hole people dig themselves in from them. If I keep busy enough, I can avoid all of my problems.

When I stop to look around, it’s only then that I realize how lonely I really am. I feel just like the sun, floating in nothingness. A ghost, maybe, wandering around while the world remains almost blissfully unaware of their existence.
 
I worry constantly about the future, specifically post-graduation. I worry that I won’t be able to start my career in the area that I want to move to. The mountain of student debt, even after only three years, adds extra weight.

Like others I attempt to put on a mask to make myself seem normal. No one knows of all the pain and emotions I have bottled up inside of me. No one.

Many people have the opposite experience I do, where the first year is the most troublesome. Not me. My final year has the been the worst I can think of. College has changed me. A little more cynical, less trustworthy of others, and less excited about the world. A good thing, maybe, to lower my expectations to reality.
I just can’t wait to get the hell out of here.

Reading this over makes me sound pathetic to be honest. My problems have almost all been caused by myself. People have it way worse than I do, but I needed to get this in writing. I worry my wording doesn’t accurately capture the depth and complexity of what I have experienced and what I needed to say.

I am a little nervous about it because it is a big change. Plus I don't really feel qualified for it, but I do have some computer related stuff on my resume and I feel like that may have helped me. (Won a competition/scholarship from Google). Other than that, I don't really have verifiable IT/Computer experience. Just that I'm slightly above average and I'm the tech guy at my current work. It's not even like I have done major work with computers at my current job. Just could figure some stuff out.

I know this is a very good opportunity to get my foot in the door and what not. Does anyone have any suggestions for a crash course for basic computer-related things? From the sounds of it, I'll be a tier 1 or 2 help desk person. My label is just IT Tech Support. It is also marketed as an internship. They are aware that I am in school for Computer Science as well. They also do have a week-long training session.

""IT technical support officers maintain the computer systems of large organisations, ensuring that they run smoothly and providing technical support and advice to computer users.""

Was the exact description they gave me. So, I am asking, what does that sound like to you and does anyone know of any crash course I can take during this week to help me prepare? (No, I don't have any of the certs either. Just the scholarship from Google and enrolled in Computer Science)

Any help would be appreciated, thanks guys &amp; gals."

I'm a senior in college. I received a full time job offer from a company in NYC. This is not a normal 'new grad' job offer. I've done six internships and thus I am now considered 'experienced'. But because the position is for 'experienced' developers, they are not really willing to wait so long for me to graduate.

Normally I would have already said no. Thing is, the project I would be working on is kind of a big deal. It's a very public move by a big 4 (company is a subsidiary), and the project is very high profile. I'm afraid to say more for fear that I may be identified, but you can't live in NYC without knowing/hearing about it.

I have worked full time in the past while also being a full time student (it's how I've done all those internships). If I take this offer, that is what I am planning on doing. My course load will be light, so I'm confident I can physically handle it, but I really don't want to go back to doing that. Having full time work and school is depressing.

Offer is for 105k base with a 10% performance bonus. I've already negotiated it up. I am also concerned this may be slightly low for NYC.

I (probably) have return offers from previous companies I've interned at. I can't give exact specifics for fear of being identified.

Compensation is everything including signing/performance.

Offer 1: Very famous media company, ~115k (was told by manager and team lead would receive offer)

Offer 2: AI startup, ~90k - ~100k, I don't know how many RSUs. (This is trickier. I may get this offer but also may not).

I would be a mobile developer at all offers.

I'm still in the process with IBM, Twitter, Palantir, Amazon and a few other companies I'm not going to bother mentioning. No guarantees I get any of these though.

What would you do in my shoes /r/cscareerquestions? Try and go back to the AI startup? Return to the media company? Tough it out for one semester and work at a high profile project? It is only 4 months after all. Or abandon all three and try for a well known tech company?

I'm leaning towards the high profile company at the moment."

* Reduce physical footprint by going microATX or miniITX
* Get rid of the CD burner

I've started looking at miniITX boards as well as cases (Looking at a Sugo13 or a DAN A4-SFX when it's available), it'd be great if someone could point me in the right direction in terms of what to look out for.

A rough list:

* Mini ITX motherboard + wifi
* Corsair H60 CPU cooler
* Trying to keep my PSU? will replace if needed
* Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM (appropriate clock speed?)
* Mini ITX case
* Concerned about my 3 HDD/SSD

My budget is $200 in addition to the ~$250 I anticipate I can sell the MoBo + CPU + heatsink + case + network card for. I won't be selling the bad RAM.

5agqev,1,2016-10-31,Take bar a third time or pursue another career and cut ties with toxic family and people,gritforlife,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5agqev/take_bar_a_third_time_or_pursue_another_career/,"I've never struggled with myself more than I am right now. I live in a really toxic single parent home that use to resent me for being successful and for getting a settlement check in a car accident that I almost died in, meanwhile I tried to help everyone the best I can and all I did was pay off my loans and bought myself a 2009 infiniti.

I was diagnosed ADHD going into full time law school in 2012 and was on Adderall since. It helped me push through school work and classes, but with the lack of support in my house and commuting through law school, also fell into a relationship with a crazy woman, it was hell. I didn't get good grades, but use to paralegal for a law firm in mid/biglaw and was close with the Managing EP. So he gave me the 1l summer associate position. It was insurance defense/litigation work and I was miserable billing hours although it was nice having my own office and getting paid well at 24. The resentment from my family got even worse, but I let it motivate me and didn't care.

I knew I wasn't happy as a summer associate there so I was accepted into sports program where I met some nfl execs made contacts but never landed job. I still have it in mind to reach out to them now after failing the bar a second time, but not sure yet. I started spiraling taking medication in excess my second year until my anxiety was so bad, i begged my doc to put me on an SSRI antidepressant called Lexapro, it was like relief for first time in my life, but dulled me out so much with sex drive and other things didn't realize. I was accepted to prestigious washington internship and didn't think or second guess myself, finally i just picked up and went. I took my ex gf with me and it was an amazing experience. I had a job and felt great finally i found little stability.

Third year comes and the worst mistake I make is coming off medication that was working, switched to Vyvanse and stayed on Lexapro, and spent entire third year in my gf's basement with her basically screwing and not chasing opportunities anymore. Once I got back on Adderall for the bar exam in Feb 2016 (last NY bar exam), I thought it was gunna work out fine and i had it all figured out when i got on an antidepressant but I bombed it self-studying..... we brawled and broke up yet i stayed in my toxic environment instead of taking bar loan and using it to move out.

Me and my girl break up the day I sit for the July UBE in NY, i'm crushed beyond belief, and spent all my savings. Tried the AdaptiBar program and did all 2,000 questions thought it was enough and I find out I failed again. Every time I've tried to come off Lexapro, I lash out and go into a state of panic. This is because either I was fine before and my broken home and family are just toxic sh1t that I ruined myself for their appeasement, or I did and am doing things better and it's just that hard of an exam that it takes this long sometimes.

I should mention I haven't been employed since those two summers full time internships during law school and getting treated like crap more and more over here, yet my mother uses my car whenever she wants because she doesn't have one and when I mention selling it they all get silent.

Should I sell my car and get the hell out of here and move to the city, get a part-time job (or full-time but don't think i can do full-time and bar exam prep third time). I don't have a father, lost my gf, and have no one, all because i'm trying to help myself. Just need some outside input please, worst mistake I made was not moving to the city and dating this toxic ex of mine that used me and kept me on this crappy outter borough of manhattan.

-PS I should mention I was offered a job on clinton's campaign down in florida after the UBE and my family said not to take it cause of my breakup... that was when she said she wouldn't come with me and I spiraled into depression. They doubted I had ADHD that I went to see their specialist doctor who is one of the best who confirmed to them I did have it... the anger on my face when he said it towards them was like you lying manipulating bastards ruined my relationship and life all cause my older brother is jealous or something? Just venting, thanks for reading and your input, I'm losing it.

And I'm writing here because once again I'm watching my future crumble.  I have bipolar type 2.  The depression cycle took me out of college my first semester of my freshman year.  I had to fight for 2 years to be let back in.  I can't tell anyone I have bipolar because it receives so much more bias than clinical depression.  My life is crumbling after I worked so hard to get it back together.  I went from religion to aerospace engineering with nuclear engineering and astronomy minors.  I excelled, but a policy change I wasn't informed of now will take my gpa to below 1.5 from my current 3.2.  Put me on academic suspension for a semester.  Take away any chance of an internship this summer, even after getting so many responses from prospective employers.

No one wants a failure and after all my hard work I'm worse than I started.  I just want control of my life but I keep being forced to realize I have none.  And it's great because all those deep dark thoughts are flooding back after being gone for years.  But it's selfish.  But it's a glimmer of control in the flat spin my life currently is.

And I'm posting here because I can't let anyone know who could change something.  That would strip my last little bit of control away.  If they told the school, I'd get sent on forced medical leave again and they'd never let me back.

I was doing so well, but one thing out of my hands has ruined everything I've hoped for.  And I just want the failures to end."

I had a plan to maybe go back to college and re-do it all and actually have a good experience. I wanted to live that party lifestyle.

But I realized its entirely cope. I'm unattractive. I am only getting older. My youth is gone. I see all these girls out having fun, picking aesthetic guys, partying, etc. Tonight really solidified it. There were thousands of girls dressed up going to party, hanging off guys, etc. Tons of hot guys winning at life having a good time, grinding, making out, talking to a bunch of girls. Doing college right. I want that. I want to have fun. I want to makeout, dress up, have company, party, etc.

I know in no way shape or form am I entitled to anything; I'm merely venting here. I know it's my fault for not looking a certain way. It just sucks.


Even if everything went perfectly, I'd be a good deal older and just that creep trying to chase his youth. I won't be able to have these experiences. I won't be able to have those GOAT youth romance experiences. These GOAT college experiences. Won't ever be good looking enough. Won't ever be aesthetic enough to where girls react in those desirable ways- asking you out, approaching, wanting to be around you, lusting for you, giving you signs, etc etc. There is no re-do.


And with that from an objective standpoint, the only answer is to off myself. It is the most logical situation as I won't be getting what I want out of life. Not saying I will do it immediately as I don't have the balls. But I just don't know. What is the point if life isn't going to be fulfilling? If I can't get what I want to make me happy?


Either way, I'm visiting the registrar and will be withdrawing from my university. I will be quitting my internship tomorrow as well. There just isn't a point to this any more.

Felt like getting it off my chest."

Hallo zusammen, 

I am working as an intern in Berlin at a young startup. The company is very small, and is totally lost about visa/immigration etc. and usually I have had to deal and find out about what paperwork I need - which is fine since it is a great way to learn and get used to the ever-lasting bureaucracy in Germany. 

I am a non-eu citizen. Not a student. My original contract stated that this internship shall be for 3 months. I received a work visa for 3 months. I am being paid slightly above minimum wage. Alles gut.

However, now they'd like me to stay longer - for additional 3 months, and I would like it too since I like working here but I do not know how to go about it. I am in the 2nd month of my internship already and have 3 more weeks to submit the required paperwork.

As mentioned above, the company is pretty fresh and they suggested that I find out about what needs to be done, whether it is possible in the first place, and they'll sign/do the formalities. 



I tried to scout the internet but I couldn't find the information that wasn't stale or relevant to my case. My German is weak as well, so that might be the reason though. 

Question: What documents do I need for extending my visa? Who should I approach for it? Approximately, how much time could the process take?

I feel like my background is unique and I really want to make sure it comes across correctly. Specifically, I've worked at a church for 10 years and the last 5 has been as an ordained minister. I'm concerned because in reality I am still very passionate about my religion, but I really do understand there's a place for it. I'm not nutty and don't plan to use the workplace as a forum to preach or anything. I don't know how to get the right idea across in a resume. Also, I'm an American female in Computer Science so that adds to the uniqueness...

Also, as a note: I have only taken 3 basic CS courses and haven't done much in the way of projects so I have none listed. Is it wise to list even the baby projects I've done? Should these be on a github account?

I plan to start applying for internships with this resume as soon as I have a final version of it.

Thank you!!!"

So let me summarise. I am studying in a top 3 CS school in the UK. Currently I am considering not moving on to software development, but getting involved in volunteering and non-profit organisations.

In case I do decide to move into software development, would this look as good on a CV as an internship? Or would the lack of industrial experience give me terrible employment prospects?"

I've already been self teaching (C++/C#) before and during school and I'm going through freecodecamp for learning web dev. Ideally I'd like to get an internship and then go from there, but there's a few issues. There is no internships in the area I live. I live in a small town in central NY, and the nearest city is roughly 40 miles away. Even more frustrating is that this city doesn't even have any internships for me anyways. There's only a few and it's only for people pursuing a 4 year degree. 

The obvious solution would be to just move to where the jobs/opportunity are, which is what I plan to do once I finish school, but without an internship I feel like I might be set up for failure if I move to another city/state without any work experience or job security. 

I'm just looking for any advice on what moves I should make next to find work/experience. Or if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what they did."

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc. 

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I also working for the IT department on campus 15/hr week right now, Tier 1 helpdesk. Trying to pick-up a second job too (can't afford tuition). I am also working on side projects to which I can add to my resume.

I have also seen my classmate, with BS in Physics and Comp Sci. end up at places such as HP, BP, Google, Abbott etc.
I just don't want to go through the same things I did after getting my BS (unemployed for a long time, found work in data entry).

Discouraged and Fed Up :(,livingwithanxietyYYC,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/5akai9/recommendation_for_doctors_with_experience_with/,"Hey everyone. I am a 21 year old student at the University of Calgary living with generalized anxiety disorder. It started almost 2 years ago when I got an internship that was very stressful and unfortunately, I started having panic attacks. This spiraled into a full-on anxiety disorder that I have been dealing with ever since.

My family doctor was useless during this whole process and immediately just prescribed me Cipralex. He didn't explain anything or was not there during the process, he just put me on a dose. Initially, it helped me but only for the first few months. After that I just plateaued. I recently got off my Cipralex after 1 year and pretty much feel the same as I did when I was on it. I switched doctors in hope of finding someone better, but this doctor was even worse, as he initially suggested me just getting off my meds cold turkey (even though I explained how sensitive I am to the medication) and was more concerned with giving me a prostate exam then my anxiety disorder (which is the sole reason I went to see him).

I am very frustrated and discouraged with finding a doctor that has knowledge on anxiety and mental illness. I want to get help and get better but it's proving very difficult.  Currently, I still have significant issues with my anxiety that disrupt my daily life and prevent me from being happy and productive. If anyone can suggest any doctors that actually have a background with dealing with anxiety disorders, it would be so helpful for me. I am trying to remain positive but I have already tried medication, counseling, CBT and some other natural remedies without much success. I just want my life back because this has made me very suicidal and hopeless as every day is a challenge for me as I am living in a constant state of fear and anxiety."
5akb4n,12,2016-11-01,I really need your advice MFTs.,aves_galore,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5akb4n/i_really_need_your_advice_mfts/,"To give you some background, I'm 25 years old and about to apply to graduate programs in Southern California (specifically San Diego) for my Masters in Marriage &amp; Family Therapy. My longterm goal is to become a therapist and work at a private practice and/or at a school where I could provide therapy for the students. 

I wrestled with getting a Psy.D and decided against it due to cost, time, and indifference about performing assessments. Yes you get priority when hiring, and a pay increase, faculty opportunities too but I'm not even sure if I would be guaranteed to make more than 65-70k per year and taking into account the 100-150k tuition a Psy.D is definitely a long term investment. 

I wrestled with getting a MCSW but I decided against it because of the case management focus in the program, even though you usually have priority when getting hired based on my limited understanding. I'm more interested in the counseling focus and not providing community resources. 

To sum this all up, I'm following my heart about to commit to the MFT despite maybe some logic and potential, but I want your advice. My desire is to learn the material in an MFT program and focus on clinical work, maybe one day own a private practice or work for a school. Because you have gone before me and walked down this arduous path, I want all the wisdom I can get from you before I make this huge decision. 

I'm hoping you guys can give me your very honest take on four questions:

1. How much does it matter where you graduated from when looking for a job/establishing a private practice? I am looking at COAMFTE accredited schools, specifically University of San Diego, and Bethel Seminary. Both are accredited, but USD is: 84k in tuition, 2 year program, with excellent faculty based on my research. And Bethel Seminary is 34k, 3 year program (although the schedule allows for you to work part time), commuter campus, with weaker established faculty (11 are adjunct, not Ph.D's or Psy.D's and only 3 full time professors). My husband thinks that USD will afford me better chances to network, job opportunities and respect from potential clients. But I think that the extra 50k (my husband already has 60k in grad loans we need to pay off) in tuition might not be worth it to come out with the same degree/accreditation with those possibilities only being hopes. I'm willing to work hard, put the time in and make the most of my Bethel Seminary experience, but I'm wondering if it will hold me back in the future graduating from a less known, established, program without the same resources USD has. What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone graduated from either of these schools?

2. With regards to your MFT degree/internship/licensure/career, if you could have done anything differently during the process, what would you have done differently? I'm so interested in everyone's feed back on this question. Thank you in advance for the response.

3. School system related question: I recently spoke with a LCSW who works as the Student Support Director of a well funded private school. When I asked him the question above he told me that he wouldn't have ever started a private practice and worked the difficult hours (what hours do you guys typically work in private practice?) until sometimes 10pm at night. He said it strained his marriage and it was often like ships passing in the night, juggling 2 kids and that schedule. He mentioned working in a school now was the best career move as it has afforded him great hours, stability (no need to fill the weekly schedule with clients) and consistency. And while I'm not interested in becoming a school psychologist since I want to do therapy and conducting assessments all day isn't the reason why I'm pursuing this profession. And I'm not interested in giving college career advice as a school counselor. I'm wondering if his job as the ""Student Support Director"" or jobs that can blend therapy, working with school staff and the student body are often available positions or are jobs like these few and far between, both in public &amp; private? How hard is it to usually get jobs working with schools providing therapy for students? I know securing a school psychologist position is extremely difficult in CA as it's so saturated. Any input on the subject from anyone working in the school system?

4. And finally, how long did it take/is it taking for you to get licensed? What is difficult to complete your hours and did you get paid for your internship?

Many thanks to you guys. This has been the MOST helpful place for me to learn about psychotherapy and I'm genuinely beyond thankful I have you guys to get advice from. It honestly means so much and I will read everything even if you write a novel about your MFT experiences that you think I could learn from--I'm so interested in your input on the field."

What I do have is:

- A CS degree (complete by the time I start working)

- Experience with C/C++/Python/Java/Javascript/LAMP from coursework

- Internship experience in software development (3 month)

- Two years of lab assistant work (CS lab)

- A strong preference for development in a commandline linux environment (almost every assignment in school had to be developed, compiled, and submitted via a RHEL server, preferred editor is vim over IDE's) as well as UNIX philosophy in software

- A sincere desire to learn more about linux servers and operating systems

- Years tinkering with desktop distributions (includes working with apt, portage, compiling from source, etc)

- Experience from my networks course re-implementing protocols in python (multi-threaded, final project was a class-wide overlay network)

Basically, I'm pretty comfortable with approaching problems in linux systems, navigating the environment, writing scripts, etc. but I've never had to do anything like setup my own public bridge, use automation software like puppet, create a cluster node, administer a complex database, or really even log activity on my computer.

Long story short, graduated with a degree in Biochemistry the past spring, mostly due to being pushed into it by parents who wanted me to be a doctor and were quite relentless about it. Discovered a love for this field (as in CS) about a year ago and started coding months ago. Started off with something really simple, Code Academy. Did the Python, Ruby, Javascript, and HTML tutorials but also did the Git and make your own website tutorials.

After that, started the CS50 course and have been making decent progress in that, things have been moving along quite well recently after I got past the initial hurdle of working with C. 

Will finish the course but I feel like I am just getting to the tip of the iceberg. I have been working as a lab technician since graduating but recently applied for a ton of positions in software sales. My logic is if I can get my hands on anything related to tech, that would be better than nothing.

Recently got a job offer for an entry level software sales position, will be making more as a base salary (commission not included) with that than I would ever make as a lab tech!

I will spend time off of work (don't have to work weekends yay!) finishing the CS50 course. 

Going back for a second bachelors degree is just not an option for me right now, it won't be doable, not doing that at all. I am very open to a bootcamp because it won't take me 1+ year of my life to do and the pay off will be more immediate, confident that I will give it all I got.

But if I can get by without doing either of those, that would be great.

So after I am finished with CS50, what else do I do to get a career going in this industry? What other program or course of action can I take after I am done with CS50? I want to be a web developer.

How would entry level work look like for me? Would I have to start an unpaid internship or will some companies take a chance on a guy like me?"

I'm attempting to do the following:

* Upgrade CPU from Haswell i5 to Skylake i5k
* Replace RAM with 16GB DDR4 (current RAM has issues with Memtest86+)
* Reduce physical footprint by going microATX or miniITX
* Get rid of the CD burner

I've started looking at miniITX boards as well as cases (Looking at a Sugo13), it'd be great if someone could point me in the right direction in terms of what to look out for.

A rough list:

* Mini ITX motherboard + wifi
* Corsair H60 CPU cooler
* Trying to keep my PSU? will replace if needed
* Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM (what's a decent clock for DDR4 nowadays?)
* Mini ITX case
* Concerned about my 3 HDD/SSD

My budget is $200 in addition to the ~$250 I anticipate I can sell the MoBo + CPU + heatsink + case + network card for. I won't be selling the bad RAM.

When I asked him to elaborate, he said he's never heard of them, and would expect me to go to a more well known company or something ""better"". I rolled my eyes, but do you think he is right?

There are two potential drawbacks: 

1. I would have to attend summer class next year to graduate. This will probably happen anyway if I land an internship over the summer, in which case dropping the class won't affect my schedule.
2. I'd use my one yearly mulligan drop. If I fucked up another, harder course, it could set back my degree.

I worked in house this past summer. The experience was fantastic, but they don't hire recent grads. My first summer I worked for a small firm, which has now become a solo practice with a not so great reputation in my city. So between my two summer internships, neither is going to employ me post-grad. 

I'm very interested in transactional work, especially real estate. However, I am also interested in JD advantage positions like compliance or government relations. Unfortunately, the real estate field in my city rarely hires entry level associates (I've been applying regardless) and the companies hiring compliance officers want someone to start in the next month or two. I don't graduate until May.

The fields that are currently hiring in my city are insurance defense, family, personal injury, and veterans benefits. Unfortunately, I am not interested in any of these areas, and none of them are closely related to my ideal practice areas. I'm torn between choosing to take a job I dislike (assuming one of these firms hire me) just so I can have a job and get some legal experience, or holding out and hoping that the right opportunity pops up before I pass the bar exam. Fortunately, my husband has a job that can support both of us for a little while, but I don't want to hold out for my dream legal field for too long.

Will entering a field in non-related practice area set me back on my goals? Should I hold out for something I'm interested in? I don't want to get permanently ""stuck"" in a practice I dislike and hate my life every day I go to work. I also feel like accepting an offer in a field I dislike and later turning it down for a more appealing offer is something I shouldn't even consider. Is it too early in my 3L year to start considering accepting any job I can get? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

**VIEWPOINT:**

The bigger picture of risk

Understandably in the world of nuclear, risk management is focused on safety. Wider considerations of longer term strategic risks and short- to medium-term project risks can easily be neglected. A broader approach in which risk management is embedded across your organisation could be key to improving overall business performance, writes Val Jonas.

Ideally, risk management should be an integral part of every business process for organisations working in waste and nuclear. However, the nuclear industry is unique in some of the challenges facing it.

If we start with the extreme time-frames we work to, effectively our industry life-cycle spans decades. Already this complicates the decision-making process, and sets the scene around the scope of risk that organisations need to factor into their management approach. For example, horizon scanning becomes necessary, taking into account threats such as catastrophic terrorism, cyber-crime as well as those posed by the natural world like earthquakes. We're contending with such huge risks - climate change and how this affects rising sea levels - that risk takes on an enormous role.

I performed reasonably well in the interview, and later that day I received an invitation to a dinner with a cohort of Yahoo! engineers and interns at Keg. At this dinner, I was told that I would receive an offer from Yahoo! within the coming weeks. I asked very specifically whether this was a ""maybe"" or a ""yes"", and I was told in no uncertain terms that it was in fact a ""yes"".

I received no communication from Yahoo! after that night, and today I discovered that I wasn't even ranked by them on Jobmine. I fortunately had other, better options in hand, so this wasn't a major problem for me personally (this is also the reason why I didn't reach out to them earlier in the first place). That said, if I had halted my job search after receiving the offer I could have potentially been left jobless - basically I dodged a bullet.

I know that it's not smart to count on an offer without written documentation, and if I really wanted to work for this company I should have actively maintained contact with them. Even still, I find it pretty alarming that they would break a verbal agreement like that without any warning or explanation. Is this par for the course? Should I have seen this coming? Should this sort of incident be reported to CECA, or is my concern overblown?

I have never cheated on my wife, I have been involved coaching sports and being there for my kids since they were born. Although marriage can be tough sometimes, I feel that its important for a husband and wife to stick together to create a great family environment for kids to thrive in. 

With that being said, I am a man and even though I am older and more mature, I still have needs. I feel like my mind is the same as it was 20 years ago, checking out the same girls I did in college. I think that is probably true for most men my age. 

I have two college aged kids and I run a business that has an internship program in the summers.  I have a decent amount of contact with college aged girls, however I always act in an appropriate way.  I ask them about school and how their classes are going, meanwhile I notice.  I notice how hot they look in their tight yoga pants or low cut shirt, I freakin notice everything, but I keep it all inside.

Tonight I don't want to keep it inside and always say the right thing and be Mr. Appropriate.  I want to talk to girls in their 20's the way that I wish that I could in real life.  I don't want a roleplay but rather an open and honest chat with a college aged girls or perhaps older who would enjoy an open, honest chat with someone like myself.  If you ever noticed a boss, a family friend or just an older man in the store, then I would like to talk to you.  

Let's chat and just be honest with each other for once.

Thanks of reading.

5an0fu,0,2016-11-01,Age discrimination in Silicon Valley?,age_discrim_throwawa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5an0fu/age_discrimination_in_silicon_valley/,"Hi everyone. I'm a 25 year old Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate student at a prestigious university in the U.S. I have had two internships, one at a large, well-known company, and another at a small startup. I hope to not sound arrogant, but I'm quite a good programmer and student (teaching assistant, extracurricular hackathons, personal projects).

Recently, I was called for an on-site interview at a small but well-known tech company in San Francisco. Again, I hope not to sound arrogant, but I absolutely smashed all of the technical questions, as well as behavioral ones about prior work experience and so on. So, I was understandably quite surprised to be rejected by them recently. 

What immediately came to mind was a strange interaction with my would-have-been manager. She said that I seemed a bit older than the typical college senior. I acknowledged this, and she asked me ""what my deal is"". I answered her questions with honesty and tact. 

I do honestly feel as though my age and maturity has been an asset to me in the pursuit of my CS degree. I had to work *so* fucking hard, straight out of high school, just for attending university to be plausible. I was even accepted in to my furthest stretch university, which has one of the best CS programs in the world.

Aside from this manager, every single person who interviewed me was a couple years younger than me. And I am now considering the possibility that they felt as though my atypical circumstances were a red flag for them - perhaps they felt that an ""old guy"" being junior to younger programmers would create tension in the team.

This is immensely concerning to me, as I feel that a similar dynamic may re-occur in my future interviews. So, I turn to the learned minds of /r/cscareerquestions to either confirm or assuage my fears. Even more importantly, I am strongly considering seeking legal recourse against this company, as I am quite sure that I have been wronged. I believe that they should be outed for their unethical behavior, but I worry that doing so outside of a rigorous legal framework could damage my reputation.

One last important note - I did share the questions and my solutions with one of my professors while seeking her advice. She confirmed what I already knew - that I gave optimal solutions; even going so far as to prove that my solution was a lower bound on the time and space complexity of the problem! I understand that this was a violation of the NDA that I signed, but I don't anticipate being an issue if I pursue legal action (unless of course this post is linked back to me - whoops!)

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks =)"
5an0m8,2,2016-11-01,Need to decide my professional future,aguirre28,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5an0m8/need_to_decide_my_professional_future/,"Hello Reddit! I really need your advice with this important decision about my future, and I am not sure what to do.

I am studying Mechatronics, only 3 more courses to take and a couple exams to do in order to graduate, however I need to cover my internship hours which I am doing in an automation company as a robot programmer that works for different car manufacturers (VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, etc).

This means, I need to think about my professional future. And here's where I need your advice. Right now I need to decide between these two options:

**First Option**




Stay at the company where I am doing my internship as an employee since they offered to hire me after my internship. I like what I do, coworkers are great and I am learning a lot, also the company paid an expensive programming certification and I have a monthly income that's 30% above the avarage salary of a recently graduated engineer (in my country), I even got a 30% raise of my base salary  after working here for 3 months. I could build a succesful laboral career from here, and have economic stability in the future. However this job consumes all my time, to the point that I am afraid I am putting on risk to be able to finish my degree. I work a minimum of 54 hours a week, 70 avg. and there have been weeks where I have to work 80-90 hours. I feel like I have to sacrifice all my time for a stable and succesfull career. In other words it makes my life less enjoyable, and makes finishing my degree really hard but not impossible. Don't get me wrong I like what I do in the job, it's just that the time I have to put into it's killing me. So, being more clear the advantages of staying are:

Advantages:

* Economic stability and good monthly salary.
* Expensive certifications that could help to find a better job in the future.
* Fair oportunities to grow in the company.
* I like what I do in the job but it gets repetitive with time.

Disadvantages:

* I have ~~almost~~ no free time, making it really hard to finish my degree or even spending time with my GF or family which is really important to me.
* I dont see my self living this lifestyle in the future, I would even prefer earning less money but having an actual life to enjoy.
* Probably I wont have to chance to start a business in the future, something I have always wanted to try.




**Second Option**




Since I'll finish my internship in 31st December I can choose not to stay at the company and now my cousin who is a co-founder of a small new bussiness, that develops specific projects that different companies asks for,  invited me to join as a co-founder. This business recently got a 250K USD fund for one of their projects that won a big Start-Up event. They have done some ""small"" projects, Polaris (Off-Road Vehicle brand) being their biggest customer so far. Almost all the money earned is being re-invested in the company to make it grow, which means there's not a stable monthly income,  and it could even be $0 if there are no projects to develop for that month. I feel like this could be a really good oportunity to give my self a chance to start something of my own (since I would be part of the team, not just an employee) instead of having to work for someone elses. 

Advantages:

* I'll have ~~more~~ time to finish my studies since I would work with flexible schedules and do stuff that I enjoy.
* I can work in any project I would like to develop.
* The work environment is even better than in the other company
* There's a lot of potential with this small bussiness, a 250k USD fund is a huge thing. I could earn more money in the long run than in the company I am currently doing my internship but of course it's not guaranteed.

Disadvantages:

* No monthly income nor economic stability (which I dont really need since I still live with my parents, which is really common in my countray at my age and I have no debts nor student loans to pay).
* There are NO oficial certifications that could improve my CV for other options in the future.
* Even with the 250k USD fund, the bussiness could never grow and stay in the past just like as a life experience thus having to start from zero looking for a job

I dont know if this might seem like an easy choice for you, but I feel like I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or to ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also the satisfaction of try something I've always wanted to"".  

Also I think it's important to mention that I dont need the economical stability right now and I can afford the risks of the second option I just don't know if leaving the safe option is a good choice.

Thank you very much for your time and your advice is really appreciated!

**TL;DR: Regarding my laboral future I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also having the satisfaction of trying something I've always wanted to"".  Taking into account that I dont need economical stability right now and I can take the risks and consecuences of choosing second option.**

i was set on taking it with William Fruin based on rmp but the only times available are ones that conflict with a potential internship i'm looking to get into. 

there's morning classes for other professors but a classmate taking Robert Wood totally freaked me out, telling me there's a crap-ton of work for his class. i'm pretty desperate to avoid teachers like him for my last semester so any and all advice would really, really help me out. thanks so much!"
5an2et,1,2016-11-01,Winter co-op job choice,coopchoice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5an2et/winter_coop_job_choice/,"Hello,

I am deciding between two offers for co-op positions this winter. This will be my second co-op job.

One position is for a Software Engineering Intern at a Toronto based company which helps ""major brands with their connected device needs"". This means I could be working on a variety of projects and platforms (smart watches, Android/iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Oculus VR...). 

The second offer is for an Android Developer Intern at Kik (the messaging app) in Waterloo. 

I am gravitating towards Kik because they are more well known. However I worked as an Android Developer over the summer and do not want to ""pigeon hole"" myself into being an Android Dev for the rest of my life (this probably won't happen, but still I want to expand my horizons, ya know?). Since the first company is a consulting company, the project I would be working on depends on what active projects they have when I start, so I could end up on an Android team there too...

Thanks for any advice picking between the two! "

I don't think that I have periods of depression is helping either. I'm able to fight off the thoughts but I worry that some day in the future I might not be able to. Even typing this is making me cry so badly. I'm currently working at an internship which helped to give a bigger sense of worth but the fact when I think that no girl has ever been interested in me really makes feel depressed and now even suicidal in thinking that maybe there is no one out there for me. I'm not sure at all what to do, I keep forcing myself to press on but each day feels both physically and mentally exhausting. I'm also not sure if what happened recently (A girl I kind of liked and wanted to know better turned out to have a boyfriend) is affecting this completely or what but I'm trying to deal with this. I think I might just never find a girlfriend and I can't really deal with that because I currently have an outwhelming desire to get a girlfriend and be able to spend time with time even through bad times. Also as a sidenote I am currently 22 but I am on the autism spectrum so some things seem to come slower than others such not tying my shoes until around 15 and only recently making some progress in terms of being able to drive. There are other things as well but it might be easier to look them up (noise, not detecting nonverbal). It just really hurts though to feel so useless that no one loves me (excluding my parents). Also my parents and others seem to keep saying ""things will get better and work out"" yet I can't seem to believe them when it doesn't feel like it will at all. I'm currently not making money (though maybe that will change if I can stick through this) and feel extremely lonely as well even since I graduated from college. To be honest I think my depression seemed to start in college due to the stress of having 6 classes at once and not being able to balance things well and even since it's just continued to be there. I personally don't hide my emotions in real life yet I feel worried a lot and not as happy as I used to be. My attempts to try and become noticed on youtube are terrible and I don't really have time to even upload really unfortunately and things just aren't working out. I do extremely long to meet a girl that will be right for me but sometimes I really wonder whether that person even exists. Lately I haven't even been able to control my dreams to be peaceful and I haven't been sleeping that well either. I'm just not sure what to do can anyone help?"
5anpwv,8,2016-11-01,[Urgent] My friend was assaulted and thinks she has to stay,PrimeOfFate,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5anpwv/urgent_my_friend_was_assaulted_and_thinks_she_has/,"I’m writing this because my friend was assaulted today and she needs help. I’ve known her and her partner for a long while now, but several states between us has made it impossible for me to help more than I can from a distance and being poor myself. 

Her partner is all she has. Her family is long gone or long dead. They grew up in the foster system together and have lived together for a while. However, to someone who majored in Criminal Justice and is very familiar with domestic violence, there has been red flags from the beginning. However, my friend is on the verge of being a vulnerable adult (legally speaking) and thus hasn’t been able to see it before we met. 

When we met, her partner forced them to have their computers in the front room. He also enforced no privacy. He would pay his half of the bills, then spend all his money on games and luxuries that he couldn’t really afford instead of food for himself. While she would pay her half of the bills and for most of the food. 

He isolated her. She went to an internship, but had no allies at home or work. Their mutual friends started telling her that she had to take care of him, the house, the food. She was this horrible person and he was so good for helping her keep this place that she *had* to help him because he was her partner! 

He would take and sell her items without permission, accusing her of stealing something of his, therefore it was his right to regain that lost item. Then even when said item was found, the money he got from the item was his rightfully his. After all, she must be taking other things that he doesn’t know about. /s

When they first moved in together, he agreed that the bathroom was his chore and the kitchen hers. Then proceeded to given himself enemas in the shower, getting feces all over the bathroom and refusing to clean it up. Then when she’d clean it, he would feel that it was her rightful place to clean both.

Unfortunately, she met me. Who told her that he couldn’t force her to have her computer in the front room. Sending her a long ethernet cable to wire her computer in the privacy of her bedroom, where he couldn’t spy on her interactions, couldn’t just throw things at her, pull her hair. She got the gall to tell him, no he couldn’t tell her that she couldn’t hang the cable from the ceiling, so he couldn’t trip over it. The landlord gave her permission to lock her door with a new doorknob. 

However, this peace didn’t last. She couldn’t be allowed to lock herself in her room. Eating only foods that she didn’t need the kitchen for. Only coming out to use the bathroom or go to work. Then the mess would clearly be his fault! All the roaches and the trash and his things all over the rest of the apartment! Only his room was allowed to be off limits.

So he started climbing in her unlocked window, snooping, taking the money she had carefully hidden to have funds to escape. But she couldn’t know it was him, right? She takes things all the time! Her money belonged to him!

Then when he finally isolated her to the point that she should be his grateful cleaning slave that gives him money, that stupid friend she had online was distracting her from her duties! He had to take the router, and the house phone and her escape funds and go to his friend’s place.

His friend was on his side! It was her job to take care of him! He was getting physically sick from her neglect! She wasn’t cleaning the kitchen and the bathroom, or the living room. No! She couldn’t have her distracting friend back until she cleaned everything spotless.

Then after she did, he came back. But things weren’t perfect! She had no right to be angry! She had no right to lock her room and keep him from the fusebox! So he had to beat her! Had to break her glasses into ten pieces! Had to split her lip and make cuts all over her face! He had to tell her friend that it was all her fault!

But now he’s sorry, but she’s got to learn her place. She’s got to learn that she is responsible for him and his actions.

Now… replace partner with brother or in this case, Nbrother. That is why the officer didn’t arrest him. That’s why the women’s shelter won’t help her. That’s why she’s staying because people keep telling her that he’s family. He’s literally her only family member and he assaulted her.

I'm at the end of my rope. She feels like she has to stay to save up enough money to at least put her stuff in storage and come up here, because I haven't been able to save anything because of starting a brand new job. She doesn't even have that much, but I don't have the money to drive down there and drive back, or fly down and drive a moving truck up for her (glasses are broken, so she cannot drive and cannot afford new ones).

Please, give me advice."

From 21-24 I attended college and worked construction (731 laborers union) - I was setup with a asbestos removal company and worked all over long island, staten island, queens, etc. The work was sporatic but was perfect considering I was in school.

Towards my last year of school I decided to take an internship through my college to help me land some type of career when I got out of school (I was working towards a degree in business management).

I ended up finding an internship right down the block from my college for marketing at a vitamin &amp; supplement company. The internship was very interesting, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. The web developer / marketing manager took a liking to me and trained me on a lot more than what he was supposed to. I really ran with the opprotunity...once my hours were complete they asked me to stay on board part time...and after a few months full time (construction basically phased out of my life at this time).

After a year here I felt the need to grow and the web dev/ marketing manager (who I had now become very close with) told me about a job opprotunity at an advertising agency in NYC his brother worked for as digital media analyst. I'd basically be working on his brothers team who was the director of analytics. I was very nervous to work in NYC (I really hate crowds). but I took the shot and started the position. After a year I was promoted to manager, after 2 years my director left and joined up with his brother to start their own consulting firm.

I ran the department for 7 months until I was laid off. I have to admit the last year there I was miserable. Commuting to the city from long island everyday, constant stress, the agencies refusal to staff up. 5 other people were laid off along with me (the agency is in bad shape).

Now it's been 2 months and honestly, I feel so lost. I don't know if I want to go back into advertising, I'm like 3 classes from getting my bachelors, I have debt piling up and the freedom feeling of not having to work is sort of turning into a depression.

I don't exactly know why I am writing this, I guess it would just be nice to know if anyone has been in this position and could tell me how they managed to get out of it?

I'm a successful 22 year old engineer.. I am also handicapped.. Brain damage during birth left me with a droopy right size.. I can still walk, but my hearing is poor, I limp, and I don't talk.

You know.. I've accepted this.. my handicap itself has never gotten to me.. Certainly, it sucks that I can't backpack through europe or do 5km walks but.. I'll live. What has gotten to me is the social aspect. I was always a pretty happy kid, but then I grew up, got into girls, kids no longer had to be my friends (in elementary school, teachers will be like.. go play with him, or the novelty is high)

Now, here I am at 22 with basically 3 friends I never see that I give a shit about, and I'm a virgin too. It isn't that I'm antisocial or mopey too.. I communicate, I laugh.. People just don't give enough of a fuck to get to know me unless they have to. (by have to, I mean.. coworkers with no friends, nobody around, etc.) I go out drinking every week with coworkers that don't really think of me as one of them.. I mean.. yeah they're friendly and talk to me, but its an acquaintance type deal..

Usually, there's a bit of novelty in me, but then people get bored. I don't bond. And don't get me wrong.. I'm far from perfect.. I don't always have interesting shit to say, and I can be pretty salty now and then, but ultimately, I think I'm a nice person deserving of love.. But I don't know love.

Being 22 and having been on like.. one date..is depressing. Truth be told, theres been a couple girls.. One I liked in highschool, but strung me along and cut me out.. One in Uni that had a bf and I was kind of 'seeing' for a while until i got my head on straight.. and a few unattractive ones with hideous personalities that I only saw out of low selfesteem and loneliness. but its been a few years now, and I can't even get a girl to show me the time of day.. nevermind an attractive one who I actually want to be friends with. this alone has driven me to chronic suicidal thoughts..

i don't think it would take much for me to be happy.. I was pretty happy this summer even without any hope at dating..

I made good friends with some interns at work, and for the first time I felt like I belonged.. i have had groups of friends before, but this time I felt like... An equally integral part of this friendship.. I felt like people would miss me if I was gone.. I'd be nagged to go to events.. but then their terms ended, and the one flew away back to school and the other simply won't talk to me. I felt her slowly slip away near the end like it usually happens with all of my fucking friendships.. starts with daily communication and turns into nothing.. I thought these ones would be different...I forsaw them at the wedding i'll never have.. I brought it up to her, and she basically said I was intense and she can't keep up.. some bullshit like that. And yes, I got needier as she got scarcer, but I was farm from intense. I just got insecure because I don't have many people I really care about and she became one of them and I didn't want to lose her. I loved her..now I think she's kind of a cunt.. takes 2 seconds to respond to a text to someone trying to stay in your life.. I tried explaining this to her, but got silence. though, she likely thinks I like her despite my explicit statement otherwise lol (said something like friendship was all I want). It was completely platonic though.. I can admit it otherwise.. I'm hugely guilty of falling for female friends, but tbh her face irked me and she didn't really have a personality I'd want to date.. i loved her as a human, but romantically, not even a little bit.

Every time I think of that, my heart just wrenches and I'm back in highschool sitting in the garage wishing I could kill myself without hurting my family. I don't think its any one thing in particular.. It certainly isn't HER, but rather the idea that I finally got myself in a place where I was happy/fulfilled and then it was like.. Lol fuck you, nobody gives a shit.

this post has no common theme or question..Idk where I'm going. Just needed to vent I guess. I've never wanted to die.. I've only ever wanted to be happy.. but death has periodically felt like the only option, because happiness has not. I've always fixed my problems.. they told me I'd never walk; i walked. they told me I'd never graduate highschool; I'm an engineer. They told me I wouldn't get good work, fuck you I drive an M325I... but this.. this i feel helpless with and I hate it. i can't make girls want to fall for a slobbery whatever i am. I can't make people be my friends. I can't fix any of this."
5anwed,5,2016-11-02,¿Should I choose a well paid stable life consuming job or unstable (might be stable in the futue) enjoyable job?,aguirre28,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5anwed/should_i_choose_a_well_paid_stable_life_consuming/,"Hello Reddit! I really need your advice with this important decision about my future, and I am not sure what to do.

I am studying Mechatronics, only 3 more courses to take and a couple exams to do in order to graduate, however I need to cover my internship hours which I am doing in an automation company as a robot programmer that works for different car manufacturers (VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, etc).

This means, I need to think about my professional future. And here's where I need your advice. Right now I need to decide between these two options:

**First Option**




Stay at the company where I am doing my internship as an employee since they offered to hire me after my internship. I like what I do, coworkers are great and I am learning a lot, also the company paid an expensive programming certification and I have a monthly income that's 30% above the avarage salary of a recently graduated engineer (in my country), I even got a 30% raise of my base salary  after working here for 3 months. I could build a succesful laboral career from here, and have economic stability in the future. However this job consumes all my time, to the point that I am afraid I am putting on risk to be able to finish my degree. I work a minimum of 54 hours a week, 70 avg. and there have been weeks where I have to work 80-90 hours. I feel like I have to sacrifice all my time for a stable and succesfull career. In other words it makes my life less enjoyable, and makes finishing my degree really hard but not impossible. Don't get me wrong I like what I do in the job, it's just that the time I have to put into it's killing me. So, being more clear the advantages of staying are:

Advantages:

* Economic stability and good monthly salary.
* Expensive certifications that could help to find a better job in the future.
* Fair oportunities to grow in the company.
* I like what I do in the job but it gets repetitive with time.

Disadvantages:

* I have ~~almost~~ no free time, making it really hard to finish my degree or even spending time with my GF or family which is really important to me.
* I dont see my self living this lifestyle in the future, I would even prefer earning less money but having an actual life to enjoy.
* Probably I wont have to chance to start a business in the future, something I have always wanted to try.




**Second Option**




Since I'll finish my internship in 31st December I can choose not to stay at the company and now my cousin who is a co-founder of a small new bussiness, that develops specific projects that different companies asks for,  invited me to join as a co-founder. This business recently got a 250K USD fund for one of their projects that won a big Start-Up event. They have done some ""small"" projects, Polaris (Off-Road Vehicle brand) being their biggest customer so far. Almost all the money earned is being re-invested in the company to make it grow, which means there's not a stable monthly income,  and it could even be $0 if there are no projects to develop for that month. I feel like this could be a really good oportunity to give my self a chance to start something of my own (since I would be part of the team, not just an employee) instead of having to work for someone elses. 

Advantages:

* I'll have ~~more~~ time to finish my studies since I would work with flexible schedules and do stuff that I enjoy.
* I can work in any project I would like to develop.
* The work environment is even better than in the other company
* There's a lot of potential with this small bussiness, a 250k USD fund is a huge thing. I could earn more money in the long run than in the company I am currently doing my internship but of course it's not guaranteed.

Disadvantages:

* No monthly income nor economic stability (which I dont really need since I still live with my parents, which is really common in my countray at my age and I have no debts nor student loans to pay).
* There are NO oficial certifications that could improve my CV for other options in the future.
* Even with the 250k USD fund, the bussiness could never grow and stay in the past just like as a life experience thus having to start from zero looking for a job

I dont know if this might seem like an easy choice for you, but I feel like I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or to ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also the satisfaction of try something I've always wanted to"".  


**Some additional things to bear in mind:**

* **I dont need the economical stability right now and I can afford the risks of the second option I just don't know if leaving the safe option is a good choice.**

* The second option is not an Start-Up, but its also not a formal company yet, it's just in the process of being one. The means a lot of the formalities are not well defined but I will have the chance to give an opinion about it when the time comes.

* I am really aware of the consequences of working with family, and I feel very comfortable working with him since he's more like my brother and I know him really well. Also I don't have to invest money, just time. No one is making a living out of this business yet, it just pays for its own expenses and they are all investing time with few or none economical return hoping to make it grow.





Thank you very much for your time and your advice is really appreciated!

**TL;DR: Regarding my laboral future I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also having the satisfaction of trying something I've always wanted to"".  Taking into account that I dont need economical stability right now and I can take the risks and consecuences of choosing second option.**"

The thing is, I love pretty much all of it (though maybe back end a little more), so I can get distracted and go off on tangents with other languages pretty easily.  So in this case, I need someone to just tell me what to do (no ADHD coping tips requested).  I do need to go back to work soon if I want to keep the lights on and I would like it to be in some area of programming.  
What do you suggest focusing on right now for the quickest realistic path to landing a coding job?  
Since I make a habit of learning, I synthesize new information fairly quickly.  I'm especially intrigued with anything analytical/scientific, my background is in project management and finance, and I live in NYC if that makes a difference.  I can't afford internships or bootcamps.  I've tried looking at operational roles in the tech industry just to be around people that could help me learn more, but they're really snobby about letting people into their exclusive club.  It appears you must be born into it.  *I'm not looking for any unrealistic short cuts here, just a way to pay the bills while staying focused on learning more.

More party stuff.",not_liking_this_shit,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/5anz1a/how_many_guys_did_i_mskeout_with_more_party_stuff/,"Was just waiting for my uber driver to come pick me up so I can go back home and leave this school at least for the week. Also needed to call my boss and tell him I'm quitting my internship.  

I'm sitting here and some girls are gossiping over last night and how tomorrow and the next day will be more fun. First one says ""yeah all she cares about are guys and partying now"".... But then she starts talking about ""do you remember the guy I made out with? Were the lights even on?"" 

Her friend ""I don't know if the lights were on. I just grabbed a guy and started making out haha"" First one: ""I remember yours he was cute. well the other guy is texting me but I want to wait and go out the rest of the week and then see if he's worth it"". The friend : ""how many guys did we even makeout with?""

They kept talking but I just got way too sad to listen. 

I know stuff like this shouldn't bother me. But I got so depressed. Just like last night. These were normal girls. Not like super models but just your normal looking dorm girl. How are ugly guys even supposed to compete in college? The frats and parties let any girl in. And even with that; girls want someone sexually appealing to talk to and interact with while there. Which is natural. The girls are all going out for hot frat guys. Making out and having sex. Going to have fun. But that just leaves every ugly guy in the dust. Even going itself would get you ignored because it's all about looks once you are there. And when I did try and try everything, there was nothing. 

Again I'm aware I'm not entitled to anything. I'm aware girls like having fun like guys do. I know it's my fault for being unattractive. I know it's my fault for having social anxiety. I know it's my fault for wanting to engage in a lifestyle that's superficial, but everyone is. But what did I do wrong in order to not have a life I think is fulfilling? In order to sit on the sidelines during the best years of my life, most of which have passed me by? If life can't be fulfilling why not just off myself? I don't even know anymore. 


Idk. I just wanted to vent. I feel overwhelmed. I won't even dare post those virginity stories I heard from my roommate (yes I'm a senior in the dorms that's how sad I am). I truly think dropping out and just 'rotting' is the way to go. That's what I did over the summer and I wasn't as depressed. 

If you want to hate, go right ahead. I just really needed to get this off my chest. I figured some guys go through the same. 

On the bright side my uber driver doesn't care that I'm crying and lives near my area so he said this ride is on him :D.

I basically provide mostly in person (i.e. deskside) support for employees in our building, but I also provide support over the phone and via email. There is a national phone number that people can call to get help from the Help Desk and if the help desk people are not able to solve the problem, they assign it to our Deskside group. Would that make me Tier 2 tech support? And which looks better on a resume, Tier 1 or Tier 2? I apologize for the silly questions, this is my first real IT job."

5aoktr,0,2016-11-02,URGENT: Jobmine/Ranking Advice,lauriersux,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/5aoktr/urgent_jobmineranking_advice/,"Hi everyone, checking ranking offers/rankings today I just got a 1 offer (8 months), 1 ranked (4 months). I'm in 2A CS, sequence 3 so Winter is basically my first co-op term. Assuming if my co-op advisor approves my co-op sequence change is it still a good idea to pursue the 8 months co-op vs risking the offer and ranking it 1 for my 4 month co-op.

I've figured out the pros and cons for each of these companies, but I'm still VERY conflicted.


**8 month offer (software engineering; networking/cloud/virtualization company; private company)**

*Pros:*

pay is good, networking/cloud company (talked with previous interns, checked glassdoor reviews, and asked previous projects and they seemed very interesting), learn ALOT (cutting-edge technologies), very good company culture and everyone is chill

*Cons:*

many friends told me that I shouldn't do an 8 month co-op because the time commitment is long and if I get bored then I'm kinda stuck with it, i will be a term behind all my classmates, since 8 month coop term (2x 4 month coop terms) I don't know if I can get a cali/SV job in my ""third co-op"" term (I'm sure I will be busting side projects, Leetcode and CTCI during the second half of my 8 month co-op term).

*Possible Negotiations:*

telling the company I will be a term behind and instead of having an 8 month ""consecutive"" work term propose for 2x 4 month co-op term for my first two co-op terms at the same company so that I can still be in my same sequence and I don't have to be a term late or switch my sequence


**4 month ranked (software developer; financial company; public company)**

*Pros:*

very close proximity to my house back home (10 mins by walking distance?), 4 months; hence I don't have to go through any hassle of switching co-op sequences because I'm basically following my plan

*Cons:*

pay is slightly higher than minimum wage, the work looks very boring, company culture looks very dull, talked with previous interns and they either didn't learn a lot or the projects were basically qa testing and writing log reports even though the job title is software developer

Yeah, so basically I'm contemplating between the two options I currently have and I'm tired of interviews and I don't want go to continuous. Should I ""try"" to negotiate with the employer for a 4 month co-op term or follow my suggested negotiation above? 

Very sorry for the long post guys. Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!"

I switched majors from engineering and have been trying to cram everything in to graduate by Dec 2017 if all goes according to plan, however I'm worried about the idea of graduating without a software internship under my belt.

 So, I'm wondering if I should just not take summer courses and try and get an internship and graduate May 2018 instead. Only thing is I'm not sure if I'd actually be able to land an internship with the few CS courses I will have taken by then.

Let me give some background on my problem.

I'm an intern in an advisory company. During our projects we receive various data like monthly trial balances. Currently our go to method of analysis of this data is:  
1. Creating a database from all trial balances in one sheet,  
2. Setting up several pivot tables (up to 10-20) depending on what we want to see,  
3. Creating tables which gather data from these pivot tables for report preparation (we can't just format pivot tables because of strict firm policy about the look/formatting of tables and because we make some adjustments or additions to the data).

Now, the problem I currently have is how inefficient/non-futureproof methods of linking to pivot table are, at least to my knowledge. Currently I can see only 3 methods of creating these presentation tables:  

**Direct link to pivot table**


Pros:  
* Easy to setup-up  
* Gives ability to quickly navigate from data in final table to pivot table ( in case of need for some check-ups)  
Cons:  
* ANY update of database which cause appearance of additional row in pivot table breaks all existing links


**Using getpivotdata function (basically copying categories names next to presentation table and months/years above the  table, the function gather information from these columns/rows), then adjusting the table based on what I need to present.**


Pros:  
* Does not break after updating the database  
Cons:  
* Takes some time to setup every table and delete excess rows
* Changing anything in pivot table (switching/adding categories) breaks the function - pivot table must remain unchanged

**Copy/paste values**


Pros:  
* Very easy  
Cons:  
* Not linking makes it ultimately hard for other colleagues to reference the data (and for me after a few months whenever we have to update the report)  
* Values doesn't update with changes in database &lt;- dealbreaker


I am wondering if there's any method of direct linking to the database based on the output of of pivot table in a way to futureproof my work. For now I can't see any reliable way to create presentation tables based on pivot tables that doesn't bring any big flaw when it comes to updating or changing anything after commiting to one of those methods. Any idea would be highly appreciated."

I don’t want to try for a full time accounting clerk/book keeper because I only plan on staying there a year or less and feel that I would be wasting their time. I like the idea of doing a “rotation program” internship that some large private companies have where I would work on the GL for several weeks, then move on to A/R, then A/P, etc. The only downside to this type of internship is I want to eventually go into tax, and this would be better experience for an audit position than a tax one. I still am applying for winter internships for tax, but I am weary if I have a chance because every position is just so dam competitive.
My questions are; 

1.)	Will they even accept me after I pass the exam? I fear hitting this milestone before getting public accounting experience might signal to them that I have a character flaw preventing me from getting a relevant job and therefore I wouldn’t be a good candidate regardless. 

2.)	What other ways of getting relevant experience (internship or full time) should I consider?

3.)	Is passing the exam in 12 months realistic? The only other thing that will keep me occupied is working full time at my old job.

4.)	What would you do if you were in my position?

5apzvq,3,2016-11-02,"Stacy gets more than she bargained for - (Bathroom stuff, femdom, maledom, humiliation)",readeranon,ReaderAnonErotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReaderAnonErotica/comments/5apzvq/stacy_gets_more_than_she_bargained_for_bathroom/,"Stacy was a brat. An alpha sub. A bitch. At this point in our relationship, Stacy sort of identified as a submissive, but refused to admit it . . . but made you fight her or beat her in some way before she would submit. I don't mean, mock rape, because it was never that. No, Stacy wanted to be beaten in a game or physically overpowered and then given to the winner. She viewed her body, her sexual skills as a prize that she wanted you to win. But she MADE you fight for it, she never just gave in. She also just loved, just loved, pushing buttons and seeing what reaction it got.

She explained this to me once using the classic “caveman” story.

“I'm like a cave woman,” she said, “You have to hit me over the head with your club and then drag me to your cave by my hair, but once I am there, I recognize you as my mate and will spread my legs for you happily. Then fight you a bit and make you smack me back into my place.”

Another time, she used the example of the princess whose hand is the award of a contest that all the princes of the land come to compete for, but that she secretly enters herself. In the fairy tales, the princess bests the men. Stacy, wanted to best all the men but one and then give herself to that one for proving himself better. Then she wanted to be put in charge of the prince’s harem.

On top of this, Stacy didn't like to admit or ask me to do certain perversely sexual things that she was interested in. Especially if she viewed the act as submissive. Then asking for it would be weakness. So, she would often, when she wanted to try something new or wanted me to do something incredibly perverse to her, would maneuver me into it or piss me off to get me to go overboard. She’d leave clues and hints about what she wanted instead of asking for it.

As an example, she wanted to try being forced to be my sexy maid one time. Kept nude, forced to do housework, fucked on a whim. Instead of asking, she used it as a bet in a game we were playing. If I won, I got her as my maid slave for the weekend. If she won, I had to take her to see a musical in the city that she wanted to go to and that would be very expensive. I won and she was happy to full fill her end of the bargain.

This is one of those stories. And to warn you less perverse readers, this one might go outside your comfort zone.

I was spending the summer with Stacy. She was living in a small city about 40 minutes away from an internship I had won and as we were off again on again FWB we decided to spend the summer living together. We had explored a number of kinks including progressively more BDSM related items when Stacy asked me about why I was never submissive.

The answer is that I had a horrible experience my first time being tied up that involved almost dieing. I was already VERY dom and hadn't really been into trying submission in the first place. It was years before this happened and Stacy asked if I would be up for trying with her.

I considered it and she made me an offer. IF she dommed me. She would make the session all about me and that it wouldn't include any pain. That she would basically tie me down, tease me for a bit, sexually pleasure me for a bit, perhaps verbally dominate me and sit on my face. But that there would be no pain involved.

Now here is the thing. I knew Stacy at this point. I knew that I could trust her with my safety. I knew that she was being serious about what she was offering. BUT I also knew that she was most likely hiding something and that this was going to be a set up for something that I might not like. The idea intrigued me and made me nervous at the same time. What was she planning? What was she considering?

I decided to go for it. Her last surprise had involved sex in a department store changing room, how bad could it be.

“Ok,” I said to her, “It will be out next wager. If you win, you can tie me down and play your little game.”

“Ohhhh,” she said “And if you win?”

“If I win,” I said, “You will have to give me a nice long massage and during it you have to tell me the truth, of what you were planning and what secret thing you want to try but didn't want to admit too.”

She gave me a look that said, “that would ruin the fun,” but she agreed.

I don't really remember what the wager was over. Something later that day, an argument over an actor in a tv show or something. This was before IMDB. The end result was that I lost though. And it would be that night that I was tied down for the second time in my life.

*

Stacy and I took a shower together and while this often ended in sex, she would only let us rub each other a bit, she wanted to save it for later. She did pay special attention to cleaning my butt and I did the same to her as anal sex was common for us. I thought she was just being playful.

She was a lovely curvy woman and as we got out of the shower I gave her butt a playful smack and she hit my hand away.

“Nuh uh,” she said, “I'm in charge for the night, you go watch tv for a bit while I get ready.”

About 20 minutes later she called me into the bedroom. She had set candles all around, there were fresh sheets on the bed and she had a few of her sex toys out including the lube. I nervously looked at the candles and said, “we agreed no pain, you aren't planning to get coy with those candles.”

“(me),” she said in a soft voice, “I wouldn't hurt you, I know how you feel about pain. I promise that I will focus on nothing but your pleasure and mine. OH and call me Mistress.” She ended with a big grin.

I laughed, “Ok Mistress.” It was hard to say it without sounding sarcastic.

She was wearing a sexy sheer black nightie with black panties, I was only in my boxers.

I shrugged. “Ok Mistress, you are in charge.”

She nodded and said, “strip.”

I pulled my boxers off, I wasn't hard yet, still nervous about those candles.

“On the bed, on your stomach,” she said. I complied and laid down on the bed. She walked around and with the rope I had bought to tie her down, secured my my wrists to either side of the headboard and then my legs, pulled apart and tied to the foot board.

She started to walk around the bed, letting her fingernails scrape lightly on my bare skin, it felt nice, and then she climbed up onto the bed, straddled my butt and I felt something warm drip onto my back. I tensed, thinking it was wax for a moment, but it didn't hurt.

I realized it was some sort of lube or oil that she had warmed and then, as I felt her panties on my ass, she began to massage my back and shoulders. She rubbed a warm oil into my shoulders, and my back, the whole time grinding her pussy against my ass, my legs, my arms. She would straddle my arm and rub her panties up and down its length while she kneaded a shoulder. She pushed her clit into my thigh as she did my back.

Then she did my legs, reaching between and up a few times to rub my cock. It didn't work well. I know there are videos of guys whose cocks seem to bend behind them, mine doesn't. When my cock is hard it sticks straight out and up.

She was able to reach my balls and ass though. She knew how to handle my balls (carefully!) and we had months before began to experiment with rim jobs. She teased my butt a bit, letting her finger slide across it in a way that felt like a tongue. I was incredibly relaxed, almost falling asleep actually, when she decided to take things up a notch.

She untied my ankles and wrists and had me get into a position on my elbows and knees. She tied me back like that to the bed and then put a towel under my midsection. I guessed that she was going to rim me. We had done that a few times. What I wasn't counting on was that she had been reading up on prostate play.

I want to be clear. Up to this point in my life I had NEVER had anything pushed into my ass. I had NO interest in it at all. I had told her so a number of times and the closest I came to it was a few times that she or another woman had pushed their tongue in a bit.

I started to feel a bit exposed, but as she had promised nothing but my pleasure and no pain, it didn't occur to me that she might assault my ass. I actually made a joke about it.

“I hope you don't have a strap on Mistress,” I said.

She laughed. “No,” she said, “just my body.”

Then she moved in behind me and started to lick my asshole. As she did, she reached in and under me, her hands still covered in the oils from the massage, and began to stroke my cock.

She had great stamina and I just relished the sensation and felt her hand stroking my cock to an orgasm when her mouth pulled away from my ass. “Remember,” she said, “you can't cum without permission.”

I laughed at that but said, “sure mistress.” and felt her lean back in to slide her tongue across and around my asshole.

I find rimming to be a pleasant sensation. It's nice, but alone the pleasure would barely even be enough to get me hard. I do however, find rimming to be very hot mentally. I love humiliation and it's hard to not view someone licking your asshole, even if you are tied down, as being humiliating for them.

So the feeling of her tongue on me, of it sliding a bit deeper into my ass and her hand stroking and stroking my cock, lubed up and warm, sent me close to the edge of orgasm very quickly.

“Mistress,” I said, trying to sound humble and subservient. “May I please have an orgasm.”

She stopped rubbing my cock immediately and her tongue left my ass. “No,” she said and I admit that I groaned in frustration. I felt her tongue go back to my asshole and her fingers began to lightly caress my balls. After what felt like hours, her hand went back to my cock and started to stroke again.

Again I grew close to orgasm and she stopped as soon as I asked to cum. We waited and she started a third time.

This time though, she taunted me. “How badly do you want to cum?”

“Very badly . . . mistress,” I replied. She giggled and started to lick my asshole again.

Her hand quickly whipped me into a frenzy and I asked to cum, expecting her to deny me. She did . . . but she didn't stop stroking me. Instead, her mouth left my asshole and I suddenly felt her finger, heavily lubed, pushing its way into my back door.

The shock was enough to keep me from orgasm.

“WHAT THE FUCK,” I roared.

“Does it hurt,” she asked, pulling the finger out.

It didn't. It felt strange, but didn't hurt at all.

“No,” I admitted and felt the finger push its way back in.

“Well too bad, then,” she said, “I promised no pain.”

“You know I am going to make you pay for this,” I said to her and felt her start to fuck the finger in and out of my ass as her hand kept stroking my cock.

“I'm counting on it,” she said, “you may cum as soon as you are ready.”

The finger in my ass was strange. She was fucking me with it and I felt no pleasure from it, but still, the hand on my cock was coaxing me closer and closer to orgasm and finally I came pretty hard.

I don't know if I'm just not a prostate guy, but I've never found anal penetration to add anything to my orgasms. When I was done Stacy pulled her finger out of me and said, “Holy shit, I see why you love anal so much, that was fun and your asshole like spasmed when you came.”

I grunted, still recovering and manged a vague threat about what was going to happen to her when she untied me.

She laughed and said, “Sorry bucko, you are going to have to wait, I'm not done with you yet.”

She left me tied and went to the bathroom to clean up. I did this to her all the time, so it was fair. When she came back, she pulled the towel away and tossed it and then untied me and had be get onto my back, tieing me spread eagle again.

Stacy tied me down to the bed, on my back so that I was spread eagle. I was still a bit miffed about my asshole invasion but figured the mild odd feeling it gave me was worth the price that I would take out on her hide. I knew that if she did something like that to me, it meant she was looking for me to really take out some frustration on her ass later.

I thought it was over and that the finger in the butt was her secret little plan, but I had no idea how far or how perversely she planned to take things.

She climbed up onto my face and lowered her cute pussy onto my face. She didn't have to tell me what to do and I started to lick and suck at her clit. I don't have a long tongue, but its a strong one. She was being careful to not smother me and was holding onto the head board.

This wasn't a strange position for us, she had sat on my face a few times, just never when I was tied up.

I licked and licked. Long enough to make my jaw start to ache when she finally started to gasp and pushed her pussy a bit harder onto my face than I would have liked as she had a long shuddering orgasm.

She recovered and turned around, facing my feet. She moved to straddle my lap and then pushed my cock against my stomach. I was half hard and she moved into one of her favorite teasing positions. She lowered her pussy onto my cock so that it was not sliding into her, but horizontally against her pussy. Imagine a hot dog (my dick) in a bun (her labia). She angled her body in such a way that she could slide her pussy, her clit specifically, up and down the entire length of my cock and back down.

It's a hard sensation to explain. It's somewhere between actual sex and a hand job. The pussy is so much softer and wetter than a hand, but the way it grips feels closer to a hand.

She road me like that, facing away, grinding her clit onto my dick back and forth, back and forth. It felt amazing and actually began to push me close to orgasm when she finally asked, “Do you want to fuck me?”

“You know I do,” I said.

“WHAT?” she asked.

“Fuck, Mistress, yes I want to fuck you,” I answered.

“Beg,” she said simply.

The dom in me rebelled. Beg her to fuck me. She should be begging for my cock. I swallowed it though. She had won the bet and ALWAYS performed when she lost the best.

“Mistress please fuck me, please please please,” I said.

“Not good enough slave,” she said.

“Mistress I need my cock in your pussy so bad,” I said. “I need to fuck you and cum, your so beautiful and sexy and I want you so badly.”

This went on for a few minutes while she kept calmly sliding her pussy up and down my cock.

“Mistress, please let me cum in your wonderful pussy,” I said and that was the one that did it or she was just too close to orgasm her self.

She paused only long enough to line my cock up and started to fuck me reverse cowgirl. I was incredibly close to orgasm at this point, as was she and the moment she started to cum it set me off. Is their anything hotter than making a woman cum? It's my biggest weakness. If a woman orgasms while my cock is inside her, its almost impossible for me not too.

She came and I came hard. She sat unmoving as my cock shrank inside her. Finally she lifted off of me and started to sidle backward. I watched her ass, her freshly fucked pussy moving closer and closer to my face and I thought she was going to make me eat my own cream pie.

“Wait wait wait,” I started to say, drawing the line there, but that wasn't her plan. She only slid her ass onto my mouth.

“Eat slave,” she said and I did. It was much better than what I thought she was going to do and we had done rimming, both of us, a few times that summer and she enjoyed it, but liked it for the same reason I did, something a sub should do to a dom. This was her first chance to experience it that way and her last with me.

I licked her ass for a bit and cringed when I felt some of my sperm dripping onto my neck. Gross, but to be fair, I had “made” Stacy eat that sort of mess a few times and having it on me wasn't that bad, I'd just need a shower.

Then I felt something warm splatter onto my neck and chest. I was confused, it felt like water. Stacy could and occasionally squirted. BUT usually she had to have some pretty serious g-spot stimulation.

But that was all I could think until I felt the full stream hit me. She was pissing on me.

I immediately started to struggle and she responded by sitting down hard on my face so I could only yell at her through her muffling ass cheeks. For those of you wondering, since Stacy did squirt, she had waterproof liner under her sheets that was just a fixture of the bed at this point.

I was incredibly grossed out and when she finished pissing on me and lifted up off me, I was almost too mad to speak.

“Untie me,” I said softly, “Right fucking now.”

She did but was quiet about it. I could tell that she was wondering if she had pushed to far.

I stood up and splashed some piss onto the carpet by accident. I looked at her and for one of the first times ever, she looked nervous.

“This,” I asked, “this is what you wanted.”

She opened her mouth but I cut her off. “This was your little game, water sports, fucking fingering my ass and water sports and you thought it would be fun to tie me down and piss me off so that I'd get nasty dirty revenge on you, piss on you or something.”

She looked very nervous, “Normally you like it when I get you mad.”

I shook my head, “No,” I said, “I get mad and then the sadist in me comes out and I enjoy making you squeal. Do you want to squeal?”

I roughly grabbed her when she didn't answer and grabbed her pussy. It was still wet, very wet though and she actually moaned slightly.

“Then lets make you fucking squeal.”

I was dragging Stacy out of the bedroom by her hair. Stacy wasn't as much of a masochist as she was a person who wanted to be bested, won or taken. I knew that she might not like the pain of my pulling her by the hair, but that the act itself, the male dominance of dragging the nude woman by the hair, would turn her on. It was very cave man of me after all.

Plus, I was irritated and didn't care if it hurt her. My ass had been violated, I had been pissed on, but worse, worse of it all was that instead of just telling me she wanted me to be violent with her tonight, telling me that she wanted me to piss on her, she tied me down and did things to me to get me irritated.

I don't like losing my cool. Never have. Stacy was a master of making me blow my lid though because she got off on what I did to her when I got mad and that pissed me off the most.

I had no plan, I had to piss and figured I would pee on her, but that didn't feel like enough. Walking to her bathroom in her apartment brought you in full view of her kitchen. That gave me an idea.

I pulled her to the kitchen table, threw her into a chair and opened her fridge. I grabbed a beer, glass bottle, popped the cap with a bottle opener that hung on her fridge handle. Stacy was a big beer drinker, over the course of most nights she would throw back a six pack. I spit into the bottle and then handed it to her.

“Chug,” I said, “I know you can and if you don't swallow it fast enough I'm going to fill the rest of the bottle with piss.”

It was a real threat, but also a test. How far did she want to go with this piss stuff. She could chug easily, out drank me EVERY time we tried to race. If she finished the bottle at high speed, it meant she didn't want to drink urine. If she went slower than normal, it meant she wanted me to make her drink my piss.

She downed the bottle at high speed, a tinge of fear in her eyes. It was a new look on her, a “uh oh, did I push him too far” look. It made me hot.

I grabbed another bottle, popped the cap and then roughly forced her legs apart. I slid the cold glass neck into her pussy, fucked her with it for a moment then placed the bottle in front of her on the table.

“Drink it,” I said, “Or else.” She did, downing it without a second thought.

A third beer. Again to her pussy, but then, once it was slick with condensation and her pussy, I slid it about half an inch into her ass. She gasped slightly, at the cold, it was smaller than the dildo she normally used. I put it on the table.

“Drink,” I said. No threat, she knew the deal and she downed it with speed.

I paused then, got out a large shot glass, went for the bottle of rum in the fridge, poured a shot, drank it, then poured a shot and handed it to her.

“(Me),” she started to say, “You're going to get me plast . . .”

I cut her off. “I've seen you drink twice this amount.”

She shrugged and threw it back. Only a few weeks before I had sat at a table with her and 5 others and done shots competition style, to see who could drink the most and she drank us all under the table.

She did have a point though, and plus, giving her water would only help my plan. I got a glass out, filled it with water from the tap, stopped for a moment in front of her and dipped my cock into the water then gave it to her.

“Chug,” I said. She did, she had guessed by now why I was having her drink so much.

I grabbed her by one of her nipples this time and pulled her out of the chair, down the hall and into the bathroom. I sat her down on the toilet, turned to the shower/tub and pulled the shower curtain back. That is when I saw it, the enema bag hanging.

I turned and looked at her and she had the decency to blush. We had bought the bag and used it a few times. I wouldn't say that we found using the enema to be more than mildly erotic, but we both felt that cleaning her out before anal play really improved the experience. It didn't look like it had been used, it looked like she had set it up, expecting me to find it.

“So,” I said. “You thought to yourself, lets just piss on RD and then he will drag me into the bathroom because he will want to get clean, and see the enema bag, give me an enema and then fuck the hell out of my ass and make me suck his cock clean.”

She put on this uninterested who cares look and said, “Whatever.” It was perfectly designed to irritate me.

“DO NOT MOVE,” I said through gritted teeth, went to the bedroom, got the rope and brought it in. She looked at it nervously. “Not what you thought I would do, huh.” She just looked away, pretending disinterest.

I took her by the hair, lifted/dragged/pulled her into the tub and forced her to lie, on her stomach, with her face down as close to the drain as I could fit her head. The first part of my plan clicked in her head then and she struggled. She wasn't into the idea of “play” rape. She wanted to be conquered, was turned on by being truly over powered. So she fought hard, but by the time she had started, she was already face down in the tub with her knees bent, she couldn't get the right leverage and I was able, all but sitting on her back, to get her hands tied behind her back and then her ankles.

I moved off her and adjusted the ropes, she didn't look comfortable. She was nude, laying on her chest, her stomach in the tub. She didn't fit well so her shoulders seemed wedged in and her face, she was lying on her right cheek was forced into the tub by the angle. She couldn't really move her head very much. Her long long hair, I pushed to the other side of her. I turned the stopper on the tub to not let anything drain out.

“Have to pee again?” I asked. “I know I still haven't gone.”

“(me),” she said, “this is going to far.”

“I don't hear a safe word,” I said.

“FUCK YOU,” she responded. As I said, she liked to fight and lose. She didn't even like that I made us have a safe word as she felt that having a safe word admitted that she was my submissive.

I REALLY had to pee at this point. I had only a few times pissed on someone in my life and was honestly partly repulsed and partly turned on at the thought. But I stood at the edge of the tub and let loose.

I started, nervously, on her legs, pissing with great relief and slowly moving the stream to splash onto her ass, her lower back, her chest and finally, right onto her head and face. She spluttered and held her breath as my urine splashed onto her cheek and forehead, squinting her eyes shut as hard as she could.

The whole time I pissed, the urine was not draining and beginning to pool at her forehead. When I finished, it had pooled just up to the top of her cheek.

She opened her eyes and took a gasping ragged breath when she realized I was done.

“Your sick,” she said.

I bent down, pried her thighs apart enough to get to her pussy and felt her clit, it was wet.

“Your wet,” I said, “Fucking piss soaked whore gets off on being used as a urinal.”

“It's piss you idiot,” she said, she was trying to turn her face farther from the urine pool.

I slid a finger into her pussy, it was deeply wet inside. “Yeah, I pissed into your pussy . . .” I paused “ . . . maybe later.”

“Gross,” she muttered.

“Whatever, you'd probably cum from it toilet bitch,” I said. “I'm really tired of this bullshit.” I looked around, saw the enema and came up with an idea that even made me consider if I was going to far.

I took the bag from where it was hanging on a towel rack inside the shower. I went to the faucet, got the water to a warm temperature and started to fill the bag. Stacy couldn't see what I was doing.

“What are you doing up there, did you take the enema bag?” she asked.

I said nothing and when I had filled the bag, hung it back in place. The line was already attached as was the nozzle, it was a cheap bag and only used a clip to stop the line. I went into the bedroom, got the lube, brought it back in, but hid what I was doing. I lubed up the nozzle and easily slid it into her ass. It was large enough to stop her up, but not as big as many of the toys we played with.

“What the fuck are you doing,” she asked. I said nothing and pulled the clip, letting the water run down the line and begin to fill her up.

The implications of the situation hit her hard. She was tied face down in a stopped tub, getting an enema. If I pulled it out of her and she couldn't hold her bowels, she would spray it out and into her own tub and it would run downhill to her face.

“Oh fuck you,” she said and I walked out of the bathroom. She yelled, “You better not even think about it (me)!”

I got one of her bigger plugs. She yelled some choice curses. We had used it during another enema session to try having sex while she had a big amount of water inside her and it had held tight the entire session. I went back to the bathroom and started to lube up the plug. I heard her call me some vile names.

“You better start thinking about being nicer,” I said trying to sound mild. “The way I see it, you have no power left except to safe word like a little submissive. I however, have all the power and all the anger built up to do things to you that you might not like.”

She stopped cursing. I waited and suddenly heard water spraying and her making a sad whining sound. I looked quickly, worried the nozzle had come loose, but she was pissing. She had her eyes scrunched closed and her mouth held shut and was making a whimpering sound. I saw the piss spray against the side and bottom of the tub then slowly work its way down her body to add to the growing pool by her face. It was almost to her mouth when she was done. Every breath she took through her nose most have reeked.

In fact, the smell was a tad much standing above her. I waited though. Finally the bag was empty, I warned her, pulled the nozzle and forced the plug into place. She moaned and let loose a tiny bit, but it looked like clear water.

“OK,” I said. “Here are the rules. You like games right.”

“FUCK YOU,” she said, her eyes still scrunched closed.

“Nope,” I said, “Your the one who is fucked here. So here are the rules of the game. It's called truth or shit. I ask you a question and if I think you are lieing, I pull the plug out of your ass and leave you until I hear a safe word. And I mean it, I will make you lie in your own filth until you safe word, even if it takes your stubborn as fuck ass all night.”

“You wouldn't,” she said.

“Like you wouldn't tie me to a bed, given my past experiences with being tied to a bed, and piss on me,” I countered. She was silent.

“Ready?” I asked but she didn't answer. “Good! Why did you leave the enema bag out?”

Here is what is interesting about Stacy. She was all fight, all brat, but now stuck, now with the threat of violence, she began to feel like I had won. Like she had been totally taken and she entered her submissive mode. She answered me without a pause, “I thought that after I fingered your ass that you'd take it out on me. I figured if I put it there, you'd see it and decide to use it.”

“So you wanted me to force you to do a lot of anal and ass to mouth stuff and instead of just asking, you thought to finger my asshole,” I asked.

“Well,” she said, “I also wanted to try fingering your ass. I haven't done that to a guy yet and some guys are supposed to like it. But basically yeah.”

“And why did you piss on me,” I asked.

She paused and I reached down to touch the butt plug hard enough for her to feel it and she actually made an “AHHHH” sound. “Yeah, I wanted you to try pissing on me, I figured you'd do it in the tub. But not like this.”

“How then, how did you imagine it,” I asked.

“I thought you'd have me kneel in the tub and piss on my tits or something,” she said.

“Did the idea turn you on,” I asked.

“Yes,” she said. “I touched myself earlier thinking about it.”

“And I take it you are finding yourself turned on now,” I asked smiling.

She paused before saying, “Fuck you, but yes, this is much farther than I expected and gross, but sort of hot.”

I laughed at that and flicked the butt plug, it made her gasp in fear. “Do you want me to get you a vibrator?”

“Oh god,” she said. “I really fucking hate you sometimes.”

“The feeling is mutual my dear,” I said, “Do you want to cum with your face in piss or not.”

“Yes asshole,” she said.

I grabbed her two vibrating eggs. They were large and normally went inside, but in the right circumstance they were smaller than a normal vibe and easier to wedge places. I got a bit of lube on the first and managed to get her thighs apart enough to slide it into her pussy. I turned that one on to medium. The other, also lubed enough to slide past her thighs, I wedged between her pussy, the tub and her thighs. That one I turned onto medium as well and heard it clicking lightly against the tub.

Doing this got me hard and I decided a nice jack off was in order. I masturbated, she opened her eye briefly and saw and groaned. I went for speed, I had plans, and cupped my hand to catch most of the semen as I came. I bent down and smeared it onto her upturned cheek, trying to get it to drip a bit into her mouth. She liked to eat my semen, but with the urine there . . . .

“I really like this game,” I said and she only grunted. “Lets see what else we can learn.”

“So,” I said, after I had finished wiping my cum on her, “We have established that your an annoying little slut who can't just ask for something.”

“Fuck you,” she said. Her eyes were scrunched closed, the lower one was probably under the level of the urine.

“And that I've taken this beyond where you wanted,” I continued, “but despite the fact that your face down in piss, a little drunk, your still getting off on it all like some sort of sex freak.”

“Fuck you,” she said and I gave the butt plug a gentle tug.

“Careful sweety,” I said trying to keep a level threatening voice. “So lets see, what else do I want to know.” I thought for a bit. “So what else are you keeping from me that you want to try. What are you going to try to surprise me with.”

The thing about Stacy was that she enjoyed being conquered. She wanted to fight, be beaten and then willingly serve. She had fought. She was beaten and now despite my taking this to places she didn't want to go, she followed the rules.

“Well,” she said and flexed her bonds. “This might be more fun to try in the future, just without the piss and shit part, an interrogation scene. I was thinking,” she paused, reluctant but playing the part, “about stealing your car keys or wallet and hiding it and making you beat and fuck it out of me.”

I rolled my eyes, not that she could see it. Knowing her she would have picked a time when I was getting ready for work or something.

“Uh huh,” I said. “What else have you got going on that I don't know about. Anything like tonight?”

“Could you drain the piss a bit first,” she asked, “I need to go again, the pressure from the enema is making it really hard to not pee.”

“How close are you to orgasm?” I asked.

She moved in the bonds a bit, a shrug I guess and said, “I'm turned on and horny and they feel good, but the bladder and the smell are really distracting.”

I nodded, again not that she could see, “Too bad, answer the question.”

She made an annoyed sound, half grunt half gasp of exasperation. “Fine dick,” she said, “I've been wanting to have another threesome.”

“That's not news,” I said, “I want that as well, we talked about it the other day.”

“Well yeah,” she said, “but I know you and how you will be careful with a new girl. There is a girl I know that I'm trying to talk into it. She's a huge masochist and sub, she's mostly straight but we've been talking and flirting a bit. I want to be a dom with her with you, like we did with Mel I guess, really mess with her, disgusting stuff and really hurt her. I know you won't be hard with her. So the plan would be for her to mess with you all night and rile you up.”

I was both pleased and angry. She was planning a threesome, a bdsm threesome, for me . . . but was trying to do so in a way that would piss me off.

“Ok,” I said, “Lets put that one on the back burner for now. Any other little plans.”

“No,” she said. I tapped the butt plug. “No, really, I promise, no other plans.”

“Ok then,” I said relaxing. “What about hidden fetishes. What haven't you shared with me yet.”

“Oh shit,” she said.

“Eww,” I said and tapped the plug, “I hope you don't mean . . .”

“Fuck no,” she said, “just I was hoping you wouldn't ask that. My feet. I really want you to suck my toes.”

I frowned. Not a foot fetishist. I looked at her feet. Toes weren't gross if clean I guess. I said as much and asked, “Why hide that?”

Her voice was a little lower now, “because I want to be . . . . I dunno, like rewarded or something. Like as a treat or a prize.”

“Like for being a good slave,” I asked.

“Fuck you,” she countered. “Please can you just drain the piss now, I really need to go.”

I thought about it for a second. “I will drain it if you answer one question honestly, do you ever want to stop these stupid fucking games and just be my slave,” I said. “You can say yes or no and I will believe you. But I bet the answer is yes and that you are a stubborn cunt who would rather piss herself than admit to wanting to submit.”

“I . . .” she started, “n . . . .” she thought and finally I heard the piss starting.

I shook my head and watched it pooling around her face, finally rising to the level of her lips and past it some. I waited for her to finish then turned both of the vibrating eggs to high, from medium.

“Oh fuck,” she said, trying to keep the lowest corner of her mouth closed.

“You are such an annoying little slut,” I said to her. “We both now how much you enjoy this shit. We both know that you are deep down a submissive cunt who wants to serve a master.”

“Shut up,” she said, moaning slightly.

“NO,” I said. “This is who you are. You are a tied up fuck toy. You are meant to be used by a man like me. You are meant to be degraded and humiliated, left in a puddle of your own piss.”

I stopped talking to watch her response. Her body was twitching a bit, as much as the restraints would let her.

“You love this don't you,” I said harshly.

She moaned, “no . . . I like . . . its hot . . . I'm drunk.”

I reached out and touched the butt plug. “If I pulled this, I bet you'd orgasm so hard that you'd black out, to be used like such a fucking slut would get you off.”

“No, please,” she said.

“Your going to cum aren't you, your going to cum while tied up like some sort of prize lieing in filth, in piss,” I said quietly. “Do you understand what that says about you, do you get how right that makes me. Having an orgasm like this, helpless, under my control. That says everything about who you really are.”

“Shut up, shut up,” she said through moans. “Turn them off.”

“I don't hear a safe word,” I said, “Which is part of how I know its true. If you weren't truly a sub of incredible levels of servitude in you, there is no way you would put up with this, let alone get off on it. Because, we both know that its not the piss that turning you on, its the situation you are in. It's how much control I have over you. You are a slave. You are my slave.”

“No,” she nearly screamed, and then spit as some of the urine got into her mouth. “I'm not a slave, I'm a strong fucking bitch and when you untie me I am going to kick your ass.”

“Strong doesn't mean you aren't a submissive slut,” I said and turned the vibes back to medium. “Plus, we saw what happened when you tried to fight me off earlier, what always happens, I eventually when, take control of you, use your body and leave you quivering and exhausted like a whore.”

Her body was thrumming, orgasm was eminent. She said, “Please don't make me cum like this, please.”

“Admit it,” I said. “Admit what you are. I already know it and so do you.”

She was shaking, barely holding off on the orgasm. “And then you'll end this?”

“No,” I said. “I will make you cum, helpless, with both of us knowing the truth, knowing that you admitted it and when you are done we will clean you up.”

She said nothing and I turned the vibrators back on. She moaned and gasped, she thrashed in her bonds and tried to move her hips enough to dislodge the vibrator. I put my hand on her ass and pushed her down onto it.

“You don't have to say anything,” I said. “You can lay there and orgasm in the piss a strong non-submissive woman. Or you can admit it and orgasm as my strong submissive slave.”

I held her down and finally heard it, almost a whisper, “I'm your fucking slave.” and she started to orgasm hard. I put my hand under her face so she wouldn't bang her head in her convulsions.

When she finished, I gave her a few moments to catch her breath.

“Here is my offer,” I said. “For the rest of the summer. Each Tuesday and Saturday, you will be my slave. I have you at my mercy. It is my price for not pulling this plug out of your ass and making you shit yourself. My slave two days a week or the most disgusting bath you have ever had.”

She thought about it. Longer than I expected. Long enough to make me nervous. I REALLY didn't want to pull the plug. Way to gross.

“Fine,” she said, “I agree to be your slave under those terms.”

I undid the bonds. I gave her a quick rinse and then left the bathroom as she voided the enema in the toilet. We took a very long shower after that. Very long. We didn't talk much, cuddled a lot.

“You know,” she said, “I only said that stuff so you wouldn't make me shit myself, it wasn't true. I don't want to be your slave, I am just going to honor the deal.”

I nodded and gave her a reassuring smile, “Sure sweety,” I said, “I know that.”

We cuddled a bit longer and I thought of something. “Of course,” I said, “There is a new rule. No more springing big stuff on me like this. I won't tell you to stop all the small annoying crap, but no more big things.”

She nodded to that and kissed me. “Sorry,” she said.

She lived up to the agreement as well. We were only together that summer for another three weeks. But each Tuesday and Saturday she was my good little slave girl (though NO amount of being a slave got rid of her sassing me).

That night was the first and one of the only times in our relationship that she wanted and needed after care. I was a little harsh with her, but two years later, when we seriously dated, she thanked me for it. It started her on a journey to understanding herself a little better and led her to find a way to be comfortable just submitting to submit . . . occasionally."

My name is Hagan and I'm currently a Junior at Shepherd University.   I am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Sciences and a focus in Networking and Security.  I have little to no outside knowledge towards my major.  I am looking to find an internship this summer dealing with something along the lines of creating networks/how to secure a network.

My question though, is what type of certifications should I strive to get?  Some colleagues of mine have a Security+ certification from an organization called CompTIA.  After quickly skimming their website I see they also have a Networking+ certification, would that also be good to obtain?  I've also heard that CISCO certifications would be good to get as well.

If you have any advice to give me on what direction to go, just let me know down in the comments and I'll be sure to reply.

Thank you very much,

5aqmjt,8,2016-11-02,Keep on doing Android or branch out?,coopchoice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5aqmjt/keep_on_doing_android_or_branch_out/,"Hello,

I am deciding between two offers for internship positions this winter. This will be my second internship.

One position is for a Software Engineering Intern at a Toronto based company which helps ""major brands with their connected device needs"". This means I could be working on a variety of projects and platforms (smart watches, Android/iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Oculus VR...).

The second offer is for an Android Developer Intern at Kik (the messaging app) in Waterloo.

I am gravitating towards Kik because they are more well known. However I worked as an Android Developer over the summer and do not want to ""pigeon hole"" myself into being an Android Dev for the rest of my life (this probably won't happen, but still I want to expand my horizons, ya know?). Since the first company is a consulting company, the project I would be working on depends on what active projects they have when I start, so I could end up on an Android team there too...

Thanks for any advice picking between the two!"
5aqtvd,6,2016-11-02,Met someone after two years being single. Am going to start playing sport again. Potentially going to fail at least two out of four subjects in my final semester of law school because of World of Warcraft (only been playing for 3 weeks). My first exam is two sleeps away. Fuck.,Obesely,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5aqtvd/met_someone_after_two_years_being_single_am_going/,"""[I am] not prepared.""

Three years ago (at the end of my first semester), I experienced a breakup in an almost four year relationship. Didn't delete from Facbook (until this year), but did focus more on my boxing. Last year, I would take out a (novice) title in a regional amateur tournament. Was in the best shape of my life physically, but my mental state would start to crumble. Not long after, I would proceed to injure my knee at training, and would need to take a few months off. In the meantime, I got fat due to a combination of stress and depression (but I treating it with professional help, and taking anti-depressants). I guess I also really lacked discipline with my food intake, and kept eating as if I were still training five nights per week.

This year, I had basically given up on life. I did the bare minimum to pass my subjects. Though my knee was much better, I was too ashamed to go back to boxing because I had put on weight, and I kept my weight onbecause I was ashamed to go back to boxing (because I'm an idiot). I was also absolutely terrified for the future, so I just regressed to gaming and spending time with my friends.

 My grades suck ass, and (in Australia) law is one of the fastest-growing degrees, but in one of the slowest-growing industries. I had 6 months of legal work experience before starting, and another 6 weeks this year. I have basically been doing this entire degree with the fear of looming long-term unemployment around the corner.

Then everything changed: A friend hooked me up with an interview at a place she was interning. I got the gig after an almost three-year gap in my employment. That gave me a little hope for the future. Two months ago, I met someone. She's great, and I'm really excited to see where our relationship goes. 

In two weeks, exams wrap up. Good or bad, I can finally go back to boxing properly. Plus, I can at least crank in a few hundred more hours into Azeroth before results get released. Will I get another internship? Will I ever be admitted as a lawyer and work as one? Will I ever box again? Will this relationship continue to blossom? I am terrified and excited in equal measure.

To be honest with you, I just want to be a boxing coach, but I am under a lot of pressure from my family to 'make something of myself'. After seven years at university across two programs, I think they would have a meltdown if I did something blue-collar (even if junior lawyers and solicitors get paid jack shit). 

Huh. At least I now get to experience failing something because of WoW. I'm 26, and this is a first (though I have failed due to laziness and procrastination before, but not due to something as iconic as WoW)."

Which one of these places would you go to? I'm interested in the back-end side of things so I would probably be doing that. 

I feel like paypal and mongodb have the best 'names', but at the same time 84.51 is really data oriented (with hella DB questions in their interviews) so I feel like 84.51 might be great to get into 'big data' type stuff. There doesn't really seem to be much information about that company online so if anyone knows something it would be helpful!

Factset seems like a great place as well, but career wise I feel that it doesn't have the name of paypal/mongodb, and I don't have any particular interest in fintech as a career so I probably wouldn't be able to use it in that way. 

Mongodb has that unicorn/startup rep, but at the same time I've heard so many bad things about mongodb as a product so I'm not too sure how to feel. 

Anyways, thought on these companies and recommendations? "

As an ACE you will be working in a sales operations function within Microsoft Canada. 

You will be looked upon as **more than just an intern** as the organization relies on you to help drive:

1. **Business processes** (such as forecast calls, identifying areas we could be more efficient in)
2. **Business Insights &amp; Analytics** More than just being able to spit a report out that has a bunch of numbers, we need someone that can articulate what those numbers mean and help sales managers who have $100M+ businesses in understanding the state of the business.
3. **Collaboration** This role touches many different areas of the business. Not only are you a member of the high performing team of ACES and will need to work with one another as you all perform similar functions, you will need to work with the marketing, finance and operations teams to ensure your sales teams are well equipped.

**ACES are typically co-op students and ideally will be going back to school following their work term.** 
**This goes without saying, but compensation is on par with what you can expect from typical co-op roles**

**This role will start in late December 2016 and end in August 2017**. It’s a great opportunity for students to get their foot in the door at Microsoft, and has shown to be a great development program as many ACES especially from Montreal have returned as MACH’s within the company as well as used this platform to gain the skills needed to get great jobs upon graduation.

We’re looking for someone who **takes initiative** and doesn’t need others to get them going, is very analytical and doesn’t just report out the numbers but truly understands it and can articulate what it means, **passionate about technology** and is overall well rounded and wants to come kill it at Microsoft.  

If you're someone or know someone that wants to take this opportunity and run with it - send me a PM and we'll give you an email you can send your resume to.

We messaged the mods before we put this up, so they're cool with it.

The problem is, this old server is JACKED. I don't know who set this up, or HOW they set it up. There is a C: drive and a D: drive. Not uncommon. However, somehow the boot manager got split up between the two drives. The restore goes fine, but when we boot up, I get boot manager errors. I've tried a couple different setting using System Recovery, and I get a couple different error messages. 

Using the Symantec Recovery Disk, I can browse the C: and D: drive, and all of the files are there, but it's like they're not getting assigned to the correct drives. If anybody has run into something like this, or knows more about boot media, please help a brother out. Luckily this is just a backup server, so the main one is still live if I need to edit anything on there before restoring it.

I am a pretty new audio engineer. I've gone through a short, but intensive audio engineering and production program. I've also completed an internship at a recording studio, but I am finally ready to branch out on my own. 

I want to focus on mixing, as of right now due to room and gear constraints. I have a room which is in the process of being acoustically treated and some decent monitors, but not much else. 

Because of the fact that I am just starting in the industry, and don't have a lot of work under my belt, I want to cut some deals to artists that hire me to mix their work. I also want to be sure that I don't get ripped off. 

I was thinking about offering mixes for $100/song (which includes 10 hours of work. Anything beyond that will be $15/hour), with package deals that vary by project. Is this reasonable? I also want to offer some form of money-back guarantee, while at the same time allowing me to retain ""ownership"" of the mix. 

Does anyone have any advice they can offer me on business practices?

I got a new decent job a year ago that allowed me to move in with her, and she receive help from her parents to pay the rent and utilities (we split everything in half). She always struggled to find decent positions and ended up doing volunteering government jobs that led to nowhere.

Even before us moving in together, we (as I also had trouble finding a decent stable job before a year ago) supported each other into looking for better opportunities.

Problems started when, after some time looking for jobs, she got chosen for a ""internship"" receptionist job at a local company (6 months contract, she's replacing one worker in maternity leave). She regrettedly accepted the job offer even if the job terms and wage were extremely bad, mostly out of pressure she felt from her parents that so nicely helped her and still helps her. 

In short, she got hired for full time, flexible hours and, most importantly, all for a mere 450 euro/month, which in our country is less than 1/3 of the median income. She is (rightfully) complaining about how she has to do the work of two people, she get humiliated by bosses, and she is too tired when she get back home to send resume to other companies. In short, she is free labour to this company.

After all her transportation expenses, her take-home wage is about 200-250 euro monthly, which is what I make in 3 days and it's far away from a ""normal"" young-worker average wage of about 1000 euro that she should be getting for her services. When we talk about her job, she speaks like it's a jail sentence and that she's only waiting the six months to finish, so she can move on. I think this is deeply wrong, not only because it's unhealthy to work with this mentality, but also because she earn so little it's just not worth it in any way imaginable.

Since her parents are helping her, I know she feel forced to keep the job to at least prove she is trying to accomplish something. Their parents thinks that ""we have to work, no matter what"". They are still extremely supportive but, in the end, think that she should not leave this job in hoping she will get the experience she needs to get a better job in the future (at her current job she will never be offered a permanent position). 

I disagree with them, because I know how deeply this approach is hurting her and how it is lowering her self-esteem and ultimately her chance of getting a REAL job which she might enjoy in the future. I feel so angry with the fact that society and her parents think it's normal that she HAS to work long hours for basically nothing in return and I also fear she might just get stuck in low-paying shitty jobs if she keep approaching work with this attitude.

We live in Europe and our country's job market is a real mess, especially for young people. She got a degree in philosophy, and she got some experience in low paying retail jobs (including some experience done overseas). Despite all of this, I still think it's not worth to get depressed like she's becoming and be abused to basically work for free (even if it's not uncommon in our country). She's proficent in english and I know she could get a better job if she accepted that she needs to aim higher. 

I suggested that she leave the job and take time to take care of herself and send as many resume as possible. I told her I will help her expand her education if necessary (I showed her some online courses she might take) and I'm ready to help her find a new job that at least pays a living wage. 

Am I wrong in telling her to leave her current job and take time to seek a decent job?
Should I let her get some more work experience as her parents suggest for the next months?
How do I convince her she is wasting her energy and time and she should look elsewhere?


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF got a low-paying shitty job and she feel forced not to leave out of guilt from her parents helping her with rent. She has no time and energy at the end of her days to send resumes to other companies, I think she deserve better and she should just leave her current job and look for something better. Am I irrational? How do I convince her to aim higher?"

(via TwoXChromosomes),asamale,asamale,https://www.reddit.com/r/asamale/comments/5as4uv/shalune_is_a_male_via_twoxchromosomes/,"Source: [Shalune](http://np.reddit.com/u/Shalune) in [TwoXChromosomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5arrv0/going_back_to_school_as_a_woman_in_her_late/d9iu071)



As a guy, I can't speak to any part of this experience that may be different socially or otherwise for women, but this is exactly what I'm in the middle of. Here are my observations:

- Still in school, so not hired yet, but so far my impression is that most jobs only care about your credentials, not how you got them. I'm going into a technical field though, I'm sure there are some that are more youth-biased.

- Despite your age, you're still legally a student. This opens up a lot of doors for things like internships and part time jobs that most adults don't have access to.

- If you're really specifically concerned about securing employment look for a school that has a coop program. Guaranteed work experience and connections by the time you graduate.

- Student discounts on professional software. Depending on your field, research the license agreements on these. There are some where you must be a registered student to purchase at a discounted rate, but once acquired you are allowed to use it during and after school for professional work for profit.

- Look up other local student discounts. Groceries by me got 10% off on Tuesdays. :D

- Depending on your previous schooling or experience, adjusting to college work can actually be extremely challenging. I came to it after working a full time job for ~6 years and had to teach myself a lot of new skills to survive. Doing one type of task efficiently for 8 hours a day is challenging, but jumping from topic to topic while actively learning is its own separate form of challenge. Don't underestimate it.

- One of the big ones is time management. You will probably have many times more free time in college than working a job, but will also have a ton of work to do in that time. If that kind of discipline isn't something you're used to be careful about commitments and expectations outside of school until you've adapted. It's easy to overestimate how much you can take on if you're not used to it.

- But don't underestimate how helpful a campus and library are for working either. I find it a lot easier to focus and efficiently work there than even my set-aside work desk at home.

- Not sure what your situation is, but a lot of places, particularly scholarships, are less excited to give you money vs young kids. I'd still try, but I think we just don't line up with most of their visions of empowering bright eyed kids. 

- I'm in Canada, so can only speak for things here, but had no problem getting approved for student loans.

- Depending on how you connect with people, being around people primarily ~10 years younger than you can be weird.

- None of the other students will actually care, or probably even notice, that you're older.

- None of the professors will care that you're older.

- You will sometimes see or hear lazy kids being lazy and taking their time at college for granted, and it will infuriate you. So it goes :P

Hope that offers at least some useful info. If you think it'd help, be glad to try and answer any other questions too.

Either way, hope you find a way forward that makes sense for ya. *salute*"

I'm 21 years old and aim to graduate in 3 years with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently I'm not in school as I moved back home, but am re-enrolling next semester. I previously went to school for 2 1/2 years as a Biochemistry major before finally facing the fact I was not enjoying what I was doing. After a lot of self searching, consulting others, and researching online, I've set myself on this path and feel immensely better doing so.

About 10 months ago I was arrested and charged with 4 felony counts of possession with intent to distribute. I'm just a few months away from my final court date and sentencing. The good news is, my lawyer seems pretty confident I will end up with probation and not having to do time, which will be great so far as allowing me to continue with school. And, there is even a chance that I could receive a deal that expunges my record after successfully probation. Although this is unlikely and I won't be counting on it, it is still a chance.

That being said, there is nothing I can do to turn back time. I made an awful, awful choice, and will most likely have to deal with it for the rest of my life. In a sense, I am glad this happened. I was very much headed down the wrong path and surrounding myself with the wrong people, and received the biggest wake up call one could give me. This has given me a newfound focus and desire to succeed unlike I ever had before. I know that if I can overcome this, it will make me into a stronger person than I had ever imagined. I want more than anything to simply graduate and find a decent job to support myself and a family comfortably.

I can't stop stressing over this. I made a terrible judgement call but I am far from a bad person. I am dedicated to turning my life around and want employers to see that as well. Still, I fear landing a job could turn out to be hell. I'm coming here asking for advice. What can I do in these next 3 years of school to help me out as much as possible? I am dedicated to learning to code on my free time (I almost decided on computer science, but also have an interest in hardware. Considering the amount of free resources to self-teach programming, it was an easy decision). I actually find it quite enjoyable, and figure it will make me that much more employable in the future. I plan on staying as involved as I can when I am back in school in January. Research labs, volunteering, clubs / organizations, and hopefully internships over the summers if I can find a company that will accept me.

Do any of you know anyone (if not yourself) that managed to be successful in the engineering field despite criminal convictions? Any tips on types of companies or regions that may be more lenient in accepting applicants with felonies? I'm open to any advice or criticism you guys have to offer. I am dedicated to the the plan I have, but that doesn't make it easier for me to stop worrying (If you can't tell, I have a worrying problem :P).

Thank you all :)

What to do?",anonymouslyyours123,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5asfo8/interning_at_26_anxious_tired_and_stressed_more/,"I am 26 and I am interning. That's right, interning..at 26! I thought this would be the right thing to do as I am still unsure what I would like to do except to be in the Cosmetics industry. I have a plethora of experience, working in many fashion and beauty houses, but it's all a bit lost, mainly because I have no idea what I want to do! Working with suppliers, working in marketing, working in straight up data entry, working in buying - I have all this experience but I don't have any idea what I would like to do with my life.
So I took an internship, or as they like to call it, a ""traineeship"" at one of the world's most leading cosmetics company. I thought this would help me, and I thought this would be THE DREAM but I'm feeling more lost than ever. I am getting paid the lowest I have ever been paid in my life (I get paid less than a full time sales assistant for a high street shop), I get treated like crap (as expected, well it is an internship after all), my bosses are condescending towards me and I don't get along with anyone at all in the company, I am learning, but given the experience I already have I'm not learning that much, and given that I just hate going into work, I can't seem to feel like it's worth it.
I was sick due to stress, my personal relationships are suffering, and I am constantly anxious. On top of that, I'm scared that people will think I am a failure because I couldn't handle an internship at my age with my sort of experience! I thought it would be a walk in the park but it is not. I have never worked so hard in my life.
What would you advise I do? I am unhappy going into work everyday, they overwork me and I stress over the most smallest things (such as forgetting to bring someone tea or spelling something incorrect in an email)
I would appreciate your advise,
Yours Sincerely,
Seriously Stressed, Anxious and Tired."
5asfu8,2,2016-11-02,Help a Junior know what is chances are and how to improve them?,redditor623,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/5asfu8/help_a_junior_know_what_is_chances_are_and_how_to/,"Demographics: Gender, race/ethnicity, state, type of school, and hooks, if any (URM, first generation, etc.): 

White male in a Mid-Atlantic state. Junior in competitive STEM school (#1 in state). First generation, but I'm middle class, so I doubt it helps a lot.

Intended major(s): 

Biology (and sub-disciplines, namely biochem and biophysics). Possibly double major with either comp-sci or linguistics.

Academics:

ACT: N/A, will take beginning of Senior year, hopefully I'll have around a 34 composite (already have taken a practice one and got a 31 without any preparation)

SAT: N/A, taking in March and possibly June if I'm not happy with scores.

PSAT: Got a 1410 (710 M, 700 R) as a sophomore. Expecting higher 1400's for the PSAT this year.

SAT II: 800 Bio-M. Planning on taking Math II and Chem before senior year.

Class rank: Not published, told I was in the top 10% at the end of last year, and I'll probably stay around there.

UW/W GPA: 

UW not published, probably around a 3.8? 4.34W, as of the end of sophomore year. Going up at the end of this quarter by a little (Honors= +.5, AP's= +1). Also, this is accounted with marking period grades. Can anyone tell me if it's true that colleges only care about final grades. If so, I probably had around a 3.8UW freshman year and a definite 4.0 sophomore year. Expecting around a 3.8-3.9UW this year

Coursework:--

Freshman year- all honors (not allowed to take AP's), nothing interesting. 

Sophomore year- all honors and AP Bio. Also took an organic chemistry class that was pretty interesting, but not substantial in information.

Junior year- AP Chemistry, AP English Language, APUSH, and AP Calc AB. Rest honors except for a comp sci class next semester, since there isn't an honors version.

AP Scores: 

AP Psych (5)

AP Bio (4) i'm cri ;(  I studied really hard for this one

AP World (3) Not submitting. Was taking a rigorous honors version of World History, signed up for the test without studying much, and got absolutely demolished by that writing section.

Awards:

Not any yet besides AP Scholar, but I have a few that I'm pretty sure I'll get National Merit, National Honor Society, and National Spanish Honors Society this year.

Extracurriculars:

Science Ambassadors (inner-city tutoring club)- Leadership since 9th grade, and I'm the most proactive leader this year and will probably be next year too.

Academic Quiz Bowl- 9th-11th, tournament organizer from sophomore to junior year. Probably will keep the position for leadership creds, but won't be super involved in the future.

Started a non-profit that is projected to raise around $10,000 for local charities by the the time I will be applying for schools. I feel that this is probably my major hook.

Worked in a chemistry lab since summer going into 9th grade. Just cleaned for the first year, and did quality control on precious metals for the last two years.

Independent research transfecting plants with the luciferase complexes in fireflies and renilla. I got negative results, so I don't think colleges will think much of this.

Probably will have a summer-long internship at NIH, NIOSH, or WVU (preferentially in that order) through various connections. 

Schools: 

This is where I need help. I don't really know where I should go, since I don't know too many people closely that really know the college admissions process. I have a few schools, but I'm not sure which schools I have a chance with or if their biology programs are any good. I really want a small to medium school in a urban area with plenty of research opportunities. I also really haven't toured any schools, so I am going purely off of what I've read around here and other places online. Here is where I'm thinking about in preferential order.

Hopkins (prob ED), Carnegie Mellon (tied with Hopkins, might ED if I like CMU better after touring), UPenn (also tied with Hopkins &amp; ED scenario), Tufts, BostonU, Northeastern, U Delaware. 

Questions: 

Where else should I be looking? Which of my listed colleges do I have no chance at? Which shouldn't I apply to because their biology programs aren't that good?

Do colleges care about quarter and semester grades, or just the final grade? (stated above)

Is it true that you can get out of ED if the financial aid package isn't enough?

Finally, what can I do to improve my application the most? I already don't have a lot of free time, but I can make some sacrifices if I can make any big boost to my application.

Thanks!"

She started the course in September, our plan was that I would try and line up work before moving over (money being the issue) but if nothing panned out by Christmas, I'd just head over and sort it out there.

I quit my job at the start of October (stressful environment, hoped I could take a month or two off before starting somewhere new in Denmark) and moved out of our flat. I visited her for a week and everything was great with us.

We'd been doing long distance for a while, as she was in New York for most of the summer doing an internship - so while being apart wasn't ideal, we were getting used to the strain. 

I returned home to my parents place, after a few days, she had grown a little distant. We talked on the phone and she said she wasn't sure if she wanted to be in relationship anymore. We video chatted all night (both of us crying buckets) and she asked me to come visit asap. We split the cost of the flight.

She said she felt guilty about this whole situation all the time. She was worried that we met relatively young and we might be the last people we're ever with. Commitment (for the first time) was really scaring her.

These fears struck me as kind of weird. Firstly, they seemed out of the blue - we'd always communicated well and this was out of nowhere. 

Secondly, she'd always been the more keenly attached - or at least, best at expressing it. She always acknowledged how what ""we have is special"", how ""lucky we are to be young and in love"".

Back in August, I remember accidentally walking into a fight when discussing a friend of hers in the States getting married, I remarked they were really young, that marriage was a silly institution and that if I were to ever do it, I'd wanna be nearly pushing forty.

She got legitimately upset and stormed out of the room on me, saying she wanted to be married young. Fast forward eight weeks, she's moved to a new city/country, started a new course, met new people - and now she's afraid about being with only one person for the rest of her life.

------

I stayed in Copenhagen a week with her. The first few days, I had to deal with a degree of ambiguity about what was going on - but we were normal, it was nice. We talked about the future as the week progressed. 

She said she was surprised by how much she enjoyed being independent, living by herself and was really anxious about that changing, about how serious me joining her over there really was.

I listened and accepted this. I just tried to show her during that week that me being over there wouldn't inhibit her from doing what she wanted, I'd only be a source of strength and support.

I'm not a jealous type, I'm not particularly controlling - she said she wanted to got New York for a summer, I said sure; she said she wanted to move to Copenhagen, I said sure. I understand how in some relationships, partners can suffocate or at least dampen the dreams of the other, but I think I've been supportive to the best of my ability.

------

After the end of the week, she talked about getting a key cut for me in her new place, space for me in the wardrobe etc. I did a few interviews while I was over too, so it was getting real and I was feeling good about it. 

She said that forever is too scary right now, but what we have is really good and we shouldn't throw it away. I returned back home on this note, with a romantic farewell at the metro station.

Our communication for the first few days when I got back was fine, but this weekend she dropped off a bit and I could tell something was up.

On Monday she said she was feeling like she did the other week - enjoying being independent, not worrying about what we'd cook for dinner, not worrying about what we'd be doing on the weekend etc.

-------


Last night she phoned and asked to go on a break for awhile. She said she needed space to figure this out, to be alone for a while, to start missing me again. I said, isn't that what we're doing now, long distance? Isn't the time between now and the new year enough space to be alone?

I told her I'm in the fourth round of an interview with company in Copenhagen and asked if I should keep looking for work there? She said, ""can you look in Copenhagen and at home? Is that too much to ask?""

I said I don't want to go on a break, that I loved her and that this wasn't a good idea. I told her that she must be feeling this way because of distance, that when I was over there with her everything was great.

She reiterated that we met really young (she was 23, I was 25), that being forever is really scary. That she wants to date other people for a while. That lots of people go on breaks and get back together.

-----

I feel emotionally fucked. I thought we had a solid, stable relationship. I thought I was the bad person and that she was this beautiful, virtuous icon of all that is good and decent... sorry that's terribly written mush, but I'm pretty mushy right now.

I just can't believe she'd be this selfish. I'd given up a lot for her, I was trying to do everything I could to be supportive, but it isn't enough.

I've dropped everything in my life for her: my (shitty) job, my place, my life and the people I shared it with in a city I loved - and she's basically asked me to put everything on hold for few months so she can sleep with other people in the hope that she misses me enough to want to get back together.

I don't think I could accept that and still respect myself. 

I'm also questioning how she be such an integral part of my life for so long, and I not know she was able to treat people like this? I'm not sure if she's considered how I must feel in all this, it feels like there's no empathy there. 

Anyway. I'm at a loss. I don't know if we're ""on a break"", or broken up. I feel that a break is as good as a break up anyway, I'm sure if I could forgive or move past that.

But I'm conflicted, because I've never loved anyone as much as I've loved her. I really thought that big question of who I'd be spending the rest of my life with was figured out. I've had the best few years of my life with her and I don't want that time to end.

So should I get on a plane in one sweeping romantic gesture and present myself there? I feel like I should fight more for this, because it's the most important thing in my life... I guess if I go, I'll know either way - but I'm also worried about dragging out this pain even more.

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend moved abroad for postgrad with plan that I follow by Xmas at latest. She's suddenly experienced commitment phobia, wants a break to be independent/date other people for awhile. I'm really hurt by this, but unsure if I should fight for this and fly over to see her asap or just begin long painful process of letting go?"

So I have received a B4 offer for next fall. I am graduated, and pretty much won't have anything to do for the next year. I was wondering, how would I go about asking for an earlier start date? Do things like that actually happen? What can I do in the meantime while waiting? I was wondering if I would be able to start in January, or at least ask for an internship, however, I do not want to seem like a dick for asking."

I'll have to start applying for internships starting late December and it makes me so nervous. I read these descriptions and requirements for financial internships and it makes me feel like I have no chance, that I won't be able to find an internship in Minneapolis (hometown). Without an internship, I would be setting myself up for failure in finding a job after Graduation. I've always dreaded the second half of college because I knew that I would have to find an internship and a job but now it's finally here and I'm freaking out. I just need someone to tell give me some tips and convince me that I'm over-thinking things...this is awful."

I'm a long term software dev intern for the IS department at a reasonably sized semiconductor company. I've been here for about 6 months, and the position is until I graduate (may 2018 assuming all goes well). 

My supervisor has had nothing but good things to say about my work, learning capability, etc. 

Would I be more hirable if I stay here for another 1.5 years, or do a different internship over the summer? 

I am relatively happy here, and could see myself working here (professionally, after school) for maybe a year or two before the commute kills my soul. 

Also is it too direct to ask if they would want to hire me once I graduate? If there isn't that safety net of a quasi-guaranteed job, I almost certainly would prefer to go to a different internship (most would pay more than them, and the environment here is dry/boring).

Thanks!"
5atpyg,0,2016-11-02,"22, About to graduate with Bachelors degree, In a decent amount of credit card/student loan debt. No idea where to go and what to do.",Murtamatt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5atpyg/22_about_to_graduate_with_bachelors_degree_in_a/,"So here are the basics, I'm 22, turning 23 next week. I'm about to graduate from my local university with a Bachelors Degree  in Business Administration with a focus in Management. Last month I received and accepted an internship at a new company that's growing very fast, located about 45 miles away from where I live. I still live with my mom and stepfather, and my current vehicle is in poor condition, about to fall apart.

I've been in school for 9 semesters, all of which has been paid for through financial aid and scholarships. I have $22,500 in Direct Subsidized Loans and $8,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loans. I also had $28,415 in federal pell grants and $5,536 in state pell grants. I will graduate in December with a Bachelors degree in Business Administration with a focus in Management. 

My internship started 3 weeks ago, I'm making $10/hour and work between 20 and 25 hours per week. It is a 45 mile drive from my house, all highway. This job has the potential to turn into a full time position with a starting salary of $50,000 and full benifits. I've worked minimum wage jobs, no more than 30 hours a week, with few exceptions, since April 2015. 

I have no savings at all. Living with my parents, I don't pay many bills. I pay around $450 every 6 months for car insurance, I'm on my grandparents plan. I also pay around $75/month for various services (Phone, Netflix, Spotify), nothing extreme. I'm included on my Mothers health and dental insurance.

When I was a freshman in college I was advised to get a credit card, and to only use it for emergencies. I didn't tell anyone but i actually got three credit cards. For the first year I did well. Only bought things with them when I knew I had enough money to pay for it and always payed it immediately after the purchase. After the first year I had a few major expenses and it just got out of control. I racked up about $2000 in debt and only payed about $300 of it. After that i just started ignoring the bills when they came. Now with interest and everything, I owe around $3500, all to collection agencies. 

I've had the same car since right before i started college. I purchased it for $2,000 from a family friend who was selling assets to pay for a lawyer because she was being sued. The car had 220,000 miles at the time and is now over 260,000 The only things that were wrong with the car then were the transmission slipping every now and again and the paint on the rear end of the car was starting to fade. Now the car leaks oil, the heater and air conditioner are both not working, the power steering fluid is leaking somewhere, the transmission still slips, and the paint from the top of the rear doors and around the rear windshield is very faded, the trunk has no clear coat and is beginning to rust, and also has a few very large scratches/dents. There is a rust spot above the front windshield where water has been getting under the sealing for who knows how long, and there is rust starting under one of the rear wheel wells. I recently got a new windshield put in the car (they clear-coated the hell out of the rust up there so that will slow it down a decent amount), changed the oil and filter, and put on new front brake pads. Over the years I've had the car, I've had the power steering pump go out and replaced, the heater has been fixed twice (it worked for about a week after each time and then stops), and made sure to maintain routine maintenance. The car gets around 22-23 miles per gallon. If I keep the car it will need new tires before winter as where I live is below 40 degrees for the most part from the end of November until mid March. I could sell the car for $1000, maybe more.

A lot of the current issues have started in the last couple months. I've been looking for a new vehicle, my cousin offered me a good car with just under 180,000 miles. The car gets around 40 mpg. He is asking for $2500 just to cover what he has left to pay on it. My Mother and Grandfather have both told me they would help me pay for the car now but I will need to pay them back over the next few months. Everyone in my family is saying a new car is a necessary expense considering I drive at the very minimum 350 miles per week and my car is in rough shape. 

Nobody knows how much credit card debt I'm in. My girlfriend has been pressuring me for a couple months to find an apartment for myself and move out of my parents home and I know that once I graduate college that my family will also pressure me to move out.

I'm not sure where to start with paying off my debt from college. I'm not sure what to do about my credit card debt. I don't know how I should start saving money. Please help me find the first step and eventually get my finances together.

5atvfg,1,2016-11-02,I posted this in SW but after reading it again it might fit here better possibly,Imaychangethislater,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5atvfg/i_posted_this_in_sw_but_after_reading_it_again_it/,"Just today I had 2 periods of suicidal thoughts that are starting to make me worried. I don't think that I have periods of huge depression is helping either. I'm able to fight off the thoughts but I worry that some day in the future I might not be able to. I'm currently working at an internship which helped to give a bigger sense of worth but the fact when I think that no girl has ever been interested in me really makes feel depressed and now even suicidal in thinking that maybe there is no one out there for me. I'm not sure at all what to do, I keep forcing myself to press on but each day feels both physically and mentally exhausting. I'm also not sure if what happened recently (A girl I kind of liked and wanted to know better turned out to have a boyfriend) is affecting this completely or what but I'm trying to deal with this. I think I might just never find a girlfriend and I can't really deal with that because I currently have an outwhelming desire to get a girlfriend and be able to spend time with time even through bad times. Also as a sidenote I am currently 22 but I am on the autism spectrum so some things seem to come slower than others such not tying my shoes until around 15 and only recently making some progress in terms of being able to drive. There are other things as well but it might be easier to look them up (noise, not detecting nonverbal). It just really hurts though to feel so useless that no one loves me (excluding my parents). Also my parents and others seem to keep saying ""things will get better and work out"" yet I can't seem to believe them when it doesn't feel like it will at all. I'm currently not making money (though maybe that will change if I can stick through this) and feel extremely lonely as well even since I graduated from college. To be honest I think my depression seemed to start in college due to the stress of having 6 classes at once and not being able to balance things well and even since it's just continued to be there. I personally don't hide my emotions in real life yet I feel worried a lot and not as happy as I used to be. My attempts to try and become noticed on youtube are terrible and I don't really have time to even upload really unfortunately and things just aren't working out. I do extremely long to meet a girl that will be right for me but sometimes I really wonder whether that person even exists. Lately I haven't even been able to control my dreams to be peaceful and I haven't been sleeping that well either. Also I have tried talking to my parents to try and get them to understand about how I feel but I just don't think they completely get it. I also was advised to possibly try online dating but I think that has a lot of risks with it and because I specifically love playing video games that possibly meeting a girl at PAX or something might end up working. That said it's still a ways off considering even though I'm 22 I still can't drive by myself because I need more hours but lately I haven't been able to get more due to having no time anymore due to my internship. I feel stuck and every day feels like a struggle. I am still going to my internship more out of obligation then actually wanting to and I feel unhappy a lot and also anxious now with some small periods of happiness but that's it. I feel like there's probably just something I'm missing. Video games used to make me extremely happy and they can provide some happiness but it feels dimished all of a sudden now. Mads give me hope for the future though because of the time people put into making them. I feel like I need help though and I'm not even sure why I'm always feeling this exhausted, I think it is partly due to not having a girlfriend and never having gone on any dates whatsoever or dances (I can't dance anyways except somewhat DDR but that doesn't really count). Anyways this is getting long but as one last point I think I also extremely miss my friends from college because while I can call them sometimes it's just not the same as being able to talk to them face to face and I feel like I need some kind of help or a good way to make friends as I really feel lonely now that there's no one who seems to even understand me.  I'm just not sure what to do at all can anyone help?"
5atxi6,2,2016-11-02,"Is finance experience/education looked down upon? (in AI research, algotrading)",confuciest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5atxi6/is_finance_experienceeducation_looked_down_upon/,"I'm in second year of university right now. I planned on going into finance in high school, since it was the only thing I had really been exposed to (did well in maths/economics/accounting without much effort,etc). The program I chose allowed me to spend two years studying in other areas with a few required business courses, then the final two years in a management program which would culminate in a commerce degree. I took mostly humanities last year and am taking almost all mathematics courses this year. The business program itself is respected and forces you to develop soft skills like presenting and collaborative work while covering most of the content you would see in an MBA program. It's a very safe and practical option for me, I am near guaranteed a good job at 22 if I stay at the top of the class,
But.

I'm not sure I like business much. I find finance interesting, but most of the careers in finance I'm interested in like hedge funds/prop shops involve skills I'd probably be stronger in if I was majoring in math as opposed to management. I've also been considering transferring to computer science with the intention of going into some area of AI research and getting a PhD, since I have a genuine interest in the field and it seems like a perfect combination of all the subjects that excite me. My parents think this is not a good idea, as I have no formal experience with computer science. They say I should continue with the business degree and if I want, add a second degree in CS/mathematics which would probably take a bit more than an extra year to do. Apparently finance courses and soft skills are harder to pick up than technical CS abilities (??? I thought this sounded wrong but okay). I see how this could be the best of both worlds, since it is a good option to fall back on in case I try CS and hate it/am awful at it. The issue is that the school is considered great for business but not known at all for computer science and it wouldn't be ideal prep for grad school - even a master's which I would hopefully be able to skip if I was in a rigorous program at a top school. 

My questions: are soft skills and an education in business an asset in tech or a waste of time that could be better spent learning advanced concepts in math/cs? Is it bad for me to continue with summer internships in finance until I have enough knowledge of CS to try software engineering or should I be in summer school to accelerate that? Would the dual degree with a well known business program be better than a CS/math degree at a more prestigious school? Do many people with PhDs in ML end up in finance anyways (i.e. will I save time and money by going straight into it with the dual degree and getting experience versus grad school)? Is CS tedious or is it fun and logical and intellectually stimulating? How do I know if I even am capable of succeeding in a CS undergrad, let alone doing a PhD?

Any advice would be much appreciated, I don't know anyone in tech so it feels very risky when compared to business, which most of my family and friends are involved with. "
5au0ac,6,2016-11-02,Not happy after going sober,alcoholicthrowaway32,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5au0ac/not_happy_after_going_sober/,"I've read lots of posts on this subreddit about how quitting drinking made people a lot happier and improved their sense of well-being.

I haven't been sober for very long, but not having the prospect of drinking some nice beer at the end of the day (or week) has really negatively impacted my happiness. It sounds pathetic to write that out, but before I began drinking, I had problems with depression and anxiety. I can feel it coming back now. I always felt weighted down by so much that I can't get my mind off; drinking used to be my escape from that. But now I can't escape from it nearly as well. I've started thinking about a lot more than just how much my life sucks, and it pains me.

I don't really know what to do. Exercise, video games, hobbies, etc. never really helped me other than providing even worse escapes because they didn't intoxicate me enough to not feel guilty for doing them. That's another problem I have: I have a lot of responsibilities between taking lots of difficult courses, a job, looking for internships, and maintaining relationships. Doing anything fun just makes me feel guilty for doing that instead of working - drinking at least numbed my mind enough that I didn't feel that guilt.

The only time I've ever felt truly happy even when not drinking is when I take ADHD medicine (I'm not prescribed it). I don't know if I actually have ADHD. I think I might because I have severe problems with procrastination and concentration while working. But I'm still on my parents' insurance; they're medical professionals and I know they would object to me taking ADHD medicine. Even so, I worry that these ""helping"" is just due to the euphoria and not the concentration aspect.

I guess I'm asking for advice, but I don't really see anything helping. I guess I'm just venting and wondering if anybody else has ever felt this way. I'm 20 fwiw"
5au685,6,2016-11-02,First day...after quite a long road,GottaGetThroughThis,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5au685/first_dayafter_quite_a_long_road/,"So I started drinking in my 20s, weekend stuff with friends - hangovers and such but never in the morning or during the week...age 30 I bartended for five years and we could drink behind the bar (in these years I also had vodka at home every night)...age 35 to 39 I drank daily at home and went out with friends and always got trashed (one xmas - I think 2009 I got way drunk at my parents and my BF basically helped me out of their house and I was swearing like a sailor- not angry but dropping F bombs in front of my nephews...(my silly mom was 'glad I had a good time').

most of 2011 and part of 2012 was hell...always drinking - beer vodka pretty much whatever there was, my BF at the time drank but maybe a drink or two when we went out.  I lost 2 crappy jobs - then in march 2012 BF came home with a check from my dad for $10,000 and told me he just went to my parents and TOLD THEM ABOUT MY DRINKING and said pack a bag you're going to rehab...I was so pissed! He told my parents! And now he's yelling that I have to go??

Well I went in with 0%bac and steady hands - did 28 days without a hitch (I had an AODA associates and a psych BS and was in grad school for a masters in counseling at the time) in internships I had run AODA groups and worked at a rehab home in 2010 (where alcohol was smelled on me-embarrassing).  I was fully educated in addiction...

Well when I left rehab I drank the next day and really started hitting it hard if not harder - kind of as a fuck you to my BF for forcing me to go , you can't force people...doesn't work.

2013 to mid 2014 I drank probably a good fifth of vodka a day - I'd get 1.75 every other day, lived with a former hair client that allowed me to flop on her couch downstairs-unemployed and drunk allllll day. Tried a few jobs but lost those too...and it was hard working when you were literally shitting your pants daily from alcohol.  June 26th 2014 I woke up- dizzy lightheaded and sicker than hell as usual- it was a Saturday and my roommate was home.  I looked at her and said ""I think I just need to go to the ER"" and she gladly took me...I had to grab the first wheelchair when we got there and they took me right back - I allowed my roommate in with me- she said the docs looked horrified by my appearance - I even had yellow eyes! My bilirubin was so high I itched and scratched scabs on my arms and face.  I stayed in the ER two night - got fluids and even a blood transfusion as I had almost no red blood cells left. On the third day I checked out against doctors orders and went back to my roommates...it was a Monday - I did try to sneak a little that week but that Friday she found it and that's when I said IM DONE! And I went from the end of June  2014 to December of 2015- when I had a glass of wine here, a few New Year's Eve drinks, but nothing more (I got a new guy in October 2015 and he knew I was a problem drinker in the past but he is not aware of the extent of it all, does not know about the rehab or the hospital and I do not want him to.  I also got a much better job in November 2014 which I still have.

In February of this year me and the new guy moved in together, I don't even know why but I started sneaking alcohol in our place - I couldn't have done that with my old roommate because she would've found out and killed me because she knew what I went through - although she was a wino and I'd be disgusted to come home to see her purple lipped and crying drunk.  That didn't even make me wanna drink at all!!!

So in February I started sneaking here and there but no anxiety no hangovers - just a little buzz.  End of July the BF had to go away for two weeks for boyscout trips with his son...that was game on for me I had the place to myself and boozed it up... and pretty much have been hard core for three months now with the exception of maybe 5 days.

The last few weeks I would drink in the morning before work and the last two weeks even having vodka in Gatorade in my purse and towards the end of my shift I would start sipping...wow...two days ago I said WTF big time, went to the doc yesterday for a full physical and am waiting on bloodwork results.  I had time alone yesterday after the doctor (bc I was off of work) so I did buy a 100ml tiny bottle and spilled most of it (sign from god) but then went back out for a pint of which I poured half out of each of the three drinks I made from it.

I have been lurking around this sub for a good month now and absolutely love it! And 'the naked mind' is also great and I read it all I can along with your posts at work. 

Sorry for the huge intro - wanted you all to know my past.  And today if the first time in weeks I didn't drink anything! And I feel good about it and I'm glad I woke up and stopped this before I went down as far as I did before.  I have been having horrible morning anxiety (and I already have anxiety) and no ambition at work- and gained twenty pounds this summer alone!   Amazingly I never had bad withdrawals when I went to rehab or even at the ER when I was at deaths door- they probably gave my meds I don't recall.

I'm so done! In my year and a half of previous sobriety on my own I went to bars and it never bothered me refusing a drink - it was amusing to see the drunk idiots if anything.   Also the guilt and shame of hiding all summer from my best ever BF (now fiancé) - he and my dog are huge reasons that I'm putting the brakes on now (and the weight I'm a snob about it but didn't know my weight until Monday at the doctor).  

So many stories on here resonate in my head - and many of your posts have brought me to tears several times...but I love it! I did AA in rehab and I respect it but I'm not a fan.  I need online support and to do this basically alone...it's only been three months of it being pretty bad / NOTHING compared to 2014! 

Again thank and bless all of you! So glad to have found this - I don't even remember how I did I was never a 'reddit' person - this was meant to be 😊"

I have been kind of struggling to find a internship for the summer since I am behind on some of my CS classes because I recently switched to CS from electrical engineering.  I have a company that is around my hometown that would be willing to let me have an internship but it would be mostly electrical engineering instead of programming which is what I really would like to focus on.


Just recently I have talked to my advanced engineering math professor about opportunities in programming that he had since he is a computational science professor and parallel computer professor as well.  He seemed really thrilled that I ask him about it and he was even more excited because I have a large math background compared to most computer science students.  He let me borrow one of his books on computing in PETSc (a programming language that I know nothing about but it is very similar to C) and told me that if I help him for the rest of the year that he might give me a job this summer working for the university on one of their projects.  He told me that he would help me step by step since it is a hard thing to get into and he really recommended that I work on it during the weekends so I don't get behind in other classes.  This job that he ""offered"" me is kind of a big deal around here apparently.  It is a program that gets federal grant money from the department of energy and they pay for an appartment and food all summer as well as pay a pretty decent wage.  The project he said was something to do with the simulation of a hard physics problem and the coolest part is that we would be using a super computer that is in the west coast.


This sounds like a perfect fit to me and I am really excited to get started but I am a little hesitant because I want to make sure that spending this much time on a project will help my future.  I really love programming and that is why I want to become a software engineer in the future.  Just like everyone I have big dreams and wish to work at a big company for a few years such as IBM, Microsoft or Google.  I was really hoping I could find something this summer that would set me apart from the crowd.  My problem is that I am not sure if this is what an employer would like to see since it is using parallel programming to solve math equations unlike building software like companies probably want to see.  I have thought about doing computational science before since I love math too but I am not really interested in going to school for that long and the career possibilities don't look as good as SE/CS.  I was just wondering what anyone here would have to recommend."

I wanted to reach out to this sub and see if anyone could offer any helpful tips, ideas or just general advice. I graduated from my local university with a BS in CS and a 3.8 GPA 6 months ago. During my time there, I took on a C#/SQL internship that I had to leave due to health issues, I did some Python work for the university, and I took another C#/SQL internship that, after 6 months, turned into a job out of college. 

Now my goals are to get out of the city I'm currently in and to get a better job with more opportunities than my current one. However I feel somewhat out of my depth and I'm honestly not sure where to even begin or if my internship/univerisity/current job experience is even going to help. Most jobs out there ask for a minimum of maybe 4 years in some programming language or framework and I simply don't have that kind of experience. I suppose I could work on a project at home to get familiar with such a thing if I were interested enough in the company or the technology (or possible salary/benefits), but I don't know if this would be considered ""valid"" experience. 

I plan to start acting on these goals in about a year from now, when I will have worked at my current job for 2 years (including the internship). Simply put, where I am now is a dead end for programmers and I'm looking to move up and out. What are some good ways to move forward? Should I be doing multiple side projects at home to make up for lack of experience? Should I be looking into freelance work or contract jobs (if this is even a good idea, considering what experience I have)? I'm just very new to all of this and I feel like I most likely started out on the wrong foot.

Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated. "

5auhia,6,2016-11-02,Should I tell my manager?,WakeSDsun,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/5auhia/should_i_tell_my_manager/,"So, I was recently hired as a full-time intern at a company. Don't get me wrong, I love the job; they give me very flexible hours with school, pay is amazing and there is a high chance that it can turn into a full time gig after the 1-year internship is over. 

The thing is, I am currently only signed on until February (my 6-month mark) and I was recently approached to interview with a different company. After a few phone interviews, I just received word from the university recruiters that they want to fly me out to do a final interview in a month.

My current Manager seems to have my best interest in mind, he has even approached me to say that he would help me prepare for interviews when it came time to interview for a full time role. Also, he mentioned that I should let him know if I am doing external interviews so that we can prepare.

My questions is... should I let him know? I feel like not saying anything and then bringing it up if I do land the job may seem like more of a betrayal to someone that took a chance on me to begin with. My thoughts are that a manager would expect an intern to field any chance he gets at landing a full-time job after graduation. But then again, I can make the interview without them ever knowing. I also don't want to taint things with my current employer and ruin a chance at extending my internship/ offering a full-time position.

- I'm seeking a software engineer mentor who is confident about getting things done in a time-efficient way. 

- The goal is to make me more effective and faster at finishing my programming tasks, not necessarily teaching me specific technologies or CS topics (unless it poses a requirement).

- **Highly prefer a mentor who is willing to meet in-person in the SF Bay Area (happy to discuss compensation)** or an extremely engaged remote mentor. 

## Requirements:

- No particular skills required, just would prefer if you are currently employed as a full-time software engineer and if you were pretty snappy at getting your tasks done.


## Compensation:

- $15/hour (happy to adjust if needed). 

## About me:

- Mid-level level software engineer. 

- Despite having programmed for multiple years and having a wide range of skills (spotty in places) I am behind schedule on every one of my tasks. I have been the slowest engineer at every company I have worked for and in every college course taken. I am constantly outpaced by interns.

- Multiple employers have repeatedly warned me my speed is too slow for me to stay with their company. This has led to termination in the past.

- I have not yet been given a task I have been unable to complete but my issue is simply being unable to finish them fast enough.

- I am very passionate about programming/mathematics. Despite struggling intensely, I love what I do and have no intention of quitting/changing-my-career. If you're willing to put in the effort I will cooperate to fullest of my ability to make the changes you find important.

- Happy to provide as much information about myself as possible if it will help you determine what's best for me (logging my approaches to problems/where I'm spending my time).

## Contact:
- Message me on Reddit at /u/TropicalCafe (happy to exchange any other contacts methods there)."

So I'm currently at a major University studying Computer Science and transferred here a year ago from a community college. By the end of spring quarter (2017) I will have 3 courses needed to graduate. 
Should I 
A) plan on staying in school for a quarter in the summer to graduate 
B) try to get an internship?

My only concern is I have never had an internship and I am going to be graduating soon. Which means I won't be eligible for internships when I graduate? Also does graduating in the fall make me disadvantaged in the job market?

5av35f,6,2016-11-03,I blame my personal failures on the rest of humankind (warning : long life story and no tl;dr),pocketoven,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/5av35f/i_blame_my_personal_failures_on_the_rest_of/,"I'm 26 years old and autistic (the real version, not the Internet version). I was diagnosed only when I was 17 so I couldn't receive behavioral therapy when it would have been able to make a lasting difference.

I used to be pretty gregarious in my youth but abnormal social skills meant that I have never been able to successfully made friends. While I know ""what normal people do"" on an intellectual level, actually doing it quickly overwhelms me or doesn't help me because I lack the basic framework to do it. For example, I have little natural empathy, but through reading religious and philosophical material I have discovered the so-called ""golden rule"". It makes sense to me to treat people as you would like to be treated, so that's how I try to act in my dealings with others. Additionally, it is actually quite natural for me to do so because my instinct is to assume people have the same needs and wants as I do (they do not - this is another thing that I know intellectually but can never act upon). However, it doesn't actually work that well because a) people generally don't want the same thing I would want in their current situation or b) people seem to notice very quickly my one-dimensional emotional game and take advantage of my naivety. One example of a) is that I once told an acquaintance in a dire financial situation and confronted with an unplanned pregnancy that I hoped his girlfriend would not make it to term (he lives in a country where abortion is strictly regulated). My intent wasn't to hurt but I just figured that if I were in his situation, with no money, no job and a pregnant girlfriend unable to abort, that I would not want the additional burden of a baby. He lashed out at me and it took me years to understand why.

As for b), it's too easy to find examples. When people ask me to do things, I try to do them to the best of my ability, no questions asked, even if against the rules or even illegal, simply because I figure that if I were X, I too would like someone to help me with Y, therefore I will help. I have let others copy my homework, I have written papers wholesale for people, I have helped people cheat in exams, I have even helped people procure drugs, all without any compensation whatsoever. I have lost the sole job I ever held helping someone prepare for a civil servant test (by helping prepare I mean feeding him the answers) and someone walked in on us and ratted us out. They were almost always people I barely knew by name. After all, I have always been told that if I'm nice to people, people will be nice to me, but people I lend a hand to rarely talk to me again, except to ask for more. I have recently become aware of my gullibility, but as I deal only in extremes, I have become extremely suspicious of anybody who approaches me, especially to ask me for something.

I have restricted interests. My primary interest is to look for IPA tables and phonological descriptions of languages in academic sources and memorize them. I have no interest in any other branch of linguistics, and even the latter took a while to develop because it actually used to be only about IPA symbols. My secondary interest is law, but only constitutional law and legal philosophy. I actually went to university and have a law degree, where I took mostly legal philosophy and conlaw electives, because I knew that knowledge of IPA would not land me a job but perhaps law would. While I can do other things, like play video games, they rarely bring me the same satisfaction that these two subjects do. I have learned early on that talking (in monologue) about IPA or legal philosophy actually bores most people to death, but they have been such enormous time sinks that I do not actually have much else to talk about - even if I did, I don't know if I would talk about it because it brings me no stimulation.

I have no job, even though I am a college graduate. My grades were good on average, albeit very high in classes dedicated to legal philosophy and constitutional law and only middling everywhere else, and actually downright low in some subjects I thoroughly hated like business law. I failed interview after interview for an internship, no matter my preparations, and my grades weren't good enough to make up for my deficient personality. I didn't get an internship out of school so I am screwed. My degree is barely worth the paper it's printed on.

No matter how much I try I just can't fake being normal well enough for people not to notice that there is something wrong with me. I have read and read on the subject and albeit I realize my flaws and how to improve intellectually, everything fails when it comes to applying the theory. I know that normal people look each other in the eyes and that avoiding eye contact is seen as disrespectful or a mark of dishonesty, but I can't seem to hold eye contact for very long. I know some people will touch somebody they're speaking to (quite common in my country) and even though I expect it, I always recoil. I know people smile for no real reason other than to appear friendly, but my mouth doesn't seem to be able to actually take that shape. I don't even like going out. The noises and especially the smells quickly overwhelm me.

Due to all of that, I have no friends. I can't even think about women. I am heterosexual and interested in women, but all I have read on the subject is very complicated and often contradictory. I actually have sexual experience, having been in a short relationship, but the girl was emotionally damaged and very possibly cluster B. It happened with little input on my part and was overall toxic. To this day I do not really know why or how it happened. This short time with an unstable personality gave me an intense distrust of women and certainly didn't prepare me for a real relationship, much less how to obtain one.

I am thus exceedingly lonely, and to cope with it and to protect myself for my gullible nature I have veered in a sort of extreme misanthropy. I have tried a lot of things. I have lived on my own, tried to hold a regular job, studied (both academia and how to be more social), went out of my way to put myself into situations that made my mind scream in agony in order to practice, and yet all of it failed. I expected improvement to my situation at least in keeping with the amount of time I spent trying, but I didn't get it. I have spent around 8 years consciously on the quest of learning to be a regular human, or at least understanding them, but I have never made a single close friendship. I resent others for it and sometimes lash out.

Whenever I see a happy couple or friends having fun, I have thoughts of violence and I sometimes wonder if I will act on them some day. On the rare occasion that people try to interact with me (mostly tourists asking for directions), I ignore them. I don't even make any effort, I keep walking. I restrain myself with my parents but sometimes I don't manage to. I have frequent tantrums and meltdowns. Sometimes I hit myself which is something I hadn't done in years. To other people it probably looks like tiny things set me off but in reality I'm just using these things as a justification to let out pent-up anger about this whole situation. I have given up completely and often tell myself that I'll just go far away when I'm able, in a remote location where my senses will not be constantly under attack like in the city and where most importantly, there will be nobody around. I have fantasies of being the last man on Earth and being rid of all of you and living happily. I sometimes hope that World War III will happen and that most people will die while I will be unaffected in my low-tech remote abode, hunting, fishing and growing my food. I figure that if the basic need that is companionship is actually objectively impossible to fulfill instead of just being impossible due to my shortcomings, that it would be easier to cope with the inability to fulfill that need.

I know (again, intellectually) that this is not okay. Other people shouldn't be blamed for my inability to establish a rapport with them. However I just can't help it. I do feel entitled to improvement in my situation after the years of chaos I have put myself through trying to understand you, just as I would expect to be a decent piano player after 8 years of grueling practice. At the very least I would like people to make the same effort and try to understand me, but I know that will never happen (as an aside, the people who talk a big game about tolerance were always the most hostile). Hating you is cathartic to a degree and is the first thing I've tried in 8 years that kind of works. It doesn't rid me of the desire for companionship and on days where I think too much about it, the cognitive dissonance bothers me, but it does provide an outlet for my powerlessness and inadequacy.

I wish I could be Mr. Anybody and have one or two close, dependable friends I go have a beer with on weekends, a wife who is only decent looking and a bit of a dummy but with a heart of gold and a dog of middling intelligence who isn't that cute but makes up for it with formidable friendliness. I would be perfectly happy with just that. However, I realize that the only thing I'm likely to obtain is the dog at this rate, so I guess I'll have to content myself with that. If you have any ideas feel free to share, but I've probably tried them."

Its been about a year since i havent played RS &amp; i was thinking about coming back to the game seeing as all my friends were getting back into it with Christmas break right around the corner.

I wouldnt be able to start until january or late December. However i wanted to post this article because ive seem to come to a complete and random misfortune that i want to get to the bottom of. My runescape account ive had and used for the past 10 years has been permanently banned. Now, i know this is something that happens a lot on reddit. Some people make posts and try to get their accounts unbanned after bug abuse or other illegal activities. 

My situation is probably a lot like what most people post - I tried  reaching out to Jmods on twitter and none have gotten back to me or have been unhelpful. So, im giving reddit a shot and hoping for the best.

1. The only offenses ive ever gotten were offensive language. 
2. Never sold or bought gold/accounts (this includes in my own.) 
3. No involvement in bug abuse, or Ddosing.
4. No shortcuts (botting, or even ghost mousing). 
5. No account sharing, i dont even let my brother on.

Also, i noticed my offence seemed to be a manual ban (there was no evidence) and it was from September of this year, literally 2 months ago, ive had no computer or log in access to even get on. I spent the last full year away from the computer because i was busy with Uni, my internship, and work full time. I had a lot on my plate. 
My clan was dismantled because i was away for a year. And they are all witnesses to that. Infact, i havent posted any videos to my youtube channel in a full year as well.

My channel here: www.youtube.com/growupidiot 
Clan name: TheStorm 

I always make pk videos, and none of my subscribers have seen any new content in that period of time. 

Now. I did ONLY manage to log in once when i went over to a friends house [im currently in seattle, WA - ill be back in Baltimore, MD by jan 2017] and it was for 5 minutes just to check on my account and make sure everything was how i left it. That was the only time from seattle i logged into my account. Aside from that my last account log in was in baltimore around sept 27th 

My last video here: 
https://youtu.be/r9Mwn1qFQHM 

I think its been 2 weeks now since ive tried contacting jagex mods to help look into my case and try to get my account unbanned. Which i know is very unlikely. Im just trying to fight my ban like anyone else because im sure a lot of ppl think this is some joke or ploy to get an account back that was missued because the owner was stupid.

I promise its not, its been 10 years since ive started RS and i do enjoy the game. ive put a lot of hours in and made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun with my account :/. 

To keep things simple.
Im perm banned yet, i have not played in a full year and the only time i logged in was at a friends here for 5 minutes to check on my account. Then, randomly im banned like a month or two later.

Im happy to work with jagex mods in order to get this resolved so please, help me out here. Im just trying to get my account back that ive had since i was a kid.

Sorry my title may have been a bit vague. I wanted to do my internship abroad to finish my BA in computer science. I was lucky to find a great internship in Japan and before i signed my contract with them i asked the school if the contract dates where ok. They asked me to increase the length of the internship so i asked the company if it was possible and sure enough i got a new date and the school approved.

Now, 3 months later, 2 months before i am going to japan the school suddenly tells me that internship period is to long. The original contract that i have is 70 work days and they want me to make the company sign a contract where i work 60 days. They say that since the school is not part of the contract between me and the company they ""dont know"" of its existence so that its not a problem for them and that i should just stay 10 days longer after my school contract has expired. (the original contract is between me and the company and the school contract would be between al 3 parties)

Is this even legal?"

Now I found a 2 month internship on .Net that starts in January and if I'm good enough the company will offer me a full time job and if not...well I'll still be looking for a full time job :( .What should I do? Should I keep looking for a full time job in hopes that I will find something or should I apply for this internship and hope that they will offer me a full time job after. The internship lasts 2 months and I can apply until November 15 so I have to think fast.
5aw1ef,1,2016-11-03,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5aw1ef/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

5aw1k7,1,2016-11-03,Internship into full time position,PersianMG,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5aw1k7/internship_into_full_time_position/,"So i'm in a little bit of an odd spot. In about a month or so I will have finished all the requirements of my Software Engineering degree for university except 2 months of industrial training. Now this has to be a paid internship and I should have done it in my 3rd year but I kinda focused on personal projects (which made me much more money anyway) so I have to do it now.

Can I apply for most full time positions and simply use the first 2 months to complete my degree? Do most employers generally care if I don't have my degree yet? I was thinking putting something like that on my resume might put off employers? My other option is to apply for internships, work hard and try to get a full time offer at the end.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

I'll be starting coding on websites like leetcode soon.

I'll also be giving GRE soon and I think I can manage a score of 320 or a bit more. My CGPA isn't that great due to some issues. And I have no computer projects or internships on my resume. 

I was wondering, which way should I go ?( So that admission to a university in the US is easier)

1. Should I get an internship ? How should I try to get it considering my limited experience ?

2. Should I do a project under a computer science faculty in my college ?

3. Please share if you have anything else in mind.

2) So does that old, out of touch Vince McHitler

3) The Big Show is approximately 7 feet tall and weighs a considerable amount

4) According to WWE lore, the heavyweight title was vacant through most of the 1980s, and again for a few months in 2004

5) Christian is not actually of the Christian faith. It's a stage name.

6) Literally anyone could have been in the Shield instead of Fuccboi and it would have been better.

7) Fuccboi is often referred to as Shampoo Fuccboi, but this is a misnomer--it's actually sunscreen in his hair.

8) K Fed has more wins over John Cena than 99.9% of competitors to set foot in the company over the last decade. 

9) The Rock is named for the illustrious ""regular old"" stone, which is also called rock.

10) Before assuming the stage name Fuck-Sheamus, he used to just be called Sheamus.

11) Per Meltz, women's wrestling is still kinda ehhh.

12) During the Attitude Era, people commonly did things that would never air today. 

13) Vince McHitler is an old, out of touch carny who doesn't know anything about wrestling and frankly never has.

14) Before becoming Roman Reigns, Joe Anoa'i was off weekly television, which is frankly where he should still be.

15) That, or dead. Fuck Fuccboi.

16) Cocaine really is a helluva drug. Paige is right.

17) 33 is a large number of bullshit facts to have to think up. You know what else is a large number? McHitlers old, old, fucking OLD, age. And he's really out of touch too.

18) If Steen holds the title for like the next decade solid, he will be the longest reigning pro wrestling champion of all time.

19) We still don't know if Chavo personally showed up at some point to bail those dogs out of the enclosed pool area, or if the police ended up just doing it while they were already there.

20) Triple H is likely personally making RAW suck with the express purpose of causing the years when he was on top of the brand (the previous worst in company history) to look better in hindsight. We already miss Evolution, AKA the most stale and overexposed stable of all time, so evidently it's working.

21) It's been said that Alexa Bliss is the most fuckable woman in the company. However, this rumor is false. Since you will never fuck her, she is not, in fact, fuckable at all. Conversely, the most fuckable woman in the company is probably a low-level, average to unattractive intern somewhere. Who's still into a better caliber of man than those who watch the product.

22) If New Day beats Demolition's record, they will have held the tag team titles for longer than Demolition.

23) The WWE Network is subscribed to by over 1.5 million people who have no idea how to torrent shit, mirite?

24) Mae Young giving birth to a hand is a deliberate metaphor for the abortion that is RAW every week in 2016.

25) Rusev is the first monster heel in years to not be a dancing fat guy by this point in his career. However, there is still time.

26) TNA goes out of business an average of four times per year, but somehow is still on the air.

27) James Ellsworth's hair is not naturally bleached yellow. 

28) When Michael Cole retires, he will be remembered as Goebbels to Vince McHitler's Hitler due to both the number and severity of the atrocities he has committed.

29) Camp WWE is actually a semi-autobiographical work depicting how that old, out of touch Vince McHitler views his daily interactions in WWE.

30) If the John Cena meme had been about Roman Reigns, he would be beloved today. ... Nah, just kidding; the meme would've never gotten over at all.

31) CM Punk was always overrated, but it only became apparent after he failed to become UFC heavyweight champion like we had all assumed he would.

32) Because of his record breaking movie career, The Rock will go down in history as the greatest wrestler of all time. Let that sink in. The fucking Rock, of all people, and not Kevin Steen. Fuck Hollywood.

33) Done. Give karma. Thx.

5awrqs,1,2016-11-03,Is 90k salary in Boston enough?,canhazadhd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5awrqs/is_90k_salary_in_boston_enough/,"I'm a senior at a large school in Boston and have been searching for a post-graduation job for about a month. I now have an offer for 90k and incredible benefits (Over a month PTO excluding national holidays, tuition reimbursement for when I work part-time Jan-June, amazing health coverage, dental, vision, etc). I have friends who are graduating and getting offers for 100k-110k per year (I don't know their benefits), and I was wondering if 90k is an alright offer. 

A company that I did an internship with might be able to get me an offer, but they've been very slow in responding. They'd likely be able to offer more, but only if their budget allows it. I've emailed them multiple times, but haven't gotten a clear answer back. They'd be able to offer a bit more pay with a bonus and stock options, but I don't have an offer from them in hand. Is this a case of having a bird in my hand and two in the bush?

I'm graduating with a 3.7 GPA and a major in CS. The place I have an offer from is a non-profit research institute, so I don't expect to be blown away by the salary. I just want to make sure I'm not being lowballed."

I just graduated with my bachelors in business with an emphasis in Information Technology. The only classes I took related to computer programming were an introduction to computer programming, an introduction to web development, introduction to databases and advanced databases.

The highest math I took was brief calculus and I didnt take algorithm and data structure classes as they were not needed.
I did an internship over the summer using c# and running the MMVM pattern and I deeply struggled. However, I didnt have much help from my supervisor as he was busy doing his own thing so the project was left for me to do and I failed miserably as I didnt get the project completed in the 3 month time frame.

All this made me realize that I am extremly unprepared and I am discouraged because I dont know if I will make it as a software developer. Luckily, I am also interested in data analysis, not data science but data analysis. However, I dont know if I even have the background to do that.
Obvioulsy job security is also a concern and I enjoy both professions equally. However, I feel that I already failed as a software developer so maybe data analyst is my last choice?

Any advice from experienced developers or data analysts would be appreciated but I definitely need guidance on what to do next.
Also, I am currently working in the banking industry making 19 dollars an hour and I am 27 years old already.

I have been in Europe seeing family for the past 3 months. I have both EU and American passports so I have been able to work a few internships while abroad. The pay is only $500 a month and non of it has been going into my american bank account. 

I plan on returning to the US in January but the grace period on my loans end in December so I need to figure out what repayment plan I should take. I was thinking of the pay as your ear (PAYE) because I am currently making 0 so my monthly statements would also be 0. 

I have been doing readying on the PAYE system and don't really see any down sides to it right now. I would appreciate any input or advice from people out there. 

Here are my current state of affairs;
- According to my account on MyFedLoan.org i have 28,826 and then another 1,000 to pay my university on heartland.ecsi.net 

- On my studnet loan.gov page it says I owe 30,714. I don't know why the amount is different but I do know it puts all my loans together. 

- I have no income according to the US and won't for at least another 2 months. 

I appreciate any input.

Looks like the long trip to the swiss alps was really worth it: 4 bedrooms, a cozy fireplace, an indoor jacuzzi and a very private covered deck with a hot tub. But the best part is: I'm here with three beautiful women.   
  
  

No, Im not a rich celebrity. I wish I was. In fact, the trip was the first prize in a popular TV quiz-show: 2 weeks in a romantic cabin in Switzerland for the winner and three companions – all expenses paid.  
  
  

But I'm not even the winner of that show. I am one of the lucky companions who were asked to join. In fact, the lucky winner is you.  
We've been close friends since high-school and although you're very pretty, our relationship has always been platonic. Since we're going to different colleges, we don't see each other so often. Needless to say, I didn't think twice when you asked me to go with you.  
The two other companions are Alexa and Jenna, your two best friends. You've met in college. Alexa is 19 years old. Slim and curvy, big boobs, blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful. Jenna, 22, is a petite girl with dark hair and brown eyes, small b-cups and a firm ass. You've told me that Jenna just started an internship as a chemist at a big pharmaceutical company. „She's really really smart, but also a little crazy“, you said. You had no idea how right you were about that...
  
  
  
  

Fast forward to today: Here I am, taking my sunbath by the pool and enjoying a Tequila sunrise. What I don't know yet, is that Jenna spiked my drink with a expiremental drug that she must have snitched from the lab where she works. The drug with the product name „HGQ-12“ will boost male libido, cause long lasting erections, increase sperm volume and even allow men to have multiple orgasms. Suspected side effects are premature and sometimes spontaneous ejaculation. Obviously Jenna didn't want to wait for the approval for tests on humans, so she figured she might just do her own little experiment...

Hey, thanks for reading! In this RP I'd love to play your male friend Jake, who's (at first) really embarrassed and confused by the fact, that he has a boner almost all the time or that even a casual touch can be enough to make him cum. Once you notice what's going on, the three of you start teasing me on purpose – just to mock me a little bit.  
I'd love to imagine that eventually, the girls realize that they might have gone a little bit to far. To make amends for making fun of me and help me to release some sexual energy, they finally allow me to fuck them whenever I want. Hey, that's just fair!  
I'm looking for a RP-partner who'd like to play with me on a midterm basis (about a week?)  
I'd love to include a reasonable amount of buildup for this RP. This specific prompt would more or less focus on sexual tension in the finca building up. Eventually, of course, it would break down into a full-blown house of sex between the four of them, but that's later on!  
Hope to hear from you :)

5axk6m,2,2016-11-03,Internship questions?,haldol5ativan2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5axk6m/internship_questions/,"Hi guys,

I started out my career path as a pre-med, student, and only switched to software engineering within the last year. My questions have more to do with software engineering internships than with actual questions on code. I'm unsure if this was the correct subreddit to post into; if that's the case, any guidance to the right subreddit would be greatly appreciated!

Moving on: I've currently applied to a bunch of internships, some from a career fair at my school, and some just from online applications. The only face to face interviews I've been getting are from the booths I visited at the career fair

My question: should I be discouraged that no one from outside the career fair is getting back to me (I'm assuming silent rejections here)? I'm beginning to think I only got these interviews because of my attachment to the school (Boston university), and not because of my actual skills. On the other hand, I'm not sure if outside a career fair, companies start going through applications at a later date, and is in part why I'm not yet hearing back.

As to my resume: I've been able to be a part of an app that helps BU students (don't want to specify further in case people know), and have worked in a lab from a development perspective (basic troubleshooting, etc). I have knowledge (and have used) most of the major languages (C++, Java/C#, Python, ruby, Linux, sql, html/css). I know this is a pretty shallow delve into said skills, but can provide clarification if needed.

I'm super appreciative of anyone can offer some insight! I REALLY want to gain some good valuable experience at a full time internship, since most of my programming experience has been class-related."

Im in a real pickle here and i need to understand more about this by tomorrow.

I wanted to do my internship abroad to finish my BA in computer science. I was lucky to find a great internship in Japan (great for my standards not this sub top 6 thing) and before i signed my contract with them i asked my school if the contract dates where ok. They asked me to increase the length of the internship so i asked the company if it was possible and sure enough i got a new date and the school approved.

Now, 3 months later, 2 months before i am going to japan the school suddenly tells me that internship period is too long. The original contract that i have is 70 work days and they want me to make the company sign a contract where i work 60 days. They say that since the school is not part of the contract between me and the company they ""dont know"" of its existence so that its not a problem for them and that i should just stay 10 days longer after my school contract has expired. (the original contract is between me and the company and the school contract would be between al 3 parties)

Is this even legal? I feel like this shouldnt even be my problem yet the school is dumping it on me and i bet this would be so confusing to explain to the company."

I started here as an intern out of high school and my boss said he was impressed with me enough that they decided to offer me a full time position. Starting here, I didn't know anything about corporate-grade software or the technology that is generally used. Fast forward to now, I've been the sole developer on a few large customer facing applications and I think I've really grown. I'm mainly a backend developer working with Java + Springboot, but I've touched .NET and worked with Mongo/SQL a lot. I talked to my boss and I'm going to work on becoming proficient in .NET next. He's trying to give me .NET projects that one of my coworkers can help mentor me on. 

I make $39.1k a year. I understand that I'm not worth much as someone without a college degree, but I have done a lot of work here. My boss has tried guiding me through everything I've needed to learn and he's said he's impressed with how I'm turning out, and that I wouldn't be here if they thought I wasn't pulling my weight (obviously). But, I still feel like I'm being underpaid at this point. I barely make enough to save money, pay rent, pay for gas + my car, etc...

My question is, do I have enough experience to go out and try to find a new job? Or should I stay here and ask for a significant raise? I like my current company, but I just don't know if they're going to give me enough money. With 2 years of experience, I feel like I'm almost to the point where I can go out and try to find new jobs. But I'm worried that's just not the case."
5axzko,1,2016-11-03,"Had an emotional breakdown and argued with my mom. Now she's taking her anger out on the rest of my family. What should I do? (Long post, but please please read).",jjh0928,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5axzko/had_an_emotional_breakdown_and_argued_with_my_mom/,"Hello everyone, I'm a 19 year old college student and lately I've been struggling. It's my first year of college and it's been really hard for me to make friends and get used to how competitive it is around here. Growing up, I was never allowed to have friends over, hang out with people outside of school, go to parties, school dances, prom, or participate in any non-academic extra-curriculars. I grew up with no social life and now that I am older it's starting to affect me because I have really poor social skills. 

I commute to campus (mom won't let me dorm or take public transport and I don't have a car so she drives me), and she's very strict about picking me up as soon as classes are over, so I can't join clubs, internships, or anything. I go to a pretty ""prestigious"" school, and sometimes the classes are really hard but I can't go to tutoring because my mom just thinks I'm not trying hard enough, even though I stay up all night trying to teach myself the material and even spend my lunch break and all my free time doing my homework and studying. I am stressed to the max and commuting everyday takes a combined three hours which is why I want to dorm on campus but my mom just doesn't get it. 

I don't have any friends in college, I'm really shy and awkward so people just ignore me which is understandable but I've been really lonely and isolated lately and I just want someone to talk to. I had a few close friends in high school, and pretty much everyone who met me at my old school found me kind and funny, but in college it's so different. I'm close to one particular childhood friend, and she was advising me to talk to my mom about how I've been struggling but I was always too scared to confront her, until yesterday.

I had a meltdown yesterday in the car when my mom picked me up after class. I won't bother you all with the details but it was just a bad, exhausting day, and I just lost it. My mom started talking about how she wants to buy me a car because she's tired of driving me around and I told her (honestly so) that I should not get a car because it's more expensive to buy me a car + insurance + gas (my school is far) than it is to dorm (I got a LOT of financial aid + scholarships), plus I'm so busy throughout the day and the last thing I want to do is drive home with 1.5 hours of traffic every freaking night. Then she started yelling at me saying how I'm being idiotic and that only people who hate their parents dorm in college and how it's her responsibility to control my life and campus activities are only for bad, immoral people and that's when I started to get really angry and I told her that she's the reason I've missed out on so many opportunities in life and just because I want to have some independence doesn't mean I'm ungrateful and disrespectful it just means that I am so tired of living like I'm under constant scrutiny and surveillance. When I'm angry, I cry uncontrollably so at this point I was sobbing I'm not sure why but I always get like this in response to stress but then again I've spent a lot of years keeping my frustrations bottled up inside. I asked her why doesn't she trust me because I've been nothing but obedient to her even if it made me mad or frustrated to do so. She doesn't understand that extra curriculars in college are important to apply to grad school and to network and make connections so I can find a good job.

The rest of the car ride was complete silence. I composed myself in time to come home and act like nothing happened to the rest of my family. But today my mom is being a jerk to everyone and no one knows it's because I had an argument with her. I feel guilty that she's taking her anger out by acting coldly to my family but at the same time I don't regret it because it was about time that I stuck up for myself. She's completely ignoring me but that's pretty normal of her when she's mad at anyone, and she usually stays like that for a few days or weeks. Anyway, I'm not sure if I should say sorry or something because I didn't want her to get so mad I just wanted her to realize that I need a little more freedom now that I'm in college. She blows everything out of proportion and she always calls me immature even though she's the one who is holding a grudge. I just don't know what to do. My old friends would always tell me to defend myself from my mom and that things will change for the better but it only made things worse. Please, I need advice.

*Side note* I don't have a job (I'm not allowed to have one) so I can't just leave my home because I'm financially dependent on my parents."
5ay12r,2,2016-11-03,Internship anxiety - any help is appreciated!,haldol5ativan2,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/5ay12r/internship_anxiety_any_help_is_appreciated/,"Hi guys,

I started out my career path as a pre-med, student, and only switched to software engineering within the last year. My questions have more to do with software engineering internships.

Moving on: I've currently applied to a bunch of internships, some from a career fair at my school, and some just from online applications. The only face to face interviews I've been getting are from the booths I visited at the career fair.

My question: should I be discouraged that no one from outside the career fair is getting back to me (I'm assuming silent rejections here)? I'm beginning to think I only got these interviews because of my attachment to the school (Boston university), and not because of my actual skills. On the other hand, I'm not sure if outside a career fair, companies start going through applications at a later date, and is in part why I'm not yet hearing back.

As to my resume: I've been able to be a part of an app that helps BU students (don't want to specify further in case people know), and have worked in a lab from a development perspective (basic troubleshooting, etc). I have knowledge (and have used) most of the major languages (C++, Java/C#, Python, ruby, Linux, sql, html/css). I know this is a pretty shallow delve into said skills, but can provide clarification if needed.

I'm super appreciative of anyone who can offer some insight! I REALLY want to gain some good valuable experience at a full time internship, since most of my programming experience has been class-related."

The bought the car for me (or for me to drive, because they never gave the title over), but now its just a decoration for their driveway because I haven't driven it in ages because I dont live there.

It's like they bought the car just for it to be an instrument of control over me, my education, and my freedom.

These are the type of mind games that are one of their favorites... I knew this was going to happen.  

I could take a taxi everyday but that would be very expensive

What should I do???

edit- in fact i told them in august i may need the car and they said it would be ok and I expressed my concern that they would suddenly without reason change their minds. They said not to worry about it

I would pay for everything... it wouldnt cost them a penny for me to drive it at all!

this is PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE, right??"

5aygcl,31,2016-11-03,Scary email from my nmoms husband,m62613,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5aygcl/scary_email_from_my_nmoms_husband/,"Background: when I was sixteen I wrote an article about a denominational vote that was happening in my moms church. My dad was really proud of me for writing the article so he posted it on his Facebook. One of his friends saw it and offered me a job. I immediately said yes to the job offer because I was really excited but then realized that my nmom and her husband would probably prevent me from accepting the job if they knew that the person who offered me the job knew my dad. The previous year another one of my dads friends offered me a job and my nmom said that I couldn't accept it because the person who offered me the job knew my dad. So this time I decided to not tell her that my dad knew the person and I simply wrote my nmom and her husband an email asking if I could accept the job and did not mention that the person knew my dad.

This was nmom's husbands reply via email:

[my name],

This is a follow up to our brief conversation this morning.

You make these good things extremely difficult.  We are proud that you pursued and obtained a summer internship in an area that interests you.  We are disappointed in the process you used.  That makes it hard to be excited.  The ends do not justify the means, and you were not forthcoming with this plan until after you had done much work on it. This is deceitful, lying by omission, or perhaps being ""economical with the truth"". You can take your pick from the definitions here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Lying_by_omission.  This is the second time in the last two months that I've been the victim of your behavior [refering to the article I posted a few months prior].  It is not fun. 

As a minor, you cannot work without your parent's approval, but you didn't seek to engage them in the process or try to convince them that this was a good idea. Instead, you assumed they would say no and decided to force the issue later, when you already had this good thing in hand.

One of the problems with building your relationships on deception is that people won't trust you and will treat you as untrustworthy.  You crave respect in your interactions, but you disrespect others through your actions [HOW IS STANDING UP FOR MY BELIEFS AND OTHER PEOPLE AND WANTED TO GET A JOB TO MAKE MONEY DISRESPECT?].  You are not doing what is required to be given respect (it is, after all, earned not given).  You blame this lack of respect (most often) on your mother. ""It's her fault she doesn't respect me"", you say.  Well, you are clearly contributing through your actions [MY MOM DISRESPECTED ME NOT BECAUSE I DRANK OR DID DRUGS OR FAILED CLASSES BUT BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE A FUTURE FOR MYSELF THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH].  I doubt you see it, just as you don't see people willing to help you learn to study for tests [I DIDN'T ASK THEM FORM HELP BECAUE ALL THEY DID WAS YELL AT ME AND TELL ME HOW STUPID I WAS EVEN THOUGH I GOT PRETTY GOOD GRADES].

OK, while I hope you've read the above, I fear all you care about is what we're going to do about this situation.  Here is what we're willing to do:

1) We currently have no details.  We must speak first with [name of the company (I'm friends of friends with [founder of the company] and [company employee] but the intro would be more logical through you) to understand the opportunity.  

In that conversation, they are going to hear two true things from me:  1) you didn't tell us until now that you were applying, and 2) you said that Cover reached out to you first.   If speaking those two truths to your summer employer make you uncomfortable, then that's one way you know you've done something wrong.

After the conversation, If the opportunity makes sense to me and you are comfortable getting transport there and back, then you have our support, along with the following condition.

2) You have said (during these last two deceptive episodes) [REFERRING TO THE ARTILE AND SOME OTHER SITUATION THAT WAS PROBABLY SIMILAR]  that you feel quite justified in your deception in order to get your way.  This deeply disturbs me. Therefore, any money you make will go to professional help on understanding your own behavior. You and I will meet repeatedly with a therapist to talk this through.  [THIS NEVER ENDED UP HAPPENING]  this way, you will get both a summer internship experience and hopefully some insight into where your process and character are failing you.

Do you agree to this?
[nmoms husband]

Has anything like this happened to any of you? I was so scared when I got this email (about 3 years ago). I can't believe that he linked a Wikipedia article. Luckily he never forced me to go to therapy but I honestly don't think it's wrong to try to make a future for yourself when Ns are being ridiculous. I no longer live with him or my nmom btw. "

5ayiz4,11,2016-11-03,CERN Connection,nofnwo,Mandela_Effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mandela_Effect/comments/5ayiz4/cern_connection/,"When I learned about the Mandela Effect the main culprit of who or what is causing it that people were pointing out was CERN and their activity. There was barely any substantial connection offered except their field of work and them [mentioning making contact with parallel universe](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/565315/Scientists-at-Large-Hadron-Collider-hope-to-make-contact-with-PARALLEL-UNIVERSE-in-days).

Then someone found this incredible [""We are ""HAPPY"" at CERN"" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Lt9yUf-VY#t=2m31s) and the scientist with hanging signs around his neck [(some say as reference to this sign)](http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2900340.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Hang-Nelson-Mandela.jpg) reading BOND#1 and the second one below it reading MANDELA.

While MANDELA was taken on face value as referring to Mandela Effect the second BOND#1 piece of puzzle was deciphered as being the name of James Bond actor in the very first Bond movie  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Royale_(Climax!) starring Barry Nelson in the role of James Bond. So that made the whole reference to Mandela as in Nelson Mandela more precise and obvious.

I was already convinced that there is some connection between CERN and Mandela Effect but what floored me was seeing the [score on screen at the end of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Lt9yUf-VY#t=3m26s) showing 4664 and comparing it to this [Nelson Mandela speech at Capetown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwpkpuOSjrI#t=36s) showing his trademark ""46664"" prison number. Noticing the similarity between the 2 I found [yet another Mandela Effect related to Mandela himself and his prison number](http://whale.to/b/mandela.html).

If this is a coincidence it's just too much for me. There are plenty of analysis of that whole video itself showing that interns are really participating in some kind of directed occult ritual (probably unbeknownst to them). But then interns at CERN really made their [mock sacrifice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOqiorNCMFU) which was published around 11th August and although everyone could see it's fake it just made the whole thing even more suspicious.

I thought some more about BOND sign meaning and there being a Bond movie Mooraker with one of the most puzzling Mandela Effects in it, which is Dolly no longer wearing braces that made the connection between her and Jaws in the first place. Then it hit me - when you look at what the braces themselves represent it becomes clear. Braces are the BOND between Jaws and Dolly! I mean how many ""coincidences"" can we find connecting the two before reasonably assuming it is no longer a coincidence?

There is also weird numerology aspect to the whole Mandela Effect - CERN connection (made mainly through We are ""Happy"" at CERN video). Apparently video being released on 3rd November 2014. was exactly 333 days after Mandela's death on 5th December 2013. 33 is also present in the day itself that video was released on (3x11=33) and color coded in the ""MANDELA"" sign hanging below scientist head being orange. Orange is 33 in [pythagorean numerology](http://www.professionalnumerology.com/images/pythagoreantable.jpg) (the only color name giving numerological value of 33).

While this might sound far fetched on surface consider the focus on 33 in video itself making appearance as we are being shown at 2 points in the video [firetrucks numbered according to highest freemasonry degrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Lt9yUf-VY#t=36s) first time near beginning, [second time near the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Lt9yUf-VY#t=3m1s). This is a whole another topic though for another time, but I figured it is worth mentioning, as it also appeared in relation to this video.

I tried to add everything I found about ME-CERN connection since I posted my original topic on the old sub, but it's entirely possible I might have missed something important, so I would like if more people would be digging deeper into this connection so we can expand on it and have as much comprehensive knowledge posted about it as possible here."
5ayl8s,14,2016-11-03,What are you doing to improve yourself?,SomeEpicName,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/5ayl8s/what_are_you_doing_to_improve_yourself/,"I'm 23 now and have been trying to improve my social life since 16. Like most of you, I grew up bullied and socially isolated, giving me a constantly depressed looking face. 

Every year since then, I've made more and more effort to be involved in school activities and to understand other people. I've tried talking to people first, following up, and even asking for their contact info. 

In college, I actually **went out to parties nearly every single week**. I went to a party school so this wasn't hard. Sometimes it would be overwhelming seeing all the extremely attractive social butterflies, but I kept going no matter how shitty I felt. I majored in social psychology and sociology which taught me a lot about human behavior. Going out a lot turned me from shy and quiet to outgoing and talkative by the age of 20, but a difficulty I had was that few socially awkward people would go out. I met a few in classes, but they were even worse than I was. I didn't know what to do with that. I **studied abroad** in Amsterdam and realized that people who study abroad tend to be very socially fluent, so I didn't fit in with the other international students (being the only American around didn't help much either). Fortunately, I had a romantic relationship with a local Aspie guy and he told me that autism does not have to hold you back. 

I came back to the USA, finished college, and did some internships afterwards in which I felt horrible anxiety. After that, I couldn't find a job (most jobs I want are too far away from me) so I volunteered a lot where I met more people. I'm now working somewhere I feel pretty good in and talk to the other employees. It's only a temporary job that doesn't relate to my studies much but it's something. 

Since I don't have many friends here in my new city, I don't go out much but when I do I **make an effort to get to know as many people as possible**. I find that people respond much better to me now than before. More people introduce themselves to me and are happier to see me.

Right now I've been **reading various articles and guides online for socially awkward people**, googling terms like ""social calibration"" and such. I've been **paying a lot of attention to physical fitness** and have been lifting in the gym nearly every day. I follow fitness accounts on Instagram for inspiration. Gaining muscle really makes you feel so much better about yourself! It changes the way you stand and carry yourself as well. Being better looking and confident also makes people treat you better, so you have a little more wiggle room to be awkward.

Sometimes I have hopeless moments when I feel like I'm going to be screwed over by my ""weirdness"" and won't make it far in life, but a part of me feels that I can have a normal, or even excellent life one day if I keep working."
5ayvr9,2,2016-11-03,Stripe or Uber for summer 2017 internship?,summerintern2017,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ayvr9/stripe_or_uber_for_summer_2017_internship/,"Hi guys, I'm a junior considering two awesome offers from Stripe and Uber (both in SF). The pay for both is about the same, and I think the benefits are somewhat comparable, too. Stripe offers corp housing while Uber only offers a housing stipend; I would rather take corp housing to avoid the hassle of finding a place to stay in SF. Comparing the offers alone, I would slightly lean towards Stripe.

However, I think that Uber has better brand recognition than Stripe. And since I am going to be looking for full-time opportunities next year, I am assuming that brand name is important for that. This summer 2016, I interned at one of the big 4, so on the other hand, perhaps pursuing brand names isn't as important of a consideration this summer.

My other considerations for my decision would be the company size/culture and possibility of receiving a return full-time offer. Both Uber and Stripe are smaller than any of the big 4, and I would like to intern at a smaller tech company next summer. Also, assuming that I get a return offer, I could see myself working at either company after graduation.

What are your thoughts on this?"

[Before becoming mangaka]

- Togashi's parents managed a company which sold papers, painting tools, stationery and manga magazines. His father's hobby was drawing.

- When Togashi was around 6 years old, he used to draw many of his original heroes and monsters.
When he was around 8 years old, he was inspired by one of his friends whose hobby is drawing manga. They showed their mangas with each other.

- When Togashi was in junior high school, he was fully attracted by some Shoujo mangas whose essential was Shounen manga-ish such as Mineo Maya's manga.

- Since then, he started reading ""Urusei Yatsura"" and learned how to attract female audience. 
Togashi thought he was suitable for Shoujo manga although his favorite manga genre was Shounen manga.

- Togashi was going to become a junior high school art teacher, but gave up right after he started his internship. 
This was because he was afraid that his own words might influence students directly.

- The reason Togashi was going to become a teacher was that he thought he would not be able to work in the same way as normal adults did. 
Shaving and wearing a business suit every day is what Togashi considered impossible for him. He was afraid of living a life outside school. 
After he gave up working as a teacher, he had no choice but to work as mangaka.

- In 1986, Togashi's hype was skyrocketing when he was selected as one of the finalists in a famous manga audition, Hop Step Award.

- When he was a college student, his editor said to him, ""Even if you end up not being able to succeed as mangaka, you have an alternative choice to live as a teacher"". 
After this statement, Togashi got more serious in drawing manga and dropped out of a college. Then he moved to Tokyo aroud 1989.

- When moving, he suffered a trouble about his household goods not arriving his house for a week. Togashi had no choice but to sleep on the floor.

- He couldn't afford to buy a single desk, so he used a drawer as desk when drawing manga. Togashi said it was painful since his legs couldn't put under the drawer. lol

- Togashi was about to run out of his bank deposit. He felt really relieved to hear that Shueisha decied to make a serialization of his manga.

[After becoming professional mangaka]

- The first manga serialization for him was Ten de Showaru Cupid (""An Ill-tempered Cupid in Heaven""). It became pretty famous, but it finished earlier than expected (chapter 32).
Togashi now regrets that he should have prepared a rough plot till the finale before serialization.

- 2-3 months after finishing his first serialization, new ideas for next manga came to his mind one after another. Then He started Yu Yu Hakusho soon.

- Togashi dsecided to focus on the occult and battle in Yu Yu Hakusho since both of them were his favorite genres.

- Editor told him that Toagshi is good at creating a story. Togashi was glad to hear that, but at the same time, 
he thought it wasn't enough in order to maintain great popularity for more than 30 chapters. That's why Yu Yu Hakusho turned into battle manga and made a great success.

- Editors in Shueisha consider it is one of the greatest role models to turn a manga which ends in each single story into battle manga. 
The role model for Togashi was ""Kinnikuman"" (""Muscle Man""). It started as comedy manga and then turned into battle manga, which 
Togashi believes can entertain shounen in terms of both surprise and excitement.

- One year after he finished Yu Yu Hakusho in 1994, Togashi suggested his editor that he would like to draw manga that would NOT become much popular. 
This is because he wanted to show various aspects of his personality as mangaka to his audience.
Togashi believed he had already drawn traditonl Shounen manga to the best of his ability in Yu Yu Hakusho.

- Togashi also told his editor that he would start traditional manga again after he finished ""Level E"". Editor accepted it.

- In ""Level E"", Togashi was going to finish stories in each chapter, but Prince Baka (stupid prince) became popular as opposed to his expectations. 
Thus, he decided to make Prince Baka the protagonist of Level E. The prince had complicated personality which always went beyond everyone's imagination, so Togashi had difficulty in creating a story.

- Having finished Level E, Togashi started Hunter Hunter. He keeps in mind that he should change his style in each arc so that his audience can be surprised.

- Togashi considers character's personality is sometimes important than story. The ending of Chimera Ant arc was not what he expected at first. 
He makes a simulation about how his characters will talk with each other and take an action in specified situations, which allows his audience to feel as if his characters really exist. 

- Togashi loves professional slang. For example, his characters call ""turn over"" when they visit websites. 
Also, he shows detailed concept of Nen as if it exists as some kind of martial arts in real world.

- Togashi tends to show some rules to his audience at first such as Greed Island arc. 
He enjoys the process finding system bugs or shortcuts in the rules to go beyond expectations of audience. 

- In Chimera Ant arc, Togashi enjoyed making a super long list as to how his characters would take actions since 10 days before invasion in Royal Palace. 
He wanted to draw characters in desperate situations taking an unexpected action when they came across someone accidentally. 
Editor gives exmaples such as encounters between Morel and Shaiapouf/ Killua and Meleoron.

- Togashi has been attracted by dirty side rather than beautiful side ever since he was a junior high school student. 
Editor considers Mukuro in Yu Yu Hakusho is one of the typical examples.

- About drawing style, Togashi decided to draw Yu Yu Hakusho impressively and Level E realistically. 
In Hunter Hunter, he keeps in mind that he should not use screentones as possible as he can.

- Togashi doesn't specify detailed personality of boss characters from the beginning. For example, Toguro in Yu Yu Hakusho was just a bodyguard at first, but 
his personality gradually became more attractive as his grudge against Genkai was revealed. 
About boss characters' appearances, he enjoys making them complicated since boss characters don't make much appearances.

- While Togashi is drawing manga, he listens to TV show ad enjoys talking about it with his assistants.

- Togashi considers himself not being good at drawing color spreads.

-Togashi memorises facial expressions ot characters in other mangas. One of his favorite book is ""Facial Expressions"" written by Mark Simon.

- There are 5 assistants in his studio.

- Togashi thinks of Akira Toriyama as a god. He has Dragon Ball 30th book.

- On Togashi's desk, there is some manuscripts of a fight betweemn Hisoka and Kastro which he considers as bad quality. 
He pays attention in order not to repeat the same error. Togashi also says that people on internet fandom were embarrassed with the chapter at that time. lol

- The previous editor says, ""Togashi-sensei is very gentle. He remembers what editors said in the past and sometimes bothered to be worried about us.""

- Editor thinks Togashi resembles Gin Freecss in terms of personality.

- An editor says he was scolded by Togashi only once when he changed words in manga a bit without permission.

- Togashi sticks to every single word in manga. He even doens't want to use various fonts since he is always confident of his words being interesting.

- Togashi's message to mangaka beginners:

""Keep in mind about audience.
Make every effort to go beyond their expectations"".

There are still some concepts that I have not yet seen and although I know I can't be perfect I do not want to waste their time if I know I'm not at the best of my ability. Even if i work hard there is no way that i'll be ready in 3 weeks with my busy schedule.

What should i do?

1 - Refuse the interview and reapply the next year better prepared? 

2 - Go the interview and take the risk of being very bad and loosing the chance of having another interview next year? 

3 - Due to my busy schedule ask if it possible to take the interview at the end of my semester (in 6 weeks instead of 3)?

The only problem is that I had no fun at all at this previous internship. Everyone was decently older, minimal intern program, and the work was with way older technology. The people I worked with were really nice, but that's the only good thing I can say about it.

I've had interviews from pretty good companies, but I think I've been panicking or something, because I haven't had any other offers. My currently pending interviews are coding challenges (one which i did poorly on, another where I did decent).

My deadline's in about 2 weeks, so I'm just worried I won't be able to find anything for next summer if I don't take it.

Does anyone have any advice?"
5azbuo,1,2016-11-03,Fucking Stacy at the Dance Club,readeranon,ReaderAnonErotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReaderAnonErotica/comments/5azbuo/fucking_stacy_at_the_dance_club/,"As it happened, a short internship I had ended while Stacy's university was in session and I had a week to kill before I needed to be back. She invited me to stay with her.

It was a tad awkward as Stacy shared a room with another girl, but we made it work and Stacy was never the sort of girl to shy away from sex just because her roommate was trying to sleep in the other bed.

We were going out to a club the night of this story and while it wasn't normally my thing, Stacy promised that I would spend the night getting ground on by her and some of her friends.

DEAL!

Stacy was competitive by nature and was turned on by competition. She loved to win, but had started to understand by this point that she enjoyed losing to a man who she deemed worthy of besting her. A strange woman.

For our evening out I was in Jeans and a t-shirt. I wasn't much of a snazzy dresser then. Stacy put on a tight dress that let her cleavage pop (it looked like it was going to burst out) and the hem was so short that if she bent over at the waist (which she couldn't because then her boobs WOULD pop out) you could see her pussy. Stacy almost never wore panties.

As everyone began getting ready to go out, we were laughing and joking and began to play the penis game. For those not in the know, in the penis game, you take turns saying penis. Each person has to say it louder than the last until we were eventually, walking around the apartment complex screaming penis at the top of our lungs. We were in our early 20's at the time, don't judge.

As we piled into the car, I was the only guy, this turned into something of an escalation game. I don't want to say it was truth or dare, because it wasn't. It was more like a game of perverse one ups man ship. Trading stories and eventually acts and trying to top the last person.

In the car it was mostly chatter. Someone talked about the time they sucked their boyfriend off while his parents were in the next room with the door open. To top that someone else said they had given a guy a blow job in school, in the boys locker room, during a school day and could hear guys changing near by. Stacy, told about fucking a guy in a public park (me) on a park table. She left out that it was fairly hidden. I decided to be a show off and told that I had fucked a girl in a park (stacy) and then gone to another girls house and gotten a blow job downstairs while her parents were awake upstairs.

I think you get the picture. The topic would change to something else and everyone would start trying to one up each other. I think the best story I heard that night, not involving myself or Stacy, was from Stacy's roommate who claimed to be actively sucking a teacher off for her grade. The one upping was on a topic regarding sex that made you feel gross.

Things escalated to dares. They were very tame at first. We were hitting the club and someone dared me to make a fool of myself while trying to get a girls number. I saw a pretty girl, dropped to my knees and begged Jesus to give me her phone number. I did not get it. Stacy dared a friend to grab the first cute guy they saw and kiss him. She did. There was a lot more along those lines. Go tell that guy you think he's hot. Go tell that girl that you aren't a dyke, but if you were, you'd munch her pussy.

We were on the dance floor and it slowed down a lot because the girls were busy dancing with each other, with me, with guys. Stacy's promise was kept and I indeed ground pretty hard on her and a few of her friends. I was the dude-meat in a cute girl sandwich by this point.

A few dares did pop up. A lot were along the lines of embarrassing dancing. Go dance with that ugly guy. Go grind up on that fat guys leg. Go dance with that guy for a bit and pretend to have an orgasm on him.

One of Stacy's friends had started to dance with a guy and they seemed into each other. Stacy dared her to start making out with him. A bit later the friend dared me to approach a girl for a threesome with Stacy and I (I was rejected!).

We moved off the dance floor and the four of us were sitting around on some chairs and talking. They were closer to dining chairs, just nice padded ones, which will be important soon.

Stacy and her friend kept escalating things.

Stacy to her friends random guy: I dare you to give her boobs a feel right in front of us. He looked at her friend who gave him a sort of flirty smile and nodded. He slid his hand into her dress gave them a squeeze and pulled back.

“Those are great,” he said, then turned to me, “Ok bud, your girl, I think you should give her a nice tit massage.”

Stacy didn't hesitate, leaned forward and I started to squeeze those lovely melons.

Stacy's other friends came over at this point and joked around about what a slut Stacy was and she joked that they didn't even know half. Stacy got onto my lap at this point and was sort of dancing to the music, but more rubbing her ass into my dick, getting me hard and teasing me.

There were a few other dares thrown out. A few pairs of panties were thrown out onto the dance floor, a few boobs were flashed. Yes at this point a large amount of drinking had been going on.

One of the girls felt up the others dress, Stacy's friend rubbed the guy on his pants and then someone made a mistake.

Stacy's roommate, perhaps to get her back for all the sleep we were interrupting, decided to try and push Stacy into backing down. She should have known better.

“I bet you wouldn't fuck (me),” she said to Stacy.

“I fucked him last night and this morning,” Stacy said.

“No,” her roommate said, “Right there, right now.”

“I would have no issue with that,” Stacy said. I held my tongue, it was a little public for me.

They started arguing back and forth and one of Stacy's friends got up and said, “Eww, she's totally going to if you don't stop and I don't want to watch that.”

A few left but Stacy's roommate, who was probably drunk at this point, and her friend and the guy stayed, those two were pretty engrossed in making out with each other.

Stacy and her argued back and forth a few times and then she did it, reached under her, lifted up and before I knew it my zipper was down, she was fishing my cock out and sliding down onto it.

We were at a dance club. People were dancing nearby, a few people were clearly watching us and her friends were right there and Stacy just started to fuck me.

Now if you have seen people fucking in a dance club, you know its not obvious unless they make it so. It's pretty dark, flashing lights and everyone is grinding up on everyone. Only people very close could probably tell what was going on at first. BUT Stacy's skirt was so short that as she fucked me, it started riding up to her waist.

She was bouncing up and down my cock, I couldn't see it but she was making eyes at her roommate who after a few moments yelled something about Stacy being a slut and left. But Stacy didn't stop, she kept on fucking me. I saw a few people watching, staring, I started to worry that we might get in trouble, but Stacy didn't seem to care and either through my fear or who knows, I came very quickly.

She was wild like that. Excitingly, dangerously, no thoughts of consequences wild. The music was pumping, she felt amazing on me and I had so much alcohol in me that I just went for it.

I fucked her in the full view of jebus knows how many people.

When I finished, she didn't move, but smoothed her skirts down. My cock quickly shrunk inside her. A few people whistled over the music and Stacy's friends guy reached over to give me a high five. I was pretty embarrassed.

After a bit Stacy slid off me and I zipped myself back in.

We left soon after that. I didn't say anything, but when we got out of the car, I saw a wet spot under Stacy were I am pretty sure my semen leaked onto her friends cloth car seat.

He roommate passed out and we climbed into Stacy's bed and fucked again."

5azqzj,1,2016-11-03,8 months with local reputable company vs. summer internship in San Francisco,crazyshin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5azqzj/8_months_with_local_reputable_company_vs_summer/,"Today I have received a 8 month internship offer from a local reputable company and the offer expires tomorrow. 

However I just finished an interview with a hiring manager for a mid-size company in San Francisco last Friday which ended very well, as he ""implied"" that I should be receiving an offer sometime this week. The problem is I have not received an offer from this company yet and I am not sure what to do. 

I asked the local company for an extension on the offer, they said we can talk about it once it before it expires on Friday. I have already sent an email to the company in San Francisco regarding the position but I doubt I will hear back from them soon.

I am not sure if I should take a risk and reject this offer and wait for the summer offer or if I should not trust what the hiring manager said and accept this job.

What would you guys do? 

To note: I also have an interview set up with one of the big 4 next week, but I doubt I will do well with them. 

TL;DR: got an offer that expires tomorrow, awaiting for another offer in San Francisco that went well with the hiring manager who implied that I should be getting an offer soon."
5azt03,1,2016-11-03,No idea what to do,JustEndThisAlready,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5azt03/no_idea_what_to_do/,"Using a throwaway because people know my reddit account. 

How do I even begin... I fell head over heels for this girl when we met at a school trip. This was like, a pretty long trip too, about a week. We got to know each other pretty well. At the end of the trip, it seemed as if the planets aligned perfectly as we ended up getting seated next to each other on the plane. I really, really enjoyed spending my time with her and wanted to get to know her better. 

Unfortunately, a few days after we came back she left on a trip to a foreign country for basically the entire summer. Of course this was disappointing to me, but we messaged each other on Facebook and stuff a lot. At first, we were messaging each other every day. About 2 weeks in, I noticed that she was taking a really long time to reply to my messages. I just brushed this off, thinking that maybe she was just busy. A little while later, her replies rarely became longer than one word long. In other words, the conversations became one-sided. I speculate that this could be due to us talking like every day and then running out of things to talk about. Maybe. 

She finally came back home 2 weeks before school started. I gave her a few days to recover from the jet lag, and then asked to get together. She gave me a reasonable excuse: she needed to catch up on summer homework. I was completely okay with this. Then, about 4-5 days later, I asked if she wanted to hang out again. She told me that she had a seminar for her internship or something. Again, understandable. At this point, school is starting in a week, and I'm worrying that we won't be able to get together before then.

Finally, about four days before school starts, I ask her to hang out again. This time, there is no excuse. I told her that I had a party to go to that day, and for her to ""give me an excuse not to go to this boring party."" She then says ""c'mon, parties are fun! You should go."" I tell her I'm not really the party type and would much rather hang out with her. She then says ""maybe you should just stay home and play video games."" 

3 no's. At this point, I'm devastated and decide to give her some space. I needed a break anyway as we have been talking almost non-stop for nearly 2 months. A couple days before school starts, I see pictures of her on Instagram with her friends at the beach. That really ticked me off. 

A few weeks later, it's now mid September. Out of the blue, I message her and ask why she stopped talking to me all of a sudden. I couldn't stop thinking about her. She says ""omg hi sorry I've been really busy, what's up with you?"" And then we have a really good convo that follows, not one-sided at all. I thought that maybe this was because I gave her some breathing room, and now we had more things to talk about with school starting back up and everything. We even began a Snap streak, so that was nice too.

Skipping to early Oct., where I face the same problem as before: basically her ignoring my messages/giving one word answers/not wanting to hang out/etc. I ask her ""I'm sorry but I need to ask this: do you even want to be friends with me?"" To which she answers ""Of course, you're nice, funny, and everything, I've just been real busy with school yk."" Clearly, she can't be this busy as I see pics of her with other friends on social media all the time. I tell her ""I can't tell if that's genuine or not.""

She finally come clean. She says sorry over and over. She then says these exact words: Sorry, but I don't want to be friends with you.

There you go guys. I was not even worthy enough for the friend zone. And I'm telling you right now, I would have been perfectly content with that. I have cried every day because I know that the last time I will ever get to spend time with her in person was probably on that school trip. It's very difficult for me. And right now, I have a lot of confusing emotions I'm dealing with.

Part of the reason why I'm going crazy is because she didn't give me a reason. Like, I asked her why she couldn't even be friends with me, and she wouldn't say. This is honestly the least she could've done for me as I did many favors for her. I gave her homeworks/quizzes to study from (I'm a senior and she's a junior), offered rides home from school (she never accepted, always an excuse), even paid for a meal one time when she asked.  I can't move on from her partly because of this reason.

Another dilemma I'm going through is how I should feel about her. I switch between sadness and anger/resentment constantly. I see her all the time in school. Should I wave high? Usually I just look the other way. I know she notices me because she will look at me, even if I'm walking behind her in the hallways or something. I guess I have this false hope that she's expecting me to keep pursuing her, which probably isn't true.

I know this was a lot of info and the flow probably didn't make any sense. Please give me any advice about this, I have no one to talk to this about. I can't focus in school or anything at this point because I keep thinking of her. It's been a month since I've last spoken to her in-person and online. I thought by now I would surely get over her, but it's just gotten worse. I just look at her Facebook profile and cry every day when I get home from school, imagining myself as one of her friends that she poses with in her many pictures. "
5azzy6,53,2016-11-03,Boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) have both been offered “dream jobs” that are pulling us apart instead of bringing us closer (long),bwv1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5azzy6/boyfriend_26m_and_i_23f_have_both_been_offered/,"Together three years, we have talked about getting married, and moved in together about six weeks ago. We met in undergrad at our state school and are both trained in classical vocal music. In this field, a successful career is difficult to build, and requires extensive travel – not ideal for marriage, family life, or putting down roots, which we both want to do at some point. There is a decent classical music scene around where we live, which we both gig around in. 


7 months ago, he was finishing up his masters program, and I was applying to masters programs around the country. I got a few school offers, one even for a full-scholarship program. 
Around the same time, we both had interviews for similar music-related great jobs in the government – salary, healthcare, retirement options, gym membership all included, plus, near both of our families. The only downside is that neither one of us would be able to actively pursue careers in our specialized fields while doing this job – the government would essentially own us. We can still do a few professional music things in the area, but extended out of town gigs would be out of the question.  


I was offered a position, and he was in the final two - they went with the other candidate, but kept his info on file. 


It took me awhile to decide to take the job. I felt like a sell-out, like the work I did wouldn’t matter and wasn’t what I wanted to do, and that I would be locked in for life (even though my contract would only be four years, then renewable). He stayed pretty neutral through the whole process, until I asked his opinion and he said he thought I should take the job. I ended up taking it, and am on track to start the job within the next three months. I still have some regrets, but think I have made a good financial and stability choice for the next four years. 


Over the summer he had a great internship in his desired field, and worked with a mentor and was feeling in a good place about music. He decided to apply for some Young Artist programs (YAPs), essentially the opera version of a yearlong internship. The only one in our area is extremely competitive, so he’d likely have to move away to do this. I was not happy to hear this and we had the first real arguments in our three year relationship. After talking to a few musician friends, we decided it wasn’t worth worrying too much about yet until he actually had an offer from a YAP – best to wait and see. 


After working through some of these issues (or, pushing them to the side), we decided to continue with plans to move in together, and literally on our move in day, he got a call offering him the job he’d been a finalist for, and they needed to know within four days or they’d start advertising for the position again. 
He was really conflicted. He said earlier this year he didn’t have confidence or feel he would ever really be good enough to pursue a professional music career, but after the summer everything felt different. He said he didn’t like being alone in a hotel (which is a lot of being a professional opera singer…) but making good quality music was an unparalleled feeling. I told him I would have serious reservations about getting engaged to him if he didn’t take the job – a comment I don’t feel good about but I feel is true. 


He ended up taking the job, but didn’t feel great about it. Yesterday, I came home, and saw a completed application for YAP in New York on his computer screen. He said he didn’t tell me because he thought I would be mad, but I was more upset that he didn’t tell or include me. I don't think he's backing out on the job, but keeping options open. He feels like he’s giving up his dreams and selling out – a lot of the same feelings I had a few months ago. He thinks in four years people in the opera world might not take him seriously (a lot of YAPS have age cutoffs) and that he’s closing doors forever. 


I am afraid that there is more and more animosity building up about this, and that I’m competing with his dreams. I don’t want it to be music or me, and I don’t feel like that’s fair to ask… but that is how it feels a lot of the time. I want to be supportive of his dreams, but not if it’s going to make us long distance, be financially less secure, and not even have guaranteed success in opera/freelance music. I hesitate to even discuss it anymore because he has said it feels like I’m not even listening, but just looking for ways to refute what he’s saying. But I do know where he’s coming from… I’ve literally made the same decision. 


How to move forward feeling better? Does one or both of us need a reality check? 

-- 

**TL/DR:** Six months ago, I took a salaried secure job with benefits, but passed up on grad school and pursuing my desired specialized field. My boyfriend is now facing the same dilemma, and his reservations are causing some rifts between us – we both recognize that the secure job is the logical thing to do, but he feels like he’s selling out and giving up his dreams. I feel like he is choosing between me or his dreams, and that hurts. "

&lt;!&gt;&lt;…EMERGENCY MESSAGE RECEIVED…&gt;&lt;!&gt;
&lt;!&gt;&lt;…DISPLAYING MESSAGE...&gt;&lt;!&gt;

Hello. If you can read this, it’s very important that you continue. Otherwise, I cannot be at fault for what happens to you next.

My name is Rick. I’m an intern at the Castle Marco Observatory, posted in the furthest reaches of known space. I’ve worked here for a couple months now. Just a couple weeks ago, the station was evacuated, due to the arrival of an unidentified anomaly nearby the planet.

Unfortunately, I was left behind, along with another scientist, who is currently in the main observation center. I’m currently holed up in a small supply closest, hiding from these…well…things. Let me start from the beginning.

It was late at night when the man arrived at the main entrance of the castle. He was banging on the door, yelling something completely unintelligible. I was a couple floors above him at the time, grabbing some supplies to keep the castle up and running for a few more days when I heard the screeching.

I immediately dropped everything, covering my ears in a futile attempt to drown out the terrible noise. I quickly made my way to the nearest window, and saw the man torn in half right in front of me. Clutching his remains was one of the creatures.

I’ve never seen anything like it. It looked similar to humans, but much larger and with wings similar to that of a bat sprouting out of its back. Several pieces of skin connected its lips together. Its eyes were bright yellow, and staring directly at me.

It widened its mouth, and it shrieked so loudly my ears rang for quite a while afterwards. It dropped its food, obviously interested in new prey. As I backed away from the window, it charged. Just as I thought it would break through, a metal barrier slid in between the window and the creature.

Thankfully, my friend had activated the castle security systems. Layers and layers of metal barriers prevented the creatures any access to the area, along with automatic turrets appearing from hidden slots from within the walls. Unfortunately, they had been malfunctioning for quite a while, so the turrets were quite useless. 

Wasting no time, I immediately began making my way to the next floor up.

I made my way down the hall, opening every barrier in my way. I eventually made it to the end of the hall, where a flight of stairs awaited me. That’s when I heard it.

Behind me, the creature slammed into the window. Again and again and again, it pounded on the barrier, until it eventually broke in, falling onto the floor of the hall. Looking up, the creature spotted me.

The hallway, along with the rest of the castle, was not meant to withstand the brutal force of these creatures. As it rushed me it repeatedly slammed into the walls, knocking the stones that made up the wall out of place. It shrieked again, and I quickly backed away.

I quickly closed the closest metal barrier to me, barely keeping the creature from catching me.

That’s when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it. A large, clawed hand gripped the frame of the doorway behind me. I felt a breath on the back of my neck, and something behind me made a soft purring sound.

It came from out of the stairway, circling me slowly. This one was smaller than the other, with wings that hadn’t completely developed yet. I didn’t move a muscle.

It stared at me, and I stared back. I knew it was toying with me, and would try wait until it became disinterested. It got closer, and I could smell its foul breath as it stared directly at me. I couldn’t hold my breath any longer, and exhaled as little as possible.

It tilted its head, and made a slight chirping sound, before narrowing its eyes and letting out a shriek, one that wasn’t nearly as powerful as the adults’, but it was so close that it didn’t matter. I lost hearing at that moment as I quickly fell onto the floor. 

Another shriek could be heard below, and the creature quickly scurried off, back down the stairwell. I struggled to get up, my head still in pain. I managed to get up, leaning heavily on the wall.
I made my way onward, crossing over to another hallway in front of me. I turned the corner, and am currently hiding in this small supply closet now.

I can hear them coming. This is to anyone living near the edge of known space: get yourself out. Head somewhere safe. If you see them coming, hide and don’t let them know you’re there.

I know a lot of people on here have mixed feelings about Groupon as a company, but that was from at least a year ago. What do you all think of Groupon as of right now? Will it still be around long enough for me to have the internship?"

5b0vef,29,2016-11-03,TIFU my ankle by surfing the internet for too long and having a small bladder,kleptoplasty,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5b0vef/tifu_my_ankle_by_surfing_the_internet_for_too/,"This is a throwback fuck up.

Basically, I was going to be picked up for a soccer game by my best friend, who texted saying she would call and warn me a little bit before she was leaving. I, in the process of wasting time on my laptop, was like “dude totally” and just kept on surfing the internet, assuming when I got the call, I would have time to get ready and run out the door.

Little did I know I would literally be running out the door, and not back in for quite a while.

Obviously, I should have just gotten ready, but as we all know, the internet can be all-consuming, and I have no willpower. This was a couple hours before the game, so I was drinking lots of water to hydrate and stuff and basically not really paying attention to the time.

Sure enough the call came and broke my distraction, but instead, she said she was actually already on her way. Note: she lives like a two-minute drive from my house. Freaking out, I raced around my house, throwing on my uniform, grabbing shin pads, socks, water, and so on.

I rushed out the door, ran to their car, and realized the water I had downed earlier was really taking its toll on my bladder. So I asked if I had time to use the washroom, tossed my bag on the ground, and hardcore *sprinted* to my side door. It was not out of necessity to pee, mind you, but because I was scared I was going to make us late.

In the middle of my driveway was an old trailer. Naturally, upon hitting this roadblock, I set my left foot to the side and onto my neighbour’s lawn, in order to avoid aforementioned trailer. Naturally, that foot slipped because I was wearing worn-down Birkenstocks, I was running like a madman, and the grass was wet. Naturally, as my left foot was sliding forwards, my right foot stayed firmly planted on the pavement and I saw in a flash—as I was so gracefully falling down—my ankle snap outwards.

Basically, what followed was just me laying on the ground sobbing at my rapidly swelling ankle and my parents rushing outside like “wtf” and my friend and her dad being like “wtf”, and then there was a nice trip to the hospital.

Coincidentally, this all took place at the exact same time my parents were supposed to leave to go pick up my brother from the airport after his summer internship abroad. Instead of seeing her son, my mom got to drive me to the emergency room, where I learned it wasn’t just sprained, I full on broke my fibula and needed surgery.

Best part was at the hospital, when all the nurses kept asking me how the soccer game went, jokingly asking if was it the winning goal, because I was in my uniform. To which I had to reply that no, I hadn’t made it to the game, as I had slipped on my neighbour’s lawn. Oh, the looks I got. My cheeks were flaming.

This also took place a week before I started my first year of university; I missed out on the 101 week I had paid for just nights before and got to “explore campus” on crutches for the next month and a half.

To top everything off, there wasn’t even a rush to begin with, as I was so unfortunately unaware, because we had to wait for a third teammate to arrive at my house who was also carpooling before we could leave.

In the end, I have a three-inch scar on my ankle to forever remind me of my stupidity and bad life decisions:

Take note, children. Don’t wait until the last minute to get ready, and don’t run in Birkenstocks on wet grass.

**TL;DR** I broke my ankle and needed surgery because I freaking slipped on grass when running to the washroom."

I got sick, hid my sickness and it ruined me for the long run. My GPA was a 0.9. Since then I went back to community college and transferred back to a 4 year University. . I left CC with a GPA of 3.12. I'm in a 4 year university now. A small one compared to the one I was dismissed from. My GPA is a little above a 3.6. I've done research in other countries (TU of Munich, Germany). I also have an internship in the NIH where I work under a scientist and I have had many posters and presentations. I also do research with my professor in my current undergrad college. I have a semester and a half left. I feel like I reached a slump and I feel like this is all for nothing. I have this feeling where I'm nothing I should just give up on everything. All my friends started great and are going to great places. But I'm here, I just exist. It's practically my last year and my classes are getting hard. It's not that the classes are hard per se, I think I've become mentally drained and I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm getting back to the slump I had 4 years ago and im worried. I feel like I don't deserve to live because of all the failure. I've had everyone even my own friends tell I would never make it to medical school. In my heart I believe it. But my mind is telling me I'm wasting my time. What do i do? Should I keep going? Or should I give up"

The pay is slightly higher at Citadel ($10k/month vs $8k/month, corporate housing for both), but I know that Facebook has a big return intern signing bonus. I'm leaning toward Citadel because I think it would be interesting to try something different (I interned at a large tech company last summer). I wouldn't mind the more competitive culture at Citadel (I felt the culture was too laid back last summer), and I prefer Chicago to the South Bay. Would I be making a mistake by choosing Citadel?"
5b13wi,1,2016-11-03,School is making me miserable and preventing me from living the life I want to live and it's been killing me this semester...,trevordabomb,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5b13wi/school_is_making_me_miserable_and_preventing_me/,"I decided to go to arguably one of the me most rigorous colleges in the country to study biochemistry and molecular biology. I love the subject and I am learning so much, but the workload is just destroying me. I'm in junior year and this semester is almost over, so I'm almost finished, but holy hell... 

I literally spend most of my waking hours either working on school, thinking about school, or studying for school. It feels like a shadow that follows me everywhere and that I can never escape from. Weekends aren't weekends because they just pile on the work for them and there always seems to be an exam that needs studying for coming up. It just feels like a constant marathon and it's just exhausting me... In the brief moments that I decide to take a break from work in order to try and relax, it's impossible for me to enjoy myself because of the looming to-do list. 

There's so many habits I want to develop and things I want to do and people I want to meet, but it feels impossible during these years that I'm in school. People talk so much about having so much fun during college and meeting so many new people, but that's been the opposite of my experience. There's no time for fun or to have a social life. Winter and summer breaks are the only times for a break, but even then, you're pretty much expected to have an internship or something to gain experience.

I so badly want to be able to have my own space to decorate as I please, to have the free time to go out in the evenings, to have the money to not worry about going out to eat every once in awhile... I just kinda feel like these five years of school (I plan on doing one year of professional school after my bachelor's) are nothing but a waste of my life for what? A better wage and an intimate understanding of something that I can talk with few people about? I just sometimes question if it's really worth all this work and all this time of my life dedicated to this single task...

I know my life will be infinitely better when I finish school. I know having a better wage will make me much happier than working a minimum wage job. I know the knowledge I'm gaining and the experiences I am having while in college are causing me to grow in ways I wouldn't otherwise. But man, it's just fucking hard. It's exhausting, and I'm so burnt out and ready to be done. People complain about 9-5, but 9-5 literally sounds like heaven to me when I'm working 14-16 hours a day for 108 days straight two times a year... 

Sorry, I know that I am really privileged to even be attending college, let alone a really great college, and I really am grateful for it. But I'm also just so, so, so ready for my life to begin. College just feels like a limbo where I'm ready to begin my life, get a house, etc. but just can't...

tl;dr: Go to a really rigorous college that takes up all my free time and really just want to start living my life (having a job, home, going out with friends etc.) but feel trapped in these 5 years and unable to do the things I want. "

(I'm basically a design engineer who does autocad all day and I'd rather be programming or in the field messing with stuff hands-on.) I am going back to school at night/online in the spring at the local CC to pivot my skillset and searching for jobs that actually interest me. I did great work as an intern and thought that if I paid my dues with the bitch-work I would move up faster to better things, but that isn't happening and I don't want to keep letting my coworkers down and get fired. How do I start giving enough of a shit to fake it until I find a new job? "

(besides data structures and algorithms) 
5b1zfz,3,2016-11-04,I'm 28 and still never been in a relationship before.... I just want to fix myself. (Huge wall of text ahead) (Advice welcome),scaredengr,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5b1zfz/im_28_and_still_never_been_in_a_relationship/,"Also should add that - because I was heavily sheltered growing up - I'm a late bloomer in practically anything and everything. Got my driver's license at 25, my first real paid job at the age of 26, and am still pursuing my bachelor's degree at university (I've spent 10 years in college on and off). 

Despite being so late to the party, I'm actually happy that I was able to finally accomplish those things. As things stand now, I feel like the current me is much smarter, a WHOLE lot more confident, and a lot more certain of my goals. Despite all of this, I have never, ever been in an actual relationship before. 

It always boggled me; I have lots of opportunities to connect with men (especially in my classes, which are predominantly male). I don't believe it has anything to do with my looks; I've been pursued many times by men throughout the years. I 100% know that it is me. I know that it's my fear that's holding me back. but fear of what? Honestly, I have no idea. Even though I said I was confident above, there are still aspects of myself that I'm not as confident about. Mainly my appearance. And yeah, I know I also said above that looks don't seem to be a problem for me in terms of attracting guys, but I always have this stupid, weird feeling in the back of my mind that I'm ""deceiving"" them.

Let me explain that last bit a little more, because I know it sounds weird (and my explanation will sound weirder, but since this is /r/offmychest, I'm just going to go with it for now). I feel that sometimes I can look really pretty, and sometimes I can look hideous. I rarely wear makeup, so ""pretty"" days are mainly non-makeup days too, so I think the assessment is fair. I feel like when I first meet guys, they don't see the real me -- they haven't noticed any of my real flaws yet. And once they do, I'm afraid they'll reject me... so I guess I'm afraid of rejection too (like everybody else). Being humiliated... that's not fun. I suppose I just have a really, really fragile ego. I know that it's a dumb thing to worry about, but that's it. I know I'm overthinking it, but how do I get comfortable with just not giving a fuck?

One of the reasons why all of this has been on my mind lately is because last year, I did it again. A really attractive guy (who was very close to my age) came up to me and started to grow close to me. And when he did, I got scared - and when I got scared, I began to ignore him. Which is kinda hard to do when you have all of the same classes together. But I managed it. And when he started to notice, he tried to pursue harder - would always try to meet up with me after class or ask my friends where I went. I continued to ignore. In class, he didn't exist to me - if I bumped into him, I passed him and avoided eye contact. It was abrupt- we went from walking back to my place together, studying together, talking late into the night.... to no contact. Yes, I know this is really shitty. I feel like a shitty person. But that's why I feel like shit. Here was a genuine, caring, good-looking guy. He always went out of his way to do things for me (I didn't like this, but I understood the meaning behind  his gesture and knew he meant well). Smart, athletic, funny, down to earth... he had everything I was looking for. And what did I do? I just ran away...

I ran because of what I said earlier -- I'm afraid of rejection, being humiliated. As our friendship escalated (and it escalated fast..) I began to get self-conscious, and this is where that ""deceiving"" thing comes in-- I thought that if I let him come closer, he won't like who I really am. This guy was the first in a long time who seemed to fit in with what I've always looked for in a partner. But he seemed too good to be true. I didn't believe it, and maybe I just got angry, and my ignoring was probably due to the fact that I thought he may just be mocking me instead (why? fuck if I know...).

Nowadays, I still see him in class. He hasn't texted me since last year. The last time I bumped into him face-to-face was a few months ago - as we passed, he hurriedly put his face down and walked past me. It was so awkward, it hurts. :( And I made it that way...

Looking back at my life, I am proud of all of the things I have accomplished, and I am grateful for all of the wonderful, loving people around me -- my family and friends have been exactly what keep me together. I'm almost out of college and am all set for graduation, and my boss at a previous internship has recommended me for a nice, well-paying position at a big tech company so that I can actually be living my dream. And all of that makes me happy. But in the end, no matter how successful I become, I'll never be happy alone... and that is the problem I want to fix. I just... don't want to be alone. :(

Anyway, that's all. This is just a pile of thoughts that have been sitting at the back of my mind as of late. It feels nice to let this all out into the open. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

tl;dr: 28F, never been in a relationship, afraid to be vulnerable, wants to know how to overcome this. and feels deep regret for being shitty to guys who were actually interested in me"

 I have about 10k saved up and will have to be moving out within the next month. I have a lot of restaurant experience so hopefully wherever I go I could get a job in that to pay the bills while searching for a career. I live in NY and am not sure if moving into the city is a viable plan with no job lined up or if I should try moving to some other city or anywhere else.

I'm sure the bottom line is apply, but if I have to move somewhere soon and I can go anywhere, preferably somewhere I would be able to realistically find a job with my levels of experience and being able to afford it going in with nothing lined up. Any advice is appreciated definitely."

What should I get?",ChicoTacos,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5b220v/buying_new_or_used_car_this_month_crunching_the/,"After test driving several cars, I decided that I want to purchase a Mazda3, the most basic model with manual transmission. Now the question is, should I buy new or should I buy used.

I like in a big city (2mil+), I searched through older used Mazda3 (2013-2015) with under 60k miles. The cheapest I could find was around 12k. 

 I could pick up a brand new 2017 manual transmission base model Mazda3 16-17k.

Am I missing something? Seems like spending the 4-5k more for a great warranty and new car seems worth it but, I don't want to make a financial mistake so I am seeking your advice.

As background, I'm 21 making 85k in a low COL area with no debt. I have been saving up the past 3 months so I could pay off the car cash. I also have a good amount of saving from my internships in college as an emergency fund. 

So, should I get the new Mazda3 or a used one?

5b2clr,1,2016-11-04,Got an internship offer. How do I convince my parents to let me go,CheeseCakeHaven21,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5b2clr/got_an_internship_offer_how_do_i_convince_my/,"Hi. I'm currently doing my ACCA studies after finishing my degree. I recently left my full time job to take time off to complete my ACCA full time. I'm 23 this year.

So recently I applied to the ACCA internship program. But my parents are bent on me taking on a full time job instead after I finish my papers in December. I went for the interview just to see if I could qualify. So I actually passed the first round of interview and I received an internship offer from a reputable firm (BDO LLP). 

I've applied for many FT jobs back in August just to see how many companies (including BDO, oh the irony) will write back to me and in fact only 1 got back to me which didn't give me a favorable offer at that time so I had to turn it down. 

I spoke to the HR yesterday and they said they'll take me on as an intern till the period stipulated in the program (3months min.) and after which they'll see if I have performed adequately enough to be considered for a FT job. I feel that is reasonable and said I'll give them my final answer after thinking about it through the weekends. 

So my situation is not such where I'm desperate for the money. In fact I feel that the internship will prove to be a good stepping stone to enter into the company and earn myself a good name and hopefully gain a very good experience from it. 

My parents are very bent on their decision (idk if it's an Asian parents mentality to ""micro manage"" the decisions). But I need to find the courage to convince my parents I wish to pursue this route instead because I'm very very interested in saying yes. 

I appreciate any constructive feedback! "

5b2ml5,240,2016-11-04,Turns out my (20M) 9 months GF (21F) is a compulsive liar and she allegedly cheated on me twice.,Papy_Wouane,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5b2ml5/turns_out_my_20m_9_months_gf_21f_is_a_compulsive/,"Hello everyone. First let me say that being French, I apologize in advance for my non-native English.

It is 8:30am here in France. Earlier in the night, at around 2am, I found out on my girlfriend's phone that she cheated on me last week. Before I go deeper and deeper into this story, I'd like you to believe me when I say that I was not abusively spying on her: She came back from holiday two days ago and I could feel in my gut something was up, although I did not know what. Last night she fell asleep with her music on and I merely wanted to turn it off, so I picked her phone and a rather suspicious Messenger notification popped, so I clicked it and rolled down a whole conversation between her and her secret lover. As I said this was at 2am. I did not know what to do, I picked up half of my stuff and ran out without even waking her up. I was shaking, I cried a lot, I spent the night out on the phone with mutual friends of my GF's and mine. They were all very supportive. But it turns out they weren't surprised...

A little bit of context: We've been together for 9 months, which I agree is rather short, but man was our relationship intense. We practically lived together in her flat (I had mine not far away, but I could sleep at my GF's basically every day, spend a maximum of time with her, and we got along marvelously well, so why bother the solo life right?). We were deeply in love and told each other so frequently, along with a flow of mutual compliments, we were starting to plan out our future together -- All in all we were two young lovers on cloud nine. Or so it seemed.

I have no idea where to start.. Maybe giving you a quick picture of us two could help. She and I have completely different characters. I'm the laid back kind of guy, to whom nothing really is a problem unless health, or work, this kind of serious matters are involved. I often tell myself ""Will this [insert whatever day-to-day issue] matter in a 20 years' time? No, then stop bothering, this is stressful for nothing."" I'm emotionally very stable. I have an analytical point of view on basically everything, I like to step back and think about whatever situation through all angles before acting. Now, she's the opposite. She likes to live her life at 100%, she's impulsive, always super involved in whatever she's doing. Her hobbies speak for themselves: Parachuting, Fire-juggling, whatever adrenalin based activity: Just name it, there's a chance she's tried it once at least. She's overwhelmed by her emotions, whether it be good or bad ones: When whatever small day-to-day issue comes up and she does not instantly find an answer, this can lead her to tears and depression. When someone brings good news, she'd be singing and dancing and be so excited throughout the whole day. She's a rollercoaster. I'm used to her ups and downs. I don't think she was ever properly diagnosed with anything but she has already been seeing a psychiatrist for these issues, and particularly the nightmares she keeps having since her childhood. Anyway, in France we say ""Just as magnets, opposites are attracted each other"". This was us, basically.

Last week, she drove across half the country to go to her usual DZ (for the uninitiated: Drop Zone, or Parachuting club/centre). She spent 9 days there. Club is small, everyone knows each other, she's got lots of friends there. Usually whenever we're in different places, we remain close and text each other constantly. She was being very distant, if I did not initiate conversations she wouldn't bother sending me anything, not even hi or good night. I started to feel left off and I told her so. We had a fight about it. She basically told me I had no right to expect so much attention from her and that I knew how she was, and that when she was out parachuting, this deserved her attention (back to the ""I do things at 100%, there's no room for anything else"" thing). She came back two days ago and I could feel something was broken between us. She stopped telling me she loved me, which is a massive deal considering she used to do it several times a day. She did not seem happy to come back to me, or at least, not 'enough'. Rest is what I described in the first paragraph.

As I said, I just spent the night outside, not really knowing what to do. First thing that came to mind, I called my friends. They're in Argentina right now, 5 timezones away, so they were available to answer. I spent 3 hours on the phone. One of the persons I called is one of my GF's closest friend, and a dear friend of mine as well (let's call her Mary). Her version of the story is appalling... Apparently, back in June, my GF told Mary about this one guy she met and she thought she was in love with. She told Mary she was in love with two guys at the same time -- me and this guy. Mary told her this is bullshit, make up your mind, don't do this to [me]. They had a massive fight apparently. Though my GF had her promise she'd never tell any of this to anyone, and she didn't. Up until this day, over the phone, because my GF cheating on me was too much for her to handle and she couldn't hold it anymore.

Mary told me about aspects of my GF's life I had never heard of. She said my GF is a compulsive liar. She caused a lot of harm around her in the past, lying about things such as accusing one of her cousins of molesting her. Things went so far south she had to move out to another city. Mary is one of the first persons she turned to when she arrived here. How does Mary know all this? She said she, herself, had had lying issues in the past, and they'd discussed a lot together about their past stories, and they somewhat related to each other. Anyway, even here in this new city my GF kept going with her lies, until 3rd year of Uni when Mary and another friend of theirs called her bluff, confronted her about the two opposite versions of the same story my GF had told each one of them. For the record, this was just before she and I got together. Anyway this confrontation caused a massive fight between the three friends. Mary somehow remained close to her, but the other friend (let's call her Ann) basically wiped my GF out of her life as soon as she understood she was just constantly lying to everyone. This caused my GF a massive depression, as those two had been roommates for two years, and extremely close.

This is when I showed up. I quickly became her lifebelt, and we got together. According to Mary, my GF is unable to handle her emotions alone. She needs someone to be really close to, be it a friend, or in my case a boyfriend. But she can't help her lying habits, and Mary.. Well she basically described to me the way my GF works with people: Everytime the person whom my GF was close friends with called her lies, there would be a fight and she'd just pass on to another person to be close with. I am that person.

Now. I'm about to confront her. Among the things Mary told me over the phone, apparently my GF already cheated on me in July when she was doing her internship in Argentina. I also need to question her about the things she told me of her past. She told several people about her past, which is sketchy as hell. Problem is, every one of her friends was given a different version of the story. According to Mary, this is how my GF does it with people: She tells them about some story, but exactly the parts she wants them to know. Different audience, different parts of the same lie. And no one knows they're being lied to until they exchange their version with another friend of my GF.

I am somewhat grateful to Mary. Yes, in hindsight, she knew enough to get me out of this relationship earlier if she'd warned me. But I understand the role of a friend, I don't blame her for not intervening in a couple she had no business with. Now I'm gathering my strengths to go and confront my GF. Though Mary admitted herself she was kind of a big liar in the past, so I cannot take anything she said for the truth. I've tried contacting Ann, who is also a good friend of mine, for answers to my many questions. She's genuinely honest, I can trust her and she'll help me tell the right from the lies. Once I gather an honest and thourough picture of what the fuck is exactly going on, I'll go out there and confront my girlfriend. Now.. I'm just not ready to do it now.. I couldn't look her in the eye and keep a straight face. I came home to my apartment where my sister was staying for the night. Woke her up at like 5:30am, and cried in her arms. As to my GF, I just disappeared and sent her some bullshit text that says ""Hello. Quick message to let you know I won't be going with you this weekend [we had plans]. I'll be gone for a while, I need some time for myself"". No clear reference to the fact that I know about her cheating on me. And she just woke up and asked me where I was. To answer her calls, and so on.

I'll try and update this when I have more news. I.. I seek truth, as I have a feeling I will never quite recover until I have it.

Hell. I started off my message saying it was 8:30am... I'm done writing and it's 10:30am already...

**TL;DR:** Found out tonight that my GF cheated on me multiple times. Was at her place. Ran out in the middle of the night without waking her up. I'm looking for the truth. Mutual friend of ours revealed she's a compulsive liar. I'm lost.

**EDIT 1, Next day 2pm**:
Hey guys. Thanks a lot for showing up. It means a lot, even from strangers. This morning I went to see Ann. Again, very supportive. She's so sorry she did not help me by warning me earlier, but I understand, totally. Her and Mary are friends. All this time I was dating my GF they talked to each other, they both knew about my GF's past and lying habits, they were scared for me, but could not intervene. I don't blame them. Anyway, Ann confirmed everything Mary told me over the phone was true. It destroyed me even more. I guess little bits of me still did not want to believe it.

Met my brother (26) today. He told me something I had not even considered (but that I actually also saw in the comments today), but I'd like to know what you think of it: What if I did not confront her. What do I have to win in that? Can I just tell her to never talk to me again ? Or do I need a conversation with her to put all this to an official end?

On a side note, my GF is asking me to send her news, every way she can (FB, texts, WhatsApp..). I still haven't replied, I'm not sure I should.

**EDIT 2; 5:30pm:**

I'm really not sure. She sent me this text: ""Ok. I give up. Come back if you think we should talk. I won't be texting you any more, not because I don't think about you, but because I can see I'm just bothering you, rubbing salt in your wound. Wish you well, and see you in x days or weeks.""

No big news this time. I keep reading through your replies and I once again thank you for showing up. I hear you when you tell me to ghost her. Its just as viable an option as confronting her, it would certainly spare me some useless talk. And you're afraid she'll get into my head, and I thank you for caring. But I think I recovered my senses and I won't bite anymore of her bs. I'd like to see whether she's going to dig deeper into her multilayered lies, or if she's at last going to grab that once chance I give her to come clean. Either way, as I commented somewhere below, I am certainly not forgiving her for what she's just done to me.

**EDIT 3, it is now 23:15pm** - Rage outburst

I have lost control over my emotions and this scares me. Today I spent my time going from friends' places to other friends' places, looking for friendly ears, and I found them. Sometimes I'd be able to sit calmly and explain -- to them as much as to myself -- over and over again what just happened to me. Some other times I'd just burst out in tears. The only constant is that I break down as soon as I'm alone.

Right now, anger is on the wheel.. and I'm actually not done telling you everything she has done to me. This one story I could not find a relevant spot to write in my post, so here it is raw. And I can only assimilate it to straight up, next level cruelty. You were warned.

So this guy she cheated on me with. I knew him, I'd met him before. How ? He's just another parachute dude after all, and I never accompanied her there. Well. She had the guts to invite him to her place, about a month ago, to ""visit"". He slept on the living room couch while I slept with my GF literally next door. He stayed something like a week. Actually, now that I think of it, he stayed until Sunday. However I went back to my parents' on Friday of that week, to do whatever I had to get done. God knows what happened during those two days. Anyway, this was not even my point. One morning my GF woke up all sad and withdrawn. As I told you, I'm used to her ups and downs. I asked her if something was wrong, expecting something about another one of her nightmares. I was taken aback: ""Listen.. I need to tell you something. This one friend sleeping on the couch right now. I had a crush on him the day we met, back in June. But it is you I want to be with, it is you I love, and I know if he were to try something with me I'd still be able to say no. But I can't handle this anymore, he needs to leave."" Make whatever you want of that. I was blind, dumb enough to not see the red flag. I gave her a chance, I said fair enough, I trust you. Man did I get a reward for this. Phew. It's a relief, I needed that out of my chest.

**EDIT** For clarity reason, as I was re reading my original story and it is chaotic and confusing: the dude my GF had a crush on, she met him first in June. Then he came over last month (story of last Edit). And then she committed the deed last week with him on the DZ. All the same guy. And then, there's this whole other guy from this summer when she was in Argentina. At this point it almost seems anecdotic, but I heard they stayed together for two weeks. At the end of which she said to Mary: ""Look, okay I cheated on him, but I regret and it made me realize how much I really love OP"". Yes, she did say that. Meh, he must have been bad in bed."

Thanks!!

Alright, Reddit! I've lurked here for a while, and have done a fair amount of IF and short (36 hour+) fasts before. Mostly have always prided myself on someone who's competent, disciplined, strong, full of drive, and [thumos](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/03/11/got-thumos/). Cue six months of break-up season, stress-eating, partying, late-night Poptarts, and general ennui. Turns out temporarily giving up on my goals and having an unhealthy relationship with food was disadventageous, *herp-da-derp*. Finally came to the epiphany that I will never *feel* like fasting, but only my actions will create the future and habits that I want. Hence posting here for accountability and external motivation, as well.

I know my fasting is not intended to detox and it's for controversial weight loss and whatever,  but we're all here for different reasons. Our action-- fasting-- is the same, and although we can disagree with each other's motivations, our goals and setbacks and physical bodies are aligned. My primary motivation is rebuilding confidence in my relationship with food, body, and self-discipline, and reaching IF-style maintenance within the next couple months. Start seeing food as fuel, rather than entertainment or emotional comfort.

**Some stats**: I'm 21, 5'0"" and female. My TDEE is ~1800 calories. I'm fairly active (go to college/university in a large American city, work at a restaurant-- iPhone says around 4-5 miles a day). My UGW is between 95 -100 pounds. I've been there before and it's my ultimate, empowered, badass self weight. Goddamn.

SW: 120

GW1:110

GW2: 100

UGW: 95

Will post progress pics, weight stats, etc. when finished. For those who doubt my drive, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4x4PS0BJgeEwPvmk5wIz7H9Rcqqkf8OaZxhlY4ciGU/edit?usp=sharing)  is a spreadsheet I kept for almost a year of my calorie intake and weight fluctuations. Wasn't hardcore trying to lose weight, mostly maintained (HUGE caloric intakes were spurred by croissants in France or emotional angst, heh.)

LET'S DO THIS.

**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for your input and kindness!! Posting here because I fully appreciate, respect, and would like to be a part of this community. My family has been 20/4 fasting for years and it feels good to fall into their lifestyle, as well. This all feels incredibly self-indulgent and I don't want to reduce fasting to merely a weight-loss tool. Thanks everyone.


*Summary of fast*:



DAY OF FAST | TYPE OF FAST | NOTES
---------|----------|---------|----------|
Day 1 | Broth fast | Terrifyingly unhungry the entire day. Like 1.22/10. I had a couple moments of cravings and ""*oh fuck oh fuck my stomach is making nooooiiseee*"" but nothing substantial that warranted true distraction. I did internship work until 2:30, courageously turned down a French Toast doughnut, bought some weird organic tampons without applicators, received a free Kindle from an older man trying to woo me, went to work (I work at a bar/restaurant, climbed the equivalent of 25 flights of stairs), and then flirted with my Lyft line co-passenger. Felt like a badass most of the day. I planned for some broth in the afternoon to ""make the mental transition easier"", but I realize in retrospect that really just dumb and now I'm mad I have to live with the sad, public consequences of having a ~50 calorie broth break on my first day. No worries, though-- in the long run, one broth fast transition day won't hurt. I am even more motivated to kick ass. See y'all tomorrow.

5b3atp,1,2016-11-04,Would there be any appetite for a live Excel coaching business based on the big investment bank's intake programmes and made applicable to all?,BusinessTechCoaching,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5b3atp/would_there_be_any_appetite_for_a_live_excel/,"I’m wondering if there would be any appetite for something I’m thinking of starting.  I’m a technology coach and ran the European Investment Banking Technology Coaching team at Morgan Stanley for many years.  I worked directly with management and the guys on the ground to design and run their technology coaching programmes including the intake programmes for interns, full time analysts and MBAs as well as senior hires.  Our biggest topic was Excel and we ensured that these guys were business ready with it and risk free before they arrived at their desks and supported them with it on an ongoing basis.


I left the firm a while ago but have been invited back to assist with other intakes and I’m now thinking of providing similar coaching online.  I’ve made it a bit more generic so it’s not just banking specific and I think it’d be really useful for anyone who’s looking to get into the business world or just move within it.


This is unique and directly relevant Excel coaching that I know big employers want their staff to have. It covers relevant Excel functionality but with a focus on the things you absolutely need to know to create professional, usable, scaleable and accurate models for use within a corporate team and that can be presented to clients.  I would incorporate all the shortcuts, hints, tips and best practices that are relevant in the business world.  In short, all the stuff that’s going to give you a real advantage and will save you so much misery with re-creating things if you don’t know it.  This is the stuff that’s going to make your VP think you’re a safe pair of hands and not the person who they have to send back with endless mark ups and who needs constant monitoring.
If you think this would be good knowledge to have, I’d love to hear your thoughts.  I do need to eat so I’d charge for this but it would be really affordable.  I would deliver these modules live, online using Skype/Google Hangouts/Live Meeting etc so you can ask questions and get an immediate answer.  I’m based in the UK so I’m in a great time zone to accommodate anyone wherever they are in the world and we have a currency that makes these modules really affordable at present!
I’ve run some experimental modules in person over here in the UK and they were well received.  I’ve been considering taking it online to a wider audience so I just thought I’d check to see what the appetite is further afield.
I’d welcome genuine comments.

**Edit**
I don't think I made it clear above that this isn't specifically Excel training which, I appreciate, is available elsewhere for free.


**To answer other questions...**


The modules I'd run wouldn’t be specifically for banking students so no, I don’t expect banking knowledge.  I’ve stripped out the banking-specific models and examples so that anyone from any industry background can understand them.  The modules do start at the beginning with Excel because they’re designed for people who might have studied a subject that simply doesn’t use much Excel (history, theology, law, medicine etc) so I go back to the beginning with them and fill in the blanks and start to iron out bad habbits.
With that in mind, I’m bringing people up to a good level of Excel usage but within the context of a corporate job.  This means they’ll fill in gaps in their knowledge but will learn, among others, things like:


How to avoid ruining the usability of a model by inappropriate formatting (and I’m not talking colour schemes).  


Learning what functions are actually used in the real world, which ones aren’t, which ones are flawed and can give you wrong results and which ones are just used as discussion points.  


How to avoid crashing models, how to spot when workbooks are corrupt and what to do about them when it happens.  


How to make models that the rest of your team can use (which allows you to live in peace!).  


How to use Excel quickly, efficiently and accurately (this is continually the biggest request of management).  


How to create output that’s appropriate and compatible with your clients.  


Why circular references can be useful and how to manage them.  


What is the reality with the pros and cons of array formulas and how are they viewed in the real world.  


All the best practices that large firms want and need you to know so that your models are professional, useable, accurate and can grow with the demands made on it.  And a load more..."
5b3cko,2,2016-11-04,Feel like I messed up my life quite a bit.,TA6687246,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5b3cko/feel_like_i_messed_up_my_life_quite_a_bit/,"Some background:

Currently a senior engineering student in university but the sudden increase in workload has caused me to stress out to the point where I can't find the motivation/discipline to keep going. So now I'm failing most of my classes and have a very bleak output of the future. 

The biggest thing I'm worried about is that I will have to take at least another semester at least to graduate and the university I attend only gives 8 semesters of scholarship, so each additional semester will be around $13,000. I don't want to burden myself or my family with huge student debt loans and was the main reason I went to this particular university, but now I feel like a giant hypocrite since I'll likely have to pay up anyway if I want to graduate.

I've also done a few internships and I realize they aren't representative of an actual job, but I didn't seem to fit in well with the work environment. I know work isn't always fun but I'd like to find something I can at least tolerate and feel fulfilled. 

Again, this all leads into the whole bleak output of the future.

So now I'm seriously contemplating suicide as these thoughts are also weighing down my ability to enjoy life.

I've yet to tell my parents about my situation as they have fairly high expectations of me and I don't want to disappoint them. 

So in summary: I've got a poor outlook on my immediate future, and then even if I do graduate I have little hope of finding a job that I'll actually enjoy just to live. Also my parents are hoping I make it big and I don't want to disappoint them.

I'm sure other people have experienced a similar situation to mine and I'd like to hear how you coped with it and found a bigger purpose in your life.

I'm finishing up my MSIII year right now (my school has a wack schedule). Most surprising thing was how different my experience was than the consensus on SDN and reddit. Like, everyone else here talks about MSIII as if it's a bone-breaking year of 16 hour workdays, mindless indentured servitude, joints hurting from all the work, developing depression, etc...

but I've had a blast this year. Starting from the top...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pediatrics:** Outpatient was just seeing kids and telling parents ""make sure to feed them broccoli and let them run around and don't watch TV"". Inpatient was longer but slow. I just had a patient or two and most of the day I could watch videos on my iPad or shoot the shit with the residents and attendings who were all friendly. **Outpatient hours: 8, Inpatient hours: 11**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Neuro:** Inpatient prerounding *started* at 7:30. We were done rounding by lunch, and then by 3:30 were let go. Attendings were the bomb, funny eccentric guys. **Outpatient hours: 5, Inpatient hours: 8**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Internal Medicine:** the outpatient section was a joke. I took two patients in the morning, two in the afternoon. All straightforward cases; I had a note template already set up so it took like 10 minutes to fill it in and submit it for each patient. Inpatient hours were longer but my chief resident usually let me go at 3:00 because he didn't want to waste my time until turnover when the day's work was already done. Got to see lots of procedures, got to interact with nurses and fellow students and cool residents. **Outpatient hours: 8, Inpatient hours: 9**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Family Medicine:** 8-4. Two patients in morning, two afternoon. Tell them to take their diabetes and hypertension meds. Residents were a little less friendly but as long as I stayed out of their way they stayed out of mine. **Outpatient hours: 9**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Psych:** By far the most relaxed rotation I've ever been on. My whole prerounding was finding out the QTc and making sure the patient didn't hang himself over night, and asking if he had any hallucinations of Jesus Christ lately. After rounding we literally had nothing going on. Lots of time to study, play on my Gameboy in the med student room, and go home early. **Outpatient hours: 6, Inpatient hours: 9**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Surgery:** I was dreading this one but it honestly wasn't bad. Day started early (5:30) but notes were very fast; just had to write up the vitals and a quick physical exam and the plan was usually ""continue current care"". My chief was kind of a bitch but the interns were amazing and ensured that I didn't get most of the shit that rolled downhill from time to time. The interns were also the ones letting me go early. **Inpatient hours: 10**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**OBGYN:** Okay, this one was a drag I'll admit. But while I didn't particularly enjoy it, I didn't actively hate my time there. Basically the key was to stay out of the residents' way. They didn't like med students or want to interact with them, and y'know what, that's fine by me. That also helped avoid getting entangled in intra-resident catfights and drama. **Outpatient hours: 8, Inpatient hours: 12**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I had a good time. The hours were longer than preclinical years, but I'd go as far as to say I actually did less work during MSIII than MSI/MSII.

Then I look around on sdn and reddit and everyone except me is crying about how their third year was so awful that they developed post traumatic stress disorder.

Anyone else have a similar experience as me?"

Everyone who I've talked to who works there absolutely loves it, but I have this fear in the back of my mind that if the internship turns out well and I do go to work there after graduation, my job will be off-shored. For example, [Ford is moving small car production to Mexico.](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2016/09/14/ford-car-production-mexico/90354444/) Should I consider job security for me to be an actual concern, or am I simply being naive?

I was offered a position as a community liaison at a middle school. I took the job because I thought it would give me a lot of experience in the field (it has) and I am really interested in establishing myself in. I want to be a school counselor and I have already applied to my local graduate program to get my counseling credential. If I get into the program the internship credential would allow me to work as a counselor in the morning (if I can find job) and take classes to get the credential and masters in the evenings after work.

Currently, my job as a community liaision I am not doing so well. I have an $80,000 budget that I have to implement on programs, events, classes for parents  but the ideas I come up with must be approved by admin (principal and assistant principal). Almost all of the ideas I had for the school year got shutdown by admin. In addition, admin/staff use me as their translator which isn't part of my job, and I have told them various times that this isn't something I do and if they need a translator to contact district office but they don't listen. Basically, since the beginning I felt that I was in a position to fail, with very limited training on how things worked (I learned that myself), very little discussion with my supervisor in the district office about usage of the funding/regulations/policies. Another major factor that I dislike is that I commute every day hr drive to work and usually an hour and a half back home after work. The commute is sucking the soul out of me and I feel very unmotivated. 

I was thinking about quitting because I think that it's very likely for me to get fired and the job is making me miserable. I also want to keep the job because I have a good relationship with the school counselors and I will definitely need their letters of recommendation when applying in the spring to counseling jobs... I do have loans (car and school) that I have to pay back as well and I feel stuck. I'm currently living in my parents home to help me with the rent and cost of living so most of my paycheck can go to my loans.

If someone can help me that would be great. "

###**Alternate title: Jail for friends, but not Clintons**

* Accusations of impropriety against the Clintons and others concerning **improper campaign contributions, political and financial favors, and tax benefits**. 

* Its initial subject was a failed Arkansas real-estate venture involving the Clintons in the 1980s that was linked to the collapse of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, a Little Rock savings bank run by the Clintons’ Whitewater business partners. 

* Clinton friends James and Susan McDougal went to jail for fraud (James died while serving his sentence), as did former Arkansas Gov. Jim Tucker and municipal judges David Hale and Eugene Fitzhugh.

* The probe eventually expanded to include the **death of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster**, the dismissal of White House travel office employees, receipt by the White House of a number of FBI files and the issue of whether President Clinton lied or obstructed justice to hide an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

###Hi James. Welcome Back 

###SOUND FAMILIAR, BELOW?

* James Comey is deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee. According to Time Magazine in March 2016: 
&gt;“In 1996, after months of work, Comey came to some damning conclusions: *Hillary Clinton was personally involved in mishandling documents *and had ordered others to *block investigators* as they pursued their case. Worse, her behavior fit into a **pattern of concealment**: she and her husband had tried to hide their roles in two other matters under investigation by law enforcement. Taken together, the interference by White House officials, which included **destruction of documents**, amounted to ‘far more than just aggressive lawyering or political naiveté,’ 


* Comey and his fellow investigators concluded it, ""constituted a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct.’” However, *Comey is not in charge of the case*, and **his superiors decide not to press charges against Bill or Hillary Clinton in the matter**. In 2013, Comey will be appointed director of the FBI, which will make him the de facto head of the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s emails that starts in 2015. (Time, 3/31/2016)

###Confused? Let's Try This:


* In 1979, the Clintons have trouble making the interest payments on property called Whitewater. 
* They get a second loan to acquire money for the first loan.
* They then get a third loan to acquire money for the second loan. 
* All of the loans are represented as separate business enterprises, which means that they should not be sharing assets. 
* Years later, other people end up going to jail for their financial crimes. The Clintons’ business partner, Jim McDougal, died in jail for this because they were worried he'd talk. 
* McDougal dies in his cell due to lethal issue related to improper dosage of a prescription drug that would be surely lethal based on his medical condition.  
* There is no further investigation on his death...how...politically convenient?



###Had Enough Deaths? TOO BAD!!

* May 1993: John Wilson, former DC city councilman with inside knowledge of Whitewater, is found hanged in his room. Verdict: “**suicide**”.

* August 1993: Jon Walker, a senior investigator for the Resolution Trust Corporation, looking for source of a suspicious $50 million transfer related to $40 million embezzlement scheme involving Whitewater and the Clintons, falls to his death from a high apartment building. Verdict: “**suicide**”.

* Don Adams (lawyer)
Died January 7, 1997
Whitewater scandal. **Found dead in car**. Gunshot to the head. Note: Replacement attorney for the case disappeared.

I've been incredibly fortunate to receive internship offers at Google, Microsoft, Palantir and Citadel. I know that chance plays a big role in the recruiting process, and I fully understand how incredibly lucky I got this year. 

The point of this post is that I have no idea how to decide between these offers. Which of these places do you think would provide the best opportunity for long term career development? I know Google and Microsoft would look incredible on a resume, but I worry that the jobs might be too cushy, and I would get complacent. I worry that Palantir doesn't have the experienced managers and mentors that older, bigger companies do. And I worry that Citadel would be too cut-throat, and I would burn out.

About a week ago, I had slept a really long night, and was kind of drifting in and out. Nobody else was home, and I had kind of stressful day before and the past week had actually been pretty bad for me. I've been a RT fan since about 2007 when I binged RvB into the late morning with my friends. And, now I watch the podcast regularly, as well as most of their shows. Anyway, in this dream I first saw myself looking at very life-like mannequins side by side, looking downwards. And all were in a small, relatively dim room. At first I was alone, but as I processed the imagery I started to realize that each mannequin was a well-known RT employee. Jack, Bernie, Gus, Geoff.., but there was more. I started to think. I ""remembered"" that, quite recently, they all died, in some sort of plane related incident, maybe a crash, or maybe something worse. And even stranger, I saw some people I knew personally, close friends were also in this lineup of mannequins. Strange. Other people started to enter the room, my mother, some other, younger people I knew, and more, of course, alive. While talking and processing everything around me, I started to, again, ""remember"" that some of my friends, had recently become employees of RT, but of course as interns, and not positions so highly in the company as Geoff or Bernie. I... saw some of them alive, in the room with me as we talked, and some, as mannequins. I was baffled, and had this horrid feeling that continuously bothered me, but, for me, was indistinguishable. I was drifting in and out of the dream, each time, with new information being revealed, but in the same continuous scenario, with no continuity problems or errors... All connected. Another strange thing, was that, even though I was coming out and returning to the dream, drifting in and out of sleep, I never lost understanding, or awareness of the dream. And the awareness I had was particularly intense. I have had many specific, vivid, memorable dreams in the past, that I remember for years, without even writing them down. But, this dream... it may have been the most surreal. I was right next to lucid dreaming, if not lucid completely. I felt I had complete control of my actions. But,... I just stayed in that small room. After a while, all my friends had left, and I was alone in the room again,.. with the mannequins. This memorial of people I knew personally, as well as knew for years through RT content, I stared at. It was beating at my heart and mind, and I couldn't avert my gaze from the hanging, downwards facing heads, all in neutral expression, in this, oh-so-silent room. I looked up at them. I wept. I wept waters of sorrow, and mourning, for all of my friends, personal and not. My heart was beating out of my chest, in agony, and my soul was deepened in sorrow. I was soon covered in the water of my tears, the mark of my sorrow... It felt like it must have been hours that I wept, hours, that I mourned my friends in agony and sorrow, and hours that I felt this softly clenching feeling in my heart, that I still, simply could not place.. I woke up. I looked around the couch I was sleeping on, and everything around me. My heart was pounding, and I was in shock. It must have took me at least a full minute, before I truly realized that was all a dream, that my friends were not dead, and that there was no memorial to their horrible deaths. I felt something I have truly, very rarely felt, the relief and unmistakeable joy, of a friend rising from the dead, of discovering that someone you loved, is, in fact, not dead, but very much alive, but for more than one friend, for so many. It was that strangest, staggering feeling to watch the RT podcast again after that, or any RT content for that matter, because the memory of that dream was almost, and so close to a true memory, of sorrow and mourning over people I loved, of that mysterious horrid feeling. And I didn't forget a lick of it.

Not the best college record or degree I could have earned, but I am in way better shape now, and I feel confident I can excel in almost any bioinformatics/laboratory internship, not to mention earn far better grades in any STEM course. 

For one, will a good CC/Extension transcript post-undergrad assist me? I plan on taking more courses in CS and Molecular Biology. I have already studied some CS in college. 

Are there any skills I should specifically learn, or that will shine on my resume? I know this depends on the company, somewhat.

I am really attracted to both Fluidigm and Illumina, to name a few, working in a computational genomics internship, but I am flexible.

Thanks for any advice!"

I got on the train and took it to a station near my dad's house (not married to my nmom) and have not contacted my nmom or her husband since. I just wanted to make a list of all of the good things that have happened since then to encourage people to go LC.

-Have been able to freely use the internet and my phone and mac (my nmom blocked social media, video sites, and skype when I was 16 and forced me to give her my phone and mac every right).

-Got a summer job (at a company the refurbished macs) 

-Got to spend time with my uncle and other relatives on my dads side (my nmom hated everyone related to my dad)

-Got to celebrate my 19th birthday without any Ns. Just my chosen family and friends.

-Started college at at a four-year university and I am perusing a degree that I am passionate about.

-Got an internship working at a really awesome campaign.

-Got a job at a marketing agency (I want to go into marketing/PR/communications.

-Filed for a legal name change to remove my nmoms last name from my birth certificate and legal documents (hearing is at the end of December) 

Going NC is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I would strongly recommend going NC if you can. You are so much better than Ns make it seem like you are. "

5b5aq5,2,2016-11-04,I [22F] need to tell new bf [23M] that me and my ex [24M] had broken up one month later than bf thought we did - need advice.,honeywings,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5b5aq5/i_22f_need_to_tell_new_bf_23m_that_me_and_my_ex/,"Hello,

So I was with my ex Daniel for around a year (official spring of 2015). Our relationship seemed pretty amazing until I found out this past Spring (2016) that he had cheated on me within the first two months of our relationship. I should have dumped him then, but I was at a terrible low in my life (got screwed over at my job and lost a lot of friends when I quit) and was codependent and tried to work it out instead of saving myself the grief and heartache that would soon follow. I was scared to be alone.

I had began talking to our mutual friend Payton about it when I got a bit too intoxicated one night and ended up telling him everything shortly after I found out. Payton and Daniel were close friends in college (they were both seniors when I met them and graduated in 2015) but have drifted apart a little since Payton stopped drinking and that they live on opposite ends of the state (10 hrs apart - about 3/4 hrs from me in opposite directions). 

Payton was an amazing friend to me during that time and encouraged me to do what was best. I was always fond of him and my feelings started to grow though I didn't realize it. Me and Daniel were on and off, taking breaks. I was sent out of state for an internship where I realized I was too young to go through this and deserved better. Me and Payton had been talking almost every day - he kept me company while I was away. I never flirted with him for two reasons: 1. I will not be like my ex and will end it before emotionally or physically getting involved with someone else. 2. There were signs that Payton wasn't interested in me anyways.

Then one day Payton sent a somewhat flirty text and I realized maybe he was interested in me. That same night I officially ended it (no more breaks no more on and off) with Daniel since I did not want to do what he did to me. A few days later Payton admits feelings for me but we take it slow.

It's been 3-4 months since then. Me and Payton and basically dating (not official - I wanted to make sure I was over Daniel completely before getting serious with Payton, because I want to be fair to him). However when we do become official (within the next two months), Payton wants to tell Daniel out of respect. I personally could care less about Daniel - he was a huge manipulative lying asshole. But they're still friends.

My issue is that I recently realized that Payton thought me and Daniel had been broken up completely by the end of June when in reality we broke up at the end of July when Payton sent that one text (it was a winky face - nothing crazy). I want to clarify this but I'm really scared of how he might react. I didn't tell Payton we were on and off because honestly I was embarrassed because I knew it was stupid to get back together with the guy who cheats on you and I was ashamed. I wasn't trying to trick him or anything - I didn't really tell anyone. 

But I feel shitty because he must have thought we were broken up and thought it was ok to flirt/get with me when in reality I was still somewhat involved with someone else and I have a feeling he wouldn't have gone after me if he knew. I wanted to end it with Daniel but I was scared until I realized I could be happier without him. I know when he tells Daniel, he'll probably find out and I don't want to keep it a secret.

What should I do? Am I a shitty person? Am I overreacting or is this a big deal like I think it is?

**tl;dr: Dumped cheating ex I had been too scared to leave (off/on) the same day a friend expressed interest in me. Me and friend are dating now and friend wants to tell ex out of respect (they were good friends before) soon, but I realized friend thought we had been broken up ~1 mo before we actually were (off/on) and I want to tell him for honesty/clarity but I'm scared he'll think I'm as bad as cheating ex or that I lied to him for malicious purposes**"
5b5bjy,2,2016-11-04,"My [21, F] boyfriend [22, M] isn't satisfying me and I don't know if I should leave. HELP!!!",ewgii,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5b5bjy/my_21_f_boyfriend_22_m_isnt_satisfying_me_and_i/,"I'm going to try to be as detailed as possible so I can the most helpful comments! I appreciate everyone in advance. Anyway, so my boyfriend, whom I will call Tom, hasn't been putting his half into this relationship. We've been dating almost a year. It started off good. He is a little less experienced as I am and I am his first long term girlfriend. We started things very slow.. we never really had that honeymoon phase in the beginning but that doesn't matter. Anyway, around 6 months things started to get better. We were inseparable. We would hangout everyday and spent the entire summer together. Went on a week long vacation and just really enjoyed time together. Tom and I are very different though. Tom is very average. Nothing against that, but I'm just going to be up front and honest. He is cute, but not extremely attractive. His humor is semi nerdy and he can be an asshole to some people. He doesn't dress super nicely and he is very book smart, but not street smart at all. He doesn't remember shit (which I can say a lot of men have in common) and he seems to never make our relationship a priority. He is an only child, can be very self centered at times, and doesn't have a good job or make any money to take me out once in a while or get me a gift for my birthday, that type of stuff. I go to college in a big city and he goes to college about an hour away. We both live about 30 minutes from each other and I can only see him on the weekends since school started because of our hectic school/work schedule. I don't trust Tom. He's a great guy to me in different ways, but sometimes I feel like he doesn't think he's doing things wrong when he is. I have caught him flirting with girls before, had an active Tinder account while we were dating (at month 5) commenting on Facebook pictures of other women, and he used to text his exes all the time. That's all done. Anyway, Tom annoys me. I get bored easily and he doesn't contribute to this relationship as much as I do. I have a full time job with good pay, and am a full time student as well. I am pretty attractive and have dated multiple people in long term relationships. I know my worth and am very smart. All of his friends can't understand why I would be with him, and all of my friends think I can do better. I never looked at it that way, and I alway fought for him making him look like a great guy. Only recently have I thought I'm too good for him. I do everything for him. He's super sweet and appreciative. He wants to have a family and when he graduates college, he says he wants to buy us a house and start our future together. I buy everything now, dinners, drinks, fun activities... I give him great gifts for any occasion. I'm super sweet and supportive of anything he does, I waste my free nights to hangout with him and his friends when he can't do the same. I make our relationship a priority. Our sex life is nothing special. He has never put me first or tried to give me an orgasm (which has never happened) He never touches me or god for bid eat me out. He lasts for a minute and that's fine but he's selfish and doesn't try to get me off ever. I can go and list a thousand things I do that he doesn't but I'm not going to waste your time. Lately, I have been getting really irritated with him. Usually I would laugh and mess around and love his humor but lately I've been a stone. I don't find him as attractive anymore, he isn't funny, he's a dick sometimes, and cares more about his friends than me. He might be getting an internship about 5 hours away from where we live. I want to be supportive but if he takes that, I don't think we would be able to make this any better. I'm considering breaking up with him. I do love him and never want to be with anyone else. He's a great soul and he makes me a better person. He has good qualities but the bad ones outweigh the good. I'm lost and don't know what to do. Please help! Sorry for the long post.

5b5e70,1,2016-11-04,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5b5e70/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5b5el4,1,2016-11-04,"Me [28F] with my boyfriend [30M] of 18 months, I don't know if I can deal with his messy divorce.",throw4634647,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5b5el4/me_28f_with_my_boyfriend_30m_of_18_months_i_dont/,"To start off, we were together for the past 18 months, but he is just now filing for divorce. This has been a recurring issue since we first got together. They had been separated for 2 years before we even started talking and there was no chance of them ever getting back together. He decided to not divorce sooner because he was trying to save money on the divorce costs as well as medical insurance. They were both in the military, and both are covered under her insurance which is basically free, no out of pocket costs.

Anyway, onto the issue. There are 2 kids involved. They have been living with my boyfriend since she took off and left them all. A month ago, she decided to take them (Without any notification) to her home state, which lead to my boyfriend needing to get an emergency custody order, which is was finally started the custody and divorce. They had not been on good terms for the past 6 months, but before that they were friendly to each other and tried to work together when it came to the kids.

Now that this has been started, she is now wanting full custody, asking for child support, alimony, as well as him to cover her lawyer/court fees, which I think is complete bullshit. They have been separated for 3 years. Within a month of them separating, she got with another man and followed him around the country for almost 2 years before coming back. While she was back, she always made up lame excuses why she couldn't see the kids.

She has been supporting herself fine for those 3 years (and her VA disability recently doubled a few months ago, so she has even more now.) (However, whenever she wanted to see this kids, my boyfriend has had to give her money to come see them because she is poor at money management). She has no other job (because she is lazy and never stayed in one place long enough, not because she is actually disabled). My boyfriend receives a little less than she does from the VA, but also makes 66,000 a year on top of that. However, even with making that much, he is still struggling, and will be even more once he has to pay for his own insurance and payments for all his yearly appointments (costly medical condition).

I don't know if I can deal with this, or how, if she can get alimony, him to pay her court fees, and possibly the kids with child support. I suggested to him many times to just get divorced last year while they were still on friendly terms and could have very likely got divorced without any of this. At the time, she didn't want the kids, and probably wouldn't have asked for alimony either, and if they could have gotten a no-fault divorce, less lawyer/court fees as well. It will be a constant reminder of how naive he was, only looking at the short-term and not long term future money-wise, and will be a constant reminder of ""we don't have enough money to do this because you are giving a leech money every month just because she is lazy.""

I am not against child support/alimony in general, just this specific situation. If they had been together and her taking care of the kids and that was why she wasn't working, and then tried to divorce right away, I would get her receiving alimony for a set-time while she gets back on her own feet. But she has had 3 years already to get on her feet, but just doesn't want to. (actually, the amount she gets from the VA and her choice of where to live, she has enough to live comfortably if she were able to manage her money. Think renting a 3 bedroom house costs around 400 a month, and what she receives from the VA would be comparable to earning almost $40,000 pre tax.) She is capable of working as well, she was even taking college courses during the 2015-16 year, and had a good internship a few years ago when they first separated.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is in a messy divorce. If she gets any of the money that she is asking for (alimony, childs + child support, and help with attorney fees), it will greatly impact my boyfriends quality of living for the next 12 years at least. I don't know how to deal with this, when he had a chance to divorce sooner without her asking for any of that while they were still on friendly terms."

We first met in high school senior year and things went really well, I was 17 at the time. She was my first serious relationship and I was hers. After about a year we got into a huge fight because my friends were getting in the way of our relationship and were not to particularly happy with me spending so much time with her. We struggled over the next few months and eventually I thought taking a break would be good for both of us, especially with our first year of University starting soon. We never stopped talking and kept our relationship a secret from our friends and family for the next 6 months. We didn't want our friends to get in the way this time. 

Things got better but I could tell she was still angry at me for ending the relationship. She said she couldn’t go through something like that again and made me promise never to leave her again. I promised and we got back together. Things went great and eventually we told our friends and she told her family. I made a stupid mistake by not telling my family the second time because I thought my parents didn't like her because of comments they said post breakup like “Don’t be sad, you can do better!”. I’m sure these were just comments to make me feel better, but at the time I didn’t think so. I told her that I wasn't ready to tell my family yet, I wanted to make sure I was absolutely certain she was the one for me. She was very supportive and the next few months were amazing. We started to get really busy with assignments and work. We both worked part-time at the same retail store, but our managers wouldn’t schedule us together, which made it very difficult to spend time together. I would work during the day and she would work at night. We started to drift further and further apart and missed spending time together. Eventually she got fed up with the fact that she couldn't come over my house and she was beginning to think I was embarrassed of her (which wasn't true). 

Our relationship wasn't perfect and we fought every now and then, but we started getting in fights all the time about how I kept her a secret. I started smoking a lot of weed with my friends and it took over my life. She accepted my smoking habits even though she was against it. My friends and I would smoke in some pretty sketchy places since its illegal here and I didn’t want to put her into an uncomfortable situation so I never invited her to tag along. Basically, I chose weed over her, I would hang out with my friends over her. We only got the opportunity to hang out 2-3 times a month and for the most part we communicated through text and phone calls.

Then summer came, she decided to take summer school and took a pretty heavy course load and I started a full-time internship. She was always busy in the evenings to go out and I still hadn’t told my family about her. I started developing an App in my spare time and started going to the gym and as a result I got really busy. We got into so many fights because of our conflicting schedules. We made an agreement to make more time for each other, we were both going to stop working Saturdays. But at this point I was so fed up with my relationship and I started to act like a shitty boyfriend. Regardless, she fought for our relationship time after time and refused to give up on me. She kept begging me to tell my family but again I refused because things weren't getting better. My friends started to push me to break up with her because they could see I wasn’t happy. She was the only girl I’ve ever been with and I thought there was someone better for me out there because of all the fighting. 

So one day I randomly decided to end things with her. I felt good about it at first, I was happy that all the stress was gone and I could finally do what I wanted. I knew I still loved her and I would probably go back to her, but I wanted to be alone for a while. This is a common problem for me, I tend to run away from my problems to gather my thoughts alone. I was really lonely and so after 1 week I texted her to see how she was doing, she told me she still loved me and said that she was completely blindsided by my decision to end the relationship. She was pissed that I dropped her from my life just because life got busy and our relationship got difficult. She was upset that I didn’t drop other aspects of my busy life to make more time for her. She was also pissed that I never told my family. She had been begging me for almost a year to do so. A week later I texted her but she said she couldn’t be my friend and then I proceeded to telling her that I wanted her back. 

We agreed to meet me that night and talk, we met up and we talked it out. The next day I texted her and she told me “I’m not saying no forever, but for right now I think we need time apart. We need to recover from this as separate people and need to think about what we really want. I don’t believe 3 weeks is enough time for you to change”. I said something really stupid at this point, I told her that if I couldn’t have her I would start looking for someone else because I was lonely. I didn’t mean it and I just wanted her back but I didn’t want to wait. She asked me for space but I clearly didn’t understand the meaning of that and I continued to try and talk to her. I begged for her back. This went on for about a week. Eventually she started ignoring me completely. Thinking back, I was coming off as desperate, which is extremely unattractive, but I wanted to show her how badly I wanted this. 2 weeks later we both happened to be going to the same nightclub for a mutual friend’s birthday, I tried to talk to her and she refused and I basically created a scene because I saw another guy talking to her. I apologized the next day but she ignored my message. I decided to follow the NC rule and went ghost for a month. 

I took the time to truly think about what I wanted, I was finally single and I was free to do whatever I wanted. I had many opportunities to hook up with other girls but I turned them all down because I was still in love with my ex-girlfriend. I’m an incredibly loyal man and I didn’t want anyone else. I came to realize how much I truly loved her and that I had just lost the love of my life. I knew I wanted her back and I was determined to do whatever it took to get her back. I realized that if I ever wanted another shot I would have to make some changes to my life. I stopped smoking weed, took time off from work, stopped working on my App project and admitted to my family that I had hid her from them. I’m now very open with my feelings as before I would hide them. I learned how to stand up for myself in front of my friends and finally didn’t have the thought that there was someone better for me out there. In addition, I reflected on many of the mistakes I made during the relationship to ensure they wouldn’t happen again.

After NC was up, I sent flowers and an album of pictures we had taken together over the years. I waited 2 weeks hoping for a reply but I didn’t get one. I decided to text her and explain all the changes I made to my life and that we could be really happy together if she would give me another chance. She replied “Thank you for the flowers, but you shouldn’t have sent them. It’s good to see that you’ve grown and matured. Nevertheless, I believe its best we stay apart. Best of luck with everything”. I asked her if she still loved me and asked if we would ever have a chance in the future but she ignored me. A couple of days went by and then I sent a rude message along the lines of “You’re making a huge mistake and you’ll regret it. I’m an amazing guy but if you can’t see that it’s your loss. Chances are the next guy will end up cheating on you like what happened to all of your friends” (She was always afraid of getting cheated on because it happened to her best friends). She didn’t answer and later that day she blocked me on all social media. The next day I sent the following message, “I’m sorry what I said, I only said those things because I was upset I was losing the love of my life. I’ve learned a lot from our relationship and you’ve had such a positive influence on my life. You’re an amazing woman and anybody would be lucky to call her their girlfriend, including myself. Maybe I will have that pleasure again one day. Please take care of yourself”. No reply. (BTW she didn’t block my number because we use iMessage and the messages were delivered)

1 month later (now the present) I heard from a mutual friend that the night that we were at the nightclub together, she got really pissed off because I was “cock-blocking” her and a guy. My friend also told me that she was talking to some guy from our work because I used to have a crush on a girl that worked there (maybe for revenge? Idk). Furthermore, my friend told me that my ex-girlfriend was just talking to these guys friendly and wasn’t looking for a relationship. I don’t know what to think about this, we’re not dating but I didn’t think she could move on this quickly (This came just 2-3 weeks after she told me she still had feelings for me). Moreover, my friend told me that she said “I hope he’s doing well”. When my friend told her that I still missed her she said “Yeah, I highly doubt that”. I know it’s not much but does this mean I have a chance?

I love this girl so much, she’s everything to me. She’s smart, thoughtful, compassionate, and beautiful. We both shared the same life goals and she’s the girl I wanted to marry and start a family with. She does however require a lot of affection and I try my best to give her that but I’m not the best at it. She’s super religious and she told me that she wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, I was okay waiting but eventually we lost our virginity to each other after 1 year. After we did it, she cried and told me that I better not leave her. Well… I left her, not once but twice. I feel awful, and I understand why she doesn’t want me back. I made a promise and I broke it. How is she supposed to trust that I won’t do it again? She’s obviously looking for stability and clearly I couldn’t provide that.

After going through months of depression and many sleepless nights, I’m starting to recover. I’ve been able to sleep again for the last month. I still think about her and I really want another chance to prove to her that I’ve changed. I’m honestly a good guy. I’m smart, honest, loyal, hardworking and compassionate. I admit, I’m not perfect and made some pretty stupid mistakes. This breakup was definitely a lot harder on me than the first time we broke up and has allowed me to do a lot of reflecting. I think it’s because we never stopped talking when we broke up the first time and so I never really changed/learned. I took her for granted and I didn’t always treat her right. I didn’t communicate very well and I let my feelings build up and come out all at once. In addition, I’ve always run away from my problems and would deal with them later, it’s a horrible quality which I’m desperately trying to improve on. I’m also very shy and lack the confidence to talk to new people (particularly women). I’m not lonely but I definitely miss having someone to confide in. 

My current plan is to continue to improve myself and work on my confidence. I’m going to let things cool off and re-evaluate my feelings for her in the New Year. I’m definitely not looking for another relationship until I’ve fully recovered from this one. I also know that neither of us will be able to consider a relationship with each other again if any of us has been with someone else. We talked about this during our relationship and as a result, I’m scared to move on and try new relationships. If you decide to reply, please mention in the comments that you've read the entire post. I can't depend on advice from people who don't know the whole story.

-	Do you guys think there is any chance of giving this relationship another go? If so what do you think should be my course of action? 

-	In the past, I thought there was someone better for me out there. I think it’s because we had a rough 6 months. She was the only girl I’ve ever been and so I have nothing to compare my relationship to. I’m scared that if I do manage to get back together with her one day that the feelings will come back. The problem is that if I move on and try new relationships to ease my mind, I will never get another opportunity to be with this amazing woman. What do you guys think?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Dated for over a year and then we took a break, when we got back together she made me promise to never leave her again. I promised. Fast forward until now, I broke up with her again because life got too busy between her school and my internship and now she won’t take me back. I started smoking alot of weed and it took over my life(now i quit). She asked for space but I didn’t give it to her and I begged for her back. Now she’s completely ignoring me. I've made some big changes in my life to better myself and I think we can really make this work. I love her. Yesterday (1 month from when I last messaged her), her friend told me that she ""hopes I'm doing well"" and ""seriously doubts that I miss her"". What does this mean? Is there any chance of fixing this? If so, how?"
5b6hia,1,2016-11-04,Javascript vs Java for personal projects?,motime16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5b6hia/javascript_vs_java_for_personal_projects/,"I am a second year CS student, I have decent grades but I have no personal side projects and I have not yet applied for any internships. Over the upcoming winter break I will have about a month of free time to work on anything I like.  Ideally I would like to contribute to open source.  I am confused about what type of applications I should build.  Would small mobile apps using native languages such as Java look better on my resume as opposed to small web development projects using JS and a framework like react?

I know the quality of code is important, most of my school projects have been completed in Java and C and I have recently picked up some JS which seems fun.  

Also apart from open source, a friend of mine who has been in the industry for a while is working on developing an react based mobile app and asked me to join him.  This project is not open source though and it is something they are trying to do on the side to make money.  I wonder if teaming up with them would be an ever better idea as opposed to open source which seems more appealing to me?

Keep in mind that I want to use the month not just to learn but get a small project or some small programs up and running that would be appealing to CS recruiters.

Or would you guys recommend that I spend quite a bit of this time getting better at DS and algorithms? 

Thank you.

5b77we,2,2016-11-04,How to improve my chances of getting into a more selective university as well as improve my future career?,zzelle_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5b77we/how_to_improve_my_chances_of_getting_into_a_more/,"I posted a something similar in another subreddit, but want to be a little more specific here. 

Anyway about me: I'm 20, and went to a very small high school. I didn't care a whole lot about doing extremely well, so my GPA could have been better. If I remember correctly it ended up being 3.76. I had no extracurriculars, and only two honors classes. But I also attended a technical school while in high school, and received a certificate for that program. This was for Multimedia and Web Design. Other than that I don't have much going for me to get into a more selective school. I'm not looking to get into an Ivy, just a more selective school. 

Here is what I'm thinking of doing so far:

- Take the ACT (didn't take in high school)

- Retake the SAT

- Start some volunteer work

- Attend a community college

- Get good grades at community college

- Apply for transfer to selected universities



I'm also planning on doing a lot of self study using online resources. I don't know a lot about programming, so I want to learn as much as I can. 

There are a few reasons I want to get into a more selective school. I feel like after graduating I will have a slightly better chance getting a job. I feel like I will possibly meet more likeminded people who are interested in their work. A better school might provide better connections or reputation as well. 

So, here are my questions. 

What will help me get into a better school? 

Should I pursue a general track at a community college or focus more on mathematics courses? I know this may just be personal preference, but thought I would ask anyway. 

What are the most important things to look into about a school's Computer Science program? Or a school in general. 

Also, something I'm wondering. Say I don't get into the school of my choice, could I still attend their career fairs to get internships or jobs? Would this be frowned upon? 

Any general advice about attending college or a career in CS will probably be helpful as well. If you were in a similar situation I'd love to hear your story. 

Thanks! (:

Im 23, never had a real job, about to drop out of highschool the second time, and have a BMI sitting around 15.      

My dad died when i was turning 18 which ruined me at the time, causing me to drop out of highschool the first time. No worries, he was sorta abusive, the kind of dick that kept sticks behind the kitchen door to beat you with. Kicked me out of the house several times and even came at me with a knife.
  
Since then, I've basically just wasted 5 years. And it's fucking killing me.  
What I've done in these 5 years:  
Rotting in my room, no friends.   

Tried becoming a chef, top of the class and i do make amazing food. But i didnt show up to class enough because i thought it was a joke most of the time. Like, imagine a classroom full of kids who can't cook for shit that are tasked with making even shittier dishes, that was the daily routine. Thinking back, i was the only one take culinairy school serious enough to take my own sharp knives with me.      
  
Worked EXTREMELY SHORTLY as an intern at a huge packaging firm, then i got appendicitis and was fucked for half a year.  

More rotting in my room, browsing reddit. No friends.   

Tried to get welfare, they sent me to something like a ""work camp"" where kids with no idea what they wanna do spend their times. Absolutely shit pay. Literally everyone in class did nothing besides me (and couple of others **sometimes**) and i felt so bad for the teacher. 
  
After that (right now) I'm having another go at highschool. But this school is apple-jerkoff-certified or some bullshit.    
So it started out normal, i came early everyday. Ace everything because i basically know all of the material. People in class are like ""wtf are you even doing here?"". But now i can't take it seriously anymore. We basically only do group assignments. My groups so far have consisted of slackers that browse facebook all day/bronies that draw ponies all day/people who skip a period to smoke a joint etc.   
Our main teacher showed us ""solar freaking roadways"", how cool of a concept it is, followed by me and another student having to point out how idiotic it is. Honestly, our teacher is that gullible guy that shares everything on facebook that looks cool in principle but is a total waste of time in reality.    
We work with iPads. You people have no idea how lame teaching with these can be. So many fucking useless apps. Apps designed for children. We're generally forced to use inferior software and hardware.  
I can't take it seriously. Every fucking day i spend there is irrelevant. I didn't go to school a single day last week. Heavily considering to drop out and do something productive.     
  
I'm fucked. What the fuck should i do? Relying on my mom is the last thing i wanna do. I can't do that to her. She has done too much for me already.   
Never written a job application...   
  
This post is a mess, it's 3am...  
   
My pros;   
*fluent danish  
*fluent german  
*fluent english  
*broken farsi  
*very quick learner  
*can build computers and work pretty well with them    
*can cook pretty fuggen good food  
*generally elitist at everything i do   
*hella efficient, and always looking for ways to make something more efficient   
*have drivers license and car (thanks mom)  
  
cons;  
*BMI of 15, physically not too strong    
*hella antisocial in my spare time  
*look like a SJW stereotype although im the opposite  
  
   
Suicidal thoughts are creeping up on me, but there's no way I'd be giving up on life just yet.  
**ANY** advice/guiding/hints appreciated   
What are my options? somehow selfemployment? webshop? opening a unique streetfood vendor?    
Literally any advice hints or guides...    
Thank you for reading through mess. Sorry if it's difficult to go through, but I'm extremely restless at the moment.

5b7ro0,22,2016-11-04,[MS] Soma &amp; Dash on Chapter 508,DashingIchiya,fairytail,https://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/5b7ro0/ms_soma_dash_on_chapter_508/,"Hey guys, this post has been written by ~~Troy and Abed~~ Soma and Dash! In reading this chapter, we found many things to be thought-provoking to say the least. Consequently, you are on the receiving end of a collaborative post about issues raised by the latest chapter.

#Off-Panel Action &amp; August vs Crime Sorcière:

Dash first. ~~Because ladies first.~~ So the chapter opens with the end of Rogue and Minerva's fight with the Historia, and later on we see what seems to be the latter stages if not the aftermath of the Crime Sorcière vs August fight. This reminded me very strongly of the Gods of Ishgar fighting God Serena for the wrong reasons. I would prefer to at least see how the individual fights reached their end - if the Historia just faded without being touched, what kind of big ass spell August used to flatten Jellal - instead, we get nothing and are left to assume that the following dialogue will sum it up for us. I mean at best, I can see Jellal standing back up, so I guess the Seis are getting the short end here.

I was so hyped for Crime Sorcière vs August, you have no idea. And I'm not even the Jellal fanboy in this collab. I waited months to see Jellal again after he flattened Neinhart - and I was really hoping that the uniqueness and combined ability of Crime Sorcière would force August to adjust to them as a testament to their group's strength, even if they would ultimately fall to him. Instead, we get a mid-battle reveal in the previous chapter of August having an answer to everything they try, and then this chapter they're all down and out seemingly. That ain't cool - this could have been a huge fight because the Seis joining Crime Sorcière felt huge at the time. I wouldn't want this all to just be to hype August up before Gildarts joins the fray, yet that seems increasingly likely.

Yes I know that it is possible that Crime Sorciere would stand up again, but I hoped that would happen with the enchanted Neinhart after Natsu kicked his arse - so I won't hold on to hope. The only point that might suggest they aren't finished yet is that Meredy hasn't appeared yet - and she could play a major role. Please recall that the link she can create between individuals amplifies power in correlation with the strength of their bond. Now note that Jellal is fighting August and Erza is fighting Irene. Uh huh, that could be pretty neat, even if it doesn't end in a win - it could help do some damage. I think Meredy's anonymity has potential to improve the current situation. However, if Meredy is being kept off panel because that is where Lyon is, bloody hell my non-shippy rage would finally be justified. What's interesting is that with Meredy, the power of friendship can literally translate into power, seeds have already been planted.

Anyways, because I have taken the August point, I should probably address what could happen if this really is Crime Sorcière finished off. I mean I should stop hoping optimistically for better treatment for Jellal and co. So Crime Sorcière defeated easymode by August would be ridiculous hype for August. Jellal is one of the strongest wizards in the country, and he can't even scratch August with a bunch of allies supporting him - I don't know how you can hype someone up much further than that. However, this level of hype makes me worry that having an antagonist that strong would in fact be counterintuitive. Like really, how is he to feasibly defeated in a non bs way now? Same goes with Irene - if Crime Sorcière can't scratch August, Wendy and Erza can't even dream of holding a candle to August's equal. So how does Hiro get out of this without relying on Gildarts to bs both fights? Don't say Laxus. If Jellal can't scratch August, Laxus won't do much better.

Ehh I didn't really discuss the options after all. I just want Jellal to stand his ass back up.

#Larcade &amp; Kagura:

***DASH:*** - My golly this was an antagonist with a tonne of hype in my opinion. I mean for goodness sake, he's a **Dragneel!** The main male protagonist is a Dragneel and the main antagonist is a Dragneel. So with Larcade Dragneel being introduced as number three, I was pretty hyped. He has a pretty rad design too - all we needed was a magic to go with it and we had a character worthy of the name Dragneel. A lot of people on Discord expected me to dislike this chapter, and they were right, but not for the reason most expected. I feel very let down that Larcade Dragneel's magic that could have been so scary turned out to be magical sex noodles.

To discuss the magic as far as I know it... he causes people who have been tainted in some way to feel an unavoidable pleasure that will render them largely useless. Unless you're Gildarts, in which case you will receive your best Manga panel ever. Later on, some tentacle-y appendages protruded from the ground and caused much fanservice. Now don't get me wrong, I did not enjoy the fanservice, especially the Yukino stuff - but the disappointing magic is something I disliked even more. I need not rant on this though, this is something that some hate and some find hilarious. However, what may be worth mentioning is that Zeref kills his love interest, Natsu is completely oblivious about Lucy, yet Larcade can hand out orgasms just like that? Talk about a mojo imbalance in the Dragneel family.

Anyway, oddly enough I am still hyped. I've been waiting months for Kagura to get in on a fight properly and it is finally happening. I thought she was going to fight Dimaria or Neinhart after they came back, so I was losing hope. If you told me ten chapters ago that we'd be getting Kagura vs Larcade, I would have not believed you. So in spite of the issues I discussed above, I still look forward to seeing what's next. As long as I don't ever have to read 508 again. I actually made a [post on Kagura](https://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/4yll5y/ms_kagura_mikazuchis_involvement/) a while back and I discussed potential for her to get involved, especially considering how Dimaria and Neinhart were back - and I was pretty disappointed how both were unceremoniously squashed by Natsu, which kind of took away my hope for Kagura to get used at all. As a result of this, I shall be as optimistic as I can be, as surely any action is better than none.

To quote my Kagura post... ""I was pretty hyped for Kagura vs Dimaria which became a shredded kimono, so anything is better than that."" - I now know that Larcade is more than capable of doing far worse than to shred a kimono. So Hiro pls.

Oh and a final note on my part: I think it's pretty rad that Erza, Jellal and Kagura who were all at the Neinhart fight now have their own fight against arguably each of the three main Spriggans. I wonder if Hiro will capitalise on this fun fact.

Hey Soma! Maybe Kagura kicking Larcade's ass after he orgasm'd Rogue would lead Rogue to ""thank"" her! Anyway, enough from me. *Tag*.

#The Light of Pleasure vs The Blade of Shadow:

***SOMA:*** My turn! Now, when it comes to Larcade, I feel ever so slightly different from Dash. Don’t get me wrong, the fact that a Dragneel- someone who’s essentially Natsu’s nephew, has a power that basically amounts to being a human vibrator is pretty ridiculous. However, it’s that ridiculousness that I actually like. I’m one for really well thought out, intelligent powers and clever plotlines and the rest of it. But on a chapter-to-chapter basis, something like this just makes me smile because it’s so insane. I mean, who was expecting that from Larcade? If you say yes… nah, you’re wrong.

As far as his origins and relation to Zeref… well, I’ve got a couple of thoughts about that. Before this week’s chapter, I had a theory that he was a sort of failed attempt of Zeref’s at creating a clone of Natsu using some leftover DNA, as a way to fill the void he carried from being separated from his beloved brother. And in truth, there’s still a chance of that being true. However, since reading the chapter on Monday, I (like others I’m sure) have had the idea that perhaps he took some DNA from Mavis (remember, he carried her body back to Fairy Tail after giving her reverse CPR, so he could’ve taken a few hairs then) and mixed it with his own to create a sort of “offspring”. If any of you have watched the cartoon Young Justice, it’s kind of like how Superboy finds out that he was created using a mixture of Superman and Lex Luthor’s DNA. There’s a few little things that kind of support it, one being his blond hair, which is reminiscent of Mavis’. As well as this, when he first casted his Viagra-wave spell, [the pose that he took to produce that light that emanated from his hands](http://imgur.com/XZSjuXE)  and [the camera pan when the attack exploded out]( http://imgur.com/30r0JNJ) reminded me pretty strongly of [Law](http://imgur.com/a/Vp66A)/[Fairy Law]( http://imgur.com/a/8UFGB) when I read the chapter.

Ignoring all that though, I’m very excited to see Kagura getting another shot at a Spriggan. This is Kagura’s third encounter with a Spriggan so far, after Dimaria and Neinhart. She’s lowkey been pretty heavily involved in the war, something I should really only expect from Erza’s surrogate sister. Even so, she hasn’t really had a chance to get to fighting properly yet, so I consider this to be her stage to really show her stuff. And it gets even better, because she’s got Yukino by her side, which is something I gushed pretty heavily over when I first read the chapter. Like I said on the chapter thread, I’ve always considered the link between Kagura and Yukino to be something of an untapped mine in regards to character development for the both of them. I’d love to see Hiro use this as an opportunity to build on their bet from the GMG, where Kagura took claim of Yukino’s life, and perhaps use this as an opportunity to form a real lasting bond between them. Fire-forged friends, and all that.

#Scarlet Storm vs Scarlet Despair

Now, I’m about to cover two of my favourite girls doing what they do best, so forgive me, because I’m probably going to go fanboy-mode. Now, in my opinion, this is a very, very interesting situation for Erza and Wendy to be in. And I mean this both in terms of the potential spectacle of the fight and the more emotional/character driven aspect.

I’ll tackle the character aspect first. Now, cast your minds back to before the war (remember those days? Pepperidge Farm remembers). Recall [this scene in particular](http://imgur.com/a/jiYZz) (you’re welcome for that, by the way). Wendy promises that, after all the times that Erza’s protected her and the rest of the guild, this time she’ll be her shield. And [what we have right here](http://imgur.com/TCwBgSa) is her making good on that promise. Yet again, this is Wendy  showing her growth from being unable to fight to being able to protect Erza from one of the most powerful characters in the verse thus far (even if she was a little…. preoccupied. Snort…).

I’ve waxed lyrical about Wendy’s growth enough times though, so I won’t talk your ears off about it for too long. But what I will say is that we’ll presumably see a more “even” combination between Wendy and Erza than we perhaps would have before. By this I mean that it won’t just be Erza doing all the heavy lifting while Wendy helps a bit, it’ll be a genuine joint effort (even if Erza does still put in the lion’s share of the work). One thing I’ve heard and have considered myself, is the possibility of Wendy sacrificing herself to save Erza during this fight. This’d be a pretty conclusive way of handling the theme of payback that Hiro's set up between Erza, as well as Wendy's growth as a whole. However, I really wouldn’t like to see that happen, for a couple of reasons. One of these is personal bias. I love Wendy, she’s a staple of my top 5 Fairy Tail characters, there’s absolutely no way I want to see her die, purely as a fan of hers. But more than that, from a writing perspective, I would consider Wendy dying here to be a complete waste. She’s grown so much as a character, but there’s still a lot more I want to see. I mentioned in an [old post of mine months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/4fw2ng/ms_blow_you_away/) that I feel like Wendy could become the leader (or one of the leaders) of the next generation of Fairy Tail wizards when she’s more grown up. Her dying here would obviously throw that out the window. In fact, the prospect of her fighting one of the most powerful characters so far alongside Fairy Tail’s current big sis is almost symbolic to me in a sense. It’s like a young intern shadowing a seasoned manager, except they’re kicking ass instead of filing receipts. From Erza’s perspective, she isn’t very much used to being the one to being protected, especially by one so young, so this may be a new experience for her. It’s hard to really define or determine what the emotional struggle of the fight is going to be for her, since we still have no idea exactly who Irene is to Erza.

As far as the more visceral, spectacular element of the fight, obviously Hiro’s gonna do his thing like he always does. But I have to admit, the thought of Wendy and Erza tag-teaming in a fight sent me on a little bit of a brainstorm about potential combos and Unison Raids they can come up with. There’s basic, obvious stuff like Wendy buffing Erza so she can go in. But consider the possibilities that can come from mixing Wendy’s wind with Erza’s armours. You could have something like Erza rushing Irene using her Nakama armour and Wendy using a Sky Dragon’s Roar to propel her towards Irene, or something like that. You could have Erza mix the water from her Sea Empress Armour with Wendy’s Sky magic to create a typhoon. Or, my personal favourite, a combination of Erza’s Blumenblatt attack with Wendy’s Shattering Light Sky Drill to create a literal storm of swords. You could call it something like “Sky Dragon’s Steel Hurricane”. Between the variety of Erza’s armours and the versatility of Sky Dragon Slayer magic, the possibilities between these two are endless.

I’m also curious about what Hiro could do with the apparent similarities between Irene and Wendy’s magic. We found out a while ago that Irene uses Enchantment magic, but one thing I think most of us forgot until recently is that Wendy herself rocks the same type of magic. This can have some very interesting possibilities for how Irene and Wendy will match (by the by, this is very much not a matchup I was anticipating dissecting, whatsoever. I give Hiro major props for flipping the script like this can you spot my bias yet). Wendy’s largely been relying on her offensive Sky Dragon magic in combat up till now. She’s not really been one for using Enchantment offensively, rather relying on it as a support tool to boost herself or her allies, or else to clear up enemy enchantments. But one thing we know about Wendy is that she’s a clever little girl, and a quick study. Just like how she figured out she could use the air around Face during the Tartaros arc to activate Dragon Force, perhaps by tangling with Irene, she’ll have a chance to learn more about using Enchantment magic in a more aggressive way than she’s currently used to.
With all that being said, would I expect them to defeat Irene? Going purely off the hype surrounding her, plus the fact that she was able to tangle with Acnologia (however briefly) and retain all of her internal organs, I’d say no. As it is, and as much as I don’t like saying it, the two of them together probably shouldn’t be beating Irene. Now, if they were to get an assist, perhaps from a certain womanizer we all know, then that would change matters. But as it stands, I’ll be happy just to see them give Irene a good sweat (even though she’s probably already got a little sweat on, heh).

Alright, that’s enough rambling from me. Back to you, Dash.

#Dashing Conclusion:

Yup, I too am pretty hyped about Wendy and Erza taking Irene on - even if they don't stand much of a chance, it'll still be pretty awesome for both characters. It's great to see the Wendy that hid behind the rock in the Oracion Seis arc intercepting a spell from the most powerful wizard she has ever encountered - to think that she has come this far while in Fairy Tail is a wonderful sight. This confidence and desire to protect is in no small part down to Erza, and it's awesome to see those two having their friendship explored a bit. I'll admit, I had totally forgotten about the bath scene until Soma brought it up - and I had not put two and two together in regards to Wendy's enchanting possibly holding significance against Irene, but looking back, it makes a lot of sense and I'm quite excited.

So 508 was hilarious for Soma and a bit of a let down for me in regards to Larcade, and disappointing for both of us in regards to the off-panel action (especially Crime Sorcière's). However, with Kagura getting a slice of the action and Wendy teaming up with Erza, I can't help but look forward to what 508 has set us up for.

5b80zh,2,2016-11-04,Advice on Current Career Plan?,JoseonOne,CPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPA/comments/5b80zh/advice_on_current_career_plan/,"Hi, I graduated a year and a half ago, and immediately began working in the private industry (partnerships accounting) while preparing for the CPA exams. I was able to finish my educational requirements about 6 months ago and have my first FAR exam coming soon.

While in college, I was unable to intern with any of the Big 4 (partially my fault for my lack of effort and not being aggressive enough with on-campus interviews and networking events). Although I applied through their careers website, I never heard anything back.

I understand most entry level staff accountants at the Big 4 are recent graduates who are CPA candidates and studying for the exams. My current plan is to first pass all four exams and possible have my managers (active CPAs) to sign off on my experience requirements for the actual license before trying for the Big 4. I believe public accounting experience is absolutely necessary in my career path, so I am trying to transition.

However, I'm a little worried that those who started working from the entry level position right after graduation would still have an advantage because of their work experience and familiarity within the firms and public industry. I guess I'm looking for some guidance on how to proceed. I considered applying for the Big 4 entry level positions now, but I'm already used to the current private firm I work at, and it allows me time to study for the exams.

Would it be more attractive for me to apply to the Big 4 position after I am fully licensed? How would this affect my position and salary prospects, and would I still have to start as a entry level staff accountant?

She gave me obvious hints, and I knew it. My issue was at the time was my confidence. I couldn't believe that a girl could possibly like me after all of my prior rejections. I was always known for going too fast, but I guess it was with women who I approached. She approached me! She was throwing herself at me, yet I played hard to get and played the oblivious card not knowing where it was going to go. At the time, though, I liked someone else so I guess I played that card too. Anyways fast forward to valentines day that year I didn't do anything for her tell her she was nice, or anything. I knew it was for me, but I was so stupid. A few months down the line, I find out she moved on from me, and is now to this day in a relationship with him. This guy looks just like me and acts just like me (I'm not kidding, I was also good friends with him too). The only differences was I am Chinese he is Filipino. We had similar everything. I guess she chose him cause she was done playing games with me. I approached her one time and she said I messed up. The last time I saw her was when she invited me to her debut. I had a chance to dance with her and I was so filled with regret the whole time. I talked to her, saying how nice she looked. I also left early, because I was so emotionally broken. I moved on from her, but I still think about this everytime I see her on social media. I have not been close to a girl since.
Now, I have tried meeting women, but it's not so easy anymore. In high school you can get close to women easily. In my college, it's pretty much a sausage fest, and at work, all employees come and go literally because its a non-paid internship of 3 months and I am the head honcho of all of them. All I have now is tinder and bumble but I haven't found a woman on there of interest. What should I do? I am 19 about to get an Associate's degree, have a steady job/place to live, but can't drive due to severe ADHD. I am a public transit/uber guy until self-driving cars.

**tl;dr**- Girl likes me, I play hard to get, she gives up on me, finds a guy who can be a doppelgänger of me, I start to really love her now but am too late, trying to find a new woman though, and be in a relationship."

Every time I text her I get responses within seconds and we arranged to meet each other during weekends but she canceled last time because her mother was hospitalized. Now we arranged the date again to next weekend and she began to ask me personal questions from favorite movies/colors/music to current relationship, such as she is no longer in relationship and I am single. 

I felt like I was really connecting with her and enjoying the texts because she sent me her recent pictures, really took interest in my life and agreed to split the bill (!) until she started complaining about her moodswings on birth control pills and then that got me thinking that she is lying to me about her current relationship status. Things got really weird after she said she wanted to meet my parents even though we actually have never met each other aside from that first meeting.

And currently the text stopped from having a great conversation to suddenly a silent nothing, probably for few days until she randomly texts me or I text her to see how she is doing. I really don't know how to interpret this. After an hour of silence I just sent her a good night text to see if I get anything back, but nothing. Should I assume that she wants the thrill of cheating on her boyfriend and will probably go back to him?

I really am not looking for a short term relationship and I don't want to temper with her current relationship if she is not single. "

I was able to finish my educational requirements about 6 months ago and have my first FAR exam coming soon.

While in college, I was unable to intern with any of the Big 4 (partially my fault for my lack of effort and not being aggressive enough with on-campus interviews and networking events). Although I applied through their careers website, I never heard anything back.

I understand most entry level staff accountants at the Big 4 are recent graduates who are CPA candidates and studying for the exams. My current plan is to first pass all four exams and possible have my managers (active CPAs) to sign off on my experience requirements for the actual license before trying for the Big 4. I believe public accounting experience is absolutely necessary in my career path, so I am trying to transition.

However, I'm a little worried that those who started working from the entry level position right after graduation would still have an advantage because of their work experience and familiarity within the firms and public industry. I guess I'm looking for some guidance on how to proceed. I considered applying for the Big 4 entry level positions now, but I'm already used to the current private firm I work at, and it allows me time to study for the exams.

Would it be more attractive for me to apply to the Big 4 position after I am fully licensed? How would this affect my position and salary prospects, and would I still have to start as a entry level staff accountant?

So, I'm a 23 yo M, 1.5 years out of college with a BS in biology. Went to college hoping to be a doctor, switched to dentistry late in my collegiate career, and I am now in the process of applying to dental school, but outlook on getting interviews is not looking that great. I have a 3.2 overall GPA with 3.75+ in my non-science courses. I've always been great with computers and have a pretty good business mind as well. I screwed around my freshman year and had shit grades in science courses but pulled them up since then. 

I'm now on the search for a backup option, should dentistry not pan out, and my family/friends have mentioned MIS/CS as a possible option. My other option is to pursue a MS in biology/biotechnology but I did lab work and graduate-level research for my senior capstone project and I was not a fan of the tediousness and boring nature of being stuck in lab all the time. Anyway, I have a family friend who is a current MIS major who has told me it's the way to go as his father was also an MIS major and now a president of a major defense contract company, but I'm not sure if this is the right career path for me. Not to say it isn't but I have no CS or IT background at all. I can work my way around any OS and have basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge along with plenty of basic computer hardware and software knowledge (I'm the go-to computer guy around my family, girlfriend's family, and all of my friends - even long-distance friends who call me for computer solutions). I also love solving basic computer and IT issues around the house and other peoples' computers (I've worked with personal computers running Windows and OS X/macOS and enterprise systems running older Windows systems). 

I've applied to a nearby university to enter their MIS program in the spring, just in case. I would apply to a CS or online MIS program but I don't have any prereq's to warrant it. And to be honest, I know CS is a ton of math and I am decent enough to keep up but not if it means taking more math classes (already took Cal I my freshman year along with basic statistics classes in my college career). Was wondering if I could get some opinions here on a possible move and if it's worth it to pursue a 2nd degree and even an MS in CS or MIS/Information Security (I have a sweet spot for cybersecurity in my heart). Also, any help with directions for a MS, and even internship ideas, if it's worth it, would be great as well. Let me know what you think. If this isn't the place to put this, please let me know where to repost to. Sorry for being so long. Thanks in advance!"

5b8uyt,3,2016-11-05,(long distance) relationships (rant),ausdertraum,istp,https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/5b8uyt/long_distance_relationships_rant/,"Hi guys. I'm new here. Did the free mbti tests recently, turned out 3/4 ISTP, 1/4 ISTJ. I've seen quite a bit that I can relate to on here so I thought I'd post. I'd appreciate input on my questions at the end, I understand if you don't want to read everything since it ended up quite long. Also apologies for any English mistakes.

I'm 25 now. I've only had 2 gfs (~1 year each with half the time LDR) plus a few girls I just dated briefly/even shorter.

My ex is 29. I was studying abroad in her country when we were dating. When I was with her we used to text 3-4 times a week and meet  about once or twice a week. Everything was pretty great. She never asked if I love her or anything like that. Once I returned to my country we did long distance, skyped once a week which worked out pretty well for a few months, then I got more busy at uni and it just cooled off. I went back to her country for an internship, got in touch again, officially broke it off (because I was in a different city so it would've been long distance still). We are friends now, talk occasionally.

Shortly after I broke up with my ex I met my current gf (22). I've been with her for just over a year, 7 months of which long distance (she went to study abroad). She's very different from my ex. She needs to text every day, constantly wants words of affirmation etc. which I really wasn't used to. Not sure if this is a personality thing or just an age/maturity thing. Anyway I somewhat adapted to that, but saying I love you and compliments just doesn't come to me naturally. I'd like to think that the time we spend together and the way I treat her should convey that I like her, but that's not enough for her. 

This has been a re-occurring issue. This week I upset her once again (""why is my bf the only guy who doesn't tell my that I'm cute""). Of course I apologized and reaffirmed her I like her, but tbh I've been wondering whether it's time to move on. She still likes me and I also like her quite a bit, but I feel like I will never be able to meet her expectations as far as showing affection goes. Saying the same stuff over and over again seems unnecessary and fake to me. As does regularly fighting/apologizing over the same stuff. Maybe we are just not compatible? The fact that we are long distance probably aggravates the problem. Honestly I never wanted either relationship to become a LDR, but I got attached and didn't have the balls to break up at the time.

Sorry for the rant, I really needed to get this off my mind. Any thoughts appreciated. I'd be particularly interested in hearing

-How you show affection?

-How do you deal with partners that require words of affirmation?

-Whether it's common for ISTPs to have shorter term relationships (might be just my age though) and/or to lose interest during LDRs?"

5b8zmk,7,2016-11-05,I'm 20 years old and I feel like a complete failure. I have no direction.,Iamacompletefailure,quarterlifecrisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/quarterlifecrisis/comments/5b8zmk/im_20_years_old_and_i_feel_like_a_complete/,"Repost from /r/self, because I really need answers. And I feel like this is a more appropriate subreddit.

To start out, I am 20 years old. I had a really bad past in high school, battling depression, so my high school grades were complete shit. By that, I mean basically straight F's, so nothing can be salvaged there. The depression was linked to me being transgender, but I got on hormones, and all is well now in that department. 
But after I got out of depression, I decided to put my life back together, and go to community college. But lately, I feel like I have been taking classes kind of aimlessly, only because I have to or else my parents will kick me out of their house. 

I want to be an art major. This was a dream that I had since the last year of high school, after I finally got my head out of the clouds. 

Art majors are very expensive. And you have to have a lot of skill and you have to work very, very hard to make it in the industry. I would consider myself talented, but not industry standards. But with a couple more years of improvement, I might be able to land myself into a good art university. I am more than willing to work for it.

But here is the problem. I’m transgender, and I’m currently taking hormones, which means that my life is bound to having insurance. When you’re working in the art industry, you don’t know when you will have a job, which means that having a steady job is out of the question. Artists often are forced to take freelance jobs, which means I definitely will not have health insurance. And that’s a really big issue. Because if I don’t have insurance, it means I can’t pay for my hormones, and my life would severely suck. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to chase after my dream of becoming an artist, but I feel because of the fact I am transgender, I cannot. And that really tears me apart. Maybe me choosing to take hormones means that I have to sacrifice my dream of being an artist. Because you can’t have everything in life. Giving up hormones is not an option, because I have already had a hysterectomy, and if I don’t have the injections, I would be forced to experience the very unpleasant side effects of having no hormones in my system. 

This is really hard for me. I feel like a failure because I’m watching a lot of my friends get internships and being recognized from their top-tier universities for all the achievements they have gotten. They have jobs and a place in life and a straight shot to a successful career. Meanwhile, I’m still living with my parents, still in community college, still very financially dependent on them. Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents to death. But I hate myself because I’m 20 and I’m still living like a child, being controlled by my parents. I have never gone out and seen the world nor have I lived on my own. I would love to, but I’m bound by my financial dependency.

Did I make the right choice by pursuing an art major? Part of me wants it so badly, but part of me feels like I’m going to end up dead and homeless in some alleyway or something. I can’t shake off these feelings that I amount to nothing and that I’m just going to fuck up everything in my life. What do I do? Change my major? Move out? I want to do something in life and become a person who my parents can be proud of.  

**TL;DR 20 years old FTM transgender. Wants to pursue an art major, but dependence on medical insurance makes the prospects risky. Feels like a failure and doesn't know what to do and where to go.**

I do want her back, but I don't know how to feel.",throwawakeupson,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ba3vg/my22m_girlfriend21f_broke_up_with_me_during/,"Hey all, first post. Sorry if this is a bit long and thanks in advance for whatever help you can give.

I love my girlfriend to the end of the Earth and back. Though we only met last March, we instantly hit it off, have traveled to a lot of places together, keep bucket lists of things we want to do together in the future, have pet names for each other, are very open with one another about our feelings and generally are as great a couple as I could imagine. We are each on our second committed partner, so I feel like we're nearly always on the same page about relationships. But, unfortunately, recently some things have come in between us and I don't know exactly how to deal with them.

When we met last spring, we each already had established plans for the coming summer and fall. We would each work internships on opposite sides of the country during the summer, and while she would return to our school in the fall I would be studying abroad in Europe for a semester. I had never done long distance before, but she had, and I worried from the beginning about the feasibility of asking her to do that again. But by a month or two into the relationship, it was clear that what we had was really serious and really great, and we mutually agreed that we should give long distance a shot, because it wouldn't be too long until I was back home.

Over the summer, we talked on the phone almost every day. Sometimes she was sad, sometimes I was sad, but we leaned on each other and got by. I even was able to fly out to see her part way through, and at the end she flew back to see me. All this time we still had the initial spark of the relationship, we continued all of our cute habits together as best as we could at distance, I was very happy and fulfilled and it seemed like she was too. 

When I had to leave for Europe, it became more difficult. First of all, there was now a 9 hour time difference between us, making it much more difficult to find times to talk. Secondly, her emotions took a turn for the worse and she became frequently depressed. The reasons she gave me were loneliness (I wasn't there and her friends were frequently busy), school stress, and the idea that her being open to me about her sadness was dragging me down and making my trip worse. I made the best effort I could to listen, understand, cheer up her and especially to let her know that she was not a toxic influence on me, but I knew that I wasn't a psychiatrist and ultimately I alone probably couldn't pull her out of this. Honestly I felt bad that I couldn't help from so far away and guilty that I was on this trip having fun by myself in the first place - I felt like I had abandoned her. She was less and less open with me and wanted to talk less, I think because she felt bad about dragging me down, and I was at a loss for what to do. So we talked less frequently (still about twice a week) and the conversations were more and more one sided. I just wanted to get home as quickly as possible and try to fix this.

We had talked a lot about our plans for when I get back. This coming January following the trip I would be done with college, so I would try to get a job and an apartment near our school so we could get back to business as usual while she finished her last year of classes. I was really happy to have that as a goal to look forward to and plan the next stage of my life around, and always told her it was no problem.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, about 2 months into my European trip with about 2 more months to go. One night while we're messaging, she says she can't handle being romantic or cute anymore, that she is too stressed out to put energy into it. She says that she needs time to focus on herself and wants to just not talk until next week. I tell her that I support her and if this is what she thinks she needs to be happy right now then she should do it, but inside I am shocked and scared by how out of the blue this is. I spend the next week thinking about what to say to her and convincing myself that she's just passing through a rough patch, because despite the hardships of long distance I never once thought that it was really coming in between us.

Unfortunately, that proved false when we talked again. She told me that after a lot of introspection, she realized that she had been in a relationship nearly continuously since high school (either with me or with her ex) and that she felt she needed to focus on herself and experience the single life. She said that she just thought she needed to go on other dates, and that that was what would make her happy right now. She had been thinking about this since I left for Europe but didn't know how to tell me because I was important to her and she didn't want to hurt me. Also, she felt like she was ruining my trip by being sad all the time and felt a lot of pressure for being something I was planning my life around. Despite all this, she said she was conflicted about breaking up with me and was worried she was hurting me and making a huge mistake.

I realized that I probably couldn't just make her forget all the feelings that were tearing her up, and I still loved her a whole lot, so I decided I had to let her go. I told her that if she thought she needed to be alone to be happy, then I support her and just want what's best for her. I told her not to feel bad and that I would be ok. I told her I'd never forget all the stuff we'd done, she said the same, and we agreed I'd call when I got back home. We tearily hung up and within a few hours she had erased our relationship status and changed her profile picture to one without me in it.

All this hurt a lot and was very shocking. Our communications had been less frequent and somewhat dampened by her sadness, but I never sensed a loss of our connection to each other. Now, doubts I had never had about how much she actually loved me started to bother me, and that was the worst part. I didn't even know if she really wanted me to call when I got back.

I had a really bad couple of days, and was just about to pull myself together and stop crying when she messaged me. She said she realized she made a huge mistake, and that she wanted to try to work it out again. After a day or so of thinking it over I called her again and told her how much she'd hurt me, but that I wanted to work it out too. She apologized profusely and tried to explain herself. She had realized that being without me was even worse than feeling distant from me. She missed talking and she was just immensely confused and depressed. We talked over several days and I decided to forgive her, and we're talking again and it mostly seems like we're back at the summer level of good feelings. We agreed that its still a good idea for me to come back home, find a job and stick to our original plan.

But there's just a lot in the back of my mind that still worries me about the situation. I am worried that she might have another change of heart and leave me again, and I don't want to deal with that hurt again. There is a serious loss of trust that I wish wasn't there. I told her about this and she said she was sorry and didn't know what to say, but hoped that trust would be rebuilt over time.

The other thing is that I just have this nagging feeling that I'm a pushover and that that will bite me in the ass in time. I've always forgiven her and told her I understand her feelings, and while I do value understanding and really love her too much to stay upset with her, I worry that me not taking a stand (even when I honestly don't want to) will have long term consequences for my self-esteem. I feel like even if I don't regret my actions at all, they somehow make me less masculine or attractive, and I don't know why that bothers me but it just does, a little. Most of my friends urged me not to take her back, not because they thought she was a bad person but because the fact that she dumped me would never go away and would always be a roadblock to recovery. I really am not mad at her and really just want back what we had, and with how we're interacting now it seems possible. I am just confused and uneasy about everything.

Can things ever really be back to exactly how they were? Was there something I could have done better, or should do now? Should I have taken her back? Am I a pushover?

I don't even know if this makes any sense, I am just hoping to hear people's two cents. Thanks for taking the time to read my story.

  ---   

TL;DR: My long distance girlfriend dumped me, but changed her mind three days later and I took her back. I love her, but I am having trouble with loss of trust and because I feel like a pushover."

5bafyb,2,2016-11-05,Escalation of Trich,zebralegz,trichotillomania,https://www.reddit.com/r/trichotillomania/comments/5bafyb/escalation_of_trich/,"Hi, everyone. This is my first time posting here.

I have had trich since I was 16 (when my dad kicked me out and I have subsequently been homeless since then). I did not know what it was until I was 18, however, when I was talking with my debate coach about her oldest son who had it in his teens, too. They shaved his head constantly for 5 years and also started doing nuero therapy for all of her kids (all are on the autistic spectrum).

Anyway, at first, it was just hair twirling, but my hair would get damaged and fall out easily. So it is not as noticeable on my scalp as hair pullers. My boyfriend has been trying to help me stop since I was 17 (I am 20 now), but I got annoyed by it and asked him to stop (even though I did ask him to help in the first place).

I have been wearing glasses since I was 15, and they were never really a problem until about 2 years ago. I would mess with the hair so it would not be underneath the arms, but last night I had a 3 hour episode. I rubbed the skin raw around my ears, and there is no hair around them. 

I finally reached out to my group for foster children, wards of the court, and homeless students at my university that has an MSW intern. But she has not yet responded to me yet. 

This is really hard for me. And even though my debate coach (not-legally foster mother) has dealt with it before, I am incredibly ashamed to approach her with it. The only person that knows is my boyfriend, and he knows about last night, but I am so ashamed.

I don't know why I posted this. I guess j just wanted to get it off my chest."
5bao6y,264,2016-11-05,Sic the IRS on 'em,neandersthall,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/5bao6y/sic_the_irs_on_em/,"I am a Dr. and a few years back I was initially paid as an independant contractor when I worked for a hospital temporarily.  Things worked out and I was hired on full time as the director after a month or so.  The previous director left abruptly (as in the middle of the shift) and they were in the process of suing her.  As such I wasn't in a hurry to sign a contact with them (i.e. bad reputation, untrusting).  

I started to work full time but stayed as hourly wage and only when clocked in at work.  However I worked every weekend, every holiday, was on call 24/7 and got called all day and all night.  I approached them about other compensation for the hours outside of work and they kept saying they would pay me, to keep track of my hours, etc.  Very reassuring and basically told me what I wanted to hear. 

After about a year I found out one of the other Drs. was making more than me, not full time, no extra duties, etc.  Super pissed so I drew the line and eventually was allowed to start turning in my logged hours (though not for anything in the past).  However I was still keeping up with emails, text messages, etc. that were expected to be absorbed by my salary...I was only paid for showing up for meetings and for phone call consultations with other Drs.  All told I figure I donated about 500 hours of my time. 

After 2 years I was tired of it all and found another job.  I told them about it and they panicked because they didn't have anyone lined up to take over my spot.  I offered to give them 2 months notice but they demanded 3 and basically guilted me into staying.  I did have them give me a raise and a better schedule but still not printed contract (honeslty I would have been happy to not work there anymore so at the time I wasn't too worried but figured they would give me notice if they wanted to part ways). 

Then strange things started happening, they hired another Dr. they didn't need (extra) who was set to start in a month.  I couldn't figure out why, especially after they just gave me a new deal.  I saw a job add out for a specialist but would have been fine if they hired one so again didn't think much about it.  

About a month later I showed up at work and there was another Dr. there who wasn't scheduled.  Turns out they had fired me via voicemail and I hadn't checked it yet.  I called to see what was up and they just laughed at me then proceeded to tell me I was crazy, bi-polar, borderline, or schitzophrenic and that everyone said so and that I was unemployable.   This after 10 years in the field, no complaints or negative feedback from them or anyone else. (It was poorly run and I complained/vented about that and the lack of pay at various times but nothing excessive). 

I had already turned down the other job and it was no longer available.  I was left unemployed with no severance, not even a face to face firing where I could tell them off.   They could have easily given me the 60-90 days notice they requested of me.  

After a few weeks in bed feeling sorry for myself I found another job right away but was still furious. I looked at hiring lawyers but of course that comes with legal fees and with nothing in writing it boils down to he said/she said and no clear mention of either party not being able to part ways without notice (i.e they were assholes and I wasn't). 

I didn't file for unemployment as I know I was a contractor.  After a year or so and some research I found a path for revenge.  I filled out 1 or 2 page form and submitted to IRS, also alerted unemployment department.  Eventually (about another year) I was granted employment status by IRS.  

Due to the deductions I had taken, I actually ended up owing some money (lose deductions, gain employer's share of FICA taxes)...a few thousand I think.  I never bothered re-filing to be honest, so I kept all of my original deductions and such.  However, they had to pay all my back FICA plus taxes, plus penalties which amounted to about $25k. 

However, I also alerted the IRS that they were applying this method of employement to 8 other Drs. over the previous 3 years.  Which meant they didn't have any employees and were skimming off the FICA tax onto the doctors (90% of which were full timers). 

I have no idea what actually ended up happening (may still be ongoing honeslty).  I assume the dominos started falling.  At the least they lost $30k on me.  If they had to pay FICA on all 8 Drs. it would be about double that (some were interns).  However, if they got audited and found to have willfully tried to skirt around the taxes (which was pretty obvoius becaues they did it to some Drs. some years and not others) then penalty could include them having to pay income taxes as well.  Total would end up being about $250k....  Not to mention they never actually had the interns on payroll, they just paid cash to another hospital who then paid them. 

I can only hope they got screwed.  I put a hex on them via some old chinese lady under a bridge who burned incense and such.  
1 owner ended up getting throat cancer
the other owner cheated on his wife and she left him. 



Edit: sorry, didn't realize the ancillary parts of my post would garner so much attention and distract from the main point. 

1) doesn't matter what my profession was, could happen to anyone

2) doesn't matter if I spell words right or use abbreviations, I typed the whole damn thing on my phone. 

3) the last sentence was me being witty and had nothing to do with the rest of the story.  I live in Hong Kong and there is a Chinese lady that sits under the bridge and burns stuff and chants and all that mess. I paid her $6 and wrote their names on a piece of paper.  I later heard my bosses developed cancer and got caught sleeping with an employee leading to a divorce.  So naturally I attributed this to karma and my $6 hex.  It was true but it was meant to be funny. 

4) mis classification of employees as independent contractors is a common trick used to skirt around taxes. Instead of employer and employee both paying 7.5%, a contractor has to pay 15% on top of state and federal income taxes. 7.5% plus penalties plus interest equals about 11%.  Then add in accountant fees and potentially legal fees (is a crime in some states).  

5) if audited and found to have willfully tried to mis classify in order skirt around taxes  then they can be penalized and forced to pay up to the cost of the income taxes (so like 25%) as a penalty.  Multiply all of that times 8 employees (Drs in this example) and the total could end up being $250k or so. 


6) the unemployment office will also be pissed and take notice and investigate as to why they haven't been getting paid.

So anyways, real event, crappy story telling..."

5bb2sy,1,2016-11-05,[Internships] Sophomore can't get an interview,VeniVidiVici42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5bb2sy/internships_sophomore_cant_get_an_interview/,"tl;dr: Am I doing something wrong or am I just a sophomore?

Hi guys,

So I'm a sophomore at MIT, and as the title suggests I can't get an internship interview. 

About a month ago I applied to a bunch of places I could think of off the top of my head, and a couple weeks ago I went down intern.supply and applied to a bunch more. I also went to my school's career fair and handed out resumes and such to places I recognized the name of. 

Since then, most places haven't bothered responding at all (even with a rejection email), much less given an interview. I'm wondering whether this is because I'm a weak candidate (in which case I want to do something about this before next year) or if it's just because places don't want sophomores (in which case I can continue what I'm doing and try again next year).

Basically, I'm doubling in math/CS, but it's very easy to get a math degree at my school (the requirements are intentionally lenient to accommodate people doubling), so I'm taking a lot of math classes first before focusing on CS. In particular I'm taking a bunch of graduate classes right now, so I don't have much time to devote to side projects. In particular, the general advice for projects of ""find something that should be done and do it"" doesn't really help me, because those things are either trivial (i.e. I can do it in a couple hours) or way too time-consuming (i.e. I don't have the time to do it with my courseload). 

Thus from a CS perspective my resume is presumably quite weak; I don't have many projects to speak of (besides some small minor ones) and the CS classes I've taken are basic introductory-level ones that I've taken just to clear out requirements (i.e. the ones I can finish without devoting too much time/going to class, which are necessarily the basic ones). So I can totally understand why I don't come across as a serious candidate.

On the other hand, I'm mildly surprised that I'm getting *nothing*, as I don't think I'm so weak as to get filed under ""completely ignore"". In particular I also have a decent competitive programming background (Codeforces, USACO, etc.), so I think I'd stand a decent chance at getting past an interview if I could get one (most interview problems I hear aren't too bad; they'd be mid-level competition problems or so). So I'm wondering whether I should take this as

a) A ""wake-up call"" so to speak, i.e. that I'm actually a terrible candidate and need to make changes before next year if I want an internship. In particular, if this is the case, then I'm happy to lighten my courseload and focus on putting together some projects next semester in preparation for recruiting season next year. But obviously I'd rather not do this, which leads me to

b) An indication that places don't want to hire non-advanced sophomores, but will do so for juniors, in which case I can continue with my current educational plan of finishing my math requirements then moving on to the upper-level CS stuff.

c) There's something else horribly wrong with the way I've been applying (i.e. through company websites/the intern.supply links) that's leading to my stuff getting filtered out automatically.

Does anyone have any insight on this? Thanks!

* Classic Bill and Monica in the White House. Perhaps this is the first time? Or they are readying to take the step and have what would be impossible for anyone to deny as sex.

* Bill and Monica meeting up in the present day. Apologies offered, old jokes shared and pretty soon the sparks are flying again.

* William Howard Taft and an intern of your choice. Just because I wanted to make a William Howard Taft joke. But I'm totally down with playing any president if you have a history kink.

Sorry guys this is gonna be a bit of a long post. I'm a senior in college majoring in Game Programming. I'm just honestly feeling more and more concerned about my job prospects. My boyfriend has the same degree I am currently working on and he graduated a year ago. He has yet to find a job that uses his degree(or anything other than the crap fast food jobs,retail, and factory work that does not require any kind of degree and will hire almost anybody). Lately I have been applying for tons and tons of internships, new grad positions, and entry-level positions. I have filled out over 150 applications in the last 2.5 months. I stare down LinkedIn and Indeed every day. I went to every page of google with the search terms video game intern. I searched for any mention of internships on Facebook. I also went to gamedevmap.com and went to every link in the USA and Canada looking for jobs to apply to. I'm starting to feel like I'm even running out of jobs to apply to that I feel my skill set aligns with. I taught myself to program when I was 11, took Computer Science classes in high school, and as aforementioned am now a senior in college. I have also been working on a game known as Crimson Nights with some others at my University and it will be sold on Steam. Its almost done and right now were looking at releasing it probably on/around the 18th of this month. I have had 8 interviews with 6 different companies, but have not yet been offered any jobs. Well I was offered a unpaid internship in Hollywood, CA, but I most definitely can not afford to move to Hollywood and work for free. I'm on my own and pay all my own bills, my parents don't help me with anything, and my student loans from the FAFSA don't even cover all of my tuition(I'm paying around 7k a year out of pocket just for school). I know how to use Unity and Android Studio. I can program in C#, C++, Java, Lua, Python, JavaScript, ActionScript, HTML, CSS, and Visual Basic. I know how to use git already and am familiar with Scrum and Agile Development. I also am familiar with and able to use many various IDES, including Visual Studio and Eclipse. What can I do to make myself stand out and get a paying position somewhere(games or software related)? My portfolio is located at https://alisontaylorprojects.wordpress.com/
Please help! Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Again sorry for super super long post but I've been feeling a bit depressed about it and disheartened. I'm worried all my hard work will amount to nothing and that my degree may just end up a worthless piece of paper."

I had realized that I was alienating myself from my friends when I was in that relationship and I wasn't happy so I ended it. Once I did end it, I realized that it was too late, and I had lost almost all of my friends in my small college town.

I mean I still have some friends, but these are my high school friends from my hometown, which is pretty far away, and I really only see them a few times a year. 

I still try to be social. I go to my internship and communicate with people and I try to get out and play soccer whenever possible, I talk to people there.

Not to brag but I have been killing it on Tinder recently, but those are just one night hookups and they are pretty vapid. Plus I had to buy Plan B for one this week and I could barely afford it, so I think I'll stop. 

I'm never invited anywhere though. I dont even get texts asking if I'm doing alright except from my mom. Its like no one knows I exist and I don't even pop in to people's heads. I feel like everyone I meet hates me, or at least finds me unbearably annoying. 

I do have depression, but I'm not suicidal, so please don't link me to /r/suicidewatch. I'm just lonely. I feel inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. I feel isolated.

It turns out that my roommate doesn't like me for whatever reason too. Apparently he and his girlfriend threw a party a couple weeks ago and everyone in the apartment was invited except for myself. He doesn't really acknowledge me when I say Hi to him either. 

I don't really know what I could have done to upset him, except maybe leave the dishes in the sink for a bit too long, but that hardly seems like something to alienate someone over. 

Idk. There is obviously something wrong with me. My personality or something is obviously very off putting because as soon as people get to know me they seem to disappear. 

It sucks.

5bdguf,18,2016-11-05,[Internships] Sophomore can't get an interview,VeniVidiVici42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5bdguf/internships_sophomore_cant_get_an_interview/,"tl;dr: Am I doing something wrong or am I just a sophomore?

Hi guys,

So I'm a sophomore at MIT, and as the title suggests I can't get an internship interview.

About a month ago I applied to a bunch of places I could think of off the top of my head, and a couple weeks ago I went down intern.supply and applied to a bunch more. I also went to my school's career fair and handed out resumes and such to places I recognized the name of.

Since then, most places haven't bothered responding at all (even with a rejection email), much less given an interview. I'm wondering whether this is because I'm a weak candidate (in which case I want to do something about this before next year) or if it's just because places don't want sophomores (in which case I can continue what I'm doing and try again next year).

Basically, I'm doubling in math/CS, but it's very easy to get a math degree at my school (the requirements are intentionally lenient to accommodate people doubling), so I'm taking a lot of math classes first before focusing on CS. In particular I'm taking a bunch of graduate classes right now, so I don't have much time to devote to side projects. In particular, the general advice for projects of ""find something that should be done and do it"" doesn't really help me, because those things are either trivial (i.e. I can do it in a couple hours) or way too time-consuming (i.e. I don't have the time to do it with my courseload).

Thus from a CS perspective my resume is presumably quite weak; I don't have many projects to speak of (besides some small minor ones) and the CS classes I've taken are basic introductory-level ones that I've taken just to clear out requirements (i.e. the ones I can finish without devoting too much time/going to class, which are necessarily the basic ones). So I can totally understand why I don't come across as a serious candidate.

On the other hand, I'm mildly surprised that I'm getting nothing, as I don't think I'm so weak as to get filed under ""completely ignore"". In particular I also have a decent competitive programming background (Codeforces, USACO, etc.), so I think I'd stand a decent chance at getting past an interview if I could get one (most interview problems I hear aren't too bad; they'd be mid-level competition problems or so). So I'm wondering whether I should take this as

a) A ""wake-up call"" so to speak, i.e. that I'm actually a terrible candidate and need to make changes before next year if I want an internship. In particular, if this is the case, then I'm happy to lighten my courseload and focus on putting together some projects next semester in preparation for recruiting season next year. But obviously I'd rather not do this, which leads me to

b) An indication that places don't want to hire non-advanced sophomores, but will do so for juniors, in which case I can continue with my current educational plan of finishing my math requirements then moving on to the upper-level CS stuff.

c) There's something else horribly wrong with the way I've been applying (i.e. through company websites/the intern.supply links) that's leading to my stuff getting filtered out automatically.

Does anyone have any insight on this? Thanks!

Statement of Purpose

I was a troubled teen at the beginning of my high school career, one of the “at risk youth” I would later write news stories about. My parents moved me around a lot during adolescence and when I entered high school I was without friends, mentors, or connected to a higher purpose. 

I spent my middle school years in Florida, where I had been established academically and socially. Then my parents moved me to Juneau, Alaska. My freshman year of high school I shared cramped living quarters on a small house boat, sleeping in a space barely bigger than a walk-in closet with four bunks. I shared the space with my parents and my older brother. There was no place to do homework, no place to shut a door to a private world all my own. There wasn't even a working toilet on the boat. I had a family, I had a home, but I didn't have a support network, a shower, or a even a proper bathroom. I did poorly in school, poorly socially, and was depressed. I binge ate to cope with it all and became morbidly obese.

As my high school years unfolded, things began to slowly turn around. My parents moved us into an apartment. I still didn't have a room of my own, but at least I had a shower and a toilet. I started making friends, getting support from teachers, and turning my grades around. I even lost a significant amount of weight and had improved my self-esteem. 

A teacher's aid in a writing for publication class I was in was impressed with my reading of a PSA I did for him and encouraged me to apply for an internship at local public radio station KTOO. I applied and got the internship that summer, which began my mentoring with then news editor Rosemarie Alexander-Isett. 

My senior year of high school I got moved once again by my parents back to Florida. I had to start from square one all over again. The credits didn't properly transfer from one school to the next and I just barely graduated high school. I had to supplement the missing credits by doubling my course work doing online courses concurrently with physical classes.  It was extremely stressful and I missed my friends in Alaska. That last move was the final straw for me, and when I turned 18 I decided to branch off on my own and attend college in Alaska at University of Alaska Southeast. I entered their English degree program. 

In Spring 2011 I attended Jenifer Vernon's Ethnographic film class and decided to create a film related to homelessness. I worked with another classmate, Nicole Dahl, who was also passionate about the issue. I had not forgotten what it was like to nearly fall through the cracks of society myself and I wanted to bring to light some of those issues. Though academic restrictions forbade me to make the film's subject about actual homeless people, I chose to aim my lens at homeless advocates—those who volunteer and assist in the cause of homelessness. We called the 20 minute final project “Invisible Hands.”   

When it was screened on campus, a woman was so moved she broke out in tears during the Q &amp; A and said she herself was a homeless person. In that moment, I felt connected to something bigger than me. The film went on to air on KTOO's public television channel in Alaska called 360 North. 

This documentary film reacquainted me with KTOO, who I had become estranged with since beginning college. I began interning once again at KTOO in the fall of 2011, with Jenifer Vernon as my academic facilitator, and News Editor Rosemarie Alexander-Isett providing one-on-one coaching of my stories. I spent the fall of 2011 through the fall of 2012 interning for college credit at KTOO and slowly honed my craft there. Thanks to Jenifer Vernon putting in place a radio node at the University's Egan Library, I also hosted a music-based student run radio show called “UAS Radio.” 


In fall of 2012 I contributed many stories related to teen homelessness and high school drop-out rates in Alaska. I was once again motivated by my own past experiences as a teen juggling an unsteady home life with academic demands. This time, I got to speak to actual homeless teens and get their stories broadcast. I spoke to the high school superintendent regarding the issue, drew statistics of homelessness among students from Alaska's department of Education and Early Development, and spoke to the folks who ran homeless shelters for students to get their perspective. I felt connected to a higher purpose for my life, which is to tell the truth through stories—especially for those who do not have a voice.

My music show “UAS Radio” landed me a paid music manager position for KTOO's sister station KXLL for a couple months immediately after graduation. I later landed a job as programming manager for KTOO's television channel 360 North for about 6 months. Subsequent organizational restructuring at KTOO caused me to have to part ways as an employee there. Though I do intermittent freelance work as a writer here and there, opportunities for journalism work have gone largely dormant for me in Juneau. 

I have the strong desire to relocate in hopes of sinking my teeth in other opportunities that may present themselves in Portland. More formal training in journalism will increase my chances of landing a job in my field in a larger area with more competition. I know that I need more in-depth training in the rhetoric and ethics of journalism, film and photography equipment, story-telling, and web design. I believe wholeheartedly the University of Oregon's Masters in Multi-media Journalism program will provide me the education I need to take my career to the next level. I hope being accepted into this program keep me connected to my life's higher purpose of storytelling. "

Here are the two I am thinking of. Please let me know if you think these are decent answers, or if neither of them are any good.

1. My height. I am fairly short and I think people don't take me as seriously because of this. I have to try extra hard to prove myself because I don't have as much physical presence when I enter a room and have to make up for it with my actions.

2. I am a very harsh self-critic. I think this stems from having been the only female in my physics program and feeling like I had to prove myself capable just because I am a female. I think that this comes off as me lacking confidence sometimes, and I am trying to actively make sure that it is not the impression I give off.

Maybe neither of these are good, I don't know. Any feedback is very appreciated! Thanks :)"

* 21 years old, 4th year student in a pretty well regarded STEM university. Currently planning to graduate in Feburary 2018 with a dual ME/CS degree. 
* My parents are well-off and still financially support me - daily living expenses are essentially 0. School/car/food/rent/etc are all taken care of. 
* Currently have $700 in a local checking account, $4k in a local savings account (0.02% APY), and $12k emergency fund in an Ally savings account (1% APY).
* Currently an authorized cardholder on my parents Amex account and have my own Discover student card.

I just accepted an offer for an internship that pays 25.75 an hour, total wages should be around $12,000 pre-tax. Now that I'll actually have wages, my current plan is to start a 401k and max out my contributions (which from what I've read, would be equal to my total wages since I won't hit the $18,000 cap). Googling around Glassdoor, it seems that the company does do some 401k matching for interns; still have to contact HR and double check if that is still the policy. 

This will still leave me with most of the money I make during the internship left over. I plan to reduce the emergency fund to around $3000 right now, since my expenses are not all that high. I live in a fraternity house, so if things were to go way far south, they would defer all rent payments until I get back on my feet without any credit score repercussions. 

I thought about starting a brokerage account with Vanguard and putting the remaining internship money in a S&amp;P index fund, but I'm unsure if this is the right move. Since I'm graduating in ~15 months, I think the better option would be to just keep the money in the Ally account and save it until I get a full time job, so I can be sure to max out my 401k contributions (since they're not taxed) and take advantage of any contribution matching that my employer offers. I might be able to afford to do this with just my salary (average accepted offer for CS is $82,000), but it's hard to know when I don't have any clue what the cost of living of the area I'll end up in post-graduation is. Since I'm pretty certain that I know when I'll need the money, would putting it in a bond for that amount of time be worth it? Is there something else I should be doing with this money?

A couple other small things, my fraternity currently owes me about $2500 from various things I purchased and filled out reimbursement requests for. I've kept a negative balance with the fraternity over the past couple years as they just deduct my rent and dues from the amount, which is convenient for me. After researching more about personal finance I realized that this was probably a poor move as I might as well just move that money to the Ally account where I'll actually be making interest on it, correct?

Some other questions:

* Is everything I've mentioned above about 401ks correct? I'm not sure if me being claimed as a dependent affects any of this. 
* The Discover student card gives me a credit report every month, and to my surprise my score is already ~800. Was I building credit from being an authorized cardholder on my parents account?
* Is there anything else I'm missing that I should do before I graduate finance-wise? I know one thing would be do actually get a copy of my credit report and check it for correctness. 

Sorry if I'm totally off-base with any of this. Despite being very into education, my parents have done little in terms of teaching me practical financial skills, so I've just been trying to research as much as possible lately to put myself in the best position when I graduate. "
5bepsj,2,2016-11-06,"Can't seem to find entry level IT work after graduation, could use some help",jbronin,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5bepsj/cant_seem_to_find_entry_level_it_work_after/,"So I recently graduated from college back in May with a BS in Systems Engineering, with a big focus on computer networking. For some reason, either I'm not aggressive enough in my job search, I'm not looking in the right places, or employers just don't care about my applications, I can't seem to find a job. I've had three job prospects (positions I actually got interviewed for) since then. Two prospects were from my last employer, which was a sales engineering internship, (I wasn't their top choice in the first one and the second just stopped contacting me), and one was a entry level position in a major area company. Obviously, I didn't get any of those jobs.

Right now I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to finally break into my career. I could keep on looking at the same old BS job listings that say they are entry/low level, but require 5 years of experience plus experience in a dozen different IT systems, or try something different.

I am considering trying a staffing agency so I can at least get some experience to add to my resume other than my internship, but I'm a little worried that I'll get wrangled into a complex situation (contracts and whatnot).

I could also pivot and switch from looking for network/systems jobs and look for software programming jobs (I did have some programming classes in school that I enjoyed), but I'm afraid I'll hit the same snag as my search for network/systems jobs has gone.

Recently I started looking at job listings via LinkedIn because I noticed some show direct connections to the recruiters and even how many fellow alumni work at this company currently. I have a feeling my few early career connections might be able to help me get a foot in the door by know the right person, but I still feel like it's a long shot.

So any ideas or advice on what I should do? It really feels pretty depressing to think that I expected to find something quickly after graduating and now I'm down to hoping to get something before the year ends."

* Africa

 * This is really what could be considered the trigger for the global unrest. It began several months ago when a world hero by the name of [Miracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4esenx/miracle/) seemingly lost his mind and [attacked Nigeria](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4gb6c6/death_came_for_us_all/) under the guise of helping handle revolutionary forces that formed before attempting to depopulate the area at the very least. He would eventually be killed during the initial attack by the combined forces of [Steven Kirkman](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/50ddvo/steven_kirkman/), [Plasma](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/55m0nt/ponyboy_edited/), and [Steadfast](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4ezv0l/galen_meister_steadfast/), much to the chagrin of [Captain 506](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4ddviy/captian_506/) and the [Astra Society](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4ggyyh/the_astra_society/). World reaction to this was shock and despair over such a famous hero losing their mind and being cut down so unceremoniously by the trio, however no further action really came of it aside from the Astra Society using it as a jumping off point for experimentation and examination of Miracle's body in hopes of using its abilities for their own gains, though that is not public information.

 * Though it was not connected to the Miracle Incident, about two months ago a [new figure](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4z6eys/the_knight_of_judgement_polaris/) emerged on the global scene by [wiping out the warlords in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/50etuz/judgement_in_africa/) though nothing was known of him other than a few key facts gleaned by local sources stating: that he was in fact a he, that he never removed his armor, that he was doing this to help save the innocent from the evil, and that he stayed in the region to help create things like irrigation troughs. The world would go on to dub him as The Knight, but world reaction was split and resulted in several heroes leading a press conference which is important enough to warrant its own section since it is connected to other situations as well. Majorly though, some figures in the world were fine with the idea of allowing superhumans police problem figures in the world, others saw it as a slippery slope of the strong deciding world issues, and some thought that it was merely wrong for superhumans to interfere with human level politics (this is an opinion held more by superhumans than humans).

 * Directly following The Knight's disappearance from Africa, several characters took the opprotunity to force themselves into the region to either claim land or gain control of the [Sinclarium](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4eo6lx/alloy_120_sinclarium/) deposits in the region. One such figure was [a new warlord](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/51kvp6/blood_diamond/) that dominated the Ivory Coast and began [expanding rapidly](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/523cy9/rapid_expansion/) to take control over Africa and rule it the way it should be ruled while also making alliances with other rogues entering the region. He would also be confronted by Astra forces telling Blood Diamond to back down or face Astra's power, though they were rebuffed and possibly leading to some sort of attack from them.

 * One such [rogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/45iowx/jamie_ravinder/) would enter through [South Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/51jdfv/from_one_thief_to_another/) via an army of superhuman level puppets, managing to take over several cities in the country and instating mining operations for the Sinclarium deposits. Some heroes like [Champion](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/46tiy9/chelsea_maynard_champion/) and [Kaarlo](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/45jexi/kaarlo_and_qorena/) would make attempts to reclaim the cities, though Champion needed to pull out to handle another incident related to The Knight and Kaarlo would go on to lose his life due to exposure to toxins. Unexpectedly, the rather unpredictable [Negaihoshi Yuuki](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/47mfam/negaihoshi_yuuki/) was the one to stay the longest and destroy a large amount of the puppets, but did not make any investigation for the enslaved populous and so did not have a part in liberating them.

 * [Another](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/5afu4j/valery_sharpe_resubmit/) would manage to take over [the Meta-Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4kk7fv/the_metaisland_everybody_is_welcome/) and effectively depose it's ruler [Omar](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/51awq2/omar_reworkbuff/). Nothing yet has come of this situation however.

 * In the middle of the Savannah an [Ivory Tower rose from seemingly nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/54q50b/tower_outta_nowhere/), an act caused by [Lysander](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4c3ohw/lysander_the_great/) which led to several magic users being attracted to the site from around the world. However, there has been very little international recognition of this incident because of the menagerie of other things happening.

 * Overall, the world reaction to the events in Africa had been initially sharp, but after repeated incidents, less attention had been drawn to the situations there. Blood Diamond and his cohorts continue to spread their control across the continent though. The territory held by the puppets is growing northward while the territory controlled by Blood Diamond has spread southward due to the difficulties that would arise from trying to travel through the Saharan Desert.

* New York City

 * Also several months ago, New York City would find itself the target of [attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4gakbj/changing_of_the_guard/) by a [shadowy figure](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/45nqck/lilith_amari_the_queen_of_the_night/), which is described aptly enough [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4k4v8u/the_aftermath_of_new_york/). The world reacted with shock over the situation and admiration for the heroes involve. Following it, celebrity hero [Tatom Alucen](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4g5ycr/tatom_zinnia_alucen/) with the help of [Tori Jamieson](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4ja8gj/tori_jamieson/) organized a [benefit dance](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4l48u8/needing_to_do_something_to_help/) in order to return a sense of normalcy to things.

 * While rebuilding efforts were underway in New York City, [a soldier of whim](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4mki1w/oracle/) went on an [operation](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/55xnj6/back_in_business/) to take down the Nanomachine Services for New York City leading to a citywide malfunctioning and subsequent disabling of the nanites through the city. This caused rebuilding efforts for the Empire State Building to be reversed by an unintended dismantling by the nanites and several parts of the infrastructure was similarly dismantled in the process. There was also an associated power outage that lead to many of the ailing members of the population to need immediate medical attention and there were many deaths from those unable to make it to the hospitals in time.

 * Roughly a few days later, the historical hero [Olympia](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/568l7m/catherine_graham_olympia/) made a resurgence when she was finally freed from her [chronological snare](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/56a2tn/and_so_she_returned_not_with_a_whisper_but_with_a/) and force herself back into the world stage and reclaim the world from the perceived chaos and evils plaguing it now.

* Chicago

 * Eight months ago, Chicago was attacked by some sort of [towering eldritch abomination](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/45slyq/the_howler_in_the_darkness_takes_on_chicago/) after an attempt to harness its power went wrong. However, due to the combined help of the local and semilocal heroes, the abomination was able to be taken down. From the presence of [Marcus Brandy Smith and his company](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/44uju1/marcus_brandy_smith/), Chicago was able to easily bound back from this incident since there was easily accessible energy to power the repairing nanomachines of the city.

 * About twice as recent as that is the development of Chicago's very own superhero team, [the Lakeside Defenders](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4nos2d/go_team_go/), with the help of Smith Power. While the public does't really know the backstories of the individuals, they were generally made of former Smith Power interns that were enlisted in going to an alternate plane of existence in search of some unidentified power source and many contracted powers along the way.

 * Matching up with the Knight's appearance in Africa, Chicago became the chosen host city for the [Press Conference](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/51f4e2/a_press_conference/) for talks over how the heroic community felt about the incident in Africa, with Tatom Alucen headlining the event. Other individuals at the conference would include Steven Kirkman, who challenged the Knight to a fight; Plasma, who announced his plans to begin constructing centers for training and equipping law enforcement to replace the incompetent heroes; and [Paragon](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4nwtv3/the_paragon_has_arrived/), who announced that she felt that no superhuman should ever take the acts the Knight did while also calling out the supermercenary [Nisha Nakajima](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4d0g3e/nisha_nakajima/) and claiming she would put her in prison for what she had done. The result of their duel left both parties injured and escaping from the scene.

 * As everyone left the city to go and handle the concurrent incidents, Chicago found itself the target of an attack made by a [team](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4rhi1x/the_souless/) of [Necromancers](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4w7lsm/turning_over_in_their_graves/), but the [Lakeside Defenders](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4zmb8u/eternal_slumber/) along with the help of Marcus and [their newest team member](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4dyto1/evander_ansel/) were able to [take down the first of several members](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/52crwi/the_lazy_aftermath/). However, [further members](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/53la03/stretched_thin/) were taken down with a bit less trouble thanks to the help of several outside sources, and eventually [Chicago was saved](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/57emut/the_saviors_of_chicago/) from the zombie threat only to learn that the entire world was threatened by the situation.

* China

 * Roughly at the same time that Chicago had saved itself and Olympia had just been reawakened, a [young man](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/54p93g/lin_zhi_reincarnation_of_lu_bu/) found himself deluded and strengthened to the point that he believed himself to be the proper ruler of China. In order to cement this, he attacked [Shanghai](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/54v06y/big_trouble_in_big_china/) to make the world fear his power and bow to him. He found himself stalled by [Zhong Ru](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/544di4/zhong_ru/) for long enough for Negaihoshi Yuuki to appear on the scene and defeat him. Lin Zhi took Negaihoshi's mercy as a chance to escape and try to grow stronger before trying again. Currently he has not been seen since.

 * At the moment, [Shanghai](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/56o2s7/rebuilding/) is going through a rebuilding period with the help of the many heroes, with Olympia trying to [weed out Lin Zhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/56wmoe/bait_and_switch/) to try and stop him once and for all, but nothing came of it.

* England

 * Nearly about the same time that Meta-Island was hijacked, England found itself as the [target of an attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/52mx4p/attack_on_big_ben/) by the Unvoiced and spearheaded by [Nemesis of Existence](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/44rmqf/nemesis_of_existence/). [Charles Hilderbrand](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4aqvww/charles_hilderbrand_eye_of_the_order/) was able to take down the Nemesis of Existence though through a combination of his powerful artifact and the Nemesis' arrogance. Unfortunately, the attack led to the destruction of several blocks of Westminster and Big Ben, as well as many many deaths across England.

There are several other events that are currently in their wrapping up stages, like [Purging](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/53i3m1/purging/) and [Drink All My Blood](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/59kl7t/drink_all_my_blood/), which will also have effects on the world. There are some other incidents but either I didn't know enough about them to include them or I just did not see them at the time of making this. Please tell me if there is anything I have missed or wrongly interpreted.

Also, some of these do not have proper aftermaths yet, which I and the modteam will be trying to work out with the users involved to try and reach a conclusion to them and see how the world is being affected by it."

Does anyone of good European countries (preferably in west) where you can get a work visa without a degree.

I am a software developer. I even had companies reached me earlier because they were interested in hiring me. But I never finished college and have combined experience of ~1.5 year (several internships in last few 2-3 year).

So I don't think I can either match the 10 year work experience requirement either"
5bg2fg,5,2016-11-06,Should I be concerned about my workplace?,Jumajuce,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5bg2fg/should_i_be_concerned_about_my_workplace/,"I need some advice whether this sounds concerning or not

I'm the head of maintenance at an assisted living home, and lately I've been feeling like the director is looking for a reason to fire me. It's fairly difficult to screw up a maintenance job when you know what your doing but the director keeps finding things to complain about even if they aren't realistic. For example, I had to repaint a two bedroom apartment where I was only given three days notice that we had a move in and it needed to be fixed up. The average time to paint and apartment of that size for two people including setup and cleanup is three days, it took me four by myself due to also having to complete my normal work since we have a policy to fix maintenance orders within 24 hours. Her issue was that apparently I worked too slow and she was disappointed that I didn't have it done sooner. Again, I was only given a few days notice beforehand and two of those days were Saturday and Sunday which I came in to work on.

There was another apartment last week where they wanted painted where I got a text at 9 at night on Sunday that my director wanted another apartment painted by Tuesday afternoon for a move in.

Another issue they found was that the contractors for flooring installation (that I recommended we do not use) would show up late and leave early and wouldn't tell me a time for when they would be back. She said it was up to me to control them (after the fact) but I had no part in dealing with them at any other time and she set it all up.

There was also an issue of a bunch of maintenance issues slipping by that I knew nothing about and she asked why I wasn't getting to them. The problem turned out to be that instead of people filling out the maintenance forms and putting them in my box up front they'd come up to me in the hallways while I'm holding an 8ft ladder and a tool box and juggling 10 other tasks I need to do before lunch and ask me to do something. When I'd tell then they need to submit a form they'd say ok and not do it.

There's been multiple occasions where the office staff and the director would be talking to me and just say how much they wish the previous maintenance guy never quite. They've gone through 7 maintenance people in the last 3 years and I'm starting to see why they have such a high turnover rate.

She also was annoyed that I only came in for half my weekend to work one time instead of the whole weekend. She said apparently I'm not as driven as she thought I was. This was after a no notice call on a Saturday afternoon, apparently being on call to them means I'm not supposed to leave the town and I don't require any notice for non-emergencies.

The other day I was suddenly called down to the directors office (no explanation, no surprise). When I arrived every other manager was sitting inside and they immediately started asking questions that were very vague.

""We're you in [room number] with [housekeeping staff]?""

""Yes, I assembled the carpet machine for her and wanted to make sure it worked correctly and the sewage issue was cleaned up.""

""That's not your department so why did you have to go?""

""You had me clean the last sewage issue because the housekeeping staff didn't want to so I wanted to make sure it was done correctly and I didn't have to stop painting again to clean it up.""

""Were you alone in the room together?""

""No, there was a CNA in the room for most of the time then she left and [one of the managers that was in the room asking questions] came in. I was in the room for less than two minutes total.""

""[Other manager] says you were alone with her.""

""If you think something inappropriate was taking place I can assure y-""

""Oh, no no no, we just need to know if you saw [housekeeper] on her phone at all?""

So they made me think I was being accused of sexual misconduct in order to find out if a coworker was using their phone at work. The part that's almost offensive was I was the last to be told about an issue with the housekeeper and what they were discussing. I'm also a manager and they treat me as if I'm a busboy in the cafeteria. I found out about what was going on from the intern who was apparently higher on the need to know list than me, another manager. Lord knows why the Activities director and the kitchen supervisor were at the meeting questioning me.

This one is my biggest issue and has me kind of worried. The nursing director from my work called and asked me to go to the hardware store then come in yesterday, when I said I wasn't in town they said they'll call someone else, I asked what happened and she said never mind then hung up.

I then texted my boss what was going on and after an hour she said the other person told her that I refused to come in even after they explained it was an emergency and a safety issue. So now my boss is having us both in her office Monday to discuss the ""issue"" because I'm on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week and I should have come in despite not being in town. Apparently giving up my last two weekends and working 3 weeks straight and staying late everyday wasn't enough to warrant a weekend off OR A proper explanation so I can judge whether I needed to come in immediately or if it could water until the next day."
5bh2ik,2,2016-11-06,Singaporean sophomore looking for internships in the States (and prepping for them),bryancresswell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5bh2ik/singaporean_sophomore_looking_for_internships_in/,"I'm a CS sophomore currently studying in Singapore. I'm looking for any advice on international students getting internships in the USA in smaller firms (think SMEs) as well as the Big 4. Most of the companies I've seen on Glassdoor all require work authorization in the US. Plus, I know getting that work visa for their interns is a big turn off for companies. 

Another problem is, my university has a common year where I don't do anything CS related (except a course on Python) for my freshman year. So in my sophomore year I'm currently studying algo and introduction to Java and computer engineering (mods are pre-determined by the school, can't change). We don't have a class on math in computer science so algos are quite hard to grasp. do you guys have any tips on mastering algos and ds questions? I just started on ctci so let's see how that goes. 

I did a simple internship last year at a startup which was focused on web dev/digital marketing/business development (30/40/30%) but now I'm really looking for SWE internships as this is my intended career path

TL;DR: I appreciate any advice on applying for internships in the states!

5bh2j3,6,2016-11-06,Does/should Oliver (or Nate) know about Murder Night 1?,LoveYouDarling,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/5bh2j3/doesshould_oliver_or_nate_know_about_murder_night/,"The title says it all. Do you think that either Oliver or Nate secretly knows about the first murder night, and if they don't, do you think it would be advantageous to clue them in?

Personally, I don't think it would be good for anyone to tell Nate. He's got an vendetta against Annalise anyway, and he already took the fall for the crime, so I don't think he would appreciate learning that he was the collateral damage for Annalise's interns. He'd probably turn them in in seconds.

It probably wouldn't be a good idea to tell Oliver, objectively speaking, but it probably needs to happen or Coliver isn't going to have a shot in hell. Otherwise, Connor would keep lying or have some mondo meltdown and the relationship would cannibalize itself. Plus, it would be deliciously ironic-Oliver is obsessed with being ""bad"" like his boyfriend, but he has no idea what being bad like Connor really means.

Thoughts?"

* Cruised through school, took Cs, learned almost nothing, no internships, took low-paying dev job after graduation. 

Fast forward one year: I've gained a lot of experience and now I'm getting contacted by recruiters at large companies and have friends who can refer me as well. I recently had a call with a well-known social media company, mentioned I had a lot going on, and asked to interview in February, which they said would work. That gives me a concrete goal to work towards. Now here's the problem:

* I suck at DS/Algo. Couldn't tell you how to implement a LL, don't know what a Heap is, don't know how to implement the different sorts at this moment. 

* My strongest language is PHP; I've forgotten my Java since school. I don't want to interview in PHP, I'd like to learn Python so I'm doing practice problems to learn the syntax but it's just an extra hurdle. 

I picked up a copy of the Algorithm Design Manual to read on my commute, ordered CtCI, and I'm trying to do problems on leetcode but I'm really struggling. I feel like 4 months is enough if I can be efficient with my preparing, but it all feels quite overwhelming at the moment. So my question is: 

* If you were in my position right now, with my (lack of) knowledge, and had 4 months -- what would be your study plan? 

Say I can allocate one hour per day to studying: do I start with the design manual cover to cover before doing anything else? Watch videos on Data Structures? Just tackle practice problems until I'm blue in the face? I feel like I'm trying to kind of touch everything at once and I'm floundering. Any advice, or someone to just sort of lay out a proper plan would be extremely helpful right now. "
5bheor,13,2016-11-06,Today I turned 22.,bdaythrowaway-22,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/5bheor/today_i_turned_22/,"And it's honestly been such a letdown so far.

I'm a senior in college and I'm slowly losing a lot of my friends. Either they have graduated already and moved away, or we're just drifting apart. The politics of who to invite out to celebrate was exhausting because some of my friends don't like each other, so I decided to invite what remains of my main friend group out for a drink tonight. Most agreed to it initially, but now only 2 can actually come. My best friend said he will try to leave work an hour early and make it, but of course it's not a guarantee. I wasn't trying to have a big celebration or anything since I have a lot going on this coming week, and 22 isn't really special anyway, but I still kind of wish more people would come. I feel so much pressure to have fun on my birthday, especially since it's my last college birthday, but the curse of having an early November birthday means that everyone is busy with midterms or work. 

I've been in love with this girl for ages, but she's still super pissed at me because of a stupid thing I did a few weeks ago and therefore refuses to see me. I have regretted that moment every day since, but an apology only goes so far and I can't change what happened. She made up a blatant excuse to avoid coming out with me tonight. If I even get a ""happy birthday"" text from her today, it would be huge.

But on a different note, being 22 forces me to confront something that scares the shit out of me. College is almost over, and it was absolutely in no way ""the best time of my life."" It would be the worst if my childhood hadn't been so fucking awful.  I have spent every day for the past 3 years drowning in work and anxiety because my family is poor and the only way I could even go to school was to keep this academic scholarship. I felt overwhelming guilt and fear any day that I did not study for at least a few hours.

Even as much as I hated college, I'm afraid about graduating. Jobs aren't responding to me, even though I have high grades from a good school and internship experience. My friend, who is in the same major as me, gets final round interviews for every job he applies to. He will probably have 3 offers to pick from in a few weeks. And I yet, I don't even get rejection emails. But it's imperative that I have a job by graduation because I do not have the option of moving in with my family. I mean that neither one of my parents literally have space for me at their new homes, and there are no jobs there. Plus, I get massively depressed when I even visit my hometown. I stayed there for the whole summer between sophomore and junior year and I was honestly suicidal by the end. I will do *anything* in the world to not go back there after college. Turning 22 forces me to confront that I only have 6 months left to find something, and that's terrifying. 

My dad told me last year that life after 21 is a steaming pile of bullshit and you're just waiting to die. I dismissed it as him being bitter that he's nearing 50 and hasn't accomplished anything, but now I'm 22 and scared of everything beyond the next 6 months because there's a chance he could be so right."

I've turned 30 a few months ago and still single. Only been in one relationship 4 years ago that lasted 1 year but I wasn't really into her just stuck with it because nobody ever liked me before and I wanted to see what it was like. I have zero friends, have always been an introvert and never understood how to communicate. I'm always the outcast even at networking events people look at me like I don't speak english.

I was bullied through school and all through life people have just pushed me around and taken advantage of me. Even at work I output twice the work of my coworkers yet I'm paid literally half because they know how to stand up for themselves and I'm too scared to say anything and make the same pay as the interns despite 10 years experience. I even have an advanced degree but that got me nowhere. I have the nice-guy syndrome, and reality pains me every day to realize nice guys truly finish last. Not just with work but with relationships.

Girls avoid me like the plague. I think I'm good looking but somehow they just see something wrong with me. I've had 2 dates in the last 4 years and they ghosted immediately after the date. I see lots of ugly people holding hands and I just know I'm better looking and why can't I find something. I feel like I must be majorly deformed or something and just so used to it that I don't notice it when I look in the mirror.

The holidays are always super tough for me and I don't think I can make it through this year. Even if I found someone today, they wouldn't know me enough to want to spend the holiday with me.

I see so many people with true friends, childhood friends with deep connections. That's something I want but I'm way too old to ever get that. Even if I find a couple friends, they'll never bond to me like their childhood friends.

Mostly I just want a relationship. I'm 30 and look 20. So 20 year olds don't want me once they find out I'm really 30 and 30 year olds don't want me because I look 20. Also it seems everyone over 25 is already married or had been engaged or have children. I feel if I find someone on my same level they would have to be super undesirable. I feel all hope is lost in finding someone desirable for me. Plus if they were desirable then there are so many better guys with tons of money, friends, family. I have nothing to offer anyone.

I don't even enjoy any activities anymore. I used to enjoy a bunch of things but gave them all up. Like fishing and hiking but they were all solo activities and I'm tired of being isolated."

I was able to find a temporary internship in Madrid, but the company I was working for was unable to make my final payment before I left the country and I had to leave about $600 sitting in the account. I had originally planned on returning to Spain within a year or so, but things being what they were, I never made it back and the money was left in the account.

In the wake of the 2009 financial collapse, Banesto was bought by Santender, and now I am back in Spain and wondering if I will still have access to my money. The things I have read say that a bank can never just cancel an account and keep the money, but I am not sure how to go about getting the account back from Santender. 

I have my old Banesto bank booklet as proof of the account. Will I need anything more than this to reclaim the account? I am also in a different part of Spain than where the account was opened, will this be a problem? Can anyone give me suggestions on how best to go about reclaiming my bank account and recovering my lost paycheck?

5bhjt4,0,2016-11-06,Haas Business and EECS Double Major as a CC transfer?,sprezzaturian1,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5bhjt4/haas_business_and_eecs_double_major_as_a_cc/,"Hi everyone, I am currently a Community College student in California who will be applying to UCB and Haas as a Business Major this Fall. I will have all of my prerequisites and Breadth Courses finished and have a competitive 4.0 GPA. I also have an internship in Private Wealth Management that I did this Summer. 

Since starting at community college my goal was to get into Haas and pursue finance. More recently, I have been taking a couple of computer science classes for fun and have really developed a passion for it. I have also been learning more about EE and am interested in that as well. It has gotten to the point where I am considering staying one more year at my community college and re-applying next Fall so I could complete the lower division coursework for EECS and declaring it as my minor once transferring, with the intent of declaring it as a second major afterwards. I have spoken to both L&amp;S Admissions and Haas Admissions over the phone and received some contradictory advice. I know each school kind of runs as its own bureaucracy and has its own rules and flexibilities. I'm calling an EECS Advisor to get their opinion tomorrow but in the meantime, I wanted to hear what UCB students think.

Apparently they will only accept 70 max units to transfer, (I will have ~110 if I stay one more year at my CC), but from my understanding even units above the 70 can be used to satisfy prerequisites for both majors. I also understand that they grant you 5 semesters to complete both majors. Is what I want to do even possible? Since I am not at Berkeley yet and live in Los Angeles, it is hard to be able to know if I could even organize the upper division classes so that I could graduate on time.

Thanks for the help/advice. I know that I am super lucky just to even have a chance at Haas, but I really feel like I would be missing out if I didn't also pursue my passions in CS and EE. Regardless, I am applying to Haas this Fall to see if I can get in, but in the meantime, I am planning on staying another year at CC with the intent of double majoring if possible. Since another year at CC will have a big opportunity cost, I want to be sure I can pull this off and see if it is worth it. I could of course just minor in EECS, though I don't know if it is worth all the effort just for a minor."

Are there any other tutorials that are similarly structured to the 30 days on hacker rank? Self learning is fun but definitely difficult to figure out a plan on where to go and how long I should wait before even applying for an internship. Some friends of mine recommended me doing web development since jobs are a plenty there. However it doesn't seem like it would be as fun as software/game development.

If anyone is willing to help guide me I'd greatly appreciate it. So far everything I've done has been very fun! Can't wait to start a project but I always feel like I'm not ready yet.

Please read the entire post to get a good idea of what went down. Thank you.

We first met in high school senior year and things went really well, I was 17 at the time. She was my first serious relationship and I was hers. We instantly clicked and fell in love. After a year we got into a huge argument over my friends I thought taking a break would be good for both of us. We never stopped talking and kept our relationship a secret from our friends and family for the next 6 months. We didn't want our friends to get in the way this time.

She told me she couldn’t go through something like that again and made me promise never to leave her again. I promised and we got back together. Things went great and eventually we told our friends and she told her family. I made a stupid mistake by not telling my family the second time because I thought my parents didn't like her because of comments they said post breakup like “Don’t be sad, you can do better!”. I told her that I wasn't ready to tell my family yet. She was very supportive and the next few months were amazing. We started to get really busy with assignments and work. We both worked part-time at the same retail store, but our managers wouldn’t schedule us together, which made it very difficult to spend time together. We started to drift further and further apart and missed spending time together. 

Eventually she got fed up with the fact that she couldn't come over my house and she was beginning to think I was embarrassed of her (which wasn't true). We started getting in fights all the time about how I kept her a secret. I started smoking a lot of weed with my friends and it took over my life. She accepted my smoking habits even though she was against it. My friends and I would smoke in some pretty sketchy places since its illegal here and I didn’t want to put her into an uncomfortable situation so I never invited her to tag along. Basically, I chose weed over her, I would hang out with my friends over her. We only got the opportunity to hang out 2-3 times a month and for the most part we communicated through text and phone calls.

Then summer came, she decided to take summer school and took a pretty heavy course load and I started a full-time internship. She was always busy in the evenings to go out and I still hadn’t told my family about her. I started developing an App in my spare time and started going to the gym and as a result I got really busy. We got into so many fights because of our conflicting schedules. We made an agreement to make more time for each other, we were both going to stop working Saturdays. But at this point I was so fed up with my relationship and I started to act like a shitty boyfriend. Regardless, she fought for our relationship time after time and refused to give up on me. She kept begging me to tell my family but again I refused because things weren't getting better. My friends started to push me to break up with her because they could see I wasn’t happy. She was the only girl I’ve ever been with and I thought there was someone better for me out there because of all the fighting.

So one day I randomly decided to end things with her. I felt good about it at first, I was happy that all the stress was gone and I could finally do what I wanted. I knew I still loved her and I would probably go back to her, but I wanted to be alone for a while. This is a common problem for me, I tend to run away from my problems to gather my thoughts alone. I was really lonely and so after 1 week I texted her to see how she was doing, she told me she still loved me and said that she was completely blindsided by my decision to end the relationship just because life got busy and our relationship got difficult. She was pissed that I never told my family and stressed if I did, things would be different. She had been begging me for almost a year to do so. A week later I texted her but she said she couldn’t be my friend because of how hurt she was. I proceeded to telling her that I wanted her back.

We agreed to meet me that night and talk, we met up and we talked it out. The next day I texted her and she told me “I’m not saying no forever, but for right now I think we need time apart. We need to recover from this as separate people and need to think about what we really want. I don’t believe 3 weeks is enough time for you to change”. I said something really stupid at this point, I told her that if I couldn’t have her I would start looking for someone else because I was lonely. I didn’t mean it and I just wanted her back but I didn’t want to wait. She was pissed and asked me for space but I clearly didn’t understand the meaning of that and I continued to try and talk to her. I begged for her back. This went on for about a week. Eventually she started ignoring me completely. Thinking back, I was coming off as desperate, which is extremely unattractive, but I wanted to show her how badly I wanted this. 2 weeks later we both happened to be going to the same nightclub for a mutual friend’s birthday, I tried to talk to her and she refused and I basically created a scene because I saw another guy talking to her. I apologized the next day but she ignored my message. I decided to follow the NC rule and went ghost for a month.

I took the time to truly think about what I wanted, I was finally single and I was free to do whatever I wanted. I had many opportunities to hook up with other girls but I turned them all down because I was still in love with my ex-girlfriend. I’m an incredibly loyal man and I didn’t want anyone else. I came to realize how much I truly loved her and that I had just lost the love of my life. I knew I wanted her back and I was determined to do whatever it took to get her back. I realized that if I ever wanted another shot I would have to make some changes to my life. I stopped smoking weed, took time off from work, stopped working on an App side project and admitted to my family that I had hid her from them. I’m now very open with my feelings as before I would hide them. I learned how to stand up for myself in front of my friends and finally didn’t have the thought that there was someone better for me out there. In addition, I reflected on many of the mistakes I made during the relationship to ensure they wouldn’t happen again.

After NC was up, I sent flowers and an album of pictures we had taken together over the years. I waited 2 weeks hoping for a reply but I didn’t get one. I decided to text her and explain all the changes I made to my life and that we could be really happy together if she would give me another chance. She replied “Thank you for the flowers, but you shouldn’t have sent them. It’s good to see that you’ve grown and matured. Nevertheless, I believe its best we stay apart. Best of luck with everything”. I asked her if she still loved me and asked if we would ever have a chance in the future but she ignored me. A couple of days went by and then I sent a rude message along the lines of “You’re making a huge mistake and you’ll regret it. I’m an amazing guy but if you can’t see that it’s your loss. Chances are the next guy will end up cheating on you like what happened to all of your friends” (She was always afraid of getting cheated on because it happened to her best friends). She didn’t answer and later that day she blocked me on all social media. The next day I sent the following message, “I’m sorry what I said, I only said those things because I was upset I was losing the love of my life. I’ve learned a lot from our relationship and you’ve had such a positive influence on my life. You’re an amazing woman and anybody would be lucky to call her their girlfriend, including myself. Maybe I will have that pleasure again one day. Please take care of yourself”. No reply. (BTW she didn’t block my number because we use iMessage and the messages were delivered)

1 month later (now the present) I heard from a mutual friend that the night that we were at the nightclub together, she got really pissed off because I was “cock-blocking” her and a guy. My friend also told me that a month ago she was talking to some guy from our work (who was also going through a breakup) because I used to have a crush on a girl that worked there (maybe for revenge? Idk). Furthermore, my friend told me that my ex-girlfriend was just talking to these guys friendly and wasn’t looking for a relationship and just wanted to be single. I don’t know what to think about this, we’re not dating but I didn’t think she could move on this quickly (This came just 2-3 weeks after she told me she still had feelings for me). Moreover, my friend told me that she said “I hope he’s doing well”. When my friend told her that I still missed her she said “Yeah, I highly doubt that”. I know it’s not much but does this mean I have a chance?

I love this girl so much, she’s everything to me. She’s smart, thoughtful, compassionate, and beautiful. We both shared the same life goals and she’s the girl I wanted to marry and start a family with. She does however require a lot of affection and I try my best to give her that but I’m not the best at it. She’s super religious and she told me that she wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, I was okay waiting but eventually we lost our virginity to each other after 1 year. After we did it, she cried and told me that I better not leave her. Well… I left her, not once but twice. I feel awful, and I understand why she doesn’t want me back. I made a promise and I broke it. How is she supposed to trust that I won’t do it again? She’s obviously looking for stability and clearly I couldn’t provide that.

After going through months of depression and many sleepless nights, I’m starting to recover. I’ve been able to sleep again for the last month. I still think about her and I really want another chance to prove to her that I’ve changed. I’m honestly a good guy. I’m smart, honest, loyal, hardworking and compassionate. I admit, I’m not perfect and made some pretty stupid mistakes, this was my first relationship afterall. This breakup was definitely a lot harder on me than the first time we broke up and has allowed me to do a lot of reflecting. I think it’s because we never stopped talking when we broke up the first time and so I never really changed/learned. I took her for granted and I didn’t always treat her right. I didn’t communicate very well and I let my feelings build up and come out all at once. In addition, I’ve always run away from my problems and would deal with them later, it’s a horrible quality which I’m desperately trying to improve on. I’m also very shy and lack the confidence to talk to new people (especially women). I’m not lonely but I definitely miss having someone to confide in.

My current plan is to continue to improve myself and work on my confidence. I’m going to let things cool off and re-evaluate my feelings for her in the New Year. I’m definitely not looking for another relationship until I’ve fully recovered from this one. I also know that neither of us will be able to consider a relationship with each other again if any of us has been with someone else. We talked about this during our relationship and as a result, I’m scared to move on and try new relationships. If you decide to reply, please mention in the comments that you've read the entire post. I can't depend on advice from people who don't know the whole story.
•	Do you guys think there is any chance of giving this relationship another go? If so what do you think should be my course of action?
•	In the past, I thought there was someone better for me out there. I think it’s because we had a rough 6 months. She was the only girl I’ve ever been and so I have nothing to compare my relationship to. I’m scared that if I do manage to get back together with her one day that the feelings will come back. The problem is that if I move on and try new relationships to ease my mind, I will never get another opportunity to be with this amazing woman. What do you guys think?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Dated for over a year and then we took a break, when we got back together she made me promise to never leave her again. I promised. Fast forward until now, life got really busy between school and my internship and I started smoking a lot of weed (I’ve quit after we broke up). I broke up with her again and now she won’t take me back. She asked for space but I didn’t give it to her and I begged for her back. Now she’s completely ignoring me. I've made some big changes in my life to better myself and I think we can really make this work. I love her. Yesterday (1 month from when I last messaged her), her friend told me that she ""hopes I'm doing well"" and ""seriously doubts that I miss her"". What does this mean? Is there any chance of fixing this? If so, how?"

5bi6mb,3,2016-11-06,[F4M] The Intern,intheofficefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5bi6mb/f4m_the_intern/,"I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom). 

There will be a fair amount of build-up here, lots of flirting and what not, but make sure your character doesn't come off too strong. I expect a lot of detail, and I will tell you if you do not provide enough. I would like consistency with that detail as well.

I've approximately 480 little creatures of joy, and I'm selling each one for $20.00. You must buy all 480, though. It is a collection (not an auction)... They are very respectful and amicable with one another, and they are (for the most part) cat and dog friendly. Some are sassier than others, naturally. Please let me know! My parents can't find out.

Finally....  This email was sent to announcements@law.georgetown because even though it's coded it still cannot be risked to be sent directly to the buyer/person it was intended for.

So it was sent to the announcements mailing list of Georgetown University, of which JOHN PODESTA is on the mailing list for!!!  That's why this is in his mailbox.

If this is indeed the case, it points to this network having already infiltrated colleges and other state institutions in order to send shit like this via generic newsletters, bulletins etc.   So that only the people who know the codes or are expecting it will know to respond.

EDIT:  HI CTR!   

EDIT 2:  HOLY SHIT THANK YOU /u/gregorio74 FOR DOING THIS AMAZING BIT OF INVESTIGATING.  

Alright, so I determined who this Peter Mattingly guy is. He worked for the Georgetown University Law Center from August 2014 - December 2014 as an Intern Investigator. His experience in this position was as follows:  

""Investigated criminal cases—including sexual and physical assault, prostitution, drug possession, theft, unlawful entry, and weapon offenses—in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia on behalf of the defense. Spoke with clients and attorneys to develop a defense theory; canvassed and photographed crime scene areas for evidence; located and took detailed statements from witnesses in the field, as well as interviewed and subpoenaed expert and defense witnesses for trial.""  

He then worked for Georgetown Univesity Law Center from June 2015-October 2016 as a Clinic Manager. He oversaw the criminal clinics' secure legal database, among other responsibilities. He is currently a student at Georgetown University pursuing a certificate in Data Science.  

https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-mattingly-983048127  

He is currently listed as an Office Manager in the Georgetown University Student Services Guide with a phone number ending in x9599 (page 7)

https://www.law.georgetown.edu/campus-services/registrar/handbook/upload/Student_Services_Quick_Guide.pdf  

 

He sent the email in question on June 30, 2015. The picture he attached is of the Beanie Baby collection he is attempting to sell. Upon searching the Internet for this picture, you find that the earliest appearance of this picture shows up on the Twitter timeline of ""Jeffry Hipp"" on October 9, 2013. Jeffry also references his Beanie Baby collection in another tweet on the same day.  

https://twitter.com/darealhippstah/status/387952304034304000 https://twitter.com/darealhippstah/status/388023752887267328  

The picture also shows up a few times on Pintrest and in a few articles online such as this one:

http://guff.com/awesome-things-90s-kids-loved-to-collect  

I think it's clear that the collection in that picture does not belong to Peter Mattingly.  

 

OP has pointed out how strange his wording of the email was, and I agree. Who is going to buy these things as an entire collection for almost $10k when almost all Beanie Babies are relatively worthless? Why list them as $20 each when they all have varying values and you aren't selling them individually anyway? OP is right, it is a way to advertise something else and ensure that nobody responds except those that know what he is actually selling.  

 

Oh, and I almost forgot the most important part. He worked at a Pizza place for four years while doing all of this from February 2012-February 2016.  "

I'm in a classroom that I love right now, but it has been a lot of work between unmotivated students and a lot of behavioral issues. On top of that I have a lot of anxiety about my internship next semester, some mental health problems, and just being a self sufficient adult after graduation. 

As a result of this, I'm failing one of my non education classes and the work in my education classes is not where it should be at. I know I'm getting burnt out already. The most important thing to me is that I'm providing quality instruction and developing quality relationships with my students. If I were to go into student teaching next semester I know it will get worse. 

I've talked with my parents extensively and done a lot of reflection on the topic. My parents don't understand why I don't want to do student teaching next year and I've tried so hard to explain it to them. The best thing that I can think of for me right now is to fix some of my grades and step away from teaching for a semester and come back to it next year. 

The thing I'm looking for advice on is the best way to help my parents understand. Also, what should I do next semester so I still learn and grow as an educator without furthering my burnout.

TLDR: I'm not doing student teaching next semester to avoid burning out completely. My parents don't understand why I won't just go into student teaching. I'd like advice on helping them understand and how I could still practice teaching skills without furthering my problems."

A little bit of background: I'm a junior undergrad studying electrical engineering and CS. I haven't really had an internship at a big name company yet unlike some of my other CS friends. Because of this, I started the hunt for internships really early this year and worked relentlessly to get an offer from a respectable company.

Whenever I had spare time I would be on Leetcode or CTCI, I stopped exercising to have more time to practice, I made excuses to avoid going out or socializing too often, and I feel that I put my mental health at risk. Failed interviews crushed me to the point where I didn't want to talk or move. I tend to have an obsessive personality and can get fixated on a particular goal very easily.

Fortunately, I was lucky enough to get a few offers, and I will be interning in the Spring and Summer with two well-known companies.

The thing is, getting these offers made me happy for a couple of days, but then I became sad again. I had to reject one offer in order to accommodate the other two, and I was flooded with regret. I still keep wondering whether I made the right choice, and seem to continue to come up with reasons for why I didn't, even though I have no control over that now.

I seem to never be satisfied with myself, even though me-from-6-months-ago would have been so impressed with where me-from-today is. Sometimes I think this is a good thing, that I'm always motivated to improve and do better. But sometimes I fear that it's damaging and unsustainable. I think it stems from the fact that the tech industry is so competitive and there are always others who seem more impressive, but it could also be a personal thing.

I know this is a longish post but I want to get a sense of what others feel? Is this common in the tech industry or even in general? Is it something I should work on improving?"

I'm the head of maintenance at an assisted living home, and lately I've been feeling like the director is looking for a reason to fire me. It's fairly difficult to screw up a maintenance job when you know what your doing but the director keeps finding things to complain about even if they aren't realistic. For example, I had to repaint a two bedroom apartment where I was only given three days notice that we had a move in and it needed to be fixed up. The average time to paint and apartment of that size for two people including setup and cleanup is three days, it took me four by myself due to also having to complete my normal work since we have a policy to fix maintenance orders within 24 hours. Her issue was that apparently I worked too slow and she was disappointed that I didn't have it done sooner. Again, I was only given a few days notice beforehand and two of those days were Saturday and Sunday which I came in to work on.

There was another apartment last week where they wanted painted where I got a text at 9 at night on Sunday that my director wanted another apartment painted by Tuesday afternoon for a move in.

Another issue they found was that the contractors for flooring installation (that I recommended we do not use) would show up late and leave early and wouldn't tell me a time for when they would be back. She said it was up to me to control them (after the fact) but I had no part in dealing with them at any other time and she set it all up.

There was also an issue of a bunch of maintenance issues slipping by that I knew nothing about and she asked why I wasn't getting to them. The problem turned out to be that instead of people filling out the maintenance forms and putting them in my box up front they'd come up to me in the hallways while I'm holding an 8ft ladder and a tool box and juggling 10 other tasks I need to do before lunch and ask me to do something. When I'd tell then they need to submit a form they'd say ok and not do it.

There's been multiple occasions where the office staff and the director would be talking to me and just say how much they wish the previous maintenance guy never quite. They've gone through 7 maintenance people in the last 3 years and I'm starting to see why they have such a high turnover rate.

She also was annoyed that I only came in for half my weekend to work one time instead of the whole weekend. She said apparently I'm not as driven as she thought I was. This was after a no notice call on a Saturday afternoon, apparently being on call to them means I'm not supposed to leave the town and I don't require any notice for non-emergencies.

The other day I was suddenly called down to the directors office (no explanation, no surprise). When I arrived every other manager was sitting inside and they immediately started asking questions that were very vague.

""We're you in [room number] with [housekeeping staff]?""

""Yes, I assembled the carpet machine for her and wanted to make sure it worked correctly and the sewage issue was cleaned up.""

""That's not your department so why did you have to go?""

""You had me clean the last sewage issue because the housekeeping staff didn't want to so I wanted to make sure it was done correctly and I didn't have to stop painting again to clean it up.""

""Were you alone in the room together?""

""No, there was a CNA in the room for most of the time then she left and [one of the managers that was in the room asking questions] came in. I was in the room for less than two minutes total.""

""[Other manager] says you were alone with her.""

""If you think something inappropriate was taking place I can assure y-""

""Oh, no no no, we just need to know if you saw [housekeeper] on her phone at all?""

So they made me think I was being accused of sexual misconduct in order to find out if a coworker was using their phone at work. The part that's almost offensive was I was the last to be told about an issue with the housekeeper and what they were discussing. I'm also a manager and they treat me as if I'm a busboy in the cafeteria. I found out about what was going on from the intern who was apparently higher on the need to know list than me, another manager. Lord knows why the Activities director and the kitchen supervisor were at the meeting questioning me.

This one is my biggest issue and has me kind of worried. The nursing director from my work called and asked me to go to the hardware store then come in yesterday, when I said I wasn't in town they said they'll call someone else, I asked what happened and she said never mind then hung up.

I then texted my boss what was going on and after an hour she said the other person told her that I refused to come in even after they explained it was an emergency and a safety issue. So now my boss is having us both in her office Monday to discuss the ""issue"" because I'm on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week and I should have come in despite not being in town. Apparently giving up my last two weekends and working 3 weeks straight and staying late everyday wasn't enough to warrant a weekend off OR A proper explanation so I can judge whether I needed to come in immediately or if it could water until the next day.

I'm worried about the meeting I need to have now with my director and the head of nursing as they know each other well and it appears to be a my word against hers type of meeting. What should I know to protect myself in case of being terminated?"

Storytime


So I started this retail job about two months ago, it's my second job, I'm about to leave a different retail store I've been at for 3 years. This store is small, but corporate owned with about 8 locations nationwide.

Anyways, I go in for my shift this past Saturday, and some of corporate is visiting and I shake hands with the company's marketing manager. 

I ask her how she likes being a marketing manager and give her my little elevator speech. She then tells me to contact her if I ever need an internship as they would love to get someone that already works for the company (district manager told me they like to promote from within). Small talk happens as they purchase a couple items, and they leave. 

My problem :

Is this a good time to just email her and ask for the internship? I feel a bit under qualified but feel like I could learn a ton in the field. What should I do? I'm definitely going to send her a follow up email, but have no idea what I should say. 

Any tips reddit?"

E-board (teacher) for my schools’ MAO, historian of our Latin club, and co- leader of our robotics team. I’m also of my school’s STEM, Beta, and Chemistry club, and our state’s Math Circle. 
I’m also teaching myself how to code since I have no experience whatsoever, starting off with Python and then C++ and Java if I can pull through. This is purely just to be familiar with programming before college.

Unis:
My dream schools are Stanford or MIT, for obvious reasons (I love Stanford’s startup culture and MIT’s proud nerdy atmosphere). After that, I don’t really know where to apply except my state school since it has a highly competitive MD-PhD program that gets you into the medical workforce 2-3 years early.

Feeling alone.,throwawaymorose,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/5bklkt/second_abortion_upcoming_feeling_alone/,"My first was age 21, with an abusive ex, we had no money, no jobs, no parental support. I didn't want to be a mom at the time, and it was an ""easy"" decision.


Now I'm 32. The biological clock has kicked in for the last few years, I know I don't have many years left to optimize safe childbearing, but I've been very torn about it. It was just never ""the right time"" to have kids (feeling like I haven't gotten to ""live my life"" yet, still never had a real job, never been financially stable enough to do all the things ""normal"" people seem to do, my career is on track to begin in 2 years). At the same time, the last few years I've been seeing kids and I just...want one. I've been dating my current bf for 4 years. The relationship has been great. He's emotionally stable, from a good family, loving, caring, supportive, and on track to make a decent income that could (probably) easily support me and a child. I love him a great deal. I think we'll probably end up together. But he's 2 years younger than I am and has shown no desire to have children. Every time I've brought up the question he always says ""not now, maybe in the future."" If I press, he answers with ""I don't know, we'll figure it out later.""


I just found out I'm pregnant yesterday. It has been an incredibly stressful few months in my life (last stretch of grad school), and I misunderstood all the early signs as stress reactions. Missed periods, general fatigue/malaise, tearfulness/mood swings, break-outs, etc. It wasn't until the last few weeks when my breasts started hurting that I knew something was off. But I had so many deadlines, I just couldn't imagine dealing with a possible pregnancy, so I ignore it. Plus, I've been on the pill, and we haven't been having sex frequently because we're currently long-distance (grad schools in neighboring states). When I found out, I told him, and he immediately told me to call Planned Parenthood and to schedule an abortion. I don't even know how far along I am. I asked him if he would want to keep it at all, and he said now isn't the time. I also have been treating my body like crap the last couple months because I've just been too stressed to care. Been eating terribly, drinking lots of caffeine, taking lots of nicotine (vape), etc. He said if we decide to have a kid in the future, we would do it right from the beginning. Have everything all planned. Have a house, have savings, etc. Everything he said made sense. I agreed and made an appointment for next week.


But I feel terrible. I've been burying my feelings because he doesn't seem concerned. When I tried to talk to him, he said ""it'll be OK, you'll feel better later."" His approach towards this has 100% been ""let's solve this problem."" I have nobody to talk to. I know it most likely isn't fully formed yet, and has no consciousness, and can't think, etc., but I'm terrified of seeing the ultrasound. I'm terrified that the full realization that this is OUR CHILD will hit me. Not just mine, but HIS too, and I can't wrap my head around killing a life that is a part of him. I don't even know how to make sense of my feelings, and don't feel like I have a safe, understanding space to talk about this. The worst thing is, I feel like I have to keep ignoring these feelings because I still have deadlines, my supervisors still expect me to show up 4 days a week and perform, turn in all my shit on time, if I fail a class right now I'll have to stay another year and delay my career another year, I'm applying to internships RIGHT NOW and that is a huge move towards finally having a career. But all I can think about since yesterday is this upcoming abortion. This life that is in me right now that I will have to briefly look at and acknowledge before it's gone. This life that could potentially grow up into a child, a person who will look like us and be molded and shaped by us together. I feel so terrible, and so alone in this. I keep having irrational thoughts that I want to die, I don't deserve to have a child ever, and I want him to break up with me and go live happily ever after with someone better. I can't bring myself to give a shit about all this work I have to do. All my friends will move on to internships and I'll be left behind, and I'm about to kill a potential person made of myself and someone I love, and all I want to do is crawl into bed and never wake up.


I'm not asking for advice per se. I just don't know how to process this, and I just need to say what is going on in my head somewhere."
5bkoos,25,2016-11-07,Why I'm a Bernie supporter voting for Trump,HCC1,POLITIC,https://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/5bkoos/why_im_a_bernie_supporter_voting_for_trump/,"On the eve of the historic, 2016 US Presidential Election, I have decided that I am supporting the US Republican candidate, Donald Trump. Few figures have conjured so many differences of opinion as Trump and few elections have kindled such fiery passions. But 2016 is one of many turning point years, another 1860, 1876, 1932 or 1973 moment for US politics.

I didn't start off a Trump supporter, but neither did I sway toward any other candidate at first. I respected Bernie Sanders' humility and commitment to his ideals and his honesty about his belief in social democracy. Even though I strongly disagree with the ideas of social democracy and the present statist, anti-freedom of speech, pro-indebtedness, massive spending and over-regulatory progressive movement in the US, I found myself swept by Bernie Sanders' true outsider characteristics and his grass-roots success and I cast a primary ballot in his favor, now making me one of the fabled Sanders supporters switched to the Trump camp.
I am not an ideologue, in fact, I believe in playing the electoral field as a great balancing act of politicians and ideologies. Right now, a vote for Trump is crucial for achieving the balance that we need.

Before I go any further, I will explain the things that I don't like about Trump. Like millions of others, I take issue with his sometimes vulgarian comments, particularly about women, and I have often been frustrated about his ability to become mired in scandal and say uncouth, unplanned things. I am worried about his ability to divide the country if he succeeds on Tuesday, but I'm not particularly worried about the man himself—my principal worry is reactions against him driving a major shift to the left in the 2018 midterm elections.

I believe strongly in the opposition and third-party politics, which is why I have donated to Gary Johnson, Jill Stein and the Trump  campaign. However, I am forced to terminate my personal support for Johnson after Bill Weld's anti-Trump comments endorsing Hillary Clinton. Weld represents the fearful, old money high-society of America who don't understand Trump and often spend more time covering each other's asses rather than staying committed to the cause they supposedly represent.

Win or lose, Trump has built an incredible movement that has brought together people from across the spectrum including Democrats and people who have hardly participated in politics before. It will help to redefine the Republican Party and has already helped to drive out many of the single issue religious voters, wealthy manipulators and manage the socially conservative ex-Southern Democrats switched to Republicanism by Nixon's Southern Strategy.

Trump is wealthy, but he truly is an outsider, chuckled at by old money American aristocrats. In spite of his wealth, he shares that in common with his voter base. Yes, some of Trump's businesses have failed in the past and some of his practices at times may not have been ideal, but the fact is that he is still here today and still solvent. Through tireless hard-work, he has fulfilled the American dream to the max.

In past elections, the Republicans have represented just a slightly different side of the same coin of special interests and big government expansion, bereft of populism and often woefully out of touch with the American people. Trump has exposed the extraordinary corruption and hypocrisy within the Democratic Party, which has fought back through its controlled entities like cable news, Hollywood, pop music, newspapers and universities. For almost two years, these devices of the elite have brayed about Trump as an apocalyptic danger, going so far as to selectively edit his speeches to make them appear menacing, avoiding showing the size of his crowds, fronting innacurate polls, making up increasingly fictitious Trumpian futures and even coordinating with the Clinton campaign to massage quotes.

Then there's Trump's opponent. The unimaginable mental gymnastics being practiced among Clinton supporters is terrifying to watch as millions subscribe to literal propaganda put out by a corrupt media establishment, Middle Eastern kingdoms and major corporations and banks who know that Clinton and the phonies in the Democratic Party are ultimately up for sale.
Clinton is truly unique in that the depth of her corruption is already public knowledge, yet she faces little if any challenge from news agencies fully subscribed to her selection as president. If anyone else committed the kinds of acts that the Clinton camp has carried out, they would go down in US political scandals alongside Nixon and the Tea Pot Dome crowd.

If setting up an illegal home server routing classified information and ignoring warnings about an upcoming attack on the US Embassy in Benghazi were not already grounds for great concern or an indictment, the rap sheet goes on. Hillary Clinton has taken part in insider trading, received massive 'donations' that amount to bribes from every major bank and most Middle Eastern leaders, invented a 'vast right wing conspiracy' to deflect from her husband's exciting pastime of stuffing cigars into intern's vaginas and hoarded classified personnel files to purge the Secret Service and White House staff of anyone who might not be a die-hard Clintonite.

Bill and Hillary have handed out political positions and contracts as favors for their friends and supporters…and we haven't even reached their policies. During Bill’s usurp of the White House, the Clintons averaged out to a self-interested centrism, tracking public opinion polls every morning as they vacillated on their policies to stay in office. After stuffing massive federalization down the American people's throat with an expensive and failed healthcare program, mandatory sentencing and an unnecessary assault weapons ban, the Clinton's lost control of Congress, shutdown the government and managed to blame it on the Republicans. Meanwhile, they squandered federal money and managed to take credit for Kasich's solution to the federal budget deficit and the Children's Healthcare Insurance Program.

The Clintons feared a drop in public approval ratings and completely abandoned George H.W. Bush's UN-approved, coalition building which established the US as a coordinator for global stability rather than the global police. Fearing setbacks at the polls if they put 'boots on the ground,' the Clintons backed out of the Somali peacekeeping mission allowing the country to fall into anarchy, failed to apprehend Osama Bin Laden, failed to end the Sarajevo siege or the Rwandan genocide and then turned to indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yugoslavia in 1999 in a faux humanitarian mission that conveniently distracted from Bill's ongoing impeachment.

Even Chelsea, the darling young Clinton is in the criminal enterprise today. While it's hard to ignore her startling resemblance to Hillary's former law partner in Little Rock, it should be even harder to ignore her husband, Mark Mezvinsky's hedge fund, which speculates on the failure of the Greek economy—or Mezvinsky's father who was indicted in 2001 and sentenced to 5 years in prison for 69 counts of bank and mail fraud in a massive Ponzi scheme and Nigerian email scheme in the 1990s.
Much attention has focused on Trump's supposed calls for violence and his support from the KKK and other white supremacist organizations. While one might hope that Trump would formally denounce these organizations, it's important to recognize the role of left-wing agitators in stirring up violent scenes at his rallies and his avoidance of the ""outrage"" culture that has taken over US public thought. No one has bothered to mention that the Communist Party of the US endorsed Hillary Clinton (a group which once supported full-on Stalinism, the abolition of private property and the deportation or execution of all business owners and anyone deemed 'bourgeois'), which says nothing good about either CPUSA or Clinton.

Why vote for Trump? Well, it is a gamble, but it's a gamble worth taking in light of his opposition. If nothing else, voting for Trump is worth it to ensure a greater chance of avoiding war in the next four years and to make sure that the Supreme Court is stocked with new justices intent on reading the Constitution and upholding the law, rather than ideological stooges. If Trump wins, we may hope that he manages to break the gridlock in Congress with Republicans expected to win a majority in the House and push for massive deregulation of industry, lowering of corporate taxes to boost the economy, major repairs to US indebtedness and government spending and steps toward the creation of a race-blind meritocracy that gives everyone an opportunity to succeed.

And what if Trump fails? Given anti-Trump sentiment in the Republican Party, impeachment is always on the table, with the option to replace him with a firm and predictable Mid-Western conservative, in the form of Mike Pence.

Hillary Clinton--who appears to be suffering from a serious and never admitted chronic illness based on a long-string of faintings and collapses--has this idea upheld by a lack of rallies and in-person appearances in 2016. In a slight of hand she was issued debate questions ahead of time and was grilled not even once by moderators for her unsavory activities.

Of course no one mentions Bill Clinton's racial profiling orders put out to the Arkansas State Police but dwell instead on the Trump family's unfortunate 1972 lawsuit regarding race based housing discrimination resolved with a settlement in 1975. While it appears that it did happen the Trump's were standard among landlords who would be unable to evict protected tenants at a time of arson, urban decay and rioting.

Hillary Clinton has promised to pursue far left policies and massive government spending to appease statist social democrats and contractors. She has made warmongering statements about Syria and criticized Trump's stance on nukes even though he has principally spoken about their high cost and the need to liberate the US military from treaty obligations by proliferating them to responsible allies.

At the end of the day, the Donald is the only major party candidate who upholds my beliefs in government reduction, deregulation and even in a way 3rd party representation, with an ear for the working class that will enable him to sell the better elements of social democracy like universal healthcare to the American people.

5bks4x,60,2016-11-07,60 days of not fapping (not a one liner),hiimthrowawayacct,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5bks4x/60_days_of_not_fapping_not_a_one_liner/,"Excuse me for typing on my phone.

So during the summer I was pretty depressed with my life. I'm a college student living with my parents, and I'm fucking up in school, me and my best friend stopped talking, I hated my phisique (skinny) just your typical shit. I didnt have a job soo all I did last summer was play League of Legends, fapped, and just hated myself for being me. My brother was getting married and I was meeting relatives who traveled for the marriage and just felt worse about myself since they expected me to do big things and there lives were better. Ive been most of my life a good talker and mostly sociable person during so I go to bars etc, but that has also been a cause of a ton of negative shit in my life. Well the week before my brothers wedding I had saved up about $3000 and i spent about 1500 on coke and alcohol because i justified it as im going to treat my cousins and brothers friends with drinks and just party since its a big occasion. After the marriage I realized I had a ton of problems I realized im super depressed and was on the brink of killing myself. At this point I was still fapping playing league of legends waiting for school to start back up. Well I decided it was time to stop the bullshit and just fix everything. But that was only because i started going fishing everyday. My friend and were watching a Tony Robbins motivational thing on netflix til 5 am and he told me to go out and go fishing since I was talking about it. Well I ended up going out and doing it at 6 am. I wasnt a fan of fishing but my brother loves it and takes me, but this time I decided to go on my own. Just me and the fish. I made my own bait did my own shit and went. I didnt catch a fish for two weeks until I got a small one, but I knew it wasnt enough so i read books about fishing did research and finally got a 40 inch carp. I realized you will succed in life if you jusy keep trying over and over again even if it means failing a lot. With that i decided to change my major the day i got that big fish. I decided to apply for an internship. I uninstalled league. I decided to workout. To talk to more people. Joins clubs and organizations that im interested. Stop fapping and do the things i want. I failed a lot in all of these. It was all overwhelming. In the case of fapping I couldnt go 3 days. And all the other stuff failed in some way or another. Well i kept trying. Just keep trying. Fapping is an urge because you feel like shit and need a quick source of happiness. So are other bad habits in life. They are temporary pleasures your mind uses as a way to distract you from your problems. I got an internship, a girl(idk how im unattractive and shes beautiful), i lift, Im going to move out signed a lease, havent played league in 3 months, and have joined clubs and done a ton of shit to change my life. Its been 60 days since i fapped have no urge. My testosterone is high, and I still can control it and quite frankily think its gross. It in my opinion is a sideeffect of depression. Every single person here should take the time to identify what is making them depressed. When you have shit to do you wont want to fap. Then  you realize you just do it to pass the time and feel pointless pleasure through disgusting porn. Be who you want and start now. Dont make a gradual change stop all at once. You will fail but keep trying. Because each failure is just a step closer to success. I thank this sub because i came on here and failed a lot, but now no urge even comes my way. So thank you, and I know all of you can stop for even longer periods.

Now the benefits of not fapping:
-Noticable higher creativity when i drive my sexual tension somewhere else
-Better sex 
-More dominance in conversation with women since you are driven to get some
-Feeling that women can sense you dont fap and shit more attraction
-A lot less nervous talking to girls
-Dont get horny over stupid shit

5bkzbe,2,2016-11-07,[NoVA] XSport Fitness Personal Training Cancellation and Refund,trashcancarla,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5bkzbe/nova_xsport_fitness_personal_training/,"Hi all,

I signed up as a member at the Fairfax, Virginia location of XSport Fitness at the beginning of August. I got sucked into a personal training plan--ultimately a dumb move for me but I was pumped at the time. The general manager assigned me a trainer who I met later that day for my first session. All was well.

During our next session, the trainer told me that he unfortunately had to put his two weeks in due to moving for an internship, but we could continue our sessions until he had to leave. I told him I understood, and he gave me the number of another trainer I ultimately ended up not contacting. Turns out, XSport dropped him on the spot rather than letting him stay two weeks. I only know because I showed up for my second training session and he told me.

So, fast forward to the end of August. I'm not getting the service I'm paying for, and I call to find out what I have to do to cancel my plan before the end-of-the-month charge hits me. The person I needed to talk to wasn't in, but the man on the phone took my information and assured me I'd get a call back sometime in the next couple weeks (apparently the beginning of the month is hectic for them). He held my payment and I wasn't hit with another charge.

I never got a phone call. I was hit with another charge on September 30th. I called to refute that charge and tell them that I had never gotten a call back. The guy said to come in during a weekday when a manager was there in order to cancel. Well, life happened (crazy work hours, family issues, and sickness), and I ended up calling back October 30th for them to hold the payment until I could come in. They told me they couldn't hold it and to call the general customer service number. When I told them I'd had it held before by them, they insisted I call the 877 number. I begrudgingly agreed. It was Sunday, so the center was closed. 

Frustrated, I emptied my checking account into my savings and later got an email saying they couldn't process my payment and that I should log on to the member portal to pay. I thought I was in the clear, and moved my money back so I could use it. Four days later, I'm hit with a charge that's half of my monthly PT payment.

I'm going to the gym tomorrow to cancel my plan and hopefully get my money back. Throughout this whole ordeal I've ended up being charged around $500 for a service I'm not receiving.

I unfortunately don't have a copy of the contract I signed (tore my house apart looking for it. Dumb, I know, but I was told I could cancel if I wasn't feeling it). I've also been charged the enrollment fee I was told was waived since I have corporate benefits, and another random $10 charge on top of that. I don't plan on disputing the monthly membership fee, but I do need the other money (all but two sessions of personal training I paid for, plus the apparent enrollment fee and random $10) back.

I'm worried (but expecting) I'll have to threaten legal action. Do I have a leg to stand on here? I'm not even sure what the process would be if I did have to take them to court. I'll work on finding the copy of the contract I have, but I'm wondering if any of this puts me in the hole in terms of refunding my money.

I appreciate any and all advice. Thank you!"

In her words"" all i care about is being a mom not a wife"". We had talked about separating off and on, with me always begging to not give up let’s keep going. I'm in the military and i got orders to Spain randomly. I asked her hey let’s give this a go will be good for us. She agrees, and shortly after wants to return home for a wedding. She takes our son and heads back to the states for her friend’s wedding. While there she tells me she doesn't want to come back. i tell her i know it’s difficult now (not knowing the language and meeting new people). She finally comes back and tells me it’s not for us it’s for my relationship with my 2 year old son. i ask to go to couples therapy and she refuses. Some time goes by and honestly things have gotten so much better. We both seemed happy and working together really well. We even extended to stay for another year about 3 months ago. We get into an argument and become distant again. this last for about a week (honestly don't remember over what most likely something dumb.) she text me while I'm in my office and says ""we need to talk about what's going on with us lately."" i come up stairs to go talk and as soon as i sit down she says those terrible words "" I want a divorce!"" 
i wasn't sure how to react i do what I’ve always done and say no don't give up i know we can be happy we just have to work on it. She refuses. I pathetically begged for about 2 days to consider therapy and promises to be whoever she needs me to be to be happy. She says she feels nothing for me emotionally or physically. She let it slip that she’s been feeling that way for years and that Spain was an adventure. She drops this little gem on me ""it’s unfair i got to prepare for all of this and you didn't."" 
I'm a wreck at this point holing back tears and vomit while trying to convince my son ""daddy’s okay i promise"". I had no idea what to think or say. I just look at my son and my legs give out. She wants to leave move back to her home town with our son. (He can't legally stay with me while I’m stationed here. All i can think about is why would she let me extend for another year and how I’m going to miss so much of my baby's life. 
Our original plan was to finish here and move to Texas where i would finish my last 6 months of school and enter into an internship for my degree in Cybersecurity. 

*little backstory: i don't have much family mom died at 19 father and my father’s mother (gma) are really the only family i talk with and have.*

i call my father in tears (keep in mind i can probably count on one hand how many times I’ve cried...like really cried.) He, being the former military man he is, gets straight to business. We need to find a lawyer...we need to separate things... we need to do this and that and this and that. I can't take it and vomit everywhere. 
A week passes by and she is still here of course, and I’m so uncomfortable in our house. We try to negotiate items money and all the little things. We have an ""agreement"". She makes out like a bandit but I’m not crippled financially for the rest of my life so i agree. Another week passes and she tells me her friends say she can get more money. I tell her we had an agreement, she tells “I’m just thinking about what’s best for our son. And what’s best for him is i have the money to do anything i want for him."" i start to panic realizing she wanted our house all the items we had in storage and now more than half my check. And most importantly she has my son. I’ve gotten legal advice for several bases and it all sounds the same: you're fucked your future will forever be 1/5 of what you wished to accomplish. We are still in this battle and she is still currently living in the same house. It's been terrible! She set ground rules while she is still here, mainly we alternate days with our son.

 She says and does these little sly asshole moves that only i know what she’s doing. Example: it will be my day with our son and while I’m at work she will text me something like this ""so I’m going over to a friends and am going to take our son so he can play is that okay? i mean if you want to see him and spend time with him then i won't take him to play."" shit like this just little pokes to bother me. Its constant and its terrible. 

All i know is the court system is super fucked... i didn't want the divorce, i constantly asked to get outside help, and i even started a week before she told me (which she knew about) ""be a better husband therapy"". None of it matters she will still walk away with everything and I am the one who has to suffer because she gave up. I honestly don't see much of a light at the end of the tunnel. Even when this is all over I'm still moving to Texas and she will be moving back to her hometown across the country. 

If i had to explain how i feel right now i would say so miserable that i can't feel it completely. It’s kind of like when you are so cold you're a bit warm. My heart has the feeling that you've forgotten to pack something but you won't figure it out until it's too late. But I’m pretty sure it's how to smile. 

Honestly i have no idea why I’m writing this on here. i feel extremely embarrassed and so stupid but i don't have any friends left where i am. They have all either left or the only one i had hangs out with her and doesn't talk to me anymore because we got into an argument about a week ago. 

I’m not the pity party type but i don't really know how to deal with all these new emotions. So any tips or tricks to keep myself off the bottle and my head above the waves?  
Sorry for all the typos and grammar I had a rough time writing this..

5bm5cw,21,2016-11-07,"Me [29F] with my BF [30M] duration 3 years, I feel like he takes me for granted, but am I being unreasonable?",maidservice4bf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5bm5cw/me_29f_with_my_bf_30m_duration_3_years_i_feel/,"There's a lot that could go in to this, but for the purpose of this post, I would like to keep it to just this disagreement.

Background:

My SO and I have been together for 3 years. Currently I work in social work 45 hours a week, am working towards my masters degree, and work a total of 20-30 hours a week at my part time job/internship. He works in the tech field 60-70 hours a week and has chronic pain in his shoulder that he will be getting surgery on again. I would say that at home I am responsible for 70% of the household work. He will mostly do things if I ask, but does not take initiative on his own because he ""hates chores, hates the word chores, and anything to do with chores"" and often says that he is in too much pain to help with certain things. This leaves me often taking care of things on my own because I get tired of asking him to do things, and often having to ask repeatedly.

Current Issue:

His birthday was this weekend. I was busy with school and work, but I made every effort to make it special for him as he had a big work project coming up and was sick. On his birthday I took him coffee, a breakfast sandwich, and cupcakes to work in the morning before heading to my internship. He unfortunately worked 7am-9pm that day, but when he came home he had the dinner he asked for (homemade tomato soup, grilled cheese, and a birthday cake) waiting for him, which he thoroughly enjoyed. On Saturday we spent the day lazily together before I had to go to work in the evening and I made sure to bring him home medicine and a snack (which I did later eat like half of). 

Yesterday, he slept mostly all day. I asked him repeatedly to go to the doctor, asked what I could do to help him, but he was too tired to even respond most of the time. I spent the day cleaning the house, doing laundry, working on schoolwork, and went to the store. One of the few times that he had been conscious he had said he wanted a huge plate full of finger foods and more soup. So at the store I got some frozen munchies, the stuff to make more soup, and stuff for tuna noodle casserole.  I came home and made all of the food and woke him up to come down for dinner, but the first thing out of his mouth was ""what is your problem?"" I ignored it and asked him to come down for food. He came down, mumbled a thanks, ate, and went upstairs without saying much else to me. 

I late brought it up that I was hurt that he didn't seem more appreciative of my efforts to make him feel better when he was feeling ill and that all I wanted was a thank you, a hug, and maybe an expression of how much I had been helping him. He took this opportunity to state that he was upset that I didn't take in to consideration how sick he was and how he was tired of me starting fights for no reason and turning his illness in to something to do with me. I slept in the other room.

This morning, he came in to the room to say how he thought it was completely unfair that I had that reaction and that I didn't even once take in to consideration that he must be incredibly sick to be sleeping all day. I told him that I understood that he was sick, but being sick doesn't give him the right to be a jerk. I said that all he had to do was say something like ""I'm sorry you felt taken for granted"" or ""But I really do appreciate all of the things that you've been doing"" but that he instead chose to get upset with me. His response was that this is all my fault, yet again.

So, I guess I'm looking for some outside perspective. Based on that short summary am I out of line for wanting to feel appreciated? I feel like I put so much effort in to this weekend and my efforts were barely acknowledged by even a hug or a proper thank you, and the fact that he got upset with me for telling him that I was upset made me feel even worse...


  **tl;dr**: I often feel like I am just an in home maid service for my SO and that he takes the things that I do for him for granted, but am I overreacting or not being understanding?"

Originally we thought I'd be here September-May, but upon arriving here I decided for a plethora of reasons to return home in December instead. Of course this has been beneficial for our relationship because we were prepared not to see each other for 8 months but now it's been shortened to only 3 :)

We went through a bit of a rough time a couple of weeks ago struggling with the distance and communication, but that has been mostly resolved, and we've agreed that when I get back home we'll see where we stand. One thing he was worried about was that he wasn't sure if he'd still want to put in the effort for a relationship when I got back, but he suddenly stopped saying this when I said that I couldn't wait around for 8 weeks wondering and that if that were the case I'd rather break up now and just move on with my life. So yeah, that was a couple of weeks ago and now lately things have been a bit more normal and we've even made a couple of plans for when I get back next month, though once in a while I still feel like he's ignoring me, or yesterday was weird because in the morning when I saw he had logged into Facebook (I know, this sounds stalkerish) I texted him, but it wasn't until about 5 hours later that he texted back and said he had just woken up, even though I noticed throughout the day his Facebook chat kept going active.

A couple weeks before I left, one day I could tell that he was stressed out about something and seemed pretty down. I asked him what was up and told him the only way we could resolve it was if we talked about it, and he started crying a bit and said he was worried I'd meet someone in Europe. I told him I understood his fears (especially since all but one of his previous relationships ended with the girl cheating on him - including one when he was in college and his girlfriend at the time studied abroad for a semester), but that I would never cheat on him, and I think I had reassured him of this by the end of the conversation. I also reminded him that he'd continue to be living in a much bigger city than the one I'm living in abroad, so really I should be the one worrying (and at the time I wasn't).

Now, ever since we went through that rough patch a couple weeks ago I've been worrying a bit. For one thing, he's the type to go out every night and party (whereas I'm not) so I guess I'm afraid he has or will hook up with someone on one of these nights out. 

Last night we were skyping and he was joking about the guys at his job hitting on him and I said I was more worried about the girls, and he said something along the lines of ""just the 18 or 19 year old interns, but I would never have a relationship in the work place."" Maybe I'm overthinking it, but shouldn't he be thinking, I'd never be in a relationship with one of them because I'm already in a relationship? I would've said this last night but I didn't think of it until we hung up of course -__-

I guess it's notable too that one relationship he was in in college ended because he cheated. Normally I wouldn't have given him a chance, but he brought it up one day (early on) when I had asked him his biggest regret and he seemed truly remorseful about it and said he would never do it again (and this was compared to something else I had expected to be his biggest regret but that's a whole nother story).

So yeah, I feel like my fears are irrational, but something is nagging at me. For one thing, I know I've missed him emotionally the whole time I've been here, but lately I've missed our physical connection more and more, and though I've mentioned this he doesn't seem to miss this as much as I do and I guess it just makes me worried that he's getting physical pleasure from someone else. He has said he's good at compartmentalizing and this has helped him to not miss me too much since he knows I'll be back soon. Plus I understand how the time is going quicker for him since he just moved back to the city we live in after having to live with his parents for a few months, so he's been able to go out with his friends and have a great time every night, plus he's swamped with work, whereas I'm over here trying to make the most of my time but ultimately missing my friends and family and, as silly as it may sound, it's been tough not having as heavy as a workload this semester because at least that would keep me distracted. I don't think he's every really been the type to hook up, either. Maybe in college, but I don't think he had any relationships in grad school and wasn't about the hook up scene then, either. Since our first date he's been exclusive with me, even before we were officially together.

I guess in other words, I understand that this is easier on his end and maybe that's clouding my judgment, but I'm thinking of asking him the next time we Skype (either this week or next weekend) if he's been on any dates or has hooked up with (or even kissed anyone) on his nights out. Or maybe I should wait to ask him about this when I get home in 6 weeks and we can talk in person?

I'm hoping he'll understand my fears because, after all, he had similar fears before I left, but part of me is afraid that he'll get offended and that it could unnecessarily ruin our trust if he hasn't been cheating.

Sorry this is so long! Any advice is greatly appreciated :)
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm abroad for the semester (6 weeks to go) and after having a fight with my boyfriend I'm afraid that's his being disloyal, but I have no evidence of this and I'm not sure if I should ask him the next time we video chat or if I should wait to bring it up when I get back home."

I was in the same exact shoes as many of you. In junior year with absolutely no Intern experience. I was applying to dozens of companies each week only to never hear back. But I changed gears and spent more time on learning how to land interviews and saw my potential increase. 

I started my internship at a small company doing great work. I went on to Intern for 3 Fortune 500 companies as a result of my shift in approach.

I have finished all my prerequisites at my university and I have begun taking the harder programming courses; however, I am married with a child and I need to start making more money now. I currently make $13 an hour managing a quick service restaurant. 

I took a lower paying job that afforded me flexibility to go to school, but I am now unable to pay my credit cards and my credit score is in the gutter. I currently go to FIU (Florida International University) and still have two years of schooling left. Recently I was emailed about UCF (University of Central Florida) having a web developer boot camp. It's a 6 month course and teaches all the current web technologies. They also have companies on board as potential employers and they do a rigorous interview prep as part of their course. The course is $9500 and I would need a cosigner to be approved for the loan due to my low credit score.

I am looking at the bootcamp as a way to get me into industry and get me a livable wage. I see it as something that would allow me to avoid taking anymore student loans since I would potentially make enough to cover my classes on my own, even if I had to go to school part time. 

I'm wondering if my thought process is on the right track or I should keep going to school for another year until I get more experience and then try to get a job or internship. Also, maybe I am not thinking about other options I have available to me, suggestions are appreciated."

5bp6h0,17,2016-11-07,When to apply for internships as a freshman?,MrBlueq,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5bp6h0/when_to_apply_for_internships_as_a_freshman/,"Hey guys, so I know everyone has been applying for internships for the past two months and now is considered a little late, but I am not sure what to do as a freshman. Everyone says to apply for internships, even if you are a freshman, but I have almost nothing besides a few clubs and classes to put on my resume. While my first semester is kind of empty, I have a lot of more impressive things that I will be doing next semester (assisting with research) that will increase the likelihood of scoring an internship. 

Should I wait until next semester when I begin researching and start more advanced classes to apply for internships? Or should I be applying now?

Also another question I have is could I apply for an internship this semester, and then apply again next semester? Would this be considered alright or will I get blacklisted from the company?
Any responses would be much appreciated.

Edit: Ok, judging from the sarcastic comments and people telling me to calm down, let me clarify *why* I am applying to internships as a freshman. I am looking for internships not because I feel the need to do so to stay competitive, I am looking for internships because I would rather crush my left testicle than work at Walmart for one more goddamn summer. I want to get the experience and better myself not to stay competitive, but because I am passionate about learning about computer science and engineering and there is nothing else I would rather be doing with my summer. Hope that clears things up :) "
5bpapb,25,2016-11-07,"I want the hard truth, no bs explanation of how much school prestige matters.",_Converge_,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5bpapb/i_want_the_hard_truth_no_bs_explanation_of_how/,"I have asked this question many times, but I have not once gotten what I feel is an *honest* answer from people. I'm a CS undergrad at a state party school with almost no research opportunities. I came here because people told me prestige didn't matter, and that it was the smarter economic choice. I want to get a PhD and do research, and people giving vague answers is not helping me at all.

So, first of all, if school prestige didn't matter, why would people want to go to prestigious schools? The usual answer I get is ""because there are better networking opportunities."" 

But you know what? Top tech companies *obviously* are more likely to hire people from top schools than people from weak schools. 

Is anyone honestly going to sit here and lie to my face by saying that I have just as good a shot at getting into a top grad school as someone from MIT? 

The *automatic* assumption about a person who goes to MIT is that they are more intelligent than me, which is why they are at MIT and I'm not. No one will honestly acknowledge that. How often do you read about studies done by Harvard? How often is it assumed that someone who goes to Harvard is automatically superior to people at random state schools. It happens *literally* all the time.

If you go to MIT, or Caltech, or Stanford, *obviously* you have access to significantly more research opportunities, significantly more impactful letters of recommendation from faculty and research advisors, significantly more recruiting from top companies, and a significantly better reputation by default.

So how can anyone tell me that simply working hard is enough to get me into a top PhD program? Professors at my school tell me that the reason they chose to teach at this school was because they *didn't* want to do research. The best I can hope for is to be accepted to REUs, which would have no reason to accept me since I have no research experience to begin with. And then even if I get great grades, a person from a better school with lower grades would still get more respect because its assumed their curriculum was harder.

And I'm expected to somehow compete with people at top schools, getting **consistent *high impact* research experience**, with top professors in their fields?

I genuinely feel that not going to a strong school is an *extreme* disadvantage. Its not just a situation where you have to ""work a little harder"" to make yourself stand out. From my current position, it seems that it will be very hard for me to get to where I want to go, while my friends at better schools tell me every day how much research experience they are getting working at internships with top professors that guarantee them good LORs.

So can someone please just be honest about this actually being the case, or tear apart my perception of the situation completely. I just don't want to waste my time thinking that trying hard will be enough, when the reality is that this path just isn't really open to me the way it is for others."
5bpfat,1,2016-11-07,Digging myself out of a hole FINALLY but overwhelmed - advice?,madamcurryous,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/5bpfat/digging_myself_out_of_a_hole_finally_but/,"So, to say the least I've managed to live semi-highly functional as a anxious-depressed person with help from my parents aka debilitatingly enabling financial support. I don't think they did it on purpose other than to show support for me trying to pick myself up everyday. But sometimes I stayed in my veg mode, or sedated myself with exercise, or enrolled in a language class, or something to reroute back to normal/adult like finding new simple routines along a wave of resurfacing effort &amp; hope to find out what I need to get out of this life.


I haven't worked in over 1.5 years, other than work exchange while travelling and donation-based therapy &amp; baby-sitting gigs and off the books art work while coming to and from my home city. Before that I derailed from my original career path for about 1.5 years. I guess it counts for something? I have traveled to over 10 countries in the past year and expanded my art brand and focuses. I tried and failed a lot and tried and succeeded at a couple things. I finally know what I'd like to do into my 30s. I'm 26 now. My energy has been divided and I had a lot of trouble time managing, but also experienced set-backs trying paths. But finally I am trying to at least get a part-time job, shadow someone in my potential field and maybe an internship? Before this I was finished undergrad, wiht a pre-medicine track and studying for MCATs. But soon realized that was NOT the life for me.


I feel completely off track and completely marginalized in many ways. I moved to a new country, started learning the language, and made some attempts to find work but was sorely disappointed or filed my energy elsewhere and lost track of some consistent things I wanted to add to my life like volunteering and getting a therapist back. My journey feels like a vestige of an erased path. 


But I feel so alone, behind, and set-back. I took the GREs almost 4/5 years ago and feel compelled to make use of it. I was once a really successful student and had a couple different jobs lined up and managed working part-time but started moving literally every 3 months or 6 months. It equally takes a lot of effort and I learned so much but on paper it is hard to be so transparent about these life skills I learned. I feel like I have very little as far as references.


Now I live in a foreign country and am trying to navigate their systems. I managed to get a visa to work here. And still don't know if I'm in the right place. Racially there is not enough diversity here but artistically it's an affordable quality of life. Basically I'm gonna do everything I need to. Whatever that means. I can to wedge myself into a lifestyle here other than partying, hobbies, exercise, managing my weight, stopping fixating on men, and minimal sustaining my life. Those used to be landmarks for me though. 


All my friends around me have consistent boyfriends and some very much settling down and I'm just deciding if I should study again in the States. I'm clearly not at that point and I kinda just smile and amuse my current direction and let everyone know it's okay even though behind this I'm just trying to find a way.
Is this a late-bloomers curse? Or like this literal jet-lagged alternative lifestyle catching up to me? I'm in a serial game of self-blame and running out of hours in the day.


My parents retire soon. I want to get off of their case a bit before then. AKA within 3-6 months.


I want to be able to make money to travel back and forth. And have some freedom but I'm pretty confused how to manage my finances let alone get off my parents buffers.


I'm here to wonder what your take is. I'm grabbing at straws at where to look for support. Part of me wants to reach out to my university frustrated, grab them my the shoulders and ask for help. 
I don't want to live the life of a slacker anymore nor do I want to lie anymore aka all my experience is somewhat fabricated or half-assed. I want to ask an advisor how to paint my story or how to find work and internships. I'm so confused whether or not to look for help from them. It's 4 years (going on 5 help me) later.


In some ways I feel like an old soul but professionally I feel like a 22 year old and it's so frustrating. Right now I'm at the point where I wnat to sacrifice sleep and just power through and use my old methods to achieve. I feel like I don't have enough time to catch up.


Where can I go for help? What kinda plan can I follow to remain calm and stay on this upward spiral?


Also this has caused my social life to completely implode. I have been hurt personally so much or feel so alienated in my lifestyle that I have a hard time being not anxious and allowing work/friend/life balance for me to exist. I am afraid of losing time in all areas of my life in order to maintain these areas of my life. The dissociation is incredible.


Can anyone relate? My existential crisis mode is over the top right now.


((I might cross-post this elsewhere just because I will focus my venting a bit but I have no idea how to get into the career I want with all this shit hitting the fan for me. I used to have it together.))"

I will be involved in reporting capabilities and Data Warehousing aspects of the database. Does anyone know where I can find good resources to get up to speed in these areas? Also is there a way I can train myself using any mock AzureSQL database and have a ""free tier"" in azure?

Thanks in advance!"

I don't think they did it on purpose other than to show support for me trying to pick myself up everyday. But sometimes I stayed in my veg mode, or sedated myself with exercise, or enrolled in a language class, or something to reroute back to normal/adult like finding new simple routines along a wave of resurfacing effort &amp; hope to find out what I need to get out of this life.


I haven't worked in over 1.5 years, other than work exchange while travelling and donation-based therapy &amp; baby-sitting gigs and off the books art work while coming to and from my home city. Before that I derailed from my original career path for about 1.5 years. I guess it counts for something? I have traveled to over 10 countries in the past year and expanded my art brand and focuses. I tried and failed a lot and tried and succeeded at a couple things. I finally know what I'd like to do into my 30s. I'm 26 now. My energy has been divided and I had a lot of trouble time managing, but also experienced set-backs trying paths. But finally I am trying to at least get a part-time job, shadow someone in my potential field and maybe an internship? Before this I was finished undergrad, wiht a pre-medicine track and studying for MCATs. But soon realized that was NOT the life for me.


I feel completely off track and completely marginalized in many ways. I moved to a new country, started learning the language, and made some attempts to find work but was sorely disappointed or filed my energy elsewhere and lost track of some consistent things I wanted to add to my life like volunteering and getting a therapist back. My journey feels like a vestige of an erased path.


But I feel so alone, behind, and set-back. I took the GREs almost 4/5 years ago and feel compelled to make use of it. I was once a really successful student and had a couple different jobs lined up and managed working part-time but started moving literally every 3 months or 6 months. It equally takes a lot of effort and I learned so much but on paper it is hard to be so transparent about these life skills I learned. I feel like I have very little as far as references.
Now I live in a foreign country and am trying to navigate their systems. I managed to get a visa to work here. And still don't know if I'm in the right place. Racially there is not enough diversity here but artistically it's an affordable quality of life. Basically I'm gonna do everything I need to. Whatever that means. I can to wedge myself into a lifestyle here other than partying, hobbies, exercise, managing my weight, stopping fixating on men, and minimal sustaining my life. Those used to be landmarks for me though.


All my friends around me have consistent boyfriends and some very much settling down and I'm just deciding if I should study again in the States. I'm clearly not at that point and I kinda just smile and amuse my current direction and let everyone know it's okay even though behind this I'm just trying to find a way. Is this a late-bloomers curse? Or like this literal jet-lagged alternative lifestyle catching up to me? I'm in a serial game of self-blame and running out of hours in the day.


My parents retire soon. I want to get off of their case a bit before then. AKA within 3-6 months.
I want to be able to make money to travel back and forth. And have some freedom but I'm pretty confused how to manage my finances let alone get off my parents buffers.


I'm here to wonder what your take is. I'm grabbing at straws at where to look for support. Part of me wants to reach out to my university frustrated, grab them my the shoulders and ask for help. I don't want to live the life of a slacker anymore nor do I want to lie anymore aka all my experience is somewhat fabricated or half-assed. I want to ask an advisor how to paint my story or how to find work and internships. I'm so confused whether or not to look for help from them. It's 4 years (going on 5 help me) later.


In some ways I feel like an old soul but professionally I feel like a 22 year old and it's so frustrating. Right now I'm at the point where I wnat to sacrifice sleep and just power through and use my old methods to achieve. I feel like I don't have enough time to catch up.


Where can I go for help? What kinda plan can I follow to remain calm and stay on this upward spiral?


Also this has caused my social life to completely implode. I have been hurt personally so much or feel so alienated in my lifestyle that I have a hard time being not anxious and allowing work/friend/life balance for me to exist. I am afraid of losing time in all areas of my life in order to maintain these areas of my life. The dissociation is incredible.
Can anyone relate? My existential crisis mode is over the top right now.


((I might cross-post this elsewhere just because I will focus my venting a bit but I have no idea how to get into the career I want with all this shit hitting the fan for me. I used to have it together.))"

5bpswc,2,2016-11-07,F4A - Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5bpswc/f4a_dark_journey_to_fame/,"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

She can't find an internship which is required for school, and she can't find a job which she needs as well.

She is depressed about it clearly, and she told me something along the lines of 'nobody wants me etc', she even said she was depressed.

Now me, I said something super cheesy after her speech in an attempt to cheer her up, not the smartest thing to write, but it wasn't offensive or anything, I decided to ignore her that she wrote she didn't want to talk about it anymore for now. She read it and wrote '...'

What the fuck do I do, it's a decently important friendship to me and I will see her tomorrow. I am not really hurt that she ignores me, but I don't know what to do when I see her."
5bpw2b,1,2016-11-07,Is our [25f/25m] relationship salvageable under these circumstances? Please help..,aGirlwithoutWDs,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5bpw2b/is_our_25f25m_relationship_salvageable_under/,"**Background:** went to the same university. Met at the end of undergrad. He stayed 8 hours away near university for valid internship opportunity. Been together formally 1.5 years, but interested in each other and dating for 2 years. See each other every few months. 


I have always known that he is a risk to date. He's not a relationship person. 

To make a long story short: we hit a rough patch for a couple months over the summer. I was going through some deep personal issues and was also very frustrated by his inability to provide me with what I need emotionally. Aside from simple requests not being met, there have been some really big and really bad things that have happened to us recently. Hard to explain those.  

Anyway, since our rough patch, I have been trying really hard to listen to his needs and really, just not ask much out of him in terms of my needs. 

**But for the past 3 months:** he is unable to show love. Which is really important in a long distance relationship.

We have explicitly talked about this and his general responses are that the rough period in our relationship has made it so he can't act loving, he said he's been feeling selfish and not really excited to see me because the ""vibe"" is bad and that he just wants things to be chill.

I also just want things to be chill, but I need to feel loved and wanted. He says that he wishes he could motivate himself to be loving and show it, but he can't and he does feel bad. 

In all, he's wanted to break up. 

I am really under the impression (as somebody who was previously in a very successful 8 year relationship prior), that sometimes relationships face controversy and if every time this happens, the parties just go separate ways.... nobody would stay together.

If both people are motivated to change and both WANT to make things work, it can.  

**Last night:** we've been (or I've been) trying to figure out a means between by family and his family for us to go to multiple Thanksgivings and be together. I needed him to give me definitive answers last week, he didn't, and plane flight prices went up. I called him and asked if he even wanted to do Thanksgiving together and he said he was no longer coming home (to his house) for Thanksgiving and that he agrees plane tickets are always expensive and it's *up to me* if I want to get tickers and stay with him. No mention of him driving 3 hours to my family's house despite him knowing it would mean the world to me to see him (it's been months) and that I am bothered he's never met my family and that we're trying to salvage things. 

Aside from the fact that he has a lot of money and I have close to none,  it sure didn't sound appealing to blow my paycheck to come see somebody who doesn't really care to see you. It makes me sad that he doesn't want to see me also..

Anyway I confronted him, he agreed to come one day for T.G. at my family's but explicitly stated that he wasn't really excited about seeing me. He also said he didn't know if a 7 hour drive (3 hours each way) was worth his time. I told him that hurt my feelings to hear and he said he can't help the way he feels but that he feels bad. I then asked him if we could spend a few days together after thanksgiving too and study together and he said he'd rather just study alone. I told him we haven't seen each other in months and that we used to always study together and we could motivate each other and be together.... and this made him angry. He said we just came to an agreement about thanksgiving but I just keep pushing and pushing..

Anyway, we almost broke up. I guess I can't force somebody to put effort into a relationship if they don't want to. It's as simple as him texting me more and seeing me once in awhile. 

He texted me this morning saying, sorry he was irritable last night and *may* have been a little harsh but that we should spend a few days together for Thanksgiving and he is capable of being excited to see me.

I usually would just take this response and be happy. But just knowing, he doesn't want to come, I annoy him so much, he doesn't feel loving and would be willing to break up at any time..... Really hurts me. The thought of being around him makes me uncomfortable and want to cry, let alone wanting to be intimate and share myself with him. 
But, I really want to see him.. even though he doesn't want to see me. I miss him..

Thoughts? Thanks..

I've interned in the Bay Area (but not SF proper) previously at a Big 4, and while I think I'd prefer living on the West Coast long term, I'd love trying out NYC for a summer.

I've received offers for an internship at JP Morgan in Chicago and at MathWorks in Natick, MA (outskirts of Boston).  And, I've been having a lot of trouble trying to decide between the two.

The MathWorks internship is 12 weeks, compared to JPMC's 10 week program, but their overall value by compensation turns out to be about the same after the internship is over (separated by a couple hundred dollars).

On one hand, I'd like to live and work in downtown Chicago at a large corporation because there'd be plenty of things to do.  But, MathWorks is more of an engineering company so I'd meet more like-minded individuals that not only love programming, but also math, algorithms, and theory.

Does anybody have any past experience with either company (internship or full-time)?  Should I make my decision based on city  (and where I want to live in the future) or what I'd be doing there?  I'd pretty much be guaranteed to make more money at JPMC when I graduate, but I don't know if I'd be doing exactly what I want.  I guess what I'm most afraid of is that I choose JPMC because of the city and pay, but I end up doing lame web development and CRUD operations instead of algorithms, data structures, and math.  If I could guarantee that I'd be doing exactly what I want (graphics programming, machine learning, the above mentioned, or security), I'd choose JPMC in a heartbeat, but I have no idea what other peoples' experiences were with them.

- Which has more prestige in the CS world?
- Where will I learn the most?
- Is considering the salary a bad thing to do in this scenario? (salary is difference of 10k a year in favor of JPMC)
- Is living in downtown Boston and commuting to Natick by train every day an option or is that kind of weird/far?

I'm sure at least one of you has been in my situation before; what did you decide on?  And if you haven't been in my scenario before, any advice you could give is very much appreciated.  My goal when I graduate is to end up on the west coast (preferably Silicon Valley) in a top 4 company, so I'm looking for the internship that could best prepare me for the future.  If you could even give advice on whether or not you think one city is hands down a better place to live in, that'd be very much appreciated.

By the way, I'll be graduating in the following Spring after I complete the internship, so this internship is important to decide where I wanna be in the future.

Thanks so much for reading this and any help you can provide."

If you're not already registered, find out if your state allows for same day registration, which will require a photo I.D. in most states. There's no point to having rights if we don't use them, and it sounds cliché, but it's true- every vote counts. Make sure your vote doesn't count towards a candidate that rigged our election system in the primaries, and who's trying to do it again in the general election, undermining the principles of democracy we carry in our society. Tomorrow really is a test of the American people. Will we continue a path of corruption and lies, followed by failed policy because of the oligarchy Washington has become? Or will we elect someone outside of the corrupt system to bring change and to get rid of the shady deals and corrupt decisions being made? And it's not how it should be, but it's how it is, the decision is about the lesser of two evils. It's either Trump or Hillary. Being realistic there is absolutely no chance of any third party candidate winning any electoral votes. Make sure your vote counts toward an outcome that's possible, and an outcome that doesn't leave us with the continuation of our corrupt politics. Bernie Sanders really did start a revolution within the Democratic Party, and even within the nation, because he too was an outsider. Donald Trump is the only other option for a revolution to drain the swamp in D.C.  You can't claim to be upset about your candidate being cheated out of the nomination, but back the nominee that cheated that candidate out of getting the nomination, and hope for it to change. Vote consciously, and do extra research tonight if you need to. But most importantly, just vote. #MAGA

In September, I started an internship at a christian camp doing event planning. It is a pretty sweet gig. I get free housing in a very expensive yet beautiful area of Coastal California as well as a paycheck every two weeks. 

I live with four other guys, and ever since I moved here, I have had a constant worry about getting *NV. I feel like camps are a breeding ground for the stomach virus as many people come through the grounds every week, especially at the high traffic camp I work at. It just takes one person to start an outbreak. In fact, the last two times I got *NV was when I was working at a different christian camp. 

Just a few days after I moved into my new house, one of my roommates came down with *NV, and then another roommate came down with it a few days later. Thankfully, the other three of us that live in the house did not catch it. However, throughout that week period *NV was going through my house, my anxiety peaked. I had several moments of panic each day and had a hard time taking my mind off of it and whether or not I was going to get it. Just last week, two female co-workers of mine came down with *NV, and the anxiety hit again. My stomach ached, I had gas pains, my stomach gurgled but that was due to the anxiety. However, there were several moments I was convinced I was going to *v. I never do though, because it is my mind playing tricks on me. 

I am just tired of this phobia calling the shots in my life. I believe it is imminent that I am going to get it, and I will get it soon. I am tired of analyzing how my stomach is feeling trying to determine if I am getting *NV or not. I am tired thinking I am getting sick when I am not hungry at times I usually am. I keep thinking ""what if at this time tomorrow, next week, or next month I will be *v'ing?"" I often look at the toilet in my bathroom and think to myself, ""I am probably eventually going to *v in this toilet."" It terrifies me. 

It is just the feeling of not knowing. Seeing my roommates or my co-workers have a normal day and then get hit so suddenly with *NV makes me feel so uneasy. One day, I could wake up and feel completely fine but then get sick by that afternoon. I get these awful panicky feelings and try to determine whether that is from getting sick or from anxiety. As always, it is anxiety. It is amazing how a normal function the body does to protect itself makes me so terrified. "

Hey guys, this is my first time posting here after lurking for the last few months. In September, I started an internship at a christian camp doing event planning. It is a pretty sweet gig. I get free housing in a very expensive yet beautiful area of Coastal California as well as a paycheck every two weeks. 

I live with four other guys, and ever since I moved here, I have had a constant worry about getting *NV. I feel like camps are a breeding ground for the stomach virus as many people come through the grounds every week, especially at the high traffic camp I work at. It just takes one person to start an outbreak. In fact, the last two times I got *NV was when I was working at a different christian camp. 

Just a few days after I moved into my new house, one of my roommates came down with *NV, and then another roommate came down with it a few days later. Thankfully, the other three of us that live in the house did not catch it. However, throughout that week period *NV was going through my house, my anxiety peaked. I had several moments of panic each day and had a hard time taking my mind off of it and whether or not I was going to get it. Just last week, two female co-workers of mine came down with *NV, and the anxiety hit again. My stomach ached, I had gas pains, my stomach gurgled but that was due to the anxiety. However, there were several moments I was convinced I was going to *v. I never do though, because it is my mind playing tricks on me.

5bry1c,7,2016-11-08,Underneath the big bright smile...,CooperFitz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5bry1c/underneath_the_big_bright_smile/,"My story
Underneath this big smile, of a bright young 23 year old is a very disturbing past.

I have never posted on reddit before and I don’t know if this is proper etiquette. I want to share my story and I hope you will read it thoroughly as I don’t believe skimming it will do it justice. Also trigger warning as this is graphic. And please refrain from hurtful comments.

My friends refer to me as “Bright Side” because I am the most positive and upbeat person they know. I am a 4th year at one of the best universities in the country. I was accepted into so many amazing schools across the country 
What many of my friends don’t know is the years that lead up to my college life (and what I struggle through during college).

My earliest memory was age 3; my older cousin had grabbed me and sexually assaulted me. After he released me I immediately ran to my mother and used the best words I could use to describe what had just happened.
The family chalked it up to boys will be boys and that was the end of it.

My mom worked two jobs so she depended on my aunt to watch me (she paid her) from ages 7-11 I had another older cousin in the household. During the day he was physically abusive. He held knives to my neck. Beat me brutally. My aunt did nothing. At night he would sexually assault me. He said if I told anyone he would kill my entire family (and I believed him). Plus my mom did so little with the assault when I was 3. I thought this was normal.

Once I was old enough to stay on my home I was officially away from my daily and nightly abuse. Then my mother developed a drinking problem. She became physically and verbally abusive. At age 12 I was working full time to keep our apartment and pay the bills. I went to bed hungry almost every night. This made me determined to focus on school. Even if it was just middle school, I was number one in my class, I was president of every club and student body, I looked forward to my one meal a day at school because it was free lunch. I channeled all my sadness into working hard at school and work. The abuse was extremely bad. For over two years I did all I could to survive the tiny household and manage it. I was made fun of at school for only owning one pair of pants and two shirts. My mothers raged increase daily. I was the perfect student, the perfect child. Once she was mad about something, one time I was buttering my bread “too loud” (bread and butter were a savior), she pulled out a gun and put it at her head and said, “I am going to kill myself because you are the most awful child. You’re so bad that that is the reason I am doing this.” She pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. The gun jammed. She was so angry. She was convinced I had something to do with it and tore the house apart looking for someway to fix the gun. This was somewhat shocking as I was a straight A student and working to pay the bills.

But her drinking and bills became too much. I couldn’t support her drinking anymore and it sent us into homelessness. By age 14 I was completely homeless. My mother left for a different state and I was on the streets.

Now in high school and freshman class president I was receiving perfect grades, I was in every club possible and enjoyed my one free meal a day. On weekends I volunteered at an animal shelter. We didn’t have a homeless shelter in my small town or I would have stayed there.

Being a young 14 year old. I am 4’11 I was 75 pounds, I look young with long blonde hair and blue eyes. I think it attracted danger. In my 5 years on the street I was raped twice. Both my men I will never know their names. I didn’t think I would survive either time and was left beaten, covered in their semen and my own blood, and more importantly left for dead. I tried seeking medical attention but since I didn’t have insurance I couldn’t get help. I called a rape crisis center and they told me if I wanted to be seen I should have called three months in advance (I am pretty serious that is what they actually said). I went to a free health clinic and they told me that since I was under 21 they couldn’t do a pelvic exam. I was stuck, with no insurance and no money, no one would see me. (Later: I have done extensive research and know how wrong this is and that legally I should have had access to health care/rape kits free of charge but that came many years later and I now help right legislation so others will not have to go through that).

But that all changed because I graduated high school with a 4.4 GPA and I was accepted to amazing schools. The schools were unaware of what I had lived through but were so impressed by my academic accomplishments. Out of Berkeley, UPenn, and many other schools, I choose UCLA.

The first day of my freshman year I moved into a dorm and I finally had my own bed. While everyone else complained how small it was I finally had a bed. To this day I still lay in a weird position from sleeping on the streets for so long but I had a bed, access to water and food.
The first day of freshman year was also my birthday, my new friends threw me a birthday party, they know I didn’t drink so it was very PG, cupcakes and all. It ended with a very large athlete assaulting me and attempting to rape me. I told my RA but I didn’t want to go to the police. I had just got away from all that I have survived through. I wasn’t going to do this to myself again.

School was going well. I struggled because I am dyslexic but I have an insanely strong work ethic. I was working two jobs at 46 hours a week because I still was on my own and didn’t have parents to help.

Eventually the athlete who hurt me raped 4 other women and after receiving my time stamped testimony from my RA I agreed to a trial. A two-year trial that wrecked my life, my grades and showed me how horrific the justice system is.
This is when I dedicated to not go to Med school but that I should go to law school.

I got accepted into a program that would allow me to live in DC for three months. I interned at an amazing organization that helps survivors. I spent my long days on the Hill helping write legislation. I had congressmen, senators, and all these big names personally thanking me for all my work. I was actually making a difference.

When I am on campus I work with an organization that raises awareness about sexual violence, we do events and provide resources.

Way before my internship in DC, while I was working one of my jobs a friendly coworker would offer me rides and was just all around nice. My shifts would end at 2am the really nice guy from work would drive me and just seemed like a good guy. 

This is the biggest mistake I have ever made.
I allowed him to be my friend. I had housing secured for the following term and the day I was moving in the person I agreed to move in with bailed literally last minute. I had no where to go and my friendly coworker said I could stay with him.
This is when things turned. He became very violent with me. I didn’t consider us to be dating but he would rape me and beat me regularly. I went down to the police station and they said that getting a restraining order would make him more mad. They also told me he had 4 previous felonies of assault. They told me that I should leave school until he graduated, because he was clearly a danger. I had nowhere to go.  I had a distant relative in a different state. Taking the very wrong advice I left my school, my home, all that I had known because I knew this man would kill me if I had stayed. The police refused to even escort me to get my stuff out of his apartment. I lost everything. I didn’t own much but I lost the very little stuff I did have.

But remember where I was coming from my entire life from age 3 was abuse. I did everything right, I studied hard, put myself through school. But I was still very broken.

So I left all I knew and moved out to a state I had lived in from ages 1-6. This was when I reconnected with a childhood friend. His family and I were neighbors. And boy oh boy. He was perfect. He was everything I never knew I deserved. We spent months talking then dating. It was all perfect. He supported me. Loved me. He understood why I flinched when he would brush my hair out of my face. I started therapy and it was amazing. He was special and kind. He was my everything. He knew my story and loved me even more. He helped me get back to school and supported me in every aspect. Our love was something that was passionate. In the years we have been together there has never been a moment where love wasn’t present. He was so happy. I was so happy. We found each other. I found my sexuality. I learned what it meant to feel safe. Our sex life was amazing. Something I never thought I could have.
I do amazing work on my campus and in the community. I am well-rounded and receive excellent grades (of course studying nonstop). And I have made it my life goal to help survivors.
…
…
…
But this beautiful perfect man hurt me more than all the abusers, than all the rapes, than the streets, than the hunger I have felt so I was very young.
He cheated on me with his married boss (who has two kids). He claims he was drunk. I decided that this love was too perfect. He clearly wasn’t unhappy with our relationship. I have never been drunk so I don’t know what it is like. Maybe you can drink and do something you didn’t know you did. I have no idea. (Any inputs on if you can get too drunk and it change who you are please comment). I decided that we could work through this. Months following things were different he quickly started to accuse me of cheating (but without any indication that I had been) I had no guy friends because he was paranoid. I guess only cheaters think like that. I would make friends with girls and he would accuse me of being lesbian. I know he doesn’t believe these outrageous statements and that he was just trying to shift the blame.
He cheated on me again with this woman. Has promised me repeatedly that he would leave his job. This has been a year since the original instance.
Some of you may ask “why stay? Just leave!” Try to put yourself in my shoes, this was the best treatment I have ever received. He didn’t try to kill me, he didn’t physically hurt me. And even more than that we had genuine love. His infidelity doesn’t make sense. We don’t fight. We are so in love. We are both in great shape. Our sex life is outstanding. We had an incredible life.
Yes he isolated me to the point that I have no friends. What he did was wrong.
So as I sit here writing this, I have officially lost the will to live. I survived a lot. But this man broke me. I obviously allowed him to by trusting him. That’s on me.

As I finish telling you the bullet points of my life story. I can’t remember why I started. I think I just wanted to tell someone. 
As I mentioned, people know me for being outgoing, someone who always has a smile on their face, and would help anyone at anytime.
But I have lost myself and I don’t know if I want to continue walking this earth everyday. I don’t know how I could continue anymore.
And I still struggle, even with two jobs, to barely keep myself afloat. I will be drowning in student debt in just a few months. I fear being out on the street again, with no help from anyone.
I am trying to live with someone I love that has hurt me more than anything. I am trying to heal from my short 23 years on this earth. I am trying to come to terms that I have lost a lot of my will to keep breathing.
This lose of will is not just due to some guy. Its due to fighting to survive everyday. And I feel like I am losing that fight.


Side note: Please never blame the victim. I wear conservative clothes, baggy shirts, I don’t drink, I’m not promiscuous. (Though these are never an excuse to rape and no matter what the person was wearing or drinking DO NOT blame them).
Some people are just violent. And with my very tiny frame I think I become a target. That and through it all, I genuinely believe that people are good and not out to get me.

Thanks for listening.

5bs6wv,1,2016-11-08,Getting hired with an interdisciplinary degree?,ThatsAllFolks42,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/5bs6wv/getting_hired_with_an_interdisciplinary_degree/,"I've done a tour of a couple of different majors in college and now after 4 years of school and 5 internships, I feel pretty confident saying I want to work in Human Factors Engineering

I started out in engineering so I have 20+ engineering credits and around 50+ gen ed and math credits. I started taking some psych courses this semester. I really do not want to finish my engineering degree (looking at 4 more semesters of classes I don't care about or expect to use).

I talked with one of my school's career counselors and she suggested getting an interdisciplinary degree with engineering as my main concentration and math and psychology as my second and third concentrations. Doing this would allow me to graduate in three more semesters.

My other option is to transfer to another school and pursue a full Human Factors degree there. This would be financially difficult and would put me in school for at least two, if not three, more years (i.e. 5 to 7 semesters).

My concern is that employers will not take an interdisciplinary degree as seriously. I do have five human factors engineering internships on my resume, so that should help some, but I don't know if it's enough to risk getting this kind of a degree.

What thoughts do you have? If you are an employer, would you be willing to consider someone with an interdisciplinary degree? 

Thanks in advance!"
5bspza,2,2016-11-08,Test,MonsieurVirgule,PostPreview,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostPreview/comments/5bspza/test/,"Hi !    
    
It seems there is a problem with Muradin, as we see him everywhere with a huge difference between high and low level play. As a 350+ games Muradin player, I would like to expose you my ideas, because the previous nerfs Blizzard made to him struck more his fun than his viability *imho*.    
.    
    
I think what Muradin doesn't have at this moment is counters and means to play around his gameplay. I'd also like to make him more easy to understand; indeed, as his winrate says, he seems to be a easy hero to understand, but in fact he is very different than it seems.    
[**HERE IS A LINK for those who do not know/remember everything on Muradin**](http://www.heroesnexus.com/talent-calculator/22-muradin#WAA)    
My humble will is to give him a real **unique** design    
.    
.    
.    
**MY PATCHNOTE** (btw all numbers are level-1-based, not level 0)    
   
.    
Health decreased from 2659 to **2526**    
    
.    
**Abilities**    
    
* Thunderclap (W) :
    * radius decreased by **25%**
    * slow increased to **30%**    
    
* Dwarf Toss (E) :    
    * Doesn't grant Resistant anymore    
    * Now grants Resistant when landing on an enemy and decreases hit enemy heroes' movespeed by 30%, which decays over 1 second.    
    
Second Wind (D) :    
    * Now heals Muradin by **159** (instead of 106) per second when he's below 40% health, and **20** (instead of 54) when he is above.
    * Activate to reduce all damages by 50% for 2 seconds (*Cooldown*: 30 seconds)    
    
&gt; I made the change on W to make the ability more impactfull and less ""just-hit-the-key"". For E, I think Blizzard want to make it a good engage abilty, but it is more often used as an escape; so I redesigned it in a way that when Muradin uses it to escape, he loses a lot of value, as ETC when he Powerslide away for example. And finally, I changed E in a way Muradin has an other way than his HP pool to absorb damage in early game, and is not forced to pick Avatar to tank in mid-end game. Also, poke damage on Muradin won't be as uneffectiv anymore, and this change matches his idea design way more imho: ""Jumps around the battlefield and stuns Heroes. **Rapidly regenerates Health as he nears death.**""
    
.    
    
**Ultimates**    


    
Avatar:
    * cooldown increased from 90 to **100** seconds
    * health bonus decreased from 1169 to 632
    * Increase Stormbolt's lenght and width by 30%
    * Increase Thunderclap's radius by 50% and slow to 35%
    * Dwarf Toss stuns enemies hit for 0.5 second   


    
Haymaker:
    * Mana cost increased to **100** (from 80)
    * Knockback reduced by 15%
    * Now follows the direction of a vector (still a point&amp;click ability yet)    
    
&gt; Avatar was arguably the most boring ultimate in this game: it was viable, but not fun at all, and what do we search in a video game ? I wanted to make the ability **feel** more impactfull, so I imagined upgraded abilities. Avatar has always put shadow over Haymaker, and I would like to change that and make it a viable ability. In its current form, I think Haymaker can't be viable without a ridiculous cooldown/damage, as Muradin as to invest too many parts of his kit and sacrifice a too much survivability to get any decent Haymaker. As Blizzard introduced vectorial abilities with Alarak's W or Ragnaros' Rolling Stone, I felt Haymaker could benefit from it.    


   
    
**Talents**    
    


**Level 1**    
    
* *Block* removed    
* *Third Wind* removed    
* *Perfect Storm* :
    * No longer Stormbolt's mana cost
    * After 25 heroes hit, increase Stormbolt stun's duration by 0.5 seconds (so 1.75 sec)    
* **New** *Small but Agile* : increase *Second Wind* 's AA damage mitigation to 100% for 3 seconds    
* **New** *Resistant Dwarf* : increase *Second Wind* 's ability damage mitigation to 75%, but also increase its cooldown by 10 seconds    
    
&gt; I think *Perfect Storm* deserves to be a real quest (as for Falstad's lvl 1 Q quest). I also want Muradin to choose between tankiness and damage, and the kind of damage he's able to soak    


    
**Level 4**    
    
* *Reverberation* : unchanged
* *Thunderburn* : removed
* *Sledgehammer* now disables Structures for 5 seconds, instead of destroying 4 ammo    
* *Crowd Control* : now increase Thunderclap damage by 40%    
    
&gt; I think *Thunderburn* is at the root of one of the biggest Muradin's intern balance issue. With *Avatar* and *Healing Static*, it gives Muradin an absurd late game survivability that make any other build in his tree look bad. In this thought-process, I reworked *Crowd Control* so it doesn't become the *Thunderburn* of the poor man, and btw allows Muradin to get some extra waveclear    


    
**Level 7**    
    
* *Piercing Bolt* : unchanged    
* *Iron-forged Momentum* : cooldown reduction reduced to **0.6** per AA (from 0.75)    
* *Landing Momentum* : removed
* *Heavy Impact* :
    * moved from level 16
    * **New functionality** : now increase Dwarf Toss' slow to 60% (from 40%) and decay over 2 seconds (from 1)    
* *Skull-cracker* :
    * **New functionality** : your AAs increase your next AA damage by 15% within 1.5 seconds and refresh this cooldown. Stack up to 3 times    
    
&gt; I decided to tune down *Iron-forged Momentum* because it is Muradin's most OP talent and almost halves the basic cooldowns in teamfight. I moved *Heavy Impact* here because, as you could guess, I deleted the previous effect from Muradin's tree and added it to Avatar, and this name suited this effect better than *Landing Momentum* :p . Finally, I reworked *Skull-cracker*, the forgotten talent, because I think it can't be balanced in its current state; so I tried to keep the idea that Muradin breaks his opponent skull by hitting the same spot again and again.    


    
**Level 13**    
    
* *Burning Rage* : unchanged    
* *Healing Static* : unchanged    
* *Thunder Strike* : unchanged    
* *Spell Shield* removed        
* **New** *Safety Wind* : *Second Wind* now grants a 632 shield for 2 seconds when activated    
    
&gt; I know what you think: ""retard, u didnt touch Healing Static, but its the biggest issue, u noob !!!"". Well, I thought about it, but without Thunderclap and health reduced on both Muradin and Avatar, I think HS becomes way more balanced. This talent tier is well balanced imho, I just removed *Spell Shield because it was too similar to the new *Second Wind* effect    


    
**Level 16**    
    
* *Give 'em the Axe !* : unchanged    
* *Imposing Presence* : unchanged    
* *Stoneform* is no longer on the trait key    
* *Heavy Impact* : moved to level 7    
* *Dwarf Launch* : reworked
    * Increase Dwarf Toss range by 50%
    * **Quest** : after you hit 10 heroes with Dwarf Toss, reduce its cooldown by 4 seconds    
    
&gt; I think that without *Heavy Impact* dominating this tier, it is one of the most balanced and fun level 16 of the game. I just decided to remove the impact radius bonus on Dwarf Launch to not make it too powerfull with Avatar. The first time I created a D-talent that increase the duration of *Second Wind* but it would have create with the level 1, 13 and 20 talents what I want to destroy in Muradin's kit: a synergy between talents that is so big it destroys all talent diversity.    


    
**Level 20**    
    
* *Rewind* : unchanged    
* *Grand Slam*: unchanged    
* *Unstoppable force* : **new functionality**
    * Increase the health bonus of *Avatar* by 30%
    * Reduce the duration of stuns, roots and slows by 75%
    * When Muradin is stunned or rooted, increase his movespeed by 10% for 8 seconds. Stack up to 4 times    
* **New** *Iron-forge Spirit* : when *Second Wind* is activ, send back 40% of the damage done to Muradin to the aggressors.    
    
&gt; I redesigned *Unstoppable Force* to feel really ""unstoppable"" by ""physical CCs"", as if he was so kind of Juggernaut. I also found the idea of a damage repulsion on D very cool: imagine if a Li Ming or a Chromie puts all her damage you and then you activate this talent at the right moment, the Ming/Chromie almost kills herself xD    
    
.    
.    
    
Level | 1 | 2| 3 | 4 |
------ | - | - | --| - |
1 | (!) Perfect Storm (Q) | **Small but Agile (D)** | **Resistant Dwarf (D)** | ... |
4 | Sledgehammer (Q) | Crowd Control (W) | Reverberation (W) | ... |
7 | *Heavy Impact (E)* | Iron-forged Momentum (Passive) | Piercing Bolt (Q) | Skull-cracker (Passive) |
10 | Avatar (R1) | Haymaker (R2) | ... | ... |
13 | Thunder Strike (W) | Healing Static (W) | Burning Rage (Passive) | **Safety Wind (D)** |
16 | Give 'em the Axe ! (Passive) | Imposing Presence (Active) | Stoneform (Active) | (!) Dwarf Launch (E) |
20 | Unstoppable Force (R1) | Grand Slam (R2) | Rewind (Active) | **Iron-forge Spirit (D)** |
* **Bold** is new
* *Italic* is moved
    
.    
.    
So this is a huge rework as you see, and keep in mind that it isn't that much a rework to balance more Muradin, but a rework to make him funner and healthier for the game :)    
.    
.    
.

5bt1wn,0,2016-11-08,Muradin's rework: my ideas (HUGE text !),MonsieurVirgule,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5bt1wn/muradins_rework_my_ideas_huge_text/,"Hi !    
    
It seems there is a problem with Muradin, as we see him everywhere with a huge difference between high and low level play. As a 350+ games Muradin player, I would like to expose you my ideas, because the previous nerfs Blizzard made to him struck more his fun than his viability *imho*.    
.    
    
I think what Muradin doesn't have at this moment is counters and means to play around his gameplay. I'd also like to make him more easy to understand; indeed, as his winrate says, he seems to be a easy hero to understand, but in fact he is very different than it seems.    
[**HERE IS A LINK for those who do not know/remember everything on Muradin**](http://www.heroesnexus.com/talent-calculator/22-muradin#WAA)    
My humble will is to give him a real **unique** design    
.    
.    
.    
**MY PATCHNOTE** (btw all numbers are level-1-based, not level 0)    
   
.    
Health decreased from 2659 to **2526**    
    
.    
**Abilities**    
    
* Thunderclap (W) :
    * radius decreased by **25%**
    * slow increased to **30%**    
    
* Dwarf Toss (E) :    
    * Doesn't grant Resistant anymore    
    * Now grants Resistant when landing on an enemy and decreases hit enemy heroes' movespeed by 30%, which decays over 1 second.    
    
Second Wind (D) :    
    * Now heals Muradin by **159** (instead of 106) per second when he's below 40% health, and **20** (instead of 54) when he is above.
    * Activate to reduce all damages by 50% for 2 seconds (*Cooldown*: 30 seconds)    
    
&gt; I made the change on W to make the ability more impactfull and less ""just-hit-the-key"". For E, I think Blizzard want to make it a good engage abilty, but it is more often used as an escape; so I redesigned it in a way that when Muradin uses it to escape, he loses a lot of value, as ETC when he Powerslide away for example. And finally, I changed E in a way Muradin has an other way than his HP pool to absorb damage in early game, and is not forced to pick Avatar to tank in mid-end game. Also, poke damage on Muradin won't be as uneffectiv anymore, and this change matches his idea design way more imho: ""Jumps around the battlefield and stuns Heroes. **Rapidly regenerates Health as he nears death.**""
    
.    
    
**Ultimates**    


    
Avatar:
    * cooldown increased from 90 to **100** seconds
    * health bonus decreased from 1169 to 632
    * Increase Stormbolt's lenght and width by 30%
    * Increase Thunderclap's radius by 50% and slow to 35%
    * Dwarf Toss stuns enemies hit for 0.5 second   


    
Haymaker:
    * Mana cost increased to **100** (from 80)
    * Knockback reduced by 15%
    * Now follows the direction of a vector (still a point&amp;click ability yet)    
    
&gt; Avatar was arguably the most boring ultimate in this game: it was viable, but not fun at all, and what do we search in a video game ? I wanted to make the ability **feel** more impactfull, so I imagined upgraded abilities. Avatar has always put shadow over Haymaker, and I would like to change that and make it a viable ability. In its current form, I think Haymaker can't be viable without a ridiculous cooldown/damage, as Muradin as to invest too many parts of his kit and sacrifice a too much survivability to get any decent Haymaker. As Blizzard introduced vectorial abilities with Alarak's W or Ragnaros' Rolling Stone, I felt Haymaker could benefit from it.    


   
    
**Talents**    
    


**Level 1**    
    
* *Block* removed    
* *Third Wind* removed    
* *Perfect Storm* :
    * No longer reduce Stormbolt's mana cost
    * After 25 heroes hit, increase Stormbolt stun's duration by 0.5 seconds (so 1.75 sec)    
* **New** *Small but Agile* : increase *Second Wind* 's AA damage mitigation to 100% for 3 seconds    
* **New** *Resistant Dwarf* : increase *Second Wind* 's ability damage mitigation to 75%, but also increase its cooldown by 10 seconds    
    
&gt; I think *Perfect Storm* deserves to be a real quest (as for Falstad's lvl 1 Q quest). I also want Muradin to choose between tankiness and damage, and the kind of damage he's able to soak    


    
**Level 4**    
    
* *Reverberation* : unchanged
* *Thunderburn* : removed
* *Sledgehammer* now disables Structures for 5 seconds, instead of destroying 4 ammo    
* *Crowd Control* : now increase Thunderclap damage by 40%    
    
&gt; I think *Thunderburn* is at the root of one of the biggest Muradin's intern balance issue. With *Avatar* and *Healing Static*, it gives Muradin an absurd late game survivability that make any other build in his tree look bad. In this thought-process, I reworked *Crowd Control* so it doesn't become the *Thunderburn* of the poor man, and btw allows Muradin to get some extra waveclear    


    
**Level 7**    
    
* *Piercing Bolt* : unchanged    
* *Iron-forged Momentum* : cooldown reduction reduced to **0.6** per AA (from 0.75)    
* *Landing Momentum* : removed
* *Heavy Impact* :
    * moved from level 16
    * **New functionality** : now increase Dwarf Toss' slow to 60% (from 40%) and decay over 2 seconds (from 1)    
* *Skull-cracker* :
    * **New functionality** : your AAs increase your next AA damage by 15% within 1.5 seconds and refresh this cooldown. Stack up to 3 times    
    
&gt; I decided to tune down *Iron-forged Momentum* because it is Muradin's most OP talent and almost halves the basic cooldowns in teamfight. I moved *Heavy Impact* here because, as you could guess, I deleted the previous effect from Muradin's tree and added it to Avatar, and this name suited this effect better than *Landing Momentum* :p . Finally, I reworked *Skull-cracker*, the forgotten talent, because I think it can't be balanced in its current state; so I tried to keep the idea that Muradin breaks his opponent skull by hitting the same spot again and again.    


    
**Level 13**    
    
* *Burning Rage* : unchanged    
* *Healing Static* : unchanged    
* *Thunder Strike* : unchanged    
* *Spell Shield* removed        
* **New** *Safety Wind* : *Second Wind* now grants a 632 shield for 2 seconds when activated    
    
&gt; I know what you think: ""retard, u didnt touch Healing Static, but its the biggest issue, u noob !!!"". Well, I thought about it, but without Thunderclap and health reduced on both Muradin and Avatar, I think HS becomes way more balanced. This talent tier is well balanced imho, I just removed *Spell Shield because it was too similar to the new *Second Wind* effect    


    
**Level 16**    
    
* *Give 'em the Axe !* : unchanged    
* *Imposing Presence* : unchanged    
* *Stoneform* is no longer on the trait key    
* *Heavy Impact* : moved to level 7    
* *Dwarf Launch* : reworked
    * Increase Dwarf Toss range by 50%
    * **Quest** : after you hit 10 heroes with Dwarf Toss, reduce its cooldown by 4 seconds    
    
&gt; I think that without *Heavy Impact* dominating this tier, it is one of the most balanced and fun level 16 of the game. I just decided to remove the impact radius bonus on Dwarf Launch to not make it too powerfull with Avatar. The first time I created a D-talent that increase the duration of *Second Wind* but it would have create with the level 1, 13 and 20 talents what I want to destroy in Muradin's kit: a synergy between talents that is so big it destroys all talent diversity.    


    
**Level 20**    
    
* *Rewind* : unchanged    
* *Grand Slam*: unchanged    
* *Unstoppable force* : **new functionality**
    * Increase the health bonus of *Avatar* by 30%
    * Reduce the duration of stuns, roots and slows by 75%
    * When Muradin is stunned or rooted, increase his movespeed by 10% for 8 seconds. Stack up to 4 times    
* **New** *Iron-forge Spirit* : when *Second Wind* is activ, send back 40% of the damage done to Muradin to the aggressors.    
    
&gt; I redesigned *Unstoppable Force* to feel really ""unstoppable"" by ""physical CCs"", as if he was so kind of Juggernaut, while other kind of cc (Silence, Poly, Fear) still have a normal effect on him. I also found the idea of a damage repulsion on D very cool: imagine if a Li Ming or a Chromie puts all her damage on you and then you activate this talent at the right moment, the Ming/Chromie almost kills herself xD    
    
.    
.    
    
Level | 1 | 2| 3 | 4 |
------ | - | - | --| - |
1 | (!) Perfect Storm (Q) | **Small but Agile (D)** | **Resistant Dwarf (D)** | ... |
4 | Sledgehammer (Q) | Crowd Control (W) | Reverberation (W) | ... |
7 | *Heavy Impact (E)* | Iron-forged Momentum (Passive) | Piercing Bolt (Q) | Skull-cracker (Passive) |
10 | Avatar (R1) | Haymaker (R2) | ... | ... |
13 | Thunder Strike (W) | Healing Static (W) | Burning Rage (Passive) | **Safety Wind (D)** |
16 | Give 'em the Axe ! (Passive) | Imposing Presence (Active) | Stoneform (Active) | (!) Dwarf Launch (E) |
20 | Unstoppable Force (R1) | Grand Slam (R2) | Rewind (Active) | **Iron-forge Spirit (D)** |
* **Bold** is new
* *Italic* is moved
    
.    
.    
So this is a huge rework as you see, and keep in mind that it isn't that much a rework to balance more Muradin, but a rework to make him funner and healthier for the game :)    
.    
.    
.    
**Please give me your feedback on the changes and ask if you want to know anything of my thought-process, I'd appreciate it a lot** *^as ^I ^spent ^several ^hours ^thinking, ^writing ^and ^FORMATTING ^to ^offer ^you ^this ^post ^xD*

My best guesses are:

Pres - Bad hair, shouts over people, doesn't deal with criticism well, built a corporate empire, claims the Patriots love him. If I didn't know what they looked like I would say Pres and Trump were separated at birth. Team Trump

Feits - Couldnt be more #withher unless he crawled inside her fucking white pantsuit

Big Cat - Trump has said he doesnt drink or do drugs, and tries to eat healthy. Rough blow for the Chaw Dawgz, Vape boys, and general way BC lives his life. No way he can swing for a candidate who lives like this. Team Hillary. As an aside, he says he doesnt care about politics but follows a hell of a lot of interesting political pundits on twitter.

Intern Tex - Trump, that was a no brainer

Smitty - His head is a square, which has eight points. No way that head lets him vote for a campaign who doesnt even have three they can string together. Team Hillary

Nate - Jill Stein. She'll get whatever vaccine they used to turn him into the the hobgoblin he is today banned from the public.

Hank - He's been on the inside, he knows what life is like in the can. He doesn't think Hillary can survive this if Trump gets elected. Team Hillary, but only to save her from the clink.

KFC - His questionably racist, angry tirades would fit in quite well at a Trump rally. Nevertheless, the roommate has his nuts in a vise, and she's Team Clinton.

PFT - Women gota stick together #sheswithher

Any others I missed?"

I'm currently working with SQL Server and so far I've been creating simple stored procedures and working with a test framework(tSQLt) creating unit tests and understanding how the current database is structured and works.

As it's not really structured like it is in university with no guidelines, I was thinking of setting myself some specific goals to keep me motivated and on-track.

What skills would be useful for me to learn that recruiters or employers would expect or like to see on my resume for a person who has a year experience in database development? 

Where can my career path take me if I'm quite good with Software Development as well?

5btqll,13,2016-11-08,How much of your skill-set is self-taught?,sickleandsuckle,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5btqll/how_much_of_your_skillset_is_selftaught/,"I ask this because I'm curious as to the extent the student is responsible for his learning and career preparation. I already know that a student is responsible for learning the material and doing homework. I already know that a student is responsible for seeking enrichment such as internships, research, etc. if they want them. 

But how much of the skillset you have, by the time you graduate, will be self-taught? Did you guys have to learn programming languages, for example, on your own time, which ended up being crucial for career prospects / graduate school? Are there any other skills that you learned (and needed) in a similar fashion?

Basically, what I want to say is, can I rely on my school's academics to provide me with all the skills and resources needed for career success, or is there a fair bit I must do of my own accord, beyond what is usually stated (e.g. internships, research). 

If there is a lot of skills I'll have to learn on my own, I should really cut down on my gaming..."

First time poster, but long time lurker on many of the programming/ cs-related subs around here. 

#A Little Background:

I am graduating this May and have worked in development positions the last two years. My grades are generally good and more importantly, I pursue my own projects outside of school, which I think is invaluable. 

I worked as sort of a backend dev (mainly scripting in Powershell and building DBs) as a Sophomore/Junior, and then got a full-stack development internship last summer that went well enough to get a job offer. I ended up turning the job offer down since I am trying to move to the PNW (Seattle suburbs or Portland) and wanted to to minimize the distractions during my senior year. I am trying to move towards the end of the summer to give myself a break to recharge/ finish up a few personal projects (and hopefully contribute more to open-source), but I am flexible. 

So far I have applied to a couple larger companies that had level 1 developer/ analyst positions listed on their career sites, but I haven't really gained any traction. I put my name into the Microsoft student feeder program thing, but am skeptical about that too. I have been contacted by Amazon since I applied last year, but I do not plan on pursuing it.

#My questions:

What is the best way to approach tech companies in the west? Is there a good avenue for discussion or should I just try to message people on Linkedin? How does it look seeing an internship on a resume that didn't result in a job? Will this be a deterrent?
How would it look to take 3 months off after school instead of jumping right into a job? Are there popular hiring periods in the year?

I have one connection to reach out to, and I will be pursuing them, but is there a better way to start?

5bu1et,3,2016-11-08,"Me [20/F] with my boyfriend [23/M] of over 3 years, am I asking too much or is he just being flaky?",bowling4alphabetsoup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5bu1et/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_23m_of_over_3_years_am_i/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years, as the title says.

A few months after we began dating, he moved out of his parent's house for the first time and lived in an apartment with two of his friends. They only stayed there for a year and decided not to renew the lease, so he moved back home with his parents.

We've talked about moving out together, but every time I try to make a game plan so we can accomplish this he just flakes out and doesn't do his part. He says that he doesn't make enough to save up his money, but he spends $60 on weed every week... that's $240 that essentially goes out of the window every month. He goes on and on about how we shouldn't move out if we don't have the proper funds saved up, meanwhile I have over $1000 saved up while he barely even seems to be trying.

This has definitely been a source of contention in our relationship. When I bring it up to him (i.e. asking him if he doesn't want to move out, asking him if we need to rework some stuff, etc.) he always says that he does want us to move out together but that he just can't swing it right now. We've been discussing this for over a year and although he knows that his current financial situation isn't exactly working, he does nothing to try to change it. To me, that says that we value different things.

This is really beginning to become a more concrete issue for me because starting Fall 2017, I'll be transferring to a university that is in a major city in my state. I currently live an hour and a half away from this city, 2 - 2.5 hours away if there is traffic. I've told him repeatedly that I really need to move closer to my school before transferring, but he still doesn't seem to get it... Not sure why, his school is nearly as far as mine and he sits in rush hour traffic for over an hour nearly every morning and complains about it constantly.

I feel like a lot of this stems from his general apathy. Of course he has many amazing qualities, but some of his worst include that he is quite lazy, unmotivated, and... almost too comfortable? To a problematic point. He is hesitant about change and often refuses to go after things for himself. An example being his college internship: He was supposed to be doing one this upcoming summer but he kept putting it off and now won't be able to because he missed multiple orientation emails, a job fair, and just never even bothered to look into it at all. This is something that is time sensitive and has to be done before he can graduate.

I definitely love him but lately I've started to feel like I'm dating a bit of a man child... This was cool when I was 17 and we began dating, but as I mature he seems to be getting left behind. I genuinely value my relationship with him and he is my best friend. I see so much potential in him but his apathetic approach to life seems to be damaging our relationship and possibly his own future.

Am I overreacting about this? Or does his behavior indicate that this is likely a permanent issue that will be difficult to resolve?

  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend is apathetic about moving out and about responsibilities in general. Is there anything that I can do?"

Just a quick background:  

* Taiwanese girlfriend of 1 year has just recently came to Australia to work for a year. 
* She is currently living in my apartment, with rent and bills fully paid by me. 
* Her mum doesnt allow couples to live together before marriage
* Lied to her saying she rented her own apartment
* GF is financially independent from parents

So two months have passed and her mum now wants to visit Australia for a week or two. Since she doesnt want her mum to find out we are living together, she basically asked me to live in a hotel for a week with expenses paid by her. I didnt really like the idea since it is a big hassle to move all my things as well as my two cats(her mum is allergic to cats). I will also be starting a new full time internship by then alongside my university studies. I suggested to her instead to tell her mum we are living together but she refused because apparently her mum previously had a panic attack due to a similar experience. 

I'm kind of pissed of right now because im covering 80% of her expenses and I have to move out of my own apartment. But I'm not sure whether to be pissed at her, or at her mum. I've met her mother before and don't really like her that well because she has a very traditional view towards relationship (no sex before marriage).I also think shes a bit of a control freak in regards to her daughters life.

So guys, what are my options as I think its quite stupid that her mum thinks she will be cooking dinner at her daughters apartment and inviting me over when in fact I'm getting kicked out of my own place. 

I'ved tried letting go of this issue and just let it happen, but the more I think about it, the more it makes me irritated! 

**tl;dr**

* GF came to australia to work
* Her mum wants to visit
* Her mum doesnt allow couples to live together
* Apartment and bills paid by me
* I have to live in a hotel as a result

Can I even get an internship? I need to create some side projects to show. I would love to get an internship at a music industry company or tech/gaming company. That would be awesome. Any ideas or places to apply and learn? 


A helpful walkthrough on how to find internships to apply too would be helpful! I have a lot of great places I would love to intern.

5buq8e,1,2016-11-08,Repeatedly Disappointing My Parents,throwaway20010312412,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5buq8e/repeatedly_disappointing_my_parents/,"I suppose my story begins about a year and a half ago. I left for college, feeling ready. I was so excited to finally be on my own and show my parents that I was ready to make decisions for myself. Though I started well, about halfway through fall semester last year, I started skipping classes and it got so bad that I had to drop most of my classes. I told my parents what happened and they were very forgiving and still supportive. 

Second semester rolls around and I start smoking a lot of weed, like everyday. I quickly turn back to skipping classes despite telling my parents that I was fine and doing well in all my classes. This was also about the time that I started feeling depressed. 

Towards the end of the semester, I sent my parents a long email saying that I fucked up bad and basically explained that I was feeling depressed but I left out the part about smoking weed because my parents are very anti-weed. They called me a few hours later and after a lot of long talks and crying, we decided that they would start being much more involved in my life. 

During the summer, I was on top of the world. I got a great internship, started getting in shape, and had a lot of time to be with friends and family. Over the summer, I smoked with my friends just about everyday but it was only at night when I was done with all my responsibilities. At some point though, my parents discovered my weed habit and blew up. It was a rough couple days but it resolved by telling my parents that I would stop. But I didn't stop. 

Now this semester, I left again, feeling confident that this was going to be the semester where I turned it all around and started caring about my future. I started very strong, getting all my assignments done, working out still, but still smoking weed when I had my stuff done. But over time it got worse and I stopped going to classes again, just like before. Instead, I smoked weed and played Xbox. Now I'm in a similar situation and I can only pass one of my classes. 

Despite all of this, I don't know if I've fell back into depression but I don't know what to do. I think I need to go back home for at least a semester but I don't know how to tell my parents. I've already disappointed them so much in the last year and a half and wasted thousands of dollars in tuition money. I hate myself for hurting them over and over and over and I just can't fathom having to do it to them again. Since I found out how I can't pass my classes (only the past few days), this has been eating at me constantly. I feel like I need to come completely clean to my parents and tell them basically this entire post. But I just can't see how they could still forgive and love me after this because I hate myself for putting myself in this situation. 

I've thought about many different scenarios from running away to killing myself but the thought of my parents getting a call from the police saying that I killed myself makes me physically sick to my stomach. 

I simply don't know what to do. Will my parents forgive me? How could they possibly still love me after this? Is this what a drug addict feels like when they go back? I don't know if anyone else has ever done something like this but I feel like a real piece of shit.

On a side note, I'm about to stop smoking weed for a long time until I feel like I have control of my life."
5busdb,2620,2016-11-08,M/21/5'7''. 3 Year Transformation. 130 lbs to 160 lbs. My journey from the scrawny soccer player to what I am today.,janolan,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5busdb/m2157_3_year_transformation_130_lbs_to_160_lbs_my/,"So after almost 3 years of lifting I feel proud enough to share my journey with you all. [Here's the transformation for those who don't like to read all about it](http://imgur.com/SRLiqaI)

**Where everything started**

I was always the scrawny kid. I played soccer since I was 6 years old and was pretty athletic - but that was it. I was about 130 lbs (59 kg) at 5'7'' (170 cm) when I turned 18.
After finishing high school in Germany, I was given the opportunity to go to the US for a year and work as an intern. During that time I started something called Freeletics, a german bodyweight / cardio program, which promised great muscular results after 12 weeks. I completely neglected my diet and even lost weight during that time. I quit about half way through and decided I had to gain weight no matter what it takes.

**Going to the gym in the states**

I started going to the high school gym (the high school my guest families kids went to) about two or three times a week, where we followed a training regime given to us by the gym coach. He actually thought I was an exchange student for about half a year, haha. It was pretty much a full body powerlifting workout. We deadlifted, squatted and benched, doing a few acessories here and there. I was really lucky to have proper guidance from the start, so I didn't waste a lot of time doing uneffective workouts. He also drilled us to eat a lot. I pretty much used myfitnesspal from the get go (shooting for 3500 kcal in my first year) and bulked to about 148 lbs (67 kg). I think I benched 185 lbs (84 kg), squatted 250 lbs (113 kg) and deadlifted 275 lbs (125 kg) when I left the states.

**Back home**

Back in Germany I moved out to study in a bigger city about 4 hours away from home. Now I could cook for myself and go the gym without relying on someone to drive me! I was psyched. I started a PPL routine, but soon switched to a classic upper lower split, due to schedule issues. I just couldn't make it to the gym 6 times a week. I continue to follow this routine until today. Bench is 250 lbs (113 kg). I haven't actually squatted or deadlifted in a long time. The last time I deadlifted, my 1 rep max was 350 lbs (160 kg).

Upper:

Bench Press 3x6-8
Incline DB Press 3x6-8
T-bar Rows 3x6-8
Close grip lat pulldowns 3x6-8
Overhead Press 2x6-8
Later DB Raises 2x6-10
Incline seated DB curles 3x6-10
Overhead DB Tricep Press 3x6-10

Lower:

Hacksquats 3x6-8
Leg Press 3x6-8
SLDL 3x6-8
Lying leg curls 3x6-10
Machine calf raises 3x8-12
Cables Crunches 3x8-12

**What my diet looks like right now**

Honestly, I have never cut in my life, so I only know how to ride the bulk train. My heaviest was around 170 lbs (77 kg), but after a few months of not being able to lift I am back at around 160 lbs (73 kg) at the moment. I shoot for 3200 kcal (at least 130 g protein). A nice clean, slow bulk. Due to dairy and nut intolerances that I just discovered I have had to change quite a bit in my diet.

Breakfast (800 kcal):

2 rolls with chocolate spread
Glas of juice and cup of coffee

Lunch (500 kcal):

Toast with margerine and sliced chicken breast
Roasted Sunflower seeds as a side, just to snack on

Shake (900 kcal):

Oats, Soymilk, frozen berries, a banana, linseeds and olive oil

Dinner (1000 kcal):

This varies a lot. I try to get a good amount of protein at dinner. I like stir-frying and steak with sweet potatoes and veggies, and so on - anything's allowed as along as I hit my 1000 kcal.

Of course I try to sleep as much as possible. I get in about 8 hours every night, weekends vary. I am sure I could have had even better progress cutting out alcohol completely, but I can honestly say that a few beers on the weekend really didn't kill my gains.

**Supplements**

5 g creatine
Fish oil
Whey protein (I stopped putting it in my shake when I discovered my dairy intolerance)

**Final words**

Can't describe how lifting benefited my life. It taught me discipline and made me much more confident. The first few months in 2016 were hard for me, I wasn't able to workout consistently due to work related stuff and lost quite a bit of the muscle. I was devasted how weak I was when I got back in the gym, but I pushed myself and started building the habit again. For me it is all about building habits. After 3 years one would think it is a no brainer to get off the couch and go the work out, but for me it is a continious struggle to stay motiviated. Eating enough is super hard for meas well and I have to remind myself everday to hit my goal, but when you're persistant and trust the process without looking to far into the future and being overwhelmed by the path in front of you, everything is possible. 

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words! The Captain America comparison made me chuckle multiple times - I'm very honored. If you have any more questions about my routine, diet, etc., feel free to send me a message, I'll try to respond to everyone."
5bv1br,9,2016-11-08,"32 yo, ""Meh"" Pension Total Would Eliminate Current Debt. Cash out?",ThrowMyBreathAway84,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5bv1br/32_yo_meh_pension_total_would_eliminate_current/,"Hi all, 

Never asked for financial advice from anyone, figured here (as a longtime Redditor) would be a good place to start. 

*I am 32 years old in my 10th year as a seasonal employee with a big and popular company that's stringing me along. I didn't get my degree until age 29, can't move up in the company, having trouble getting other job offers, regretting most of my time with this company, WAY behind the 8-ball right now. I'm back home with the parents and working side jobs, gigs and internships, but that doesn't seem to be aiding my job search.*

**That's the motivation, now the question:**

All I really have to show for my time with this company is about $25K in pension  (in which I'm 100% vested).

I have $35K in student loan debt (pretty much my only debt that's left, but I'm paying close to $500 a month with it).

If I save up until February-March (when my seasonal contract ends), and pension is taxed 20% (total of when I take it out and on my income taxes), I'll have $20,000, plus about $15,000 saved up to completely pay my student loan debt, thus bringing me completely out of debt, as far as I know (I just paid off my car last month). 

The $25K my pension is over 10 years, and I've been trying to leave the company for some time now, so I don't see it going up much. 

Is it still wise to cash it out and use it now, or should I continue with student loan debt and save that money until retirement? 

I've felt like a total failure in recent years, so I'd like to make this move to make myself feel better... but I don't want to do it if I'd be losing too much at retirement age to justify the move now.

Thanks for reading, guys.

5bv2sa,2,2016-11-08,"Feeling like I'm overly criticized for my work/portfolio at one job interview, but not the other. Is this normal?",kemaskitty21,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/5bv2sa/feeling_like_im_overly_criticized_for_my/,"Before I begin, I would like to state something. I'm pretty much a self started graphic designer. I went to school online for video game design (yes, I was one of those people who fell for those commercials. Big mistake). I originally wanted to do animation or concept art. I can sketch pretty well, but my animation skills are crap. After some brief introduction to Photoshop and Illustrator in college, I decided to use this as a base for a new career path. 

I know I have a lot of growing/learning to do and I'm not afraid to express that to potential employers. I've had an internship and freelance jobs in the past which I feel has got me pretty far considering. But lately all the places I've applied make me feel like a failure.

I currently work at a small newspaper that's quickly dieing out (which is why I'm job hunting). I make newspaper advertisements as well as niche projects for local businesses and restaurants like menus, placemats, brochures, etc. I keep physical and digital samples of these for my portfolio to show employers. I mainly use InDesign, Photoshop &amp; Quark. I use Illustrator on my own from time to time but my job &lt;u&gt;does not&lt;/u&gt; require me to design vector graphics and logos. 

This year I had 3 job interviews. 

&lt;b&gt;1st interview: Another newspaper&lt;/b&gt;
This place was closer to home and is considered a top notch company of the area. They seemed to like my resume and portfolio. I was given a computer test where I had to design an advertisement for a car dealership. While they didn't tell me if I passed that or not, they did offer me a job. However it was part time (even though I applied for full time) and the pay was worse than what I currently have. Turned down the offer.

&lt;b&gt;2nd interview: Sports shop &lt;/b&gt;
This place was looking for a full time graphic designer to help design sports gear for teams. I should've known from the get go that applying for a position where they were looking for a ""superstar"" was a bad idea. Aside from the awful interviewing experience I had endured (didn't read my resume, didn't look at my portfolio, wouldn't answer my questions, etc) he specified looking for someone proficient in Illustrator. I did elaborate that I'm a bit rusty but know my way around. They then gave me ""homework"" to replicate or redesign. They didn't have any kind of copyright policy and wanted me to put Thor on a wrestling singlet to email back to them. I noped right out of that in a hurry!

&lt;b&gt;3rd interview: Printing company&lt;/b&gt;
This place was very strange. I was on Zip Recruiter when this job popped up in the beginning of October. There were no job specifications other than it was entry level. I applied anyway, because why not? A whole month later this guy emails me to come in for an interview. When I was there it felt like I was in a principal office being told I did something wrong. He looked over my portfolio and samples of my work and said he'd rather see college work samples. I explained I didn't have any and that college was 7 years ago. I tend to portray my best work and not something I attempted at 18 years old on Windows XP in Illustrator CS2...
He then told me that my portfolio only portrayed that I can make ads and shows no typography skills or shows that I have a sense of design. But I thought samples of my work meant I have a sense of design? And that's what this place does - they advertise. I can understand why he asked about typography, but why ask about making logos when they don't even really do that?

Basically, I'm frustrated and confused. One place loves my work, another place thinks it's garbage (and it hurts to hear that). Is there no fine line to this whole thing? I thought being called in to interview meant they were considering me, not bash me? Am I too sensitive? I've been designing for 3 years now and I'm trying to improve whatever I can.

5bv8bq,10,2016-11-08,Computer Science at IU,fru1tn1nja,IndianaUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/5bv8bq/computer_science_at_iu/,"Hello, I am a high school senior looking to major in computer science. My two main choices for colleges at the moment are Purdue and IU, and I wanted to ask any current or former IU computer science students what their thoughts were on the program at IU. I know Purdue's computer science program is well-respected around the country, but from what I've heard, it's extremely hard to do well in it and takes a huge amount of time and effort to succeed. Reviews from a number of Purdue CS students I've seen have been negative. I also currently live and grew up in Lafayette, so it would be nice to go somewhere else for a change.

From what I can see, IU's computer science program is fairly good too, not as highly ranked as Purdue's, but still respectable. Most of the IU CS students say they love the program, and many quickly find high-paying jobs soon after they graduate. I would love to hear a CS student's point of view on the Purdue and IU programs (besides the fact that this is in an IU subreddit and its probably a sin to mention the name of Purdue at all) and how hard CS classes are at IU, how hard it is to get an internship / job after graduation, are there a lot of employers who think an IU CS degree holds weight, etc. Thanks!"
5bvcj9,1,2016-11-08,I feel depressed and like my life isn't exciting or interesting.,pinktips0904,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5bvcj9/i_feel_depressed_and_like_my_life_isnt_exciting/,"Hi guys, the winter blues are here I think. I have pretty bad depression in the winter, and tried to go off my antidepressant about a month ago but changed my mind, so I'm still taking that. One of the things that makes me feel so depressed is just how straight up boring my life is. I'm a 20 year old college student at a small public state school in the Midwest. The town is in the middle of nowhere and there's not much to do or see here. It's about as lame as it sounds. There's a biggish ""city"" about 1.5 hours away that my friends and I will go to sometimes, but the only thing to really do there is eat and shop, and since we are broke college students that isn't always the best option for us. I do have a lot going for me and there is a lot of stuff I do and have done that I can feel proud about. Older adults like my parents, teachers, counselors, and bosses tell me that I have everything in ""spades"" and am a beautiful girl with a bright future. Sure, I guess, but I feel like while I might have things going for me, I just don't have a lot going on. Like there's not much I actually ""do"" that I get joy out of. I feel like a boring robot.

I'm studying computer science, so there aren't many girls in my classes, so I only have a couple of girl friends. I have guy friends, I guess, but they're just my friends in class. We don't do much of anything outside of class. I do have things to look forward to, like getting a pretty decent paying internship next summer in the ""biggish city"" but it's not all that great. This past weekend I visited one of my friends that lives in DC and it was honestly such a fun adventure. There is so much to do and see there even outside of all the touristy stuff and I just feel like I am missing out on so much. Upon returning yesterday, I have just been in the most miserable mood. 

I feel like a lame-o that lives in farmland and like I don't have much substance. When people ask me what I like to do or what I feel passionate about, I don't even know what to tell them. Honestly, there isn't much I'm passionate about/interested in/like to do. I chose computer science because I wanted a well paying job and since I don't like anything else anyways. I'm not bad at it, and get decent grades, but I'm not a crazy computer nerd or anything. I've had one CS internship already and another one lined up for next summer. I don't know, I just feel really upset. I feel like my life is a repeat cycle of get up, go to class, go to work, do homework, sleep, repeat. I know that's what college is but even when I graduate next December I feel like it will be the same pattern, just working instead of going to school. Would moving out of the Midwest help me? I'd like to live somewhere with more culture/scenery/things to do, but I still feel like at the heart of it I will the same boring girl. I've talked to a college counselor about this, and she asks me about people that I do think I have interesting lives and what they do, and I can't even answer that either. Most of them don't live in my college town I feel. Basically I just feel really disheartened by the wintertime here, everything is dying(grass and trees and stuff), I don't have much social life and the one I do have revolves around getting blackout drunk(college town life), my personality is bland, and I feel like my life is one boring endless cycle. Is this a symptom of depression, or am I just being a little bitch about everything? I've felt like this for about a year now and it seems to really hit worse in the winter.

Advice? Input? Thanks"
5bvcm3,2,2016-11-08,[Need Review] Personal St. for Chemical engineering graduate school,hana_bana,PersonalStatement,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalStatement/comments/5bvcm3/need_review_personal_st_for_chemical_engineering/,"Hi guys please give me any feedback you have cause all the people who said they would read my personal statement haven't gotten back to me yet and I'm super desperate lol!

I am fortunate to be a senior in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of XXX with a research background in polymer synthesis and biomaterials. My interest in research has led me to pursue a doctorate in Chemical Engineering, focusing on the area of bioengineering. In addition to my enjoyment of teaching and mentorship, my passion for research makes me well suited to graduate study, and ultimately, professorship. 


I would not have been able to withstand the rigorous workload of my undergraduate career without the training I received during my ten years as a competitive gymnast. Before age 13, I was already juggling full-time studies with 3 to 4 hours of gymnastics per day, and traveling for competitions on the weekends. Over the years, I honed excellent time management skills that serve me well in my academic pursuits. I became resilient early in my life, dealing with stubborn injuries and disappointing competition results; I credit my mental toughness to my years in this unforgiving sport. Most importantly, gymnastics gave me discipline and self-motivation, two skills that are vital to success and fulfillment as a graduate student. 


I began exploring research during my fourth semester at XXX when I participated in a semester-long program called Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering (GLUE). I worked with Ph.D. candidate [name] in the Civil Engineering department, and I had the opportunity to synthesize silver nanoparticles and characterize them with UV-vis spectroscopy and DLS. The experience led me to pursue undergraduate research.

The summer following my fourth semester, I took a step away from research to explore industry during my summer internship at a small pipeline fittings manufacturing company. The small size of the company meant that I worked directly with the General Manager and CEO to design Standard Operating Procedures and solve technical problems. I found it fascinating to apply my classroom knowledge to problems that would have a tangible impact on the design of a product. However, the greatest takeaway from my internship was that I vastly preferred to explore the bounds of current knowledge with research. My internship set my course squarely on graduate school.

The fall of my junior year, Dr. XXXX invited me to do research in his polymer group, after I had communicated my interest in organic chemistry and differential equations. Indeed, polymer science combines these two areas succinctly, and I have appreciated learning to synthesize, characterize and depolymerize macromolecules for the past three semesters. Last year, I aided in the development of novel alumino-organic catalysts based on the Vandenberg catalyst. This semester, I am directing an independent project to characterize the depolymerization capability of poly(caprolactone) with the Vandenberg catalyst and other alumino-organic catalysts that I helped develop over the last two semesters. Although this project is pure polymer chemistry, it piques my interest due to its implications in biodegradable polymers, an area that is important in drug delivery and tissue scaffolding.

Following the first two semesters of polymer chemistry in the XX lab, I was eager to apply my knowledge in a biological application. The summer after my junior year, I studied mussel adhesion in the Future Leaders in Advanced Materials program at the Materials Research Laboratory of the University of California, Santa Barbara. With postdoctoral researcher XXXX in the lab of Dr. XXXX, I compared the properties of dopa and dehydro-dopa amino acid structure. Using cyclic voltammetry, I characterized the electorchemical properties of two model compounds that reflect the functional groups on dopa and dehydrodopa. I also synthesized mussel-inspired adhesives with the model compounds to compare their adhesive capabilities. The most rewarding part of my work was when I suggested adding a new component to the adhesive formula. The resulting adhesive was so effective that our machine, limited in the amount of force it was able to apply, was unable to measure the amount of force needed to cause the adhesive to fail. I presented my work at a UCSB poster competition at the end of the summer; I also gave a presentation at the Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium at Rice University in October 2016. 

Researching mussel adhesion, I observed firsthand how the complex process demanded the expertise of a vast array of scientists and engineers. Dr. Waite’s research was too fundamental for me, because of my innate need as an engineer to find a direct practical application for my work, but it showed me that I want to be in a field that combines the captivating complexity of biology with the practical applications of engineering. Fortunately, my variety of experiences allows me to transition easily into bioengineering. I am proficient in polymer chemistry and chemical engineering, and my variety of research experiences have taught me to adapt to different skill sets and working environments efficiently.

In the future, I plan to become a professor of Chemical Engineering because I enjoy mentorship and teaching as much as I enjoy reserach. As a graduate student, I hope to mentor an undergraduate, and my experiences as a mentor in a variety of settings will prepare me for this role. I currently volunteer as a science teacher for underprivileged sixth grade students as part of the XXXX program, and it is incredibly rewarding to share my love of science with the children. Many do not have educated family members, so I have the unique opportunity to demonstrate what a “real life engineer” looks like. In addition to youth outreach, I am a PAL in the Women in Engineering program, where I mentor a female freshman in engineering through her first year. 

Through two vastly different experiences, I have sharpened my ability to teach effectively. My first teaching experience was tutoring Organic Chemistry and Intro to Computing. I found it so rewarding that I am eager to become a Teaching Assistant as a graduate student; I am grateful to be able to help others succeed academically, especially because I understand how challenging it can be. Secondly, I am a volunteer coach for the XXX Gymnastics club team, instructing beginners on fundamental skills they will build upon as they advance in their abilities. As a graduate student, I will continue to invest greatly in the students I teach and mentor. 

With my experiences in many areas of science and engineering, I am well equipped to contribute to biomedical research in graduate school. My summer research in Santa Barbara familiarized me with biomaterials, and my tenure in the XXXX Polymer Group has given me a strong foundation in polymer chemistry. My natural curiosity and love of learning have motivated my success in areas ranging from fundamental research and graduate level coursework to industrial engineering. Finally, in addition to research, I am also looking forward to participating in outreach opportunities and mentoring undergraduates. [part about which labs I would want to work in.

**Where everything started**

I was always the scrawny kid. I played soccer since I was 6 years old and was pretty athletic - but that was it. I was about 130 lbs (59 kg) at 5'7'' (170 cm) when I turned 18.

I think I benched 185 lbs (84 kg), squatted 250 lbs (113 kg) and deadlifted 275 lbs (125 kg) when I left the states.

**Back home**

Back in Germany I moved out to study in a bigger city about 4 hours away from home. Now I could cook for myself and go the gym without relying on someone to drive me! I was psyched. I started a PPL routine, but soon switched to a classic upper lower split, due to schedule issues. I just couldn't make it to the gym 6 times a week. I continue to follow this routine until today.

**What my diet looks like right now**

Honestly, I have never cut in my life, so I only know how to ride the bulk train. My heaviest was around 170 lbs (77 kg), but after a few months of not being able to lift I am back at around 160 lbs (73 kg) at the moment. I shoot for 3200 kcal (at least 130 g protein). A nice clean, slow bulk. Due to dairy and nut intolerances that I just discovered I have had to change quite a bit in my diet.

Breakfast (800 kcal):

2 rolls with chocolate spread
Glas of juice and cup of coffee

Lunch (500 kcal):

Toast with margerine and sliced chicken breast
Roasted Sunflower seeds as a side, just to snack on

Shake (900 kcal):

Oats, Soymilk, frozen berries, a banana, linseeds and olive oil

Dinner (1000 kcal):

This varies a lot. I try to get a good amount of protein at dinner. I like stir-frying and steak with sweet potatoes and veggies, and so on - anything's allowed as along as I hit my 1000 kcal.

Of course I try to sleep as much as possible. I get in about 8 hours every night, weekends vary. I am sure I could have had even better progress cutting out alcohol completely, but I can honestly say that a few beers on the weekend really didn't kill my gains.

**Supplements**

5 g creatine
Fish oil
Whey protein (I stopped putting it in my shake when I discovered my dairy intolerance)

**Final words**

Can't describe how lifting benefited my life. It taught me discipline and made me much more confident. The first few months in 2016 were hard for me, I wasn't able to workout consistently due to work related stuff and lost quite a bit of the muscle. I was devasted how weak I was when I got back in the gym, but I pushed myself and started building the habit again. For me it is all about building habits. After 3 years one would think it is a no brainer to get off the couch and go the work out, but for me it is a continious struggle to stay motiviated. Eating enough is super hard for meas well and I have to remind myself everday to hit my goal, but when you're persistant and trust the process without looking to far into the future and being overwhelmed by the path in front of you, everything is possible.

5bvsbu,56,2016-11-08,M/21/5'7'' [130lbs &lt; 160lbs = 30lbs] (3 years) My journey from the scrawny soccer player to what I am today (x-post /r/Fitness),janolan,progresspics,https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/5bvsbu/m2157_130lbs_160lbs_30lbs_3_years_my_journey_from/,"So after almost 3 years of lifting I feel proud enough to share my journey with you all. [Here's the transformation for those who don't like to read all about it](http://imgur.com/SRLiqaI)

**Where everything started**

I was always the scrawny kid. I played soccer since I was 6 years old and was pretty athletic - but that was it. I was about 130 lbs (59 kg) at 5'7'' (170 cm) when I turned 18.
After finishing high school in Germany, I was given the opportunity to go to the US for a year and work as an intern. During that time I started something called Freeletics, a german bodyweight / cardio program, which promised great muscular results after 12 weeks. I completely neglected my diet and even lost weight during that time. I quit about half way through and decided I had to gain weight no matter what it takes.

**Going to the gym in the states**

I started going to the high school gym (the high school my guest families kids went to) about two or three times a week, where we followed a training regime given to us by the gym coach. He actually thought I was an exchange student for about half a year, haha. It was pretty much a full body powerlifting workout. We deadlifted, squatted and benched, doing a few acessories here and there. I was really lucky to have proper guidance from the start, so I didn't waste a lot of time doing uneffective workouts. He also drilled us to eat a lot. I pretty much used myfitnesspal from the get go (shooting for 3500 kcal in my first year) and bulked to about 148 lbs (67 kg). I think I benched 185 lbs (84 kg), squatted 250 lbs (113 kg) and deadlifted 275 lbs (125 kg) when I left the states.

**Back home**

Back in Germany I moved out to study in a bigger city about 4 hours away from home. Now I could cook for myself and go the gym without relying on someone to drive me! I was psyched. I started a PPL routine, but soon switched to a classic upper lower split, due to schedule issues. I just couldn't make it to the gym 6 times a week. I continue to follow this routine until today. Bench is 250 lbs (113 kg). I haven't actually squatted or deadlifted in a long time. The last time I deadlifted, my 1 rep max was 350 lbs (160 kg).

Upper:

Bench Press 3x6-8
Incline DB Press 3x6-8
T-bar Rows 3x6-8
Close grip lat pulldowns 3x6-8
Overhead Press 2x6-8
Later DB Raises 2x6-10
Incline seated DB curles 3x6-10
Overhead DB Tricep Press 3x6-10

Lower:

Hacksquats 3x6-8
Leg Press 3x6-8
SLDL 3x6-8
Lying leg curls 3x6-10
Machine calf raises 3x8-12
Cables Crunches 3x8-12

But I just got an offer for a software engineering internship for a local company that has a really great reputation, the pay is good, and the experience will be awesome since I want to work in software development. I am having a hard time weighing my options here, Apple is a great company to work for with some of the best benefits to offer, and the software internship is better pay and great experience but likely no tuition reimbursement as an intern and I will likely be unable to work from home until I gain their trust.

I'm pretty stoked to have gotten an offer from them since I've had no prior internship experience, and since they're pretty much a household name in the tech world. But they are obviously known more for hardware than software, which worries me a little because I really HATE writing low level code. I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but I'm hoping that I get placed on a team that doesn't deal with low level stuff. But even if I get placed on a team that doesn't deal with low level code, would having Qualcomm on my resume actually be a turn off to companies that don't do any low level stuff at all? 

I'm obviously going to work my butt off in my internship so that I can hopefully get a full time offer, but I also want to apply to other companies as well to keep my options open. Am I worrying too much, or could this actually be a problem in the future when I go through the new grad hiring process?"

---

After disgracing her lover Fergus's (Wes Bentley) respected family name by bearing an illegitimate child, of colour no less, Lena Dumark (Angela Bassett) moves town to live her life with her newborn son. 18 years later she returns to their hometown of Jensen, Ohio, with her son Stevie Dumark (Jacob Artist) as Fergus's mother Lucina (Frances Conroy), Mayoress of Jensen, has become terminally ill for unknown purposes. With Fergus still denying his existence, Stevie is forced to get a job to help support his mother (and her alcoholism) at the only place hiring in town - the town's undertakers. There, he meets the unlikely array of staff, and soon realises that the undertakers hold a lot more secrets from the light of day than Stevie would like to know.

Cast: 
- Fergus Stenfold (Wes Bentley) - Son of aristocrat Oswald Stenfold and Mayoress Lucina Stenfold, born into white privilege and money, as sees the return of his ex-lover and their child as most unwelcome. 

- Lena Dumark (Angela Bassett) - Ex-lover of Fergus, and mother of Jamie. While devoted to her child, the stress of being a single parent and of being abandoned has driven her to severe alcoholism.

- Oswald Stenfold (James Cromwell) - Wealthy aristocrat father of Fergus Stenfold, who still greatly holds a non-white prejudice and capitalist view of society, and wants to see the Dumarks gone once more. 

- Lucina Stenfold (Frances Conroy) - Wife of Oswald Stenfold, and mother of Fergus. A fragile soul, who genuinely cares about her town and has grown accustom to being oppressed by her closed-minded husband.

- Irene Stenfold (Sarah Paulson) - Trophy wife of Fergus, who is obsessed with the life of luxury, and shares the same racial prejudice and need to keep Lena away as her father-in-law. 

- Stevie Dumark (Jacob Artist) - The unfortunate, illegitimate son of Fergus and Lena. Doe-eyed, too trusting for his own good, but with a keen thirst for knowledge and integrity. 

- Andy Owings (Denis O'Hare) - Owner of 'Owings and Co.' undertakers; a tired, bitter war veteran who has nothing in life but his business, and is beginning to watch it sink in front of him, and refuses to lose his source of income. 

- Alice Sands (Taissa Farmiga) - A nervous but approachable girl from a struggling home, who is a senior in high school, and is hired alongside Stevie as one of the two new interns for Owings and Co. Love interest for Stevie. 

- Charlie Garland (Evan Peters) - The reserved, mysterious embalmer at Owings and Co. After awaking to his lover dead in her sleep, he has slowly developed necrophilic tastes. 

- Odie Tompkins (John Carroll Lynch) - An ex-convict and asylum patient, working as the Cremater of Owings and Co. His acute but growing taste for cannibalism leads to not all of the bodies reaching the fires. 

- Tula Davensby (Lily Rabe) - The floaty but focused florist at Owings and Co., who's flowers pack a surprising punch in potency. 

- Alex Davensby (Finn Wittrock) - Tula's fiance, who can sense an uncomfortability at Owings and Co. and wants he and Tula to move out of Jensen to start their married life elsewhere. 

- Jeffrey Wilson (Michael Chiklis) - The town's less than expert police chief, akin to Much Ado's Dogberry. He desperately attempts to maintain the towns peace, but his bumbling and weak-willed nature leave him devoid of the townfolks respect. 

- Jamie Lindsay (Matt Bomer) - A charming and good-looking civilian who strikes up affections for Lena, but may not be of entirely pure intent. 

- Sophie Collins (Emma Roberts) - A young girl who is aware of her beauty, and although she does not work for Owings and Co., holds the darkest secret of everyone in Jensen. 

- Loretta Vanderbill (Kathy Bates) - Chief Detective from the neighbouring town, who comes to investigate why Jensen's mortality rate is increasing as consistently as it is.

So all of CS I've taken are two 100-level courses, then three more: OOP, Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics. I didn't take any internships.

So with that said about my background, where do I go to be in demand by big companies? Do I go to a bootcamp?

So recently I have been interviewing with several companies, and I managed to get an offer from one. This company is not a tech company, but they are a very big name in the financial world. The compensation is slightly above average and the environment seems fun. They also happen to be located in my city, so I wouldn't need to search for housing, and it's an easy commute.

My general plan has been to accept this internship if I don't get an offer from a unicorn I have been interviewing with. I did my main technical interviews with the unicorn, and had planned to either accept or decline the other offer depending on how the unicorn responded. 

Today, the unicorn told me I did really well, and all my interviewers recommended me, but that I was just slightly below the mark. However, due to how close I was, I was offered another interview. This is great, and means I just need to try a bit harder, but it somewhat throws a wrench into my plans. As there is another phase after the technical interview, as well as having to deal with extra scheduling time, learning whether or not I get the unicorn will take longer than I expected.

The offer I have has no explicit deadline, but I don't think they'd be willing to wait until nearly early December for a decision from me. At the same time, that's more or less how long I'm thinking the unicorn's total process will take (due to Thanksgiving + scheduling). I'm not really sure what I should do. I've been told I should just accept the offer I have, and then tell them I'm no longer available if I get the unicorn. But that seems really unethical. Is that really a course of action I can take, with no repercussions?

I'm just so unsure of what to do. I need to have an internship this Summer, but the unicorn is actually my end goal. Any advice on how to navigate the situation? "

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

5bxdfw,13,2016-11-08,[Personal] My Skin Has Ruined My Life,goldlinkwhenIdie,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5bxdfw/personal_my_skin_has_ruined_my_life/,"Up until 6 months ago, I never had any issues with skin. I went through my teenage years never having ever gone through a break out, only ever getting a few small whiteheads at a time. Once I hit 18, I rarely ever got a pimple. I consider myself very fortunate. 

Unknowingly, I had both rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis. Two difficult and frustrating skin issues that never got the better of me. My rosacea was always limited to my cheeks, and was always only a light pink. My seborrheic dermatitis was limited to the sides of my nose, but it was never really serious. Never serious enough where it hindered me from going about my life. 

This was 6 months ago. Since then, my skin has completely taken control over my life. I dehydrated my skin due to the use of my sisters foaming cleanser for 3 weeks. I only began using it, in conjunction with a moisturizer, because I wanted to start taking care of myself better. I also took out dairy and gluten from my diet, all part of this self-improvement ideal. After 3 weeks, I had gotten more pimples than I'd had in the last year, and my skin had become very tight. I stopped using both at this point. 

Over the course of the next 3 1/2 months I didn't put a strong enough effort to fix my skin. I tried 1 moisturizer, didn't work, gave up. Tried 1 cleanser, was too drying, gave up. 

My face never felt too tight and I wasn't getting pimples very often, so I felt fine with how my skin was, despite knowing that I would need to fix it at some point. My nose was almost always slightly red or pinkish due to the rosacea, but it was never that bad. 

I had nothing to do all summer but relax and I could've healed my skin, but didn't. I blame myself 100% for this. 

Though the last 2 months I have actively been trying to fix my skin, it has been a challenging task. Researching products, waiting for them to be delivered, and careful spot testing has taken a lot longer than I ever thought. Also, many of the ingredients I need to hydrate my skin, I can't use due to my seborrheic dermatitis. 

To make matters worse, I also had my seborrheic dermatitis flare up in the end of July and in October. Both times I used this cream called Protopic (tacrolimus 0.1%) and I think its led to broken capillaries and spider veins on the areas I've used it in. The areas are near my eyes and beside my nose. Giving my face a sun burned look. I've now also been suffering these broken capillaries on my nose. 

I now realize that I'll need laser treatment to reduce this damage even after I heal my skin. But these laser treatments seem terrifying as I've read about possible side effects people have had. 

I was supposed to be across the world doing an internship, and later supposed to go to fashion school. I've ended up sitting in my house, being depressed most of the time. I've been trying to fix my skin, I really have, but realizing how much of my life this has taken only made me terribly depressed. 

I don't know if anyone will read this or not. I just needed a place to rant. "

Offered .NET Developer after graduation (Dec. 2015). Making 70k/y w/ city employee benefit.

I acquired an internship my sophmore year and joined full-time at the same company after graduation. I am now in the process of getting a promotion in a couple months to Software Engineer level 2. Even though my manager and team lead have been very happy and keep mentioning that I am doing a great job I feel there is much I have to learn. 

This brings me to my question. I have been thinking of getting my masters and have decided that I will stay in Software Engineering rather than continue with Computer Engineering (wanted a career that was more relevant to computer engineering before graduation). Would you guys suggest an online Master's program or one from my local University, University of Nebraska? Which programs would you suggest for an individual with limited coursework related to Software Engineering?

While I am happy with my company right now and am hopeful for a decent raise to come with the promotion, I want to start thinking about the future. I would like to go further. In order to get this promotion I joined a cross functional team to offer ideas and implement solutions for improving productivity and volunteered to take on additional tasks through that group. That got me noticed by the manager and scrum master. I have been nominated to take additional training as well, will be going to NFJS in Denver :) Getting an offer from a previous manager helped get me the promotion as well. What I would like to know now is what can I expect as a Software Engineer level 2? Also does the label really make a difference to a hiring manager outside of my current company? I will have been a level 1 for 8 months when getting the promotion, will that affect their expectation? What can I do to prepare myself and make myself look even better? Any resources that you guys suggest?

Also seeing that most of the folks here are advocating for the big 4, I'd like to know what are my chances into getting in one of these companies in the future? Should I be participating in hackatons? 

Gotta hit the sack tonight but I will answer any questions tomorrow. 

Really appreciate the information you all have shared on this sub."

The first two years I was screwing around and not taking myself seriously and landed a 1.5 GPA attempting to do my classes for Accounting. At the end of the second year (and failing Accounting 1A twice), I decided Accounting was just not for me. I looked into Computer Science and found out that it was something that I understood and can work out. 

Starting my 3rd year, I have been trying to repair my GPA and have taken myself fairly seriously in restarting my education. I am currently taking some intro/intermediate programming courses in C++ and Java and retaking some classes that I failed on the side. 

I want to transfer to a UC or CSU and I know I have a long way before I can even think about applying.

However, I feel a bit lost in how I should proceed with this path. I would like to get some work experience in a relative field (even something as simple as cellphone repair) or perhaps an internship. 

I want to build up a portfolio of ""stuff"" but I have no idea how to get started. 

My question is: 

1. Is now a good time to even consider internships or should I focus solely on my education? 

2. There a ton of different fields in CS, and I have no idea how to even begin to figure out what I want to go into. Where do I begin my research? 
 
3. I would like to take a variety of courses to figure out what I want to do -- what different courses are recommended to get a better understanding of what there is?

4. I want to network with other people in the similar field. Are there communities or outlets I should check out to meet up and socialize with beginners like me as well as expertise in the field? 

5. Do you have any other recommendations/opinions/ideas that I could benefit from?

I have been in a FWB relationship with this guy for over 2 weeks, and now I caught a feeling for my FWB already. I know it is too short time but I had to deal with some bullshit stuff the past few days and he was always beside me and tried to make me feel better and comfort me. I guess that's why I caught a feeling for him because he was not my type at all at first so I thought I could keep this relationship going for a long time.


Also, he was really nice and sweet to me. He said he loves kissing me a lot, showered me with compliments, always cuddled me and kissed my forehead after sex, bought me coffee and food everytime we hung out, tried to make sure that I feel satisfied with sex. He seemed to be very interested in me because he asked me bunch of questions about me, my life, my family etc. I even told him if he was investigating me. We used to text almost everyday and he sent me good night messages every night. After the bullshit stuff happened, he cared about how I feel more than usual. He kept on checking that I feel okay. 


One day, I asked him if he hangs out with me just for sex and he said that ""Can I sleep over at your place tonight? I can prove that I am not here for sex I won't make a move if you don't want."" We even hung out when I was on my period, and when I told him about it, he said that we don't have to have sex. 

So I thought he had a feeling for me as well but when I told him that I caught a feeling for him, he sighed deeply and said he doesn't know what to do and asked me if he wasn't nice to me and didn't spend a lot of time together then I wouldn't catch feelings and I said yes and he said he feels like he's punised for being nice. We both agreed to stop hanging out or sex or anything. He asked me if I am gonna reply if he texts me and I asked him why do you have to text me? and he said he cares for me. He sent me good night text that night though.


He is going to go to other country for his internship for 3 months the end of November though but I don't know whether he is hestating to be in a relationship because of that or he was just a nice person to everyone and I misunderstood it. 
  ---   
tldr: I thought my FWB also had feelings for me by his sweet behaviour towards me but I don't know whether I just misunderstood it or he is hesitating to be in a relationship because he has to go abroad for 3 months and we have known for a short time. "
5c00iz,11,2016-11-09,"Me [24 M] with my wife [23 F] together for 6 years, married for 1; a combination of a misdiagnosis and bad medication led to domestic violence and separation.",Orestes_and_Hermione,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5c00iz/me_24_m_with_my_wife_23_f_together_for_6_years/,"Before we met both of us grew up in abusive households; my parents used to beat, yell, and belittle me, my wife only ever alluded to the emotional abuse she went through. She otherwise would not talk of it. 


We both met in a university in the US. She was a local, I am from Asia. I picked up and dropped several drug habits (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.) while with her. Never once harmed her physically or emotionally throughout it all.


I dropped out of university, she finished. I traveled back to my home country in Asia to retry my degree there, she did an internship in Germany.


She decided to burn all her bridges and start a new life with me by moving to my home country. I was living with my parents at the time [both in their 50s]. My conservative Muslim parents gave me the ultimatum of marrying her or abandoning her. I couldn't afford to support myself let alone another person, so I chose to marry her.


When my university semester started I shifted to an apartment closer to it, she moved in with me. Near the end of the first semester I had a nervous breakdown; that made me seek professional psychiatric help. First I sought help from the University, but then I went to a government hospital when the medication got too expensive.


I was [mis]diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed Seroquel and an anti-depressant [the anti-depressant changed a lot, from Lexapro, to Brintillex, etc.] When I was there I also did a few tests (the EEG I did there becomes important later.) This was when my memory starts failing me, and things started getting bad.


I had the habit of clamming up and becoming unresponsive when put in stressful situations. Before the medication this was manageable, but on the medication I would be in fight-or-flight mode at any sign of confrontation. My wife previously rarely got confrontational, but after the prescription it seemed like that's all she ever did. 


My first instinct is to distance myself from any situation where I may get violent, but after I started my medication my wife physically tried to stop me. She grabbed my arm but I punched her in the ribs to distance myself. This was the first time I ever hit her.


I had to stall my degree and we moved back in with my parents. My dosage got increased at this point (highest was 800mg), and I can't remember much besides my violent episodes. 3 days before our first anniversary, I nearly killed her. I don't even remember why.


At this point I wasn't working on my degree and my wife moved out to a different apartment. My parents forced me to work with no pay because I wasn't doing anything productive [at this point I'm still on Seroquel]. My parents tried to force me to attend my cousin's wedding (the thought of weddings/marriages now trigger the fuck out of me), and when I refused they threatened to remove all support they were providing me.


I moved in with a friend of mine for several months and quit Seroquel cold turkey. I fell relapsed into alcoholism but after a few months I sobered up and finally began trying to figure out what the hell was going on.


After several months my parents apologized for the cousin's marriage thing and told me that the hospital called and left a letter; the EEG showed abnormal brain activity and they scheduled me an appointment for an MRI scan for epilepsy.


I went back to university to finish my degree but because the university knew of a bit of my recent medical history, they made me see their associated doctor (he was the first to prescribe me Seroquel). 


He initially told me that if I refused to take medication, he could not vouch for me as a non-liability to the university, effectively banning me from doing any degree there. After I told him the results I got from the government hospital, he retracted his statement and told the university that I was allowed to study there. He told me that if it really is epilepsy, I don't have to be on (read: should never have been on) Seroquel.


I did some research and found that ""agitation"" is one of the most common side effects of Seroquel, even in ""objective"" medical literature, and there exist many other accounts of people who went through episodes of rage like I did. [A quick Google search of ""Seroquel Rage"" would provide you with plenty of anecdotal evidence.]


When I was initially starting out the medication I thought that I would finally have the answer to the problem of my mental illness. Now I know that I didn't and that exercise of medical trial-and-error came at the cost of intense suffering, abuse, a year of my life and my wife and marriage, and its future. 


My wife hasn't filed for divorce, but has blocked all communications with me and any mutual friend we had, and a friend of mine found her on Tinder; chances are she's cheating on me. I've tried my hardest to tell her my side of the story, but she's not having any of it.


What now?


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Legal, doctor-prescribed drugs ruined my life and marriage, and there is nothing I can do about it now but move on. Question is how?

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

5c1qzr,3,2016-11-09,How do I avoid background check discrepancy because of no job title?,hlkhulu,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/5c1qzr/how_do_i_avoid_background_check_discrepancy/,"I was offered an internship last summer that I took and finished successfully. Out of curiosity, I asked the third party company who performed my background check for a copy even though I know I passed. It turns out there was a discrepancy, because the agency I used for one of the temporary contract positions I had in the past had no job title for my work and couldn't verify. I specified on the background check form that the payroll title might differ, but it came back with a discrepancy anyway. Now I have a new background check for a separate offer, and I don't want to fail.

My resume job title is ""Independent IT Consultant"" for three of these temporary positions, which is a factually correct descriptor, but will it appear inflated given that the background check showed I was making $11.50/hr? I never gave salary info to this new company I have my offer from. What's the best thing to do this next time I fill out a background check form?"
5c2ft9,8,2016-11-09,Can I learn how to program in 6 to 9 months?,hbmcint,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5c2ft9/can_i_learn_how_to_program_in_6_to_9_months/,"I understand that this question has been asked many times, but as it's not always answered in the way that applies to me I'm hoping for some help. There's a job I want to apply to for internship in anywhere from 6-9 months. While I'm in a related field, I have no experience with programming and the job is in software development. 

I've looked into programming before and enjoyed it, but as it was a hobby, other priorities took precedence. Now I much more time, 4-5 hours a day to study a day if need be. I'm a quick learner and have a solid grasp on math and logic. Is this feasible? Can anyone recommend a structured learning path available online? It's very confusing from answers I've gathered. No one seems to agree on a language to learn first (not whats best to learn) or on milestones and goals to set. 

It would also probably be done on a used MacBook pro or custom desktop (havnt decided but leaning to Mac), so hardware advice would be helpful to. "

Can I get a few questions answered? 

* BS in computer science, with already 2 years professional work under my belt at a small company and 3 years of internship at HP before that. What's the average outlook for someone in my career? I very proficient at C#, perl, and web page design (bootstrap, js, html, the whole shebang). I tried looking at listings online but none really listed a salary range. 

* How hard would it to get my dog over from the states? He's an 80 pound Belgian Malinois so I can't exactly put him in a carry on bag. 

* What's the housing situation like? Here in the states most good real estate has long been bought by renters or people using housing as an investment. Only houses well outside the metro and/or new (shitty) neighborhoods are within the average person's price range. 

* I know Healthcare is pretty great for those in the EU in general, but what does it look like for an expat? I have scoliosis which may become a problem later in life for me. 

* I'm 5'10, 5'11 on a good day. Will I be short? 

* What's the technology turn out for the Netherlands, or Europe in general? As in, how long do you have to wait for new games or advents (vr, electric cars, popular apps or devices) to make their way from America or Japan to there? 

* How's the Internet fam. Here I pay $90 split 3 ways for 105 mbps. Which is good, but not great especially considering the price. 

Anything else I should know or be on the look out for? Thanks for indulging me."

Trebuie sa tii cont , desigur, de particularitatile business-ului tau. Poate trebuie sa transporti cantitati mici cu o frecventa mai mare, in acest caz recomandam sa utilizezi grupaje de marfa pentru a optimiza costurile. Marfurile perisabile sunt si ele un caz aparte si e important sa verifici in ce conditii vor fi transportate.

Daca nu este miscat pe cablu sau prin alte mijloace un vehicul trebuie sa aia prorpiul sistem de propulsie. Costurile transporturilor depind in general de distanta intre surrsa si destinatie, de mijlocul de transport ales si de dimensiunea si cantitatea de produse care trebuie transportate. In multe cazuri, sunt multe destinatii pentru acelasi produs, ceea ce da un plus de complexitate in problema minimizarii costurilor de transport.

Viteza de transport este un alt factor determinant, in special in cazul marfurilor perisabile. Chiar si in conditii optime de transport, marfurile perisabile pot fi afectate de un transport prea lung. Asigurarea marfurilor. Daca ai un volum mare de marfa sau vrei sa transporti marfuri cu valori mari, nu ar strica sa faci o asigurare. Evenimente neprevasute pot interveni oricand, iar pierderile pot fi greu de suportat. Ambalarea corespunzatoare. Daca marfurile sunt fragile, ia masuri suplimentare de impachetare.

5c2sti,15,2016-11-09,How to deal with burnout in college?,_Rearden,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/5c2sti/how_to_deal_with_burnout_in_college/,"Hello everyone,

So i am a junior at university and I am experiencing burnout, or what I believe to be burnout.

a little background, I am a junior. Im majoring in Management information Systems and Computer science at a good school. They are both very competitive majors and I have been generally successful. I am involved with a lot of the top clubs in the school as well as a business fraternity, and trying to start a club. I recently accepted a very competitive internship offer for the summer that will most likely lead into a very comfortable job offer. All great things right?

Well, I feel like it doesnt really mean anything. I still feel so empty inside. Like I did college, and I did it well but I dont feel that way. But now that I actually have an internship (which I will refer to as a job because 99.9% of the time the internship leads to a job offer) I feel so pointless with school. I am not enjoying my compsci classes like i used to. My major classes, I just go through the motions.

I find myself battling being tired all day every day. I don't have any drive or motivation. I am mentally exhausted all the time and just as physically exhausted. The stress builds because I know I need to be coding an assignment but I cant pull myself to do it anymore. I know I should be out doing stuff for my clubs but I cant imagine a reality where I get up and do it. I should be finding a girlfriend but I cant imagine a reality where I can develop an emotional bond with another human being. 

I am just tired all the time. I feel like the world is contuining to spin but I can no longer keep up. I used to be a top student, well I still am now, but I can feel this burnout absolutely grabbing my by the balls and holding on to me as it drags me down. I don't know how to stop it. 

I still have 3 more semesters of hard classes in college. I don't know how to continue on with this sensation that is plaguing every moment of my existence.

Please, if anyone has dealt with this and knows any tips. Help me. I want to be normal again."

I moved to chase the programming dream as a developer in October. I have been to every meetup and continue to network with the tech community. I have freelanced for some time now but all of my clients mainly want is WordPress websites so I don't have any real JavaScript to display in my portfolio. I am about a years experience and every company wants 3 to 5 for entry level. I am self-taught, reliable, honest, and hard working, so I figured it would be easy to find a job out here. At this point, I realize an internship might my best chance of working for a company right now because of my lack of work history.


What is the best way to get recognized in the town, where should I be looking, and who should I be trying to talk to?

Any help is appreciated and I am grateful for anything you have to offer.

5c2yue,2,2016-11-09,A Guide to Youmacon,thefigg88,Youmacon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Youmacon/comments/5c2yue/a_guide_to_youmacon/,"Hello!  
This is a short-ish and ~~unbiased~~ opinionated guide to everything Youmacon.  
  
##What:  
Youmacon is a free to walk around, but pay to enter any of the rooms event loosely about Japanese culture appreciation.  
  
##When:  
Youmacon is four days long around the time of Halloween Thur-Sun.  
  
##Where:  
Detroit, MI Renaissance Center (Ren Cen) and Cobo Center (Cobo).  
  
##Who:  
[Official website](http://www.youmacon.com/)  
Put on by paid staff, interns, and volunteers.  
Welcome to anyone, even kids.   
  
##Why:  
• See people dressed up in costumes  
• Play video games, board games, and trading card games  
• Watch anime  
• Dance  
• Listen to music  
• Attend panels, talks, and discussions  
• Buy posters, memorabilia, figurines, stuffed critters, accessories, international snacks, games, digital media, and more    
  
Intrigued?  
Here's everything I can tell you about my experiences.  
  
##Buying tickets:  
Buy them online in advance!  
They typically go on sale around April of the same year and the sooner you buy, the better...  
1. Because it's cheaper  
2. You can get your ticket sooner  
3. You get your ticket way, WAY faster  
  
##Which days and times to go:  
It's not mandatory to attend all four days; it's a come and go as you please event.  
Since they only release the official schedule right before the event begins, plan on going on Sat at the very least.  
Try to squeeze in some time on Fri, maybe Sun.  
Thur is the least attended day, although everything is completely free.  
  
##What to wear:  
Anything within reason!  
• **Emulate a character from popular media** (e.g., [Naruto](http://www.rolecosplay.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/naruto-cosplay.jpg), [Street Fighter](http://www.rolecosplay.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Street_Fighter_cosplayers_at_FanimeCon_2010-05-30_2.jpg), [Avatar the Last Airbender](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3271527209_54180d6c5d.jpg), etc.)  
• **Gender-bend your favorite character** (e.g., [Link](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OFrgnrZ0VKE/TaNDg_jsbmI/AAAAAAAATkI/fZmhsa0IJuU/s1600/IMG_8233.jpg), [Wonder Woman](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c7/4e/b7/c74eb7ce781fe1a53a240995c72b5b1b.jpg), [Disney](http://www.danatica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/male-cosplay-disney-princesses.jpg), [Vegeta](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/25/05/3c/25053c24614038901f58e737f8a4d4e4.jpg), etc.)  
• **Mashup characters and/or ideas** (e.g., [Ash Ketchum as a zombie](http://orig10.deviantart.net/aeb2/f/2013/322/e/d/zombie_ash_ketchum_cosplay_by_jackwrither757-d6uqj05.jpg), [post-apocalyptic Mario](https://armedgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pax3-614x1024.jpg), [sexy Adventure Time](http://i.imgur.com/0oEifUV.jpg), [poor man's Gundam](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/158/821/1737.jpg), etc.)  
• **Out of the ordinary outfits** (e.g., [furry](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0tJY3zv1p-k/TfUB6NkVVXI/AAAAAAAACeY/KthgX7AqjYY/s1600/cat_furry.jpg), [lolita](http://www.captmondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/August-26-2012-Fan-Expo-Lolita-Cosplayers.jpg), [rave cat](http://orig07.deviantart.net/a1ca/f/2012/073/c/8/c82a9c6fb123ffbf6e7a370569344efe-d4ssphb.jpg), [kimono](http://img02.deviantart.net/a758/i/2010/284/9/3/anime_banzai_kimono_cosplay_2_by_ff7docfanl-d30jxow.jpg), [steam punk](http://images2.westword.com/imager/u/745xauto/6623795/10361320.0.jpg), etc.)  
• **Geek attire** (e.g., [onesie](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1_MtXLpXXXXXZXVXXq6xXFXXXR/Unisex-Flannel-AdultStar-Wars-I-Am-Chewie-Chewbacca-Furry-Costume-Hoodie-Pajamas-Pyjamas-Women-Onesie-Animal.jpg_640x640.jpg), [shirt](http://fashionablygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/shirts.jpg), [hat](http://images4-e.ravelrycache.com/uploads/ThePrincessR/241841649/Sailor_Moon_hat_title_medium2.jpg), [signs](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-mPs9-is1I/Uf7T6HBYalI/AAAAAAAAAN8/HLeEJrouaEA/s1600/CounterProtest.JPG), etc.)  
  
##What to bring:  
###Must haves...  
• **Money!** - cash only for at-the-door tickets and merchandise/food can be purchased with cash or card  
• **ID** - need it for 18+ stuff  
• **Water bottle** - you may be in long lines waiting to get into a panel, so have a water container to fill up at drinking fountains  
• **Phone** - plan out your day, take photos, communicate where you are with friends, navigate the city, and entertain yourself while waiting in line  
• **Phone charger** - preferably a power bank so you can be anywhere and still charge your phone  
• **Bag** - something to hold your stuff in and possibly some merchandise as well  
###Consider bringing...  
• **Pen** - you have to fill out a form when you get your ticket at the very least, so it's useful  
• **Chapstick** - give your lips some love after being out in the chilly fall air  
• **Anti-gas meds** - if you're gassy, don't damper other guests' fun  
• **Snacks** - food isn't cheap there  
• **Energy drink** - make the most of your time there and be awake for the late night events  
• **Deodorant** - freshen up a bit from time to time  
• **Hand sanitizer** - some areas have this for free, but they're not everywhere  
• **Headphones** - zone out with some music  
• **Portable gaming system** - don't forget the charger  
• **Jacket/umbrella/rain coat** - check the weather report  
• **Comfortable clothes and shoes** - you will be standing and sitting on the floor from time to time while waiting in line  
  
##Where to park:  
1. **Greektown Casino** - the parking garage is huge, so there's most certainly going to be a spot open, it's a stop on the People Mover, it's $10 on weekdays (you get that money back if you gamble with a player's card for 30 min), and it's free on the weekends.  
2. **Cobo or Ren Cen lot** - it's pricey, but you literally can't get be any closer to the action if you don't want to use the People Mover or walk, even though it's a safe area.  
  
##Getting acquainted with the people and culture:  
You will NOT recognize or even like many of the outfits, but just appreciate and respect the work and thought put into them (i.e., have fun with it).  
There will be people there who have... interesting social norms that may differ from yours.  
Don't touch people without permission, even if you really want to hug your favorite character or inspect someone's intricate outfit.  
Be patient with other attendees as they may be quite talkative, opinionated, awkward, or not great picking up on social cues.  
Foster the ""all are welcome"" environment or at least tactfully remove yourself from uncomfortable situations and people if need be.  
  
##What to do first:  
Once you have your ticket, take a look at the scheduled events and plan out your time at Youmacon.  
1. Find a few panels that you would want to check out, then mark down when and where they are in your organizer/calendar of choice  
2. Figure out when are good times to eat (preferably outside of the busy times of around noon and 6pm)  
3. Familiarize yourself with the map of the two centers and maybe the surrounding city area, especially since the Ren Cen layout is SUPER confusing  
4. Go to the vendors room as early as possible to not miss out on limited quantity items  
5. Walk around or play games in between panels/events  
If you just don't know what to do, then locate the gaming areas and take your time getting there to enjoy the costumes.  
  
##Going to a panel:  
At least 30 min before a panel is going to start...  
1. Head to the area where it's taking place (you will get lost at least once in the Ren Cen)  
2. Go to the bathroom  
3. Fill up your water bottle  
4. Locate the end of the line (don't be afraid to ask which line someone is in) and don't be afraid if it's long; there's a 95% chance you'll get in and find a seat just fine    
5. Keep yourself busy by talking to people in line with you if they're feeling social or do stuff on your phone (panels may not start on time, so you need to occupy your time)  
Panels may be quite interactive, so be prepared to sit in a spot that's near the front and by the aisles if you want to participate or away in the middle/back of the room if you just want to listen and observe.  
  
##Panel recommendations:  
Totally subjective.  
Look through the booklet and check out anything that you might enjoy, and if you end up not liking it, you can simply leave to do something else.  
I personally like Raunchy Shakespeare (18+).  
A lot of people like the Live Action Mario and celebrity Q&amp;A panels.  
  
##Where to eat:  
The Ren Cen cafeteria on the lower level has the most selection and affordable food.  
Cobo has a cafeteria and some food outlets scattered about, but they're kind of over-priced.  
There are restaurants and bars nearby, especially around Greektown, just depends how much you want to spend, what you're craving, and how much of the sights you want to see.  
  
##What to buy:  
The vendors room has a lot of stuff, but half of it is stuff you can get online for cheaper, although some offer special bulk discounts and you may be able to haggle (politely) with sellers.  
Look for the hand-made toys, art, trinkets, and figures.  
They also sell board games and trading cards in the table top areas.  
  
##Video game room:  
The busiest room in all the con.  
If you want to play in a tournament, ask a staff person about signing up as early as possible.  
Many of the games are in Japanese, so just ask someone who seems to know how to use the machine when they're not busy.  
  
##Video game recommendations:  
1. **Jubeat** - fantastic rhythm arcade game pressing buttons to the beat that you MUST try out.  
2. **Taiko no Tatsujin (Taiko Master)** - another awesome rhythm arcade game using a drum.  
3. **Cho Chabudai Gaeshi! (Super Table-Flip!)** - a quick and silly game where you charge up your rage and flip a literal table controller destroying as much as possible.  
4. **Music GunGun!** - a rhythm game where you shoot targets to the beat.  
5. **Any of the PC/Console games** - take a break to play some familiar games, try out games you've wanted to look into, or have fun playing classics with new people  
  
##Table top room:  
Test out new games or play one's you know with others.  
People in here can be real passionate about gaming, so be prepared for enthusiastic responses and advise if you ask questions.  
  
##Table top recommendations:  
1. **Red Dragon Inn** - the perfect party game that's all about fun, drinking, and gambling.  
2. **Betrayal at House on the Hill** - explore a haunted house and find out who amongst you is the traitor.  
3. **Legendary Marvel / DC Comics Deck-Building Game** - recruit your favorite super heroes to fight bad guys in card form.  
4. **Alhambra** - build your city one building at a time.  
5. **Games in the raffle** - there's an area where you can try out a new game, and then enter into a drawing to win it.  "

This job was very detail oriented, the work was constantly changing, and is highly subjective. It's a minimum wage job and I was putting in 15 hours a week. 

I wasn't enjoying my job. It was a lot of work for a minimum wage job and by working this job, I was losing out on other opportunities where I could enjoy the work more, get more relevant experience (this job only gave me soft skills unrelated to my major) and get paid more than minimum wage. Basically, I've been thinking of quitting for a while, and this has affected my work performance since I was unhappy. 

I know it;s my fault 100% that I got fired, but now that it's happened, I'm pretty concerned with how it'll affect my future. Some questions I have in specific are: 

* Do I have to disclose that I was fired to future employers?
* Could I lie and say I quit? 
* Will future full-time employers care that I got fired from an on-campus job?
* Will this make me less likely to get hired? 
* Are there any long term affects of getting fired that I should know of? 
* Worst comes to worst, can I completely leave this job off of my resume? I've had other jobs and 2 previous internships that I still have on my resume

I would really appreciate the feedback as I am concerned and would like some advice from you guys! Thank you!

I got an offer from a Wall Street bank for a summer internship, and while the pay is $40 an hour, it doesn't include anything else such as housing, or relocation, which housing alone is looking to be roughly $1800-2000+ a month. 

While stocks and finance interest me, I think I would fit in culturally better in Silicon Valley or Seattle, but it's tough saying no to a wall street offer especially since I don't have any other offers from internship searching this fall. Would working on wall street set me up well for finding a full time job next year? I want to work full time in California or Washington over NYC. 

I guess I'm just nervous that I'll reject this offer and not find anything else better and regret that I didn't take it. "
5c4uej,5,2016-11-09,Take Spring Co-op and Extend Graduation?,awkwardsealion,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/5c4uej/take_spring_coop_and_extend_graduation/,"Hi all,

I am very fortunate to be in this position, but I am extremely undecided as to what I should do.  A little background, I'm a junior in ChemE pursuing a minor in computer science.  I just got offered a spring co-op with ExxonMobil and have already accepted a summer internship with Marathon Oil (Upstream internship).  I would definitely take the Exxon co-op, but it also extends my graduation by two semesters due to senior design.  Both jobs pay great, although I'm a little hesitant to travel so far from home (live on the east coast and jobs are in Texas and Louisiana).  Those are probably not great reasons to not take the Exxon job but at the same time, I gotta graduate at some point.  My question is for you all is:

1.)  Will taking the ExxonMobil job open a lot more doors for me?  My ideal job is to live in California or Houston working for a large chemical manufacturer or O&amp;G company, so I'm thinking by taking the co-op it makes my resume stand out more.

2.) Similarly, will declining the ExxonMobil co-op close that door forever?  I still could possibly have one more summer if I graduate Fall '18 with a minor in Comp Sci, meaning I could apply again plus I'll have experience in the oil and gas industry.

Any and all advice is appreciated, and I hope this doesn't seem like I'm bragging about my offers, I'm just a very indecisive person and looking for anyone's take on this."
5c4wa2,2,2016-11-09,I [23/f] can't let go of boyfriend's [22/m] mistake at the beginning of our relationship. Is it considered as cheating?,girl0110,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5c4wa2/i_23f_cant_let_go_of_boyfriends_22m_mistake_at/,"Hey all,

First off I'm new to Reddit, so I hope I got this thread in the right section:) and also since English is not my mother tongue there will be some grammar mistakes, so bear with me please :P
On the serious note now:) My boyfriend (very very shy guy) and I have been dating for year and a half now, and I consider our relationship extremely romantic and passionate and what not, with developed strong communication. We met in the beginning of May 2015 at a gathering, two days later started talking online, nothing really flirty, but it was daily conversations over everything and anything. I did like him quite a lot, and felt he liked me back, but it just stayed like that. Fast forward month and a half later we still talk online, I get acceptance for a two months summer internship in foreign country. In this month and a half, we go out couple of times over coffee (as friends).

 (*) Then one day we meet up again for a walk in a park and he finally kisses me, and after several romantic sweet hours there, we go home. Next day, he calls me up to see each other. We go out, him being normal as it initially seemed to me, romantic and stuff and after less than an hour tells me that we should stop seeing each other (at that point it was one week before me going away for working abroad), starts telling me about this girl from his past, when they were doing long distance for 10 months (different cities, he was in high school at the time, and in those 10 months they only met couple of times) and at the end he cheated her in a club, broke up and everything got destroyed. He told me he cared a lot about me and didn't want to hurt me, and was scared if he did so. I was so confused at the time, literally didn't know how to react, went home and felt awful. After two days (no contact) I called him up, and told him that since I will be living I'd like to go out with him on a coffee to say proper goodbye (I felt really close with him and needed sort of closure I guess), we agreed a date, went out and he started apologising, saying again that he is scared if he'd hurt me (I do have enormous trust issues from a past relationship and friendship, but had that gut feeling that I want to try this out), asked for another chance to try it out. We agreed to give it a chance and see how it goes. After two months of constant Skype-ing and talking (we agreed that we will be exclusive, and confessed one another that since I went abroad there was no one else in our lives, so we were 'official'), I get back in my country, and everything is awesome. After couple of weeks he tells me he got an HPV (up until then we still haven't been together - he is my first actually) - he told me right after his appointment with the doctor. He said that only with his last sex partner he had unprotected sex, and that it was in the end of June (right when we started seeing each other only friendly). He states that all they had was strictly sex relation (friends with benefits) and a deal that if one of them finds someone, they will stop it. He said he stopped when he saw that we (me and him) are getting serious. Honestly, I felt betrayed. I never knew that there was anyone in his life, I probably couldn't understand that type of 'relation' and felt that our 'romantic picture' is broken. So in the heat of him understanding about HPV, we went at doctor together to make a full STDs checkup, he was very upset and angry and thought that the girl knew all along, asked for analysis and stuff, however when he opened the Facebook chat to show me the document that she sent him, I just felt this need to check the whole conversation. I guess it was because I still didn't have a very clear picture for when they stopped seeing each other. I did go through the whole fb conversation (I ACTUALLY ASKED FOR A PERMISSION, OF COURSE TRULY UNHAPPY HE AGREED, AND HE WAS RIGHT BESIDE ME THE WHOLE TIME I WAS READING), and saw that she texted him over the summer, it was mainly if not all, questions over some games, and him replying coldly, up until I got in the late june with him saying: ""I found someone new, I really like her, we should stop. I got this friend X if you want me to give you the contact."" ( the date was the same date when he told me that we shouldn't see each other anymore (one week before me living abroad). So after conversations with him I got the following bottom line story:

After the walk in the park, (since I write too confusingly, I marked the paragraph in the text where I explained you the story with (*)), after our first kiss and real date, he went to see her and slept with her. The next day he stops the 'relation' with her, goes out with me, and breaks off with me stating that he's scared he'll hurt me. 

I know that he wasn't committed to me, nor that we were really dating, or said anything. It's just that in my head, it was. I felt so dirty, just with the thought that he could really *do* something like this. Time has passed, so many times asking if there was something more (even though deep down I believe there wasn't), so many conversations, so many times closed that chapter, and reopened. It's just that, I truly am in love with him, and I truly respect him as a person. He is very sweet, passionate, smart, and opened to ask him with many questions about this and anything. I've never named *this* a cheating, but then why can't I let it go and why do I feel cheated? I didn't recall this for many months now, and today I accidently saw a YouTube funny video about cheating and felt so .. bad. So if it's not cheating what is it? I've never told this to anyone, I guess what I need from you now (hah, after so much time) is an opinion. We get to a point where we discuss about house, and getting old, and I do trust him, I do know that there is no one else, and I do know that there was no one else from the day that we said: 'WE ARE OFFICIAL!' (at least I know as much as I CAN know) but there's this but. I just needed to finally let it go off my chest, and face down your opinions. What would you do? How would you feel? Did I make the right decision for trying not to label this as cheating, or should I have put an end on it once I found out? Is there anything you can recommend me to do or advice me in any way. 

Thank you SO much for reading this *NOVEL* and big thanks in advance for any comment you will make. I appreciate your opinions so very much!! :))

Short summary:
tl;dr
Boyfriend whom I'm dating almost year and a half, before getting official, after our first kiss date, slept with, at the time, constant *friend with benefit* (strictly rules applied). The next day breaks it off with both, and few days after we makeup (I don't know about this girl) we become official. After 3 months I find out, and after long conversations decide not to label it as cheating. Now, an year later still feel a burden in my chest, and want opinions from you guys. Did I make a mistake, or should I finally let this go and move on with my relationship?"

American Express Offer: 40% higher salary than Workiva, plus a one-time starting stipend; 10 weeks full-time over the summer.

If you had the choice, which would you choose? I am having a tough time deciding because the stuff Workiva does seems more interesting, but American Express pays more hourly and is a larger, more ""well-known"" company.

I'm now at a point where I am about to become assistant manager at a chain sit-down restaurant, where the average is about $35,000/yr, and this is after working there for 1 year starting out as a server. If I were to travel, I could possibly have a general manager job in a couple of years, which puts me in about a $10,000 increase.

My issue is that it seems harder to progress further than general manager in the restaurant field. I could try upgrading to a better/higher-paying restaurant when I have more experience but I don't know how common that is.

Or, since my life is becoming more stable, I could go back to school to major in computer science. My issue is that I do not want to drop my salaried position only to become an intern getting paid hourly. If I don't get hands-on experience in programming/software then I don't know how my CS degree will get me a job. Maybe my vision is a bit obscured?

I'm asking advice on which would be a better choice for where I am now. I know I am young, but I feel like I'm already getting drawn further and further into management and school seems like it will just get in the way.

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende. Or it could be a pair of sisters trying to reach fame in L.A such as Kylie and Kendall Jenner.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

I was a retard in High school, so I had to take remedial courses. I also transferred college very late so not all my credits were transferred and I switched majors computer engineering to computer science. I was also focusing on my Youtube channel/gaming so I failed some classes. 

Basically, right now I'm taking 5 courses and I'm doing fairy well in all of them. But, the problem is I got no experience, except for one of the classes I'm taking right now. We have a group project consisting of QA, Backbone, Graphics, and Specs with about 5 people on each team, we have to make a game that resembles Space Invaders. I guess that's the only experience I have.   

I recently lost interest(I still like it, but I'm not addicted anymore) in gaming, so I can fully focus on programming now, but is it easy for me to get an internship or experience before graduating next year? I can probably do some side projects, but I'll hopefully have at least 1 internship before I graduate. After I graduate would I be in a bad position for applying for real jobs? or am I fucked if I somehow get declined on every internship?"

The first two years I was screwing around and not taking myself seriously and landed a 1.5 GPA attempting to do my classes for Accounting. At the end of the second year (and failing Accounting 1A twice), I decided Accounting was just not for me. I looked into Computer Science and found out that it was something that I understood and can work out.
Starting my 3rd year, I have been trying to repair my GPA and have taken myself fairly seriously in restarting my education. I am currently taking some intro/intermediate programming courses in C++ and Java and retaking some classes that I failed on the side.
I want to transfer to a UC or CSU and I know I have a long way before I can even think about applying.
However, I feel a bit lost in how I should proceed with this path. I would like to get some work experience in a relative field (even something as simple as cellphone repair) or perhaps an internship.
I want to build up a portfolio of ""stuff"" but I have no idea how to get started.

My question is:

1. Is now a good time to even consider internships or should I focus solely on my education?

2. There a ton of different fields in CS, and I have no idea how to even begin to figure out what I want to go into. Where do I begin my research?

3. I would like to take a variety of courses to figure out what I want to do -- what different courses are recommended to get a better understanding of what there is?

4. I want to network with other people in the similar field. Are there communities or outlets I should check out to meet up and socialize with beginners like me as well as expertise in the field?

5. Do you have any other recommendations/opinions/ideas that I could benefit from?

I have had some form of depression for 5 years now. I've always been pretty good at bottling it up and ignoring the issue of depression. This semester, however, is different. This semester hit me like a freight train. I began the semester coming off of a summer internship that paid well, so I felt good. The things I was feeling sad about changed from ""why am I such a failure"" to ""why don't I have a girlfriend"". This lasted about a month until I started to fall behind on some of my classes. The night that I got a failing grade on an exam, I went home and cried myself to sleep. All motivation that I had was gone. I stopped going to classes and I stopped keeping up with assignments. I still set my alarm on time to go to class, but I would wake up and lay in bed just thinking about how disappointed my parents would be when I had to move back home. I lost all motivation to do anything whatsoever. I continued going to the gym on a daily basis because it was routine. I kept a good diet because it was routine. I talked to friends because it was routine. I started smoking weed all day every day because it was routine. I just kept feeling worse and worse with each day. Today, I finally met with the school counselor (psychiatrist). It was just an induction meeting, so nothing came from it. I was informed that I would be put on the wait list and that the first available time to schedule an appointment was December 1st. That is way too late to actually help seeing as I am going to fail out by the 16th.


I have to move back home and try to go to community college. What I am afraid of is that I will continue to do the exact same thing that caused me to fail out of college in the first place. I want to get help, but I don't know where to go to get it. I am having to get a job to be able to afford school, but it won't be much money. Do any of you have experiences with getting help that isn't expensive. I don't know if I could get my parents to cover the price of getting help, but I do need some professional help. I just can't believe that I finally got up the courage to talk to someone about my situation and it's just not going to matter. I don't want to get to the suicidal point again. I've helped myself so much before, but I don't know what to do. I can't face telling my parents that their son is depressed and has failed out of college because of that."

I've never posted here before, but I feel like I really need to get this off my chest, maybe get some insights from people who are familiar with the things I am feeling. I'll start at the beginning.

One and a half years ago I worked an internship at a print &amp; copy shop. I hated the people there and detested the work. I was due to work there for twenty weeks, but at fifteen had a complete burnout. I've never had anything like that before. I got physically sick to the point of vomiting at the thought of having to go back there, so I didn't. Being away from there made things slightly easier to deal with, but I was still bed-ridden for weeks. I was physically sick from stress and afraid of everyone, everything and especially social situations. I didn't want people to need me for anything, I just wanted to sit in a dark corner and be on my own.

After half a year, therapy, medication and experience I was finally out of the dumps. I was doing GOOD. Completely healed. Feeling absolutely fantastic. I then got pregnant with my first baby and pregnancy was a breeze. I loved it. I loved not needing to do anything, I loved being able to look forward to parental leave to be with myself and my baby. I went off medication when I found out and dealt with it well.

Now my baby is 9 weeks and my leave is almost over.  I will need to work another traineeship again in January, for half a year. I'm scared. Terrified even. I have episodes where I can barely breathe, I have constant aches in my neck and shoulders that (at least in my experience) cause difficulty breathing. I don't want to go. I don't. I don't. I don't. 

I don't know how to deal with this. "

As per this subreddit, I really need some help/advice! I'm currently not in medicine, yet, though I have several acceptances to medical schools. Honestly, I don't want to go. I've been out of college for &gt; 2 years, and quite simply, I've come to dislike medicine.  
The only other career I could see myself in is programming. I have *some* background in the field -- I've played around with HTML/CSS along with python and java in the past (and we're talking &gt; 6 years ago). I enjoyed it a lot, but sadly I got sucked into the pre-med ""philosophy"" in my Undergraduate studies, so I majored in Psychology + Biology...and boy do I regret doing that.  
-------------  
My Options:  
--&gt; **First Option:** Start an associate's degree/computer science certificate in Spring 2017 (deadlines for these approaching this week!), try to get a programming internship in the Summer of 2017, and then complete the associates degree/computer science certificate in Fall of 2017. The goal after that, of course, get a junior level job. **The only problem:** I'm not sure if I'll be eligible for FAFSA -- I haven't made enough money from my crappy job working in the Emergency Department to pay for this endeavor.  
--&gt; **Second Option:** Do a bootcamp. I'm pretty sure I'll need a 0 to 60 bootcamp as opposed to a 20 - x bootcamp like HackReactor. Doing a bootcamp will allow me to gain the skills necessary to code in 3-4 months and *hopefully* get a job making $70k-75k (?) **The problems:** I'm not sure if there's a lot of upward mobility with NOT having a CS degree and only having a bootcamp certificate. At some point, I would like to get a Masters in CS or possibly an MBA if I choose to go that route, the former of which requires at the very least an associates. Additionally, I have no idea how to fund a &gt;$10k bootcamp. Lastly, I live on the east coast, and most of the top bootcamps are on the west coast..moving for 3-4 months would add an additional $10k to this option.  
--&gt; **Third Option:** I go through with medicine, hate my life, and commit suicide as I'll be in well over $200k debt that I'll be unwilling to pay for. **The problem:** I don't get to live!!!

As many times as I read the stuff on the sidebar, I really value the opinion of people who have read it + have experience to back it up. 

My background: I'm 19 currently and have three semesters left to finish a degree in Accounting (graduating Spring 2018). I have no student loans, and I should not have to take any. I own my own car (2000 Toyota Camry; ~130,000 miles).

My current account balances look something like this: 

CDs- $3050ish ($1000 becomes availible July 2017, $1000 July 2018, $500 July 2019, and $500 July 2020). 

Online Bank General Savings- $6,800 (.75% APY) 

Physical Bank Checking/Savings- $1200ish 

Credit Card- $0 balance (just paid it off before making this post), but $1200 limit

I have two other savings accounts for a road trip I want to take after college ($450 right now), and a Christmas fund ($300, about to be drained and I will build it up gradually throughout next year). 

My current income/expenses come out to something like this: 

Income: $800-$900/month (accounting internship ~13-18 hours a week)

Rent: $200

Utilities: $250ish 

Gas: $75 

Food/fun/misc: averaging ~$200

My financial goals are to buy a house within 5 years (assuming I can get a job soon after graduating), setting up for retirement early so interest can work for me, and I also plan on starting a college fund for my younger sister (luckily for me, she's only 3 months old, so even if I only set aside $50/month I can have a nice suprise for her in 18 years or so). This isn't really a goal, but I also have 3 surgeries I need to be done. Luckily my step mom has fantastic insurance that will cover alot, but I will still be looking at $2000-$3000. None of these surgeries need to be done immeadietly, and can be delayed as long as my pain tolerance holds up. Besides that, there isn't too much I plan to do with my money. I guess secondary goals would be starting to prepare financially for the possibility of children. 

My question comes now with what I should be doing now. I have gotten advice from two people I know personally, and both have been on opposite sides of the coin. One says I should take some of my cash and go ahead and open up a retirement account. We walked through an investment calculator showing how important investing early was, and getting started at 19 wouldn't be bad. I could max my contribution for this year. It's unlikely I could next year, but I might be able to if I get approved to work full time over the summer. The other option is to keep my money where it is for a house downpayment. I do feel very strongly about wanting to be a homeowner, and I know that putting the money into the retirement account could delay that goal. But I also realize the benefits of investing early. 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks :)

Usage: Hardly used at all from January-August (maybe 1 or 2 hits here and there, but that's it). August 26th-September 9th(ish) I smoked a lot. I was celebrating welcome week and getting back to school. I would say .5 grams a day with 2 days off every 7 days.

Weight: 160lbs
Height: 5'10""
Hair color: Black
Skin color: White
My hair grows fairly fast. I worked out a lot and ate fairly healthy.

I decided to quit smoking around September 9th because I knew possible drug tests for internships would come up so I wanted to be clean. Also my gf was starting to get mad at me for smoking too much. 

Anyways, one of the internships I applied for offered me a position on October 28th. A few days later I got a letter in the mail informing me I needed to complete a **hair drug screen**. My heart instantly dropped and I started looking up different methods to make sure my hair was clean. I had gotten my hair cut a week prior to that offer and it was about 1.3"" long at the top. 

Today is November 10th and I went in and got my hair tested. They cut the hair 3 times towards the back of my head around my cowlick. When I got home I measured the hair around where they cut and it was only 0.8"" long. I did the math and used 0.5"" every 30 days and got 48 days for 0.8"". 48 days before today (11/10) was September 23rd.

I was so paranoid a few days after Halloween that I tried washing my hair with Salicylic Acid + Laundry detergent for 15 minutes until I realized it was basically a waste of time. I didn't do any treatment leading up to it because I've heard lots of mixed reviews.

Anyways, I just took the test and I will update this thread when I get the results back. Until then I'm going to be freaking out.

- I strongly prefer written resources over any videos
- I want the resource to be in python
- I want there to be attack-able modules, meaning not too much at once covering the major data structures and algorithms one at a time 
- I want practice problems with solutions to be with the accompanying modules - so, for example if the section of the book is on lists, problems just on lists. Cracking the Coding Interview does an ok job at this, but there are some slight differences with Java Arrays, Hash tables, etc than with Python lists and dictionaries. Since I've been learning Python and can interview in that, I'd prefer to stick with it if I can.

For conceptual material, I love this book - it's really friendly, modules are a good size, but the thing that's missing here is a good, meaty set of practice problems!

In addition to a resource recommendation, if anyone is reading this and feel they are at a similar skill level to me (and in the NYC area), please do reach out as I'm also looking for a study partner (or several) as that makes these sorts of things much more fun and meaningful.

5ca9po,1,2016-11-10,My mother threatened to beat me to death yesterday; she is blaming it on being stressed out about Trump's election,SeaDragon29,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ca9po/my_mother_threatened_to_beat_me_to_death/,"**The short version:**

Yesterday, in a moment of frustration, my mother literally threatened to ""beat me to death"". Today, she tried to hit me. She is telling me that this is my fault because I asked her to be quiet so I could transcribe (I am 25, a professional writer, and I need to transcribe interviews to get my work done).  She also tried to blame it on being stressed out about the election results. She refused to seek counseling, when I calmly told her that I thought she needed to. 

**Full details below:**

I was sitting in the family room, trying to transcribe audio so I could write a blog post. She walks in. I say ""I'm trying to transcribe."" She somehow interprets that as a sign that she's not allowed to make any noise in her own house and leaves in a huff. This bothers me, because I would have totally gone to a different room if she asked me to. But I was trying to transcribe and didn't want to talk over the audio if I didn't have to.

I go to her workroom to tell her that. She gets super defensive. She shouts at me that I need to get a job at a PizzaHut (in a tone that says clearly I'm supposed to perceive that as a threat); I say, ""Fine, when we drive into town on a grocery run tomorrow, I can print out some retail resumes and hand them out at places around town.""  So she says, ""Fuck the grocery run. That's not happening."" In a tone that clearly shows her one goal is to bully me into shutting up.

At which point I get really mad and tell her she's being a bully and then leave. 

I go back to the other room and can't help but start sobbing. She comes in and says (and this is a direct quote) ""What are you whining about? How about I beat you to death!""

At which point, I'm just like stunned. I yell something at her about how she wouldn't win, which admittedly was stupid, but I didn't know what else to say. She's never said anything like that to me before. 

So anyway, after some cool-down time, she 's said she's sorry but tried to blame it on Trump and told me that I still need to change something because ""you've been trying for three years and it hasn't worked""...And told me not to tell my dad about the fight because it would put him in a funk for a week. (It would.)

But I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I guess most writers have to get work done in a hostile environment, but I feel like after MIT, that's all there is for me. No one cares about seeing me successful anymore. 

And obviously, I'm freaked out because my mom threatened to kill me and then told me I shoudn't take it seriously b/c obviously she wouldn't *actually* do it...

And I'm just like, I just want to work an internship. I never asked for a functional family, a boyfriend, or anything. I just want to work. And I don't get why she's picking on me when I'm trying to work.

Apparently, one of the things she's upset about is that we (my brother, my dad, and I) don't spend more time cleaning up the house, doing dishes, cooking dinner. I agreed to cook dinner tonight. I don't want to, though. I am ashamed of myself for kow-towing to a bully; I am an adult, and if someone tries to bully me in my own home, I should be able to stand up to her and not do any of the things she asks of me. 

I don't know what to do. I need to concentrate on my work, so I can land a writing internship, get my own salary, and get the fuck out of this house, never to return. 

The sad thing is that now I can't clean anything without feeling like I'm playing into the hands of someone who, on some level, wants me dead, who thinks that beating to death is an okay punishment for not being able to break into a very competitive field after three years. 

I showed her the anti-psychotics--which my shrink prescribed for me at a low dose as a trial but then decided I didn't really need-- and told her I would take one to avoid screaming matches, even though those pills make me really stiff in my joints.  Even that wouldn't persuade her to seek counseling. 

I don't know what to do. I cannot let a death threat slide, but I cannot work with worrying about her being present in the house. 

(Thanks for reading/listening. Constructive advice would be appreciated.) "
5caaxu,1,2016-11-10,Off season internships,Tempcsuser22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5caaxu/off_season_internships/,"Hey,

Just wanted some advice on how I should proceed with my internship search. I am currently a sophomore at a top 20 CS school, and last summer, I interned at a small public  company (with a well known name) in SF. Next summer, I am going to be interning at a well funded unicorn. Based on my background, I am trying to figure out how good of an idea it is to do an off season internship (non summee) . Right now, my options include working at another unicorn or Google (although I don't think big companies are for me). Basically, is it a good idea to move forward with any of these companies for an off season internship? After next summer, I only have one more summer to intern, and although I am pretty sure I want to work at a unicorn, I'm worried I won't be able to figure out my best fit without a fall internship. Any thoughts?"
5cb9j9,13,2016-11-10,Rant -- How long would it take you to complete this project?,thatsnas,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/5cb9j9/rant_how_long_would_it_take_you_to_complete_this/,"I have been working as an ERP developer (but being paid as an application analyst) for about 2 years. I started for this company as an intern and was signed on as an employee after I graduated. We have a small IT team with one other developer. The other developer has been working with this particular ERP system for ~10 years. When I started, I was given the opportunity to learn the ERP system, working along the same track as the other dev. 

I started with learning the DB, writing ad-hoc SQL queries, then building dashboards/reports with SSRS/Crystal Reports. That was my job for basically the first year, then I got into BPM writing and form customizations with C#/Linq. These types of customizations are mostly created from the pre-built standard forms/methods provided by the ERP that I would manipulate to fit business needs. 

Earlier this year, I was tasked with a project to convert a Record Tracking ""Database"" for the Quality department which is an Excel spreadsheet with a bunch of macros into a web application. 

The requirements:  
1. Import Excel data to DB (~4000 rows)  
2. Allow email to be sent from app  
3. Populate data based on criteria (ex. loading read-only date based on another date)  
4.Logins with AD authentication, CRUD permissions  
- The current spreadsheet is not protected, it's basically a free-for-all, anybody can change any of the data. So yes, the data in most of the fields are wrong  
5. Service to alert people who are assigned to an issue if a due date is coming up  
6. PDF export (or other printable form), there is only 1 form that is printed   
7. One other web form with details on how the Record was acted on.  
**Edit for scope creep  
8. Records are currently stored in a directory based on Record ID. Need to Open and Create Excel files.


So outside of the PDF export, alerting, permissions, etc, basically what we have is a datagrid with linkage to a detail form. 

I guess this is where the rant starts. With zero web development experience, I added up the time for all of the components of this and I told my boss it would take 200 hours to complete, which he criticized, but with no experience I had no idea what to estimate. 

Using VS 2013, I started the project with Web Forms then tried asp.net MVC using a bunch of different methods. It's pretty difficult to learn and I didn't like how anything was turning out, so I kept restarting and using my previous code in new projects. 

I ended up using [Serenity](https://github.com/volkanceylan/Serenity) (which is awesome by the way, try it out) and I am getting close to completing the project. Recently, my boss tells me ""You should have only had 60 hours on this project! you could of used Web Forms! This is a simple project!""   I think this stemmed from the progress that I showed them, which I didn't show them a whole lot throughout the course of the project because of the amount of times I started over. 

So if you could put yourself in my shoes or think back to the time you were a junior dev (or current junior dev), how much time would you put on this? What other methods should I have taken?

5cbfcf,1,2016-11-10,Got internship in industry but would like to pursue public,southtaxes,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5cbfcf/got_internship_in_industry_but_would_like_to/,"I am currently in the last semester of my junior year in my undergrad accounting program and I should be enrolled in my school's 150-hour program by the end of this semester. I recently got an industry tax internship for spring of 2017 and so far it seems like it will be a great culture fit for me. However, since the day I decided to pursue accounting, I wanted to do at least a few years in public (preferably big 4) and then switch over to industry if I wanted a better work/life balance. I was straight forward during my interview in regard to my interests in public accounting, and the interviewers were somewhat understanding since they came from a public accounting background. But they would obviously rather have someone they plan on investing in to stay with them for the long-run.

One of the main reasons I want to pursue public is because of how quickly you are able to climb up the ladder and assume more responsibility, especially when compared to those in industry. But the managers at the company where I will be doing my internship explained to me that their office is rapidly growing and the opportunities to move up come a lot quicker than in most industry positions. My main concern is that I'll end up regretting the decision to stick with them after graduation rather than pursuing public for a few years, and by the time I realize I might want to try public, it will be too late. I would really appreciate some opinions or different perspectives on how I should handle this matter!"

5cbhzu,27,2016-11-10,I'm tired of crying about the past. Recently Diagnosed.,sassyslut69,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5cbhzu/im_tired_of_crying_about_the_past_recently/,"I just cried for 2 hours straight today. I'm 23F and was diagnosed recently. I'd like to rant a little now if that's ok. 


I was that girl everyone said would succeed. I was one of the only girls in my business school to be accepted into a program that fast tracked you to Wall St. I had leadership roles where I stood in front of lectures and taught people things. I wrote for the school newspaper. I was sassy. I was fun. Everyone thought I had it all. I thought so too. 


Everything started to fall apart my senior year. I was juggling courses with an internship and a job. Energy drinks were my water. I started to notice I was getting crazier every weekend and caring less about my future. More cocaine. More molly. More sex. Lots of sex. All of my friends were applying to jobs and I wasn't. I couldn't. My bosses started to notice I've been skipping meetings and duties. I started to avoid them. My room was a disgusting mess (always had this problem but it was unlivable this time). I got a D in a course for skipping too many classes. I never get bad grades. I spiraled. I started to wonder what was wrong. 



Looking back it makes sense. I've always felt like I was more..childish than others? Always living in the moment. Never thought about the future. I would lose my phone every couple months. My mom never gave me her purse as a child because I would always lose them. I don't remember my childhood though. I don't remember lots of things. Thought I was developing early Alzheimers. I would blurt things at inappropriate times. I spent money recklessly. I procrastinated every single essay/assignment until the very last minute. I couldn't retain information in lecture if I wasn't interested. Doodled a lot. Day dreamed a lot. A guy once told me I was ""the dumbest smart girl"" he ever met. I was unpredictable. I could throw temper tantrums at friends, boyfriends, strangers. I was always known as the ""crazy"" friend. I had the crazy stories, the crazy adventures. I was always a little too loud, too silly. Too intense. I needed to have all the fun. All the stimulation. I was most miserable when I had to be alone in my room with my thoughts. So many thoughts. No direction. 



I was burnt out. My brain snapped. I ended senior year without a job. I fell into a deep depression where I couldn't get out of my bed for 5 months. I didn't understand life anymore. I didn't understand why I didn't have a job like all my friends. I thought I was supposed to be the smart, ambitious one. I still couldn't fill out a job application. Maybe I'm actually dumb and can't adult. Why was adulting so hard? Am I just a worthless lazy fuck? I turned to booze and boyfriends to distract me. I then mustered up any energy I had left to get a job. Then got fired a couple months later. W.T.F.



That's when I realized I must be missing something. Life shouldn't be this hard. I booked an appointment with a psychiatrist and told him to fucking help me please. I was diagnosed. I was in denial. I was given Adderall. 



Meds. Who knew. Immediately something had changed. I felt.....calm. content. quiet. (That's how I felt on cocaine. I knew my reaction to coke wasn't normal). I could sit down and just fucking be. I don't fidget in my seat. I don't feel the need to do something fun. I cleaned my room. I applied to jobs. It no longer takes all my energy to do basic tasks. I could see clearly. I can regulate my volatile and unpredictable emotions. A weight has been lifted. Life feels real. I feel like an adult. 



This week has been strange. It's crazy to think that what I thought was my personality is actually due in large part to lack of dopamine. I'm having an identity crisis. I'm sad that I wasn't treated earlier. I'm sad that I suffered from depression and low self esteem. I'm sad for the girl I could have been.



But now I know how strong I am. I knew I could be better. This wasn't how my story was going to end. I'm thankful there is a solution to my brain and I'm ready to fight back with a vengeance. Happy tears now.

5cbler,147,2016-11-10,I didn't call when ordered (Read: The End of the World is Nigh),jessiconic,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5cbler/i_didnt_call_when_ordered_read_the_end_of_the/,"Quite, quite unfortunately, this is no mother-in-law, but my own mother.

But I am posting here regardless, because honestly, you ladies get me. I've taken some of the wonderful advice on here and I'm slowly but surely getting the self-help and peace I desperately needed starting from the age of 10. Some background: I recently moved out of the house and into my very first post-college apartment, with a fancy new job about 45min away from my parents.

So let's go back in time to Halloween night... I [21F] was at a friend's party, having a good time chilling out and making new friends with my lovely boyfriend in matching Pokémon one-sies. And then The End of the World started. 

For some background, my not-so-little brother is a senior in high school. He's filling out college applications, and seeing as I was the most successful in my family at getting into college, I've been the go-to person for college app advice. Not a big deal, I'm cool helping him out.

So he texts me: ""Hey would you help me review this essay""
And I respond: ""Sure, but I'm at a party, can I call you in a few hours?""
And he says: ""yeah, sure"".

End of story, right?

Well gosh golly get your drama-llamas ready, because NOPE.

The texts start pouring in from my mother, who is presumably 'helping' him with his essays (read: standing behind him and stressing out at him).

""Call me.""
""Call me.""
""Call me.""
""Call me.""

 To which I respond, ""Why? What's up?""

""Call me.""

Nuh-uh. I know for a fact that nothing is wrong, and I don't have to call her when she demands that I do.

Again: ""What do you need?""

""Call me.""

You can imagine the rest.

So, I took a deep breath, remembered you ladies, and stood my ground. I did not call her. I did not respond when it was clear she was not going to answer. And I texted my brother after the party to see if he still needed my help, and we set up a better time to talk in the morning.

So fast forward to today (November 10th). By this time myself and my boyfriend have already visited the 'rents once. He insists that we make time for my family every one or two weekends, because family is important to him, and he still has a naive glimmer of hope that my mother will come around to him. (My dad adores him in his own quiet, gruff way, so we've got that going for us at least.) We played badminton, ate hamburgers and everything appeared okay.

I'm tired after a long day at my big girl job. It's been an exhausting week. I usually call boyfriend when I get off of work, but he is hanging out with a friend and I don't want to interrupt, so I decided to call my mother instead and check in.

Everything goes okay for about twenty minutes. Chatting about my brother and college, telling me about her job, etc. And then, she ""steps out into the garage so she can speak with me privately"". Oooh, ominous. 

She starts giving me the one-two about not calling her TEN DAYS AGO. I politely told her that I had taken care of it with my brother. She still chastises me for not calling *her*. I asked why she didn't answer me when I asked what was up. ""Because I asked you to call me!""

Eye-roll. I told her that I did not have to. She goes off on a tangent about how she NEVER asks me to call her anymore because I hate it when she does, and how she NEVER drops in on me because she wants to 'respect my space', and how she NEVER contacts me at all because I hate her or something. And then goes on to say that she would NEVER not tell me what was going on over text unless there was an emergency, because she doesn't want me to panic.

...???? She did??? If I hadn't spoken to my brother earlier, that is EXACTLY what I would have thought.

So I tell her that. ""But you had talked to your brother already!"" And I say yes, I did, I talked to him - not you.

Back and forth, I keep shutting her down. Then she takes another turn about how something unrelated. Ready?

""I did the math and you let 'friends', who you only knew six weeks, help move you out of the house! I wanted to be there! I wanted to move you into your apartment because it gives the parents closure to help their little girl move out!""

WOW. First of all, friends are friends, and you have no clue how long I knew them. Second of all, you could have been there?? She works a flexible schedule and she is constantly switching her Fridays off, which is when I moved. And finally, this is coming from the woman who, when I asked her to drive me home from my last day of my 2-year college internship that I loved to death because I didn't want to drive upset, forgot. And then cried at me for asking my boyfriend to drive me instead. Because she didn't remember me asking her first.

This is ridiculous. I'm sick and tired of this. I'm always the bad guy. I can't have a conversation when she just wants to railroad me and only acknowledges her own side. So I play the ""you said it, not me"" card when she whines about how I think that she's ""bossy and intrusive"", and try to end the conversation. I tell her ""you can call me later if you still want to talk."" 

To which she dramatically wails, ""No, I can't! You don't want me to!""

Well damn. You get mad at me not calling, and then refuse to call me?! The irony."

I don't own a gun, don't want to own a gun, have only fired a gun once in my life and didn't enjoy the experience. I think trade agreements are pretty much okay. I have college degrees, I live in a very blue city, in a blue state. I shop at Whole Foods. My daughter--an only child--gets violin lessons from a private tutor. Climate change is my number one political issue. I have made ignorant redneck jokes and felt superior. 

I am, so far as I even understand the phrase, the very picture of a cuck and I will never, ever, like your guy. 

But I have nothing against _you_. Hell, I don't even _know_ you. And I don't think you know me. We're shouting at each other through a wall and it's time for that to stop.

Bad as I feel after the election, the one, single bright spot is that, for the moment at least, Trump has blown the system apart and now we have a chance to really change things. That's actually very exciting. Or terrifying, depending on what changes get made.

To that end, how much room is there in your mind for compromise? I'm not looking for Trump policy answers. We'll get plenty of that very soon. Right now, I want to know about what _you_ think, you of the NIMBLE NAVIGATOR flair. 

If I say that I was deeply worried about Clinton's constant cozening up to Wall Street and embarrassed by her ham-handed retail politics, will you agree that Trump's behavior regarding women is, at the very least, disturbing?

If I say that the left (including myself) can for sure be patronizing and superior, and that the phrase ""job training programs"" is how Democratic candidates say ""shut the fuck up"" when they're in Kentucky, can you chuckle ruefully, then admit that manufacturing jobs just aren't coming back and that any politician who says otherwise is probably lying? 

If I say that a carbon tax (no matter how much I might want one) is probably unrealistic, if not counter-productive, can we agree that coal is filthy and needs to go, even if it puts miners in the Carolinas out of work? 

Do we agree that sometimes there is no painless answer? 

If I say serious gun control in America is about as likely voluntary castration, can you agree that gun violence is horrifying and that we need to do _something_ more productive than letting the DNC fund-raise off the NRA and the NRA fund-raise off the DNC? Do you have some ideas as to what that something might be?

Can we posts links to authoritative sources that support our arguments? Can we disagree--or even hate each other's guts--respectfully? Do we all think that, no matter how Hope-and-Chang or God-Emperor-like they may be, all men are flawed and politicians needs to be watched at all times, lest they sell the Nation to the highest bidder and/or try to stick their appendage in any random intern and/or beauty pageant contestant?

If I say [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRp1CK_X_Yw) is the stupidest political ad I've ever seen and Hollywood makes me want to vote for the ghost of Senator McCarthy if it will make those people shut up, can you take off that MAGA hat? It makes you look like a geriatric newsboy. 

Can we get some fucking overlap in our venn diagrams over here, for once?

This isn't an offer for a ceasefire. Ya'll are _wrong_ about some of this stuff, but I'm realizing that I also had no idea how deep the anger ran or how justified it is. How deaf the establishment has been. We don't need to agree, you and I, except to acknowledge that people are hurting.

What we _do_ need, I think, is to change the rules of engagement, because neither side wants a repeat to 2016. 

So, it's nice to meet you.

Can agree on that much?"

&gt;**Embarassed, Unprincipled DNC Leadership Must Resign**
 
&gt;To the Editor:
 
&gt;The showing for Democrats on Tuesday was abysmal at best. Even after coming up with an ""autopsy"" of the failures during the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats gained only two seats in the Senate and five in the House. They have handed Republicans control of both Houses with Donald Trump in the White House. I can't think of a worse scenario for progressivism in this country. Clearly something isn't working.
 
&gt;I supported Bernie Sanders in the primary election and did all I could to get him nominated. I saw firsthand the enthusiasm of his supporters at rallies in NH, Amherst, and Boston. I talked to many voters of all types in NH, MA, and CT, who wholeheartedly supported his proposals. I watched the poll numbers as he inched closer to Hillary Clinton and continually bested her numbers versus Trump. I have no doubt Bernie would have successfully tapped into the same anger that Trump did and would have beat him handily.
 
&gt;But the DNC leadership had other plans. They wanted to support Clinton, a neoliberal who took money from big banks and corporations, promoted fracking to the world, and constantly flip flops on every issue imaginable. As the Podesta emails have proven, Clinton's campaign, the DNC leadership (including interim chair Brazile), and many members of the mainstream media colluded to thwart Bernie's message and paint him as a sexist radical for daring to stand up for truly progressive values.
 
&gt;Corporatism and neoliberalism have clearly not worked and it is time for the current DNC leadership to step aside and let truly progressive leaders steer the Party away from the Party of Clinton and back to its progressive roots.

Three of these are software positions, with the fourth being the director of a rather large club at my school.


What I'm trying to decide is what will be the next thing I bump off my resume (to make room for a fourth tech internship) to keep it down to 1 page. My first option is to bump the directorship and list 4 tech jobs. The second option is to bump off a full-stack position I had nearly two years ago. I'm not really planning on becoming a full-stack developer full time, so I'm not sure if this position is actually valuable for any of my future applications.

I figure more tech-based work experience is always good, but the leadership experience provides more diversity to my resume and a better talking point in an interview.

I'm currently in my 5th year in engineering school, and graduate this December. (took a semester off for an internship) I started off smoking weed and drinking, but freshman year I really didn't even drink that much. occasionally, but never enough to get real drunk cus shitty frat beer tasted shitty. so I spent most of my time smoking weed. first year I did decent, started to slip second semester, but did fairly well. I experimented with Molly a time or 2, and did shrooms twice my freshman year. first time was epic, tripped hard and had a great trip. second trip we tripped for 24 hours on half an 8th, which leads me to believe it was laced with a DOx, and I stayed away from psyches for a while. 

sophomore year rolls around and I kick it up a notch with the drinking. my roommate was pledging a fraternity, and I was getting fucked up Wednesday thru Sunday, maybe more. my the end of freshman year I was a daily pot smoker/stoner, and that never really changed. during my sophomore year I fucked up my grades...HARD. first semester sophomore year, I had the excuse of getting strep throat halfway through the semester and the flu over finals week. however, I admittedly also partied too much. but I was also smoking wayyyy too much weed, and not studying or doing my work enough. I tried coke that year I think, and did molly a couple more times, but didn't get deep into either. second semester I had no excuse, did just as terribly as first semester (same year) I also got wrapped up in a girl, so that didn't help. we'd skip class, fuck, and smoke weed alllll the damn time. after fucking up this semester, with literally no excuse other than I was a piece of shit, I realized where I was at, and that my on her way to being successful girlfriend was a girl I didn't deserve. (in the long run this definitely wasn't true, but that's a story for another time, and hey, still got my shit together cus of it 😂) 

so there I was, junior year with a shit average, on academic probation, and knowing I fucked up hard. I retook a bunch of classes, because I had done poorly enough that the way the grading worked I could replace Ds with Bs and fix my cumulative. I wanted to do better. so I did. but the fucked up part is....this is when I started doing MORE drugs! first semester junior year I dabbled with coke quite a bit. not a lot, but had a few weekends spent up till 5 am or later. I also never quit smoking weed on the daily, I just knew when it was time to work, and when it was time to party. ended up getting the best semester average so far that semester. second semester junior year me and the woman end up breaking up, but were still very involved with each other for most of the semester. this is when I reallyyyy got into the drugs. not necessarily cus we broke up, but because it was fucking fun, and where I go to school it's so cold you HAVE to get reallll fucked up, and everyone's got drugs all the time. this semester I was doing coke quite a bit. my buddy had a sweet hook up and the shit was fire. unfortunately he ended up getting arrested that year...however, I did a decent bit of molly, quitee a bit of coke, was still smoking every day, and dropped acid twice that semester. again, got my best semester grades so far again! this is the semester I got offered an internship, so I quit doing drugs for a while (mostly weed) and passed my drug test and started working. about a month after I start working, I started smoking on the daily again, and did shrooms once. other than that, took it real easy for 8 months. 

now here we are at second semester of the year, but first one I had been back to school. I was drinking pretty much Wednesday thru Saturday again, and I had reallyyyy good hook ups on blow and weed, so I was literally smoking all day everyday, but not over stoning myself, and making sure I always got my work done. then, I shit you not, just about every weekend I was doing coke. with the occasional mid week rippers with some friends. (usually their idea but I said fuck it) I think the funniest one was I was up all night on Adderall studying one night, and had started coming down from the addie, so I started doing study bumps of coke to keep myself going. I also tripped mushrooms twice this semester, and did molly a few more times as well, but I was always stoned, and doing a lotttt of coke. and here's the kicker..once again...best semester grades I had gotten, doing MORE drugs! I couldn't believe it. I was partying harder than my sophomore year, but was still keeping my shit very much together. 

Here we are at my final semester of college. I found an amazing acid connect, tested good real LSD, which I honestly didn't think existed which is why I didn't trip a lot previously. I've done coke maybe 2 or 3 times this semester, molly 4 or 5, but I've also done shrooms or acid pretty much every 2 weeks or so, occasionally doing one after doing the other the week before. I'm still doing well in all my classes, struggling with only 1 or 2, but I'm gonna graduate this semester and be off to the real world. 

as of 3 weeks ago I've quit smoking weed cus I'm moving across the country without a job lined up, and wanna be ready to be able to piss in a cup whenever the need arises. I've still been doing LSD and mushrooms, don't plan on stopping for a while, and will prolly do a lil more coke before the semester is over, but those are outta your system in a week so I'm not worried. I definitely eased off the coke and Molly this year because coke is just such a financial drain, especially when you don't have the right connects, and this town is dry AF right now. and I need all the money I can get to move across the country. 

so yeah. there's my college story, fucked up on drugs. let's hear yours? 

TLDR; smoked mad weed and always drank sophomore year, fucked up my grades bad. did more drugs and partied harder every year the years after, and kept getting better and better grades. "
5ccgoq,1,2016-11-10,How to tell when you have hit the point of no return in a relationship? I'm [31/m] she is [30/f] and we have been together 5 years.,Spudwiser,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5ccgoq/how_to_tell_when_you_have_hit_the_point_of_no/,"Here goes, I totally expect people to say this is all my fault but I need advice anyway.

My Fiancée and I have been together for 5 years (Dated for about year and a half, moved in together and I popped the question in January and she said yes). Since we have moved in together about 3 years ago or so our sex life has really dropped off and her insecurities with me started.  I have had to delete female friends from facebook, if I talked to a woman in public that I knew it became a game of 20 questions afterwards but she had been cheated on before in a past relationship, the only really serious one she had, so I just managed to deal with it.

About 6 months ago I made a huge career change, it involved going back to school and working full time. I thought I was attentive to her needs the whole time but if I tried to initiate any kind of sexual contact I was swatted away.  During this time I became fast friends with a female co-worker.  There was never sex involved, we never even would take our lunches together, but we shared a cubicle at work, and we talked a lot, she was my direct supervisor.

I was getting to the point that I was going to have to chose work or school because work could not accommodate my schedule and I was burning the candle at both ends.  This female supervisor made sure all my time off was covered, and did everything in her power to make sure my attendance issues did not show up in the system, even going so far as to cover a whole week for me when I had to take time for an emergency operation smack dab in the middle of my studies.

As time went on my Fiancee drifted farther away from me.  I did everything to get her back, the stress was so much that I failed my final exam and had to do a makeup one.  The weekend before my makeup exam I planned a trip for us, scrapping together what little cash I had to go on a small day trip.  The whole time I was in the car with her she hardly spoke, when she did it was small talk, nothing major.  That night when we got home I tried to make love and she rolled over and went to sleep.

The following Monday I aced my exam, 2 days later I had an interview with a company.  I took her along, scrapped together more cash for a hotel room and a fancy meal and basically when we got back to the hotel room she turned off the lights and went to sleep.

I went back to my old job the following week as the interview was a bust and the female co-worker could sense something was up.  I poured my heart out that day, almost left early afterwards.  She was worried about me and asked me for my phone number so we could text, she was scared I would do something stupid.

I ended up landing an internship with a company that required me to travel, the first week I was away the co-worker and I texted.  She wanted to know how things were going.  After a few texts of idle banter she started getting strange. She told me I was only part of a small group of male friends she hadn't slept with and that she preferred dating guys who wanted an open relationship with their current wives or girlfriends so that she could have as many guys wrapped around her fingers as she pleases.  I told her that I would always remain the 2% of guys she never slept with and ended all contact via text but I didn't delete her from facebook.

When I got home from my trip I told my Fiancee what happened.  I wanted to be open and honest with her, as you need that to have a healthy relationship.  She made it out to seem everything was ok and I thought we moved on.

About 4 days later I had to leave again for business and this happened to be the week of our anniversary.  She told me it was fine and we will do something when I get back.  The night of the anniversary I get the text, the one that accuses me of cheating, the whole ""You had an emotional affair"".  I told her that I didn't, called her, did what I could from 3000km away.  She told me that I am always looking for another woman, and that I need to prove to her that I am worth her time.  So much for honesty.

I get home 3 days later.  We go out for coffee and I inform her again that I did not cheat, but having a female friend the did take some interest in me was nice considering her (my fiancée) and I had no physical contact for close to 6 months.  She told me that she was willing to work on it and we had sex for the first time in, well, 6 months.

The next day I decide to make it special considering I was away for our anniversary.  I make a beautiful meal from scratch including dessert and go out and get her chocolates that she loves.  I picked out a dress that she looks absolutely stunning in and matched that with a pair of earrings and a black pear necklace that I got her the first Christmas we were together. I dug out my suit, got all dressed up and picked her up from work.  She walked into the kitchen and saw a candle light dinner complete with wine waiting on the table. I whispered in her ear to go upstairs and get into the outfit I picked out for her.  We ate and then went upstairs.

I did everything in the bedroom she asked of me and more.  When it was my turn she looked at me and said ""You don't get to get off tonight because of the shit you put me through the last few days."" Well needless to say that killed the mood, but I respected what she said and went to bed.

The next morning I got up and she treated me like garbage, lower than garbage actually.  Even when I got the call from work that I had to leave the next morning it didn't get any better.  She then admitted to reading the text messages this woman sent me.  She read them the night of the dinner while I slept.  She then gave me the ultimatum to delete this woman from facebook and cease all contact (which I already had via text) but it didn't stop there.  It ended up becoming an all night shouting match which almost cost me my internship as I was too tired to function like and adult the next day.  She even read the texts in which I asked some of my friends for advice, telling me that I had no business bringing up our relationship to outsiders

The whole time I was away she kept it up, between calls and text messages I had enough and told her to leave before I got back.  Something must have clicked because the next day she apologized and told me she was willing to work things out. She told me that she turned over a new leaf sexually and she was sorry for not being intimate and that it was because she didn't feel pretty anymore.

The day before I was set to come home she called me and told me that she wouldn't be home the day I got in.  She had bought tickets to a show that she and her girlfriends were going to and she would be spending the night at one of their places and I could pick her up the next morning.  I found this odd considering she doesn't trust me and that she wants to work on our relationship. Actually it really pissed me off, but I told her that was fine, we could be together the next day.

I decided at that moment that I would make us breakfast the morning she was coming home.  Even though I would be traveling all night I wanted to do that much for her.  I asked a simple question ""What time would you like me to pick you up in the morning?"" And I was told, in no uncertain terms to ""Stop interrogating her, she will call me in the morning when she is ready!""

I ended up speaking with my boss of my current internship (this is an unpaid position which could lead to employment depending on my performance) and laid it all out on the line.  He was sympathetic, telling me he went through something similar with his current wife, and me managed to get me home a half day early.  It was the best he could do but I wasn't about to pass it up.  I decided not to call her and surprised her at work by showing up.  Her response was ""What are you doing home a day early?"" I told her that I really wanted to see her and talk.  We went home and she went to bed, no talking, so I camped out in front of the TV that night and slept on the couch.

I spend 7-10 days on the road, I am a sexually healthy 31 year old man and when I come home all I want to do is be with her.  She tells me that she wants me too, but every signal she is throwing me makes me think she is the one having the affair.  Her friends never liked me, thought it was beneath her to date someone who was working a dead end job so if I tried to ask them what was going on they wouldn't answer me anyway.  I refuse to stoop to her level and look through her texts but I really feel she is looking for a way out.  The female co-worker did text me when I got back with a screen cap of a message my fiancée sent her saying that ""She can have me, it was what we really wanted!"" with a time stamp for after she told me she was willing to work past all this.

Have we hit the point of no return?  I feel like there is nothing I can do to prove to her that I love her.  She has cost me 4 female friendships over that last 5 years due to accusations just like this.  2 of them were with women I grew up with that have got me through some of the darkest points in my life.  I really do feel like I did nothing wrong, but she keeps making it out to be like I took this chick to a seedy motel room and had sex.  The person I picked to be my best man at our wedding has told me that I will not stand for me if I stay with her but I don't want to throw 5 years away.

I need some help."

I'm pretty happy with that - it seems pretty fun, and it'll be the first big-name booster on my resume.

My original plan was to do the internship and then finish my degree in the fall (I'd only need one semester after this upcoming summer in order to complete my CS degree). However, recently Microsoft offered a fall internship to me. If I took it, I'd end up doing both internships pretty much back to back, and then return to school in the spring and complete my degree.

The problem is, I'm not really sure that's a wise choice. There are certain classes that my college only offers in the fall that I was looking forward to taking. Additionally, taking Microsoft's fall internship means I lose a semester, as otherwise I could be graduating by December. So I'm pretty torn at this point.

Are there any others who have been faced with the decision of whether to do back-to-back internships or just graduate early? What would you do in my position and why?"

Haven't been on many dates since, had some nice talks with people on both Tinder and Grindr the past 1,5 year but they rarely ever result in actually dating them.

Either way, beginning of this year I met a nice guy on Tinder and had 3 dates with him over the course of 1 month. Then he friendzoned me, telling me he wanted to be friends which I agreed to but haven't heard from him and it has been 7 months. Haven't reached out myself either though. Even though he broke my heart, I still often think of him and the time we've spent together and wonder how he's doing (he's currently doing an internship for which he moved, but still fairly close to where I live) and a part of me wants to see him again.

Then there's another guy I met some time later on Grindr which broke it off due to ""not being able to build a relationship right now"" only to say he's sorry and wants to continue with what we were doing. Then met up once after then, canceled again for the subsequent date and after a few days of radio silence I reached out how he was doing he claimed that I ""felt more like a good friend to him"". Auch. Not again....

A few days later I went on vacation (great timing!) and tried to get my mind off him. But for some reason this parting has hit me more. Perhaps because we had a total of 10 dates and it just felt like we were moving towards a relationship already. While I was at holiday he reached out again and told me he couldn't get me out of his head which is new to him, because with previous guys he dated he just forgot and moved on when it was over. 

Him saying that made me believe there was hope. But words are just that and he turns out he wants to be friends to which I told him I don't know if I can. He was the best thing that happened to me.

Even though friendship shouldn't be considered a consolation price how can one go from being so close (cuddling, kissing, sex) to just being friends? A part of me still feels something (and will likely never really go away) and I'll probably hate myself for not making more effort to win him over the first time. Or even worse, trying to win him over again.

Now it has been radio silence for about 3,5 months already and I still miss him dearly. I have never seen him again on Tinder or Grindr so either he has found someone or he is really not able to start a relationship with anyone and taking time for himself.

Either way. Lately I frequently have had the urge to reach out to both of them again. Asking how they're doing, perhaps meeting up again for drinks or something but a part of me keeps me from doing that probably in order to protect myself from getting hurt again. 

I'm conflicted as what to do here. I probably should just leave it at that, delete their contact details and move on hoping to find someone I that will see me as more than a friend. However, based on past experiences the chances of that happening are very slim.

TLDR:
Lately I have had the urge of reaching out to guys I dated earlier this year and have ""friendzoned"" me and never heard of again. Just to ask how they're doing, perhaps hoping to actually become friends which they both claimed to want but neither of which have acted upon that. "

Trump wants to reunite our country under one flag and one anthem with a unwavering commitment to protecting life, liberty, and justice for all; the fact that he wants to bring jobs back to Americans; the fact that he wants to keep out those who disrespect our nation and its borders by entering illegally, the fact that he wants to keep out pernicious ideologies that prey on the weak, the marginalized, and the very bedrock of our republic; and the fact that he is not beholden to special interests and speaks his mind, together, show me the kind of character and good nature he has instilled in his daughter Ivanka, who I hope to vote for in 2024. I am with her, but until her name is on the ballot, I am with Donald J. Trump.

We support a comparatively large finance and marketing department, who, with the exception of a few, see nothing but their own greatness. We have one user who is a semi important director ($SID) and, from what I am being told by my peers, constantly will walk through IT and try to start conversations about firewalls, IoT, and stuff that he clearly doesn't understand. Essentially he thinks everyone in IT is his best friend because they let him talk so that he goes away. Recently, he put in a ticket about ""laptop not functioning properly"". I send him an IM asking what the issue is and he said to just come to his office, as it would be ""easier to show me"". Away I went..

&gt;$Me ""Hello $SID, I saw your ticket about your laptop. What seems to be the issue with it?""

&gt;$SID ""Last week I was on important business trip doing important things and my computer wouldn't come up. It just stayed black. I can't have that happen to me.""

&gt;$Me ""That doesn't sound good. Has it been doing that before or is this the first time?

&gt;$SID ""This is the first time. I'd have called you guys if it happened a lot, I can't have that. I need my laptop to work.""

&gt;$Me ""Understandable. Well if this is the first time it could have been a fluke. I can run some diagnostics on it and check your hardware if you'd like.""

&gt;$SID ""Nah, I think I need a new one. Can you make that happen?""

&gt;$Me ""Before that I wouldn't mind taking a look at this one, if it is having issues we should try and fix it.""

&gt;$SID ""I can't be without my laptop right now. Can't you just build me a new one? I know $OtherDirector just got 
one.""

I'm working on a project for my internship, I've been given a data set that I worked up into an excel spreadsheet of about 400 rows and 15 columns. I want to make a program/app that will let my employer easily get info on rows that match parameters they put in. From what I've googled SQL sounds perfect for this, and I've already learned the basics of the language, but I'm not sure how to go about actually working that into a usable program. From what I've read about MySQL (which was really interesting and I want to learn more about it when I'm on less of a time crunch) I get the idea the database is only accessible through a website? If thats the case, what would be the best way to go about making this application offline? Would I be better off just making something with Java or Python (the only languages I know, if theres a better option, I would gladly learn another if that's what it takes to get this done)? 

Any advice is appreciated, I'm afraid this is a really ambitious project for someone who is barely a beginner, but I tend to learn best when I throw myself into the deep end. Thanks!"

5cf8tk,1,2016-11-11,I am such a loser,galondi,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5cf8tk/i_am_such_a_loser/,"It's so horrible I hate myself. I have nothing,, I am a miserable person. I hate myself for being like that, for being an asshole, a jealous asshole about what others can do.

I have wonderful friends and an awesome boyfriend and my flatmates are also truly awesome. And all of them have so many fucking talents it's unbelievable. Most of the time I hide myself in my room because I can't see the luck of the others. I hate myself even more for that, but it's just that I can't see it in myself. I know I tend to overlook the flaws of others but I just see the best in them but that makes me feel miserable. 

I should be lucky for them right? I should be lucky that I have such inspirational people around me. But the only thing that it makes me feel is even more miserable and like a loser. Because I have nothing like them, I have no skills and not that mindset like them.

For example my flatmate. She is such a strong young woman. She achieves everything she wants in life and it looks like without effort. She is hardworking, dedicated and rational. But she can also have fun! When there is something she want to achieve, she persists on working towards that goal, no matter what failure comes with it. She may cuss around but then she moves on like a fucking master. And then she achieves it and can move on towards another goal. Nothing in life irritates her, she is focused and don't let any boyfriend blur her straightforward sight. It's just so fucking impressing!

My other flatmate is the same. Everything he does he does it without effort. People just love him, everyone just love him. He is good looking, knows what he wants in life but is so spontaneous and open minded. All of his friends love him and when someone is over the only thing you hear is laughter all the time. He is such a cheerful person and he could propose or say whatever he wants, everyone would follow him. He has a big heart and he is just lovely. 

All of my really really close friends are astonishing. They have the most complex characters I've ever met. They are creative, compassionate, loving, caring and thrive towards meaning in life! They care about environments, they care about people in their lifes and try to make the best out of everything. When one of them enters the room the room shines and they make something really special, magical out of it. 
One of them is S. And she is the most lovely person I've met, beneath my boyfriend. She is funny, quirky, has her own mind and although she sometimes struggles with her emotions she always finds her way and such magical places in her life. Whenever I'm with her I would love to stay there forever, just to get something from her inspirational creativeness and otherness.
The other one is G. She has the biggest heart on this planet. For her family for her friends for everyone around her, for every single person she met. And so many people stamped her to the ground because they couldn't see how big her heart is. It's so sad to see that but she fought through so much and never asked for help. She somehow managed it and tried to heal herself from that. This is just so impressing, I don't know how to say that. When you see her all the sunbeams are shining through her face. She is such a good soul. 
One of them is N. She is like a mystery sometimes and she has so much experience although she is not older than any of us. She is strong and hard working and she does what she wants to do. She is big communicator and she ties people and friends and groups together. She has brilliant ideas and a way of lifestyle no one can compete. She is truly a trendsetter. And I love her too!

And one of the most special persons I've met is my boyfriend. And I know how awful it sounds but he is the most impressive person I've ever met. He has fought through mental and pyhsical disorders and still he stays like this and is keen to fight even more. His soul is so tender, I can't even tell how to describe it. Like the sould of a little boy, innocent and with the most raw emotions. And I love him so much, I want to spend my lifetime with him. He is the most intelligent person too, he can do everything. He can learn everything in minutes! I mean he already learnt so fucking much and everyone appreciates him. He is so special, and sometimes a bit odd but that's exactly what I love about him. All of his work he has done so far, in university and other practical experiences, he did excellent. He did perfect on every single thing he touches in life. Everything he do he gets all the appreciation and excellent grades. And I know he will achieve so much. And he can think rational, logical. But also he is creative and creates fantastic stories, touching stories. 

And about me? In comparison to all these peoples and especially my boyfriend I'm a piece of shit. Truly I fucked up in my last two most important exams of my degree and my grades fell drastically after that. So now I have worked 3 years very hard, just to get my whole degree fucked up because of those two grades.

I hate myself I have no single experience and I don't know what to do with my life. I have a shitty degree and now I am looking for an internship and even for that, with a fucking degree, I'm too inexperienced and shitty. I hate it. I don't know what do with my life. There aren't many thoughts other than self-hatred.

Whenever I try to write a motivational letter I see I have no single motivation for anything. Not because I don't want this job but because I know about all those fucking asshole successful people, being 109309329092 better than me. Sorry for ranting but that's the only place I can do it. I HATE IT. 

And then my boyfriend comes over, he has severe depression, and writes a perfect, outstanding motivational letter for his own job. And I read it and I feel so bad about myself because I'm just a piece of shit. And I hate it that I have this feelings. Every single sentence is beautiful and astonishing written. Of course he can get the job in no time. And they will love him and appreciate his work and creativity.

And I? I have zero creativity. I have nothing I can do really good. There is no true one calling I have. The only true calling is being a fucking loser. But even that I'm not like perfect. A perfect loser. 
I have no creativity, I have no skills, I have no hard skills, no soft skills. Nothing. When I look at my resume I feel like these are just shallow bubbles.

5cfldu,24,2016-11-11,MongoDB or Microsoft for a summer internship in software engineering?,dsioa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cfldu/mongodb_or_microsoft_for_a_summer_internship_in/,"Hey everyone,

Trying to make some tough decisions and would appreciate guidance if you have any: I have offers from both MongoDB (NYC) and Microsoft (Redmond) to work as a software engineering intern for the summer between my junior and senior year.


Below is some information about each of my offers.

**MongoDB:**

 * Working in Times Square, NY office (HQ)

 * Free Housing in NYU dorms

 * Smaller company perhaps provides more interesting work

 * (Seemingly) more selective internship program

 * (Hopefully) server or cloud team


**Microsoft:**

* Working in Redmond, WA office (HQ)

* Free corporate housing in nearby apartment

* Slightly higher pay (+$5/hr)

* Huge name brand which could help on my resume

* SQL Server team


Last year, I worked at big-name financial data company in NYC. Coming from a large company, I feel that Microsoft might be a similar experience. However, a summer in the Seattle area would be a ton of fun, and the Microsoft name could be a huge help on my resume. Furthermore, the SQL Server team seems to be pretty legit. (If anyone knows anything about this team, that'd be amazing!)

I'm not 100% sure about the future of MongoDB, especially when most tech companies prefer to use PostgreSQL, Cassandra, HBase, etc. depending on the problem. At the same time, I *loved* the culture at MongoDB, and it's somewhere I'd love to go to full-time when I graduate. (They hinted that they mainly hire new-grads from their intern class.) 

Because of these reasons, I'm really conflicted about which company to go to. Has anyone interned at either of these companies, and could give me any advice? (Or even if you haven't, I'd love your opinion.)

Thanks so much guys!"

Here's my idea:

We need to open up a market where investment companies can buy the right to a percentage of people's tax dollars! Companies could pay people's medical bills or college tuition in exchange for the right to take a small percentage (maybe no more than 5%?) of that person's federal income tax for the next 20 years (or maybe 10 or 5 years).

This way, companies who invest in good people who work hard and make a lot of money will make a profit and companies who invest in liberal arts majors or women's studies majors will fail. **The market will decide what's important, and people who deserve student loans will get them.**

Make America Great Again by literally investing directly in tax payers!"

I've been working this job for about 3 years now. Started off as an intern not doing anything at all, then slowly cut my teeth on some pretty cool stuff. Now i spin up environments, do very basic MySQL work, Jenkins automation, server monitoring, software monitoring, etc. 

My brother asked me if i wanted to do the Hack Reactor bootcamp with him. So im basically here to ask you guys what you think. With my 3 years current working experience (that will only increase), Cisco Certs(basic stuff), and then the hack reactor training, how possible is it for me to find work in the area and for how much yearly? 

I'm just asking for advice or tips or anything you guys can offer me to steer me in some sort of direction. Currently im stumped, i have no idea what i want to do. I would love to do the bootcamp but ill be spending about 20k. I know most people say don't expect much of anything form bootcamps if you have no prior knowledge or working experience, but thats where i hesitate. I feel like my background in systems and networking would really help me become a very well versed and dynamic Full Stack Engineer.

Responsbilities as part of the commitment to write for the local college newspaper were sending me into depression. My classwork was suffering. Grades dropped. But then a curious thing happened.

Just three days ago I was fired from my job at the local college news paper. The day after my firing, I went to see the university academic advisor for the local college news paper. Every group on campus has an academic advisor. The local college news paper was no exception.

I spoke with the advisor, who agreed to talk to the editors who fired me. He spoke to them. I told the editor that I do not want my job back as there are only three weeks of class and the Thanksgiving break. Furthermore, I told the advisor that I didn't want any acts of revenge or reports or files to be sored away that would harm the people who fired me. Responding, the advisor said that my decision to not seek grievance was classy.

I enjoyed working at the local college news paper. I enjoyed meeting people and getting the stories in. I enjoyed seeing my name published in the papers and I loved the respect and reputation of honesty I earned for myself. My teachers were proud of me. They even said so.

Seeking an internship and employment outside of college, I told the advisor that I wanted to intern at the city's only news paper. We're a very small city. The university student population is about 10,000 souls. The city in which the university resides is only another 15,000 souls.

The advisor agreed to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf and agreed to be a contact on my job resume.

Today, my stress levels are down, thoughts of suicide are gone, and I Have time enough to work on my remaining class papers.

5chccp,0,2016-11-11,~50k in student loan debt with 3 years left to finish school. Looking for advice on the best course of action to take?,theSuppleLemur,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5chccp/50k_in_student_loan_debt_with_3_years_left_to/,"Howdy,

So first off, I apologize if this is lacking any information that could be useful for you guys to assess my situation. This is my first post here.

The title sums it up. I'm close to 50k in student loan debt with no degree yet. I went to school for 2 years (Biochemistry) before finding out I thoroughly enjoyed programming and deciding to make the switch to Computer Science. Then I took one semester of classes to help cover some pre-requisites I was missing for Comp Sci classes. The 50k figure is from 2 1/2 years of school, as well as a summer spent studying abroad and having an (unpaid) internship in China.

I've been stressing out like none other over this. Worrying I won't have the financial means to make it through three more years of school (I have about 10k left I can borrow if needed before reaching the undergraduate borrowing limit), being too much in debt over my head (in a worst-case scenario, such as not receiving a single grant, scholarship, or paying any towards my schooling that I earn as I go, I would need to take out around 30k to cover these next 3 years), etc. 

I realized I was borrowing way too much where I previously was, so I moved back home. Now I don't have to pay rent or for food, which is a godsend. As much as I hate being in my low 20s and living with my parents, I can't force myself to put myself back in that situation again. I'm not currently in school since I owe a few thousand from my last semester at my previous institution before I can actually get my transcripts transferred over and resume taking classes at school near home. I'm looking to have this paid off by April / May, and enroll back in school starting in the summer.

I intend on spending a year at a local CC to take more of the pre-requisites I need. They will all transfer over to my intended institution fine. I planned on going part-time so I can pay for the classes over the course of the semester instead of borrowing anymore. After this next year spent at the CC, I would have 2.5, maybe 3 years at the state university to finish my degree. The semesters would be fairly light, but I can't speed it up too much since all the classes build on each other. I may only have 10-12 credits per semester, but I can't take anymore classes until I pass those 10-12 credits at a time. Get what I'm saying?

So what is the smarter route to take: do I get through the remainder of school as fast as possible, even though that means taking out additional student loans, so that I can enter the work force ASAP and begin paying them off? Or, do I stretch my schooling out an additional 2-3 years (this definitely isn't the route I want to take, but if it's the smarter of the two choices, well, I'm willing to strongly reconsider) in order to take out as few loans as possible, paying for most of school along the way.

If I go to school with the intention of graduation as quick as possible, there will probably be a period of 1-2 years towards the end where whatever tuition that isn't covered by grants, scholarships (will be doing everything I can to get some), or money I make at my job, that will have to covered by private loans since I will have potentially reached the $31,000 limit by then.

I should note that since I will be living at home, I will only need to pay for tuition, which comes out to ~10k a year at the state university I plan to attend.

I realize that I have made mistakes and am going to be spending many years dealing with them. Perhaps the biggest of these was going to school not knowing what I wanted to do. Now, there's no one here to blame but myself. But I do come from a financially irresponsible household and did not have the best role models growing up when it comes to money. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents to death, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life dealing with poor financial decisions like they have. I would love to be 35 years old and debt free, actually being able to live comfortably and support a family.

Sorry if this is wordy, there's just a lot on my mind and I want to figure out the best way to go about this. I'm leaning towards the ""finish school ASAP and get to paying off those loans"" route but am here to hear the advice of someone far more educated in the matter than I.

So far, I've created five personal projects that I've uploaded on Github (one of which was an app I made to improve sales tracking at my old job), I currently contribute to an open source project on Github, I completed 50 questions on Project Euler, and have read CTCI while finishing around 10 problems from the book. On my resume I put my experience as a team lead at the sales company I worked at, the projects I made, the languages I work with, and as well as my website that I created which acts as a portfolio.

The school's system matched me with the developer job at a company with 3 employees that's paying me minimum wage. I am very underwhelmed by this because all of my friends are making at least twice what I am at better firms and I am financially struggling. I'm now motivated to learn enough to work at a top firm in North America by the time my next internship term rolls around (next year). The advisors I've talked to and shown my resume to told me that it was either just ""bad luck"" and that I needed more experience before any company would have a look at me. How do I end up accomplishing my goal of working at a top firm in North America based on what I've already done? I am willing to dedicate a lot of time to making this happen.

I just learned I am getting a second interview with Immersion on Monday for their Software Engineer Internship potion. For this one they want to do shared screen with Skype and have me do some code in C++. Does anyone have any idea what they ask? I looked on GlassDoor but it didn't help much, especially for internship positions. Has anyone here ever interned there before? I'm a bit concerned because I have more experience with C# than I do C++(last time I used C++ was a month ago but I use C# almost every day since I've been working on a indie game in Unity). I just want to try and be as prepared as possible and with so much to know and so much they might ask I'm not really sure where to begin. Thanks for help btw."

Any advice would be appreciated.,tacopirate2589,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5ciao0/im_graduating_this_year_with_an_english_degree/,"When I began my college career, I planned to go into teaching. I was very sure about this until the end of my junior year/beginning of senior year. As a result of these plans, my undergraduate degree is in English. I was going to do a MIT program to get my certification, but I have no desire to do teach and definitely do not want to spend two more years and $20k+ on a MA degree I don't even want.

I used my elective slots this quarter for English ed classes and absolutely hate them. Even if I were to be accepted into the MIT program, I don't think I would be a good teacher, at least at this point in my life.

All of my extracurricular experiences have to do with working with high school kids: observing classrooms, some tutoring, and helping out with campus events catered to secondary students. None of this experience is prolonged, either. I did not have a chance to build good relationships with mentors given that all of my volunteer experiences were for separate events.


Outside of school, my only work experience is in food service. With the exception of my freshman year, I only worked consistent jobs during the summer to save for school. During the school year I primarily focused on keeping good grades to obtain and keep scholarships.


On a more positive note, I only need two more classes for my major and 16 credits to graduate. I have 20 credits (4 classes) I could fill with electives. 


For the remainder of the school year, my options are: 

1. Take the minimum full-time credits Winter and Spring quarter and focus on getting a relevant job or internship.

2. Chose a minor, but not have much time to look for/work a relevant job.

3. Take 16+ credits Winter quarter and be done with school in March.

** I have a scholarship that will pay 100% of my tuition under the condition I keep a 3.5+ in every class. I cannot afford to slack off in any classes if I want to stay in school through Spring quarter. I have $20k in loans and was hoping to stay through Spring quarter to keep them deferred while I am on my lease in my college town. 




I'm very worried about job prospects given my degree and lack of experience.

 If anyone has advice to push me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it!

I can't seem to decide what to choose, but I know I want to select the one that teaches me the most while also enabling me to land a prestigious internship for my junior year, as I am a Sophomore in college.  Which one do you think will provide the most oppurtunity to me to grow as a computer scientist?  Which one will look the most prestigious on my resume?  Which one is best if I am considering graduate school?  My career advisor is not familiar with computer science internships, so I'd figure I'd seek outside help."

I met her in college as I turned 27. I couldn't take my eyes off of her the first time I saw her there in church. It was one of those moments where I felt like things were going in slow motion. I had to get to know her.

I found out that her name is Haley.

I don't really believe in fate, but something brought us together. By chance I was assigned to a position that would allow me to get to know her and her roommates. Out of a hundred or so other people, I was assigned to them. It's not exactly a long shot, but it felt like fate, or whatever you would call something like fate when you don't believe in fate.

I felt like we clicked immediately. Our first date was okay, but I've never had an amazing first date. Don't even know what that would feel like. I was nervous about my date with her being enough because she had gone on this amazing group date with her roommate and two guys just two days prior. But, it went well enough, I liked her plenty, and I setup a second date for the following weekend. She agreed and I started making plans. She had told me she'd never seen Indiana Jones before, so I setup a day where we'd watch all 3 in a movie theatre in my apartment complex and we would make fun food and snacks throughout.

The following weekend came and she bailed on me for that second date. I wasn't wildly surprised. This isn't the first, second, fifth, or even tenth time someone has bailed on a second date with me. Not really sure how to account for that.

So, I wrote her off in my mind and started becoming interested in one of her roommates.

Haley and I still remained friends and I spent a lot of time with her and her roommates at their apartment. They all liked having me around, and I had a blast with them.

Several months later my roommates and her roommates decided we would start watching movies with several sequels each weekend and blow through them all; a sort of marathon movie weekend thing. We started with all of the Star Wars movies, as SOMEHOW most of her apartment had never seen any of the Star Wars films, and the following weekend was the Indiana Jones marathon. Again, as ""fate"" would have it, while we were watching what would've been a bullet point in our second date, she started to get cozy with me and starts cuddling with me on the couch.

Shortly thereafter, one thing led to another, and we were officially dating and together. I'd never been more happy in my entire life. I was 27 years old and I'd never had a relationship before, though lord knows I've tried. I was now in a serious relationship with this absolutely gorgeous girl, prettiest girl I've even ever taken on a date before. She's funny, she's ambitious, loves to learn, and is just like me in so many ways. Her roommates would jokingly say that she's the female version of me.

I had Haley, was in my last semester of school, and had a job waiting for me at a huge tech company doing something I've always wanted to do and in a part of the country I've always wanted to live in. Things were perfect. Everything was coming together right at the end of my undergrad school career.

I spent every moment I wasn't in class with Haley. She couldn't stand to be away from me either. We both went to school at a religious university that had a midnight curfew. All boys had to be out of female apartments, and the same thing went for girls in guy apartments. Haley and I never followed this rule. Even in the moments we weren't together, we were texting and messaging each other every 5-10 mins. Seeing a notification embroidered with her name at the top of my phone's screen brought me one of the most fantastic feelings. This girl wanted to be with me. For the first time in my life I had someone who wanted me as much as I wanted them.

The end of the semester came and it was time for me to graduate and move away. This ball was already in motion long before I met her. Haley is younger than I am, so she had a lot of schooling left to do. We both knew this, but we tried hard not to think about it or talk about it until the time came where we needed to. The time came and she was terrified to lose me, and I her.

I was about to start a job where I'd be making good money, so I told her I would fly her out as often as she could manage to come. We wanted to be exclusive, though I gave her an out if she wanted it. I told her she could date other people while I was away. She didn't want to date other people. She told me this in no uncertain terms. In fact, she started to have a panic attack the moment I brought up dating other people because she was afraid I was breaking up with her.

We stayed exclusive and continued to date long distance.

Shortly into moving to my new home, I contracted a form of acute vertigo, and associated agoraphobia and anxiety disorders, that made life difficult to lead. I lost my independence and asked my mom to move in with me while I went to doctors and tried to get better. There were moments when walking to the bathroom was difficult. 24 hours a day I felt like I was on a boat in heavy seas. Being awake had become a miserable test of endurance.

The only thing that made waking up bearable was waking up to Haley's name at the top of my phone wishing me a ""Good morning :)"".

I'd never loved anyone before, but I felt like I loved Haley. Because I'd never been in love before, I didn't know what romantic love felt like. There were moments of doubt where I thought I should try new things and date new people, but those feelings faded fast the more I dated Haley. Though we were apart, we talked just as much as ever. Every night was consumed by long face to face video chats, and we'd talk until one of us fell asleep.

One day I woke up, and I don't know what changed, or what switch was flipped in my head, but I knew I loved Haley. There was no longer any doubt. Suddenly the idea of me being with any other girl disgusted me. All I wanted was her.

Because of my vertigo, I couldn't travel to go see her, and that KILLED me. It tore me up that my body was keeping me from her. Haley and I came up with an idea and discussed her doing an internship in the same city I lived in, and suddenly there was a chance for me to be near her again all the time.

Haley is younger than me. Perhaps too much so. I was 27 and she was 18 at the time. I didn't plan to love someone that much younger than me, it just happened. Her parents hated the fact that I was so much older than her. They'd never met me, and Haley was too afraid to set up a conversation between her parents and myself. I'm a good guy! I knew they would like me. She made the excuse that her parents have always hated her past boyfriends and she was afraid of that happening again. They wouldn't let Haley accept an internship near me, and because Haley is still young, she accepted that answer...because they're her parents. It drove me insane that Haley wouldn't just take the risk for me.

My mother and grandmother, the two people whose opinions I respect most in the world, told me that I needed to ""put a ring on that girl's finger and let her know where [my] heart is"". Up until that point, I'd never seriously considered the thought that I might actually get married to someone. I had hoped that would be in my future, but when you had been single for as long as I had, I kind of gave up on the notion. I treated it like some far away dream I would never realize. It was starting to become real now. It might ACTUALLY happen. It was a very surreal feeling.

I started to go to doctors as often as I could so I might be cured of my ailment, so that I might be able to go to Haley and propose to her. I came up with a really cute proposal, chose to do it on her birthday, and started looking at her pinterest for ideas for rings.

Haley started acting strange after all of the discussions and arguments with her parents about her taking an internship near me. She became somewhat distant, at least more so than she had ever been with me.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we're doing our normal daily video chat. I can see that she's sitting on her bed, with her legs crossed, laptop and cell phone in front of her. The conversation is going well, as usual...until all of the sudden she gets a text, looks down at her phone, and pans back up with a look of sheer panic on her face. She stumbles over her words a bit, but manages to blurt out, ""I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I'll call you back in 20 mins"". The video call goes dead.

I had NO IDEA what to make of that situation. So, I just waited. I knew her brother was out of the country in Europe, so I was afraid she got bad news about him. There were a lot of terrorist attacks happening over there at the time.

I waited 20 mins...40 mins...60 mins...90 mins.

I finally got a video call back from Haley. She sounded...tired...and she wouldn't make eye contact with me much in the video. I ask her what's going on, and she tells me that she got bad news about one of her friends who was on a religious mission. She tells me that friend had some medical problems and had to come home early. I told her that I understood how that might be disappointing, but I was wondering why she reacted the way she did, as as intensely as she did. She quickly changed the subject and said her mom was calling and that she'd talk to me later.

I started to recall something, that I had tried to forget, that Haley briefly dated a guy before me, but she broke up with him because he was leaving on a religious mission. I was afraid that this ""friend"" might have been this guy.

About a week goes by.

I get a phone call from her...and I don't know why, but I had a bad feeling about this phone call. Somehow the phone call came at an odd time and seemed out of character for her. When you're doing a long distance relationship, you start to get a feeling for people's communication patterns. People are normally very predictable, and when they fall outside of these patterns, you start to get nervous or worried. It's hard to explain, but this call felt out of the norm somehow.

I answered the call. Immediately she sounded anxious. It's hard to describe the tone of her voice, but it felt like how someone might sound on the phone if someone else had put a gun to their head, but they're trying to say that everything is alright when it's not alright.

She told me she had been talking to a church official (like a priest/reverend) and that she was working through some things from her past. She said the church official told her that she shouldn't be dating anyone while she works on these things. I had been a member of this church my whole life...and that sounded like a weird request for the official to ask of her. She told me that we needed to take a break for a little while, and that she didn't want anything to change. She said the only thing that would change is that we wouldn't call each other boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.

I urged her to reconsider, because I already felt like our relationship was strained somehow due to the internship battle with her parents. Long distance relationships are hard enough as it is. I knew this little ""break"" from each other was going to be the end of it for good.

I told her I didn't feel right about it, and she conceded. I had hoped things were back to normal.

All of the sudden I'm not hearing from Haley like I used to. I'm not getting morning wake up texts anymore, or anything. She's no longer bugging me to video chat every couple of hours. Something was wrong. Something was happening. My stomach is now uneasy and nervous.

I decide to talk to her best friend and roommate to see what's going on. I call her on the phone and ask her why Haley hasn't called me that particular evening like she said she was going to. Her friend let's out a huge sigh and says, ""Please don't make me do this"". ""...Do what?"", I reply. She let's out another huge sigh and tells me that Haley is out with her ex who did in fact come home early from his religious mission.

I tell her to make sure Haley calls me when she gets home, as my friendship with her depends on it.

Haley finally calls...almost 2 hours past curfew...so I know this wasn't just a friendly hello with this guy. At the beginning of the call, Haley tried to hide where she'd been all night. I ask her very directly if she was out with her ex, and she tried to deflect by asking me ""who told [you] that"". I eventually shake it out of her and she admits that she's been with him the last few days. She tells me she loves both of us and she's really confused. I tell her that I love her to the point where I would want to marry her, and inform her of how much it hurts that it's not an easy decision to choose me over him. She just keeps telling me that she doesn't know what to do and that she still really loves me.

I try to be understanding of the situation she's in...and I tell her I'll give her a week to decide between us. I only ask that she doesn't take too much time and that she tries to give me as much time and attentoin as she give him, because it's not perfectly fair that I can't be there with her in the moment due to my illness and he can.

She agrees.

The next morning is a little better, but her attention starts to drop quickly again. I get nervous once more and talk to her best friend/roommate (the same one from before). She asks me if I know about the letters. I say, ""...what letters?"" 

I come to find that Haley has been writing several love letters to this guy almost every week he's been gone. I'm talking about letters where they're discussing what their kids would look like, what kind of dog they will get when they're married, and what their house will look like.

I had been dating Haley for several months at this point and I had heard NOTHING about any of this. Haley even lied to her roommates when they asked if I knew about this guy and these letters...telling them that I knew all about it.

Her best friend/roommate also told me that Haley's just leading me on, and that she made her choice about me vs the other guy days ago...and that I didn't win.

I tried to keep composure at work while I started spiraling down emotionally. I walked outside and had an emotionally fueled phone call with Haley the moment I found that out about her letters, and after she tried to lie a few more times...I broke it off with her. I yelled at her. I had never so much as raised my voice at Haley before. I yelled at her.

I immediately felt bad about the way I treated her on the phone call, though I stood by everything I felt and most of what I said.

**SIDENOTE**

**Shortly after that relationship ending phone call...something hits me. When we first started dating officially, she apologized to me for bailing on our second date, and asked me to not hate her for doing that. She tells me that she was seeing a friend off on a religious mission...and didn't know if she'd see that person again. It hit me...she bailed on our second date to be with this very guy. I also found out that the group date she went on two days before her first date with me...was also with this guy. FROM THE BEGINNING this guy has been in the mix ruining things. He had the jump on me by TWO DAYS.**

**Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.**

**/SIDENOTE**

Two days after we break up, she's in a ""Facebook official"" relationship with this guy, and engaged to him only a week after that...on July 4th weekend. Don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy that holiday again. I lost 15lbs because I was sick to my stomach about all of this and couldn't eat.

She made a deal with her fiance to cut all ties with me. So, not only did I lose the only love of my life, but I lost my best friend.

A couple of months later, her birthday comes, and I'm reminded of a marriage proposal that I planed, but will never be.

I was in the darkest point of my life at that moment. I was alone again, I was sick, lost my independence, was living with my mom again, and I could hardly leave the house to go to the grocery store. My life was starting to fall apart. 

...but something interesting happened around Haley's birthday. Her engagement ended up falling through and she became single again. Long story short *(as if the brevity of this part of the story would make much of a difference after this novel)*, her parents and I became decent friends and we joined together under a common cause...get Haley to not get married to that guy. I came to find that he was a huge jerk and treated Haley and her parents poorly...and Haley's parent's were scared to death of Haley getting married this young.

**SIDENOTE**

**Though Haley's parents hated this guy, they let Haley travel alone to Las Vegas to stay with him, and even paid for her hotel. Remember when they wouldn't let her visit me? Yeah. I remember that too. Interesting double standard.**

**/SIDENOTE**

**SIDENOTE 2**

**Haley had been in a car accident shortly before I graduated and moved away. She hit her head in that car accident. Less than 6 months before that, she smacked her head on an asphalt parking lot and developed a very severe concussion. It took her a couple of weeks for speech and motor function to come back. I believed part of Haley's erratic behavior might have been due to repeated head trauma. She had even been to a doctor and they saw significant swelling in her skull.**

**/SIDENOTE 2** 

I came to find out that her parents didn't like the age difference between Haley and I primarily because they were afraid I was going to try to marry Haley right away and not let her finish up school. I told them I had plans to propose to her, but wanted Haley to finish school too before we got married.

Because I had been helpful to getting Haley's head issues diagnosed, Haley's mom was being super cool to me and suggested I try to get in contact with Haley again and see what happens, as she could really use a friend right now. You see, Haley ended up behaving poorly around her roommates and friends right around the time she got engaged. I believed a lot of that might have been due to the head trauma. She ended up burning bridges with a lot of her friends and she didn't have many people ""in her circle"" anymore and was dealing with depression. Haley was also back home, away from school, and all of her old friends were away at school themselves. She had no one but her family, and now me.

I know what you're thinking...""Turn around! Don't go back to her! Stay away!!""

I now almost wish I had done that.

The same night I find out Haley's engagement fell through, her and I talk again for the first time in months. It felt **SO GOOD**. It was like trying to stop biting your nails, getting a few weeks in without biting, and then just going to town and taking your nails down to stubs. You aren't proud of yourself...but it felt so good.

Haley apologizes to me for everything. 

While Haley was still engaged, I was seeking guidance and inspiration from anyone I could because I was not doing well. I spoke with my step-sister about a very similar situation she was in when she was younger with her first fiance and the man that ended up becoming her husband. When she ditched the man that would become her husband for the other guy...and then the engagement fell through...the man that would become her husband didn't make her feel shame for what she did. She tells me that meant so much to her that it was one of the things that led her to want to marry him in the end.

I took this and applied it to my situation...and forgave Haley immediately. I took her back in without any struggle...and it FELT SO GOOD. I was happy again. Though we weren't technically ""dating"" again...I had ""my girl"" back. I looked at it, again, as ""fate"". Finally this other guy was out of her life and I'd have a chance to be the only man in her heart. I also had a good relationship with her parents now. I felt like this might finally all work out this time.

Haley and I started talking like normal again. Texting every 5 mins, and video chatting every night. She even told me she thought about me a lot before her engagement fell through, and even thought about buying a plane ticket to come see me and apologize in person.

This made me think that MAYBE, just maybe, Haley is willing to live her own live and come see me with or without her parent's say so. She's young, but she's an adult. She can make her own decisions. BUT, she said she caused so much turmoil in her relationship with her parents dealing with her ex-fiance that she didn't want to do that again, and that she would only come see me if her parents okay'd it.

They never did. I even offered to fly her parents out with her so that she wouldn't be alone and they could meet me in person.

Still a no.

We tried for a couple of months to get her parents to let her come see me. Though we weren't officially dating, Haley said she has a lot of deep feelings for me and is interested in pursuing those with me.

After a few tries, and a few more no's, Haley started getting sad and distant again. I started to recognize this from when this happened before...the last time it all fell to pieces. I started to get nervous all over again. No way was I going to lose her again. I couldn't go through that **again**.

Because Haley couldn't come see me, we started having what I could only describe as a video chat dates. We would go get the same food, turn on a webcam, and video chat. Often times we would also watch hockey and Haley loved hockey. Hockey is the only sport I like to watch, so that made me love Haley even more.

A couple of weeks after I noticed Haley getting distant, I was trying to contact her to discuss the hockey game that night, because I got the times mixed up and was late home from work.

The last few weeks I was hearing from Haley less and less. This day was no different. I hadn't heard from her for hours that day...which is unheard of for us. Silly, I know. She finally texts me and tells me she's working on a project with someone for an online class and would call me in a couple of hours.

Several hours pass and I still don't hear from her. I'm texting her every hour or so just to send her something fun for her to read, but get no response. Not even an emoji or ""haha"".

My mom plants the idea in my head that maybe she's talking to another guy and that's why I'm not hearing from her.

Suddenly it's 2:30AM her time, and I FINALLY hear from her. She says she took so long because she was finishing up the project with this person who she says is a friend she hadn't heard from in a few months. I ask her if the friend she was talking to was a guy. She asked me why it mattered. Then all of the sudden she says she's tired and has to go to sleep and would talk to me later.

I call her right away before she has a chance to go to sleep. She answers the phone with an annoyed tone in her voice.

I ask her again if she was talking to a guy for the past several hours and basically ignoring me. She said she was talking to a guy, but it's a guy from her class, she hasn't talked to him for a while, and that she's annoyed that I'm being jealous the way that I am. She tells me she has feelings for ME and no one else but me, and not to worry.

I feel stupid, but try to help her remember what she had done to me several months prior and that I'm dealing with a bit of PTSD from that. She understood, calmed down a bit, and reiterated that she cares for me, that she's not stringing me along, and that I shouldn't worry.

We end the call amicably. She texts me a few more times before I go to bed and tells me AGAIN to please not worry.

A week or so after that, Haley tells me that, because she's been kind of lonely and depressed, that her parents might fly her up to school to see a couple of friends, and to also look for housing for when she returns to school full time. I tell her that maybe I can visit her there while she's at school visit. I figured I could have my mom help me drive there, as my vertigo was still very troublesome at that point.

Haley looks and sounds excited by the prospect. I tell her to let me know as soon as she knows if and when she's going. She agrees.

A couple of weeks later, on one of our video chats, Haley tells me that she already has her place ticket booked, she's had it for weeks, and that she hasn't told me yet because...and she says that she didn't know how to tell me this...but that she didn't think that it was a good idea that I go.

Her excuse was that she burned a lot of bridges with friends up at school and that she wants to spend time with those friends, primarily her roommates, to try to rekindle things. She tells me most of her trip will be devoted to that, and other times she would be looking for housing. She says that she knows that if I met her there, all she would want to do is spend time with me, and she wouldn't have enough time to spend with her roommates and looking at housing.

Are you rolling your eyes yet? You should be. I should have been. But...I was lost in hopeless hope. Hope that she and I could be together again. I wanted nothing more in life. I would've given up my home, my truck, my job, and everything else that I have just to be with her one more time. I sincerely felt that way.

So, her excuse made sense to me...and I told her I would stay behind.

Fast forward to the following week when she's leaving on her trip. She seems fine in the morning when she leaves for the airport...but the second her plane touches down in her destination...I effectively stop hearing from her. The only time she contacts me is after midnight her time...ie. after curfew. She couldn't text me to let me know she arrived safely, or that she'd be busy and would talk to me later. No. Just flat out ignores me all day long. She does this for 4-5 days. 

I come to find out that she spent a grand total of 30 mins with her roommates, and spent the rest of her time on that trip with the guy from her online group. You know, the one she told me not to worry about. For some reason she thoguth it a good idea to post a picture of the double date she went on to instagram...where she knows I can see it.

When she came back home, I told her I knew she was going on dates with this guy while she was gone. She refuses to admit that she lied about having feelings for this guy until just this conversation...saying that she was really turned off be me calling her with that jealous phone call that one night...even though I was scared she was going to do what she ended up doing.

Let's just say that I deal with Haley's crap for a few more months, get effectively cheated on/betrayed a couple of more times before I finally decided that I had enough and couldn't do it anymore. I had run myself sick with worry as I worry about her turning to the alcohol and drug abuse from her earlier teens, her dealing with anorexia, cutting, and suicidal tendencies. Almost all of these being things I didn't know about her when we first started dating. I stuck by her because I loved her.

But, I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't be treated like trash anymore. I ended our friendship one day before what would've been our relationship's one year anniversary. She was in a relationship with a new guy the very next day. She couldn't even wait a week out of respect for me.

This was in March of this year. I didn't talk to her again until July, when I was feeling guilty about the way I ended things and apologized to her. Here it is, November, and I haven't talked to her again since July...but I've thought about her all day long, every single day since March.

I've cried more in the last year and a half than I've done collectively in my entire teen/adult life. It's over a year and a half since I graduated and moved away...and I'm still sick, still scared to death to be more than 20 mins away from home by myself, had to move back home with my parents to get better medical care, might lose my job for having to do that, and feel more romantically alone than I've ever felt in my life. I went from everything being perfect, to everything in my life falling apart around me.

I try **really** hard to not think about Haley, to have no contact, or check up on her in any way...but sometimes information makes its way to me. Today I found out that Haley is engaged again, and to the guy she told me not to worry about. If I couldn't feel bad enough, this guy isn't sick like I am, he comes from a wealthy family, and is a pilot.

I've never felt so...wildly depressed in my life. She's off, happy, and doing well...and I'm doing so poorly. I was having a hard enough time finding someone to love me as it was when I was healthy. Who's going to want me now?

I still have as much love for her as I ever have...but there's a hate for her now that's grown along side it. I try not to feel that way...but I can't help it. I'm so jealous and angry that she was able to do this to me and immediately walk away into her next happily ever after while I'm suffering.

I don't think I've ever felt like I've had such little control over anything in my life. I've come to learn that the ONLY thing I have control over is how I react to what life throws at me.

...I just wish it would stop throwing so much at me.

I wish I could let her go. I wish I knew how, so that I wouldn't be in such pain anymore.

**What happened to my life?**"
5civa5,9,2016-11-11,X201 Long Story/Thoughts and Questions (at the end),[deleted],thinkpad,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/5civa5/x201_long_storythoughts_and_questions_at_the_end/,"Over the years, I've owned several different models of ThinkPads. It all started with an X100e back in the summer of 2012. Before then, I had heard some tales from older coworkers and saw a few while I was in college. While I did an IT internship, one of the senior staff carried around his T60 or T61 by the top of the LCD bezel (where the webcam would be on a newer model). I never saw such a thing before and didn't know whether to think he was a moron or marvel at how tough that ThinkPad really was.

Since then, the oldest I've owned was a 755CE, and the newest a T460p (the only one I've purchased new so far) with many in between. Some of my ""daily drivers"" included the T400, T410, X200, and X220. Throughout that journey, I found that I prefer the power of the T4xx line, but prefer the form factor and portability of the X2xx line. An X2xx model just feels way more portable and easier to use for me. 

For several months, I used an X200 with the X200 Ultrabase and dual external monitors. Although the X200 was my favorite, it really started showing its age around the late summer of 2015. Then I purchased an X220, finally got a decent job several months later, and upgraded to the T460p I have now. 

I preferred the look and feel of the X200, but needed more power and RAM. While I owned the X200, I purchased an X201, but had to return it. When the X201 arrived, the always-on USB port had a broken connector and the screen had some nicks/damage (it was described as everything working). Fortunately, the seller was easy to deal with and took it back. Since then, I wanted to revisit the X201 but never did until this past week.

So, here we are, in 2016. My T460p is my desktop replacement (with Ultra Dock and two Dell U2414H monitors), and I am using the X201 as a bedside and travel laptop. My X201 has the following specs: Core i5 M 560 CPU, 8 GB of RAM, 180 GB Intel 520 SSD. I love how it's a mix of the ""retro"" ThinkPads with semi-modern guts. I miss all the status LEDs, the ThinkLight, the 7 row keyboard, the blue Enter key, and the much more ergonomic palmrest (at least compared to the T460p). Aside from the warmer running CPU (my X200's P8600 rarely went over 60 C under load), it's everything I missed about the X200 plus a trackpad (yes, I do use those sometimes) and a faster CPU. I haven't had a chance to do much of a stress test, but it should be good enough as a spare/travel/bedside machine. 

What else should I do to ""max out"" my X201? I've got a USB 3.0 Expresscard and a new Lenovo 9 cell battery on the way. Is it worth installing a Gobi 2000 if I may never end up using it? Should I replace the thermal paste (runs at high 40's/low 50's at idle and general usage)?

Thanks

5cj5xb,31,2016-11-12,I wrote this a while back (2 years ago) but never posted it. I hope this helps those who are currently looking or thinking about looking for a new job/career.,Ibram002,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5cj5xb/i_wrote_this_a_while_back_2_years_ago_but_never/,"Intro:

I’m a MBA graduate, Eagle Scout, UCLA Alumni, Entrepreneur and was even a Manager at an international engineering and manufacturing company for the Oil &amp; Gas Industry. I graduated my MBA with honors, worked full-time on multi-million dollar projects and have vast experience in multiple industries (Oil &amp; Gas, Energy, Education, Municipality, Fast-Food, Sports, and Entertainment). To some, my background and qualifications may be impressive, to others, it may seem monotonous, or even mediocre. However, a couple months ago, I was unemployed, lost, depressed...and couldn't get a single interview, no matter what I did. 

I’m writing this entry as an informative piece, only to share my experience of being unemployed and the journey I took before I was offered the opportunity to work for literally the best company I have ever had the privilege to work for. The information I am about to share is something that I see everyone can benefit from, regardless of their background. I feel that everyone can learn through my experience, and it would be selfish if I didn’t share this. Now please note, I am not the best writer in the world, but I will do my best to be as clear and informative as I can. Also, the information I am about to share, I believe is most applicable to those looking for their first or second, full-time or even part-time job(s). 

Background of Looking for a New Job:

Like many new graduates coming out of college, I had no idea really what I wanted to make a career out of. I graduated with a BA in economics and MBA, with an emphasis in Management. I am both a UCR and UCLA alumni. When it was time to look for my first full-time job, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were not many opportunities within finance (the industry I was most interested in), and therefore I had to apply to elsewhere.

My first full-time job was working for a small, international engineering and manufacturing company that specialized in skid mounted power generation and process systems for the Oil &amp; Gas industry. I applied to this company through my university’s career website and I accepted an entry level position with this company as a “Sales and Marketing Administrator.” Being “fresh out of college,” I was looking for an opportunity where I could gain new knowledge and skills that would contribute to my overall growth and development as a professional. This company seemed to be a great fit. 

However, long story short, I worked at this company for about two years. During my employment there, I was working 70 - 100 hour weeks while I was on salary (meaning I did not make any extra money for the extra hours I worked). Given my average hours worked per week and salary paid, I was able to calculate that I was making less than the minimum wage per hour (this is with a MBA degree). I was literally working every day on a low salary, even on weekends. I was working so much, the company ended up giving me my own personal key so I can access the offices anytime I needed to. I invested all my time and energy in this company, only to find out that there was no real future for me there. This was a small business, and I was able to realize that the owners of the company had their own agenda which was not beneficial to my future. I can go on and on about the many reasons why I had to leave, but that is not the point of this piece. The point of this, is to share my experience of finding my next job and the lessons I learned. 

The Beginning of my Job Search

Feeling pressured into getting a new job, I decided to create an updated resume, which I could use to apply to any job postings that I saw myself as a good fit. Even though my preference was to find a finance related job, I thought that the more jobs I apply to, the greater the probability of me getting an interview - my main goal was to just find a new company to work for. Therefore, towards the last three months of my employment at this engineering and manufacturing company, I decided to submit myself to all and any postings that I could on Monster.com, Indeed.com and LinkedIn. 

One week went by, two weeks, three weeks, 1 month, and I still had no interview opportunities. By the time one month passed, I probably had applied to over 500 job postings. I was appalled that someone with my background and experience couldn’t even get one single interview offer. It wasn’t until I saw one of my friends from my MBA program post up a link on Facebook to a job description that their company was currently hiring for. This was for a Financial Analyst Position at a multi-billion dollar company (will not name for confidentiality purposes). However, I reached out to my friend, submitted my resume, and got a phone interview within a week.

For the next two months, I went through 6 interviews. I met with HR managers, department managers, team members, and had multiple on-site visits where I learned about business operations and how my role would tie in. Interviews seemed to be going great and I even learned from my friend that the Interviewers were very impressed with my candidacy. After two months of interviewing, I finally got a call from HR to discuss compensation for the role. They knew what I was currently getting paid (at the engineering and manufacturing company) and they informed me that the position I was applying for had a salary cap just below my current pay. I told them that this was completely acceptable to me (since it was moving me into a finance role) and I would happily accept any offer as I was more excited to become part of the company. They were glad to hear that the compensation was acceptable and told me that their decision would be made within a couple of days. I felt very hopeful as they were saying extremely nice things and it sounded like they were putting together an official offer for me. 

At this time, I decided to start working on my resignation letter to my current employer. This was not a simple task, but the words were somehow easily transcribed from my brain to my paper. I had this letter ready and was just awaiting for the official job offer before submitting it to my supervisor. 

I remember that everyday that went by, felt like a week. It took three days (three of the longest days of my life), before I heard back. On this third day, the company I spent two months interviewing for, finally sent me an email which I was expecting to see an attachment of an offer letter. However, it was the complete opposite. Instead, they sent a four sentence, generic paragraph basically saying that they have decided to no longer consider my candidacy for this position, my resume will stay on file, blah, blah and blah. I would have included the full email in this posting so you can read what rejection feels like, but there was a disclaimer in it that prohibits me from sharing it. Regardless, I was in shock and instantly felt like I just wasted two months of my life interviewing for this position. 

During the next week, I fell into a state of depression. This was a completely new experience for me as I am typically an optimist and don’t let things like this affect me. However, this hit me, and it hit hard. I became very anti-social, quiet, and felt like breaking down because I put all my eggs in one basket, and it didn’t pan out for me. This was the first time that I experienced rejection on something that I thought would completely play out in my favor. Knowing that I didn’t have an offer and was still stuck being at my current employer was eating me up inside. At one point, I even broke down in front of my girlfriend, thinking that I would never be able to get a job elsewhere and that I was a complete failure. 

After a week, with the support of my girlfriend, I realized that there was no point sitting and dwelling    T&amp;D in recent weeks yearsin  . Like all other past failures in my life, I needed to learn from this experience and keep pushing forward. I knew that I needed a new strategy. Therefore, I decided to recollect my thoughts and start my job application process all over.

The Second Beginning of my Job Search

Unlike my first job, where I settled for a position because it was the best one I could get at the time, I decided to make this time around different. I decided that I was not going to settle. I did not want to risk working at another company where I would find myself in the same position two years down the line. Therefore, I set myself some strict guidelines for my new job application strategy. These included, but were not limited to:

New Employer must:
-Be in the finance industry/or the role has to be finance related
-Be a larger business (at least 500 M in revenue/year and making a profit for the past 5 years)
-Have a company culture that is innovative and appreciative
-Value autonomy and teamwork
-Be within commuting distance (&gt;50 Miles)
-Have good management
-Provide growth opportunities to its employees
-Have low turnover rate
-Have at least above a 3 star glassdoor rating or above

I admit, these may not the best guidelines in the world, but they were a start and specifically geared towards what I was looking for in my next employer. From my first full-time employer, I learned a lot of things that I did not want, but that list is too long and extensive to include. Therefore, I only focused on my must-haves. 

I can go into great details of how I came to develop my new strategy of getting an interview, but I think it is best to explain the “Roadmap” that I created through my extensive research, countless trial, and error. 

Tips to Getting an Interview:

Please keep in mind that the nine (9) tips below are something that I created as a guideline for my job application process. The combination of these nine (9) items allowed me to lock eight (8) different interviews within two (2) weeks with companies that fit my job search criteria. I believe if these tips are taken seriously and then anyone can be successful in also getting an interview with their potential dream job(s). 

1. Create your perfect job criteria

Take the time the time to create your ideal job. Put a list together of your “must haves” and think about both your short-term and long-term goals. For example, personally I wanted a career in Finance. Therefore, one of my must-haves was to stay focused within the finance industry or finance roles. I found that it would be easy to also consider other roles, but I stayed true to the type of positions I was looking for - all finance related (finance associate, financial analyst, etc.). By having my list, I was able to use that as a reference when reading job descriptions and deciding whether or not to take the time to apply to them. 

2. Have a great resume(s)

Make sure that your resume is job specific and not generic. I learned that making a resume that is customized to match a job posting has a much greater success rate than just making one resume to submit to all job postings. Therefore, don’t be lazy, and take the time to revamp your resume to better fit a job description. This includes incorporating keywords from the job description(s) and have them match those in your resume from past work experience, making sure your experience falls in line with the role you are applying for, and keeping it to a single page length.

3. Create a dedicated email address

This is important when applying because you will be getting a lot of emails throughout your job search. It is crucial to keep your job application emails separated from your personal ones, so I found it most useful to use a dedicated email address. Make sure this email is professional - easiest to use your name in some manner (tied with a number or middle initial). Your email should not be deemed as unprofessional as this may negatively affect the way companies perceive you. Remember, your image is everything when a company is considering you. You do not want to give them a reason to not consider you. 

4. Do your research

Read into the companies that you are applying for. Glassdoor.com is a great website to read employee reviews on the company and getting some insights to the company’s interview process. Don’t just apply to a random company as you may find yourself working for a company that you will not enjoy working for. Check out the actual website of the company you are applying to. Read the “About” sections and see if their mission, vision and company core values are something you can see yourself following on a daily basis. Keep true to your perfect job criteria and you will be fine. There are a lot of companies out there that fit my criteria, it was just taking the time to find them that was the hard part. 

5. Submit your resume:

Online Employment Websites - Use these sites to help find the available jobs out in the market. You can use these website to refine your job search to specific job titles and locations. These sites typically have the most recent job postings from companies is all industries. 

Indeed
Monster
CareerBuilder
SimplyHired
ZipRecruiter

Be careful when using these sites. You will see thousands of jobs on here. It is extremely easy to submit yourself to all the jobs, but remember, your time is limited and should be spent only on companies that fit your perfect job criteria. 

LinkedIn
LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network with 300 million members in over 200 countries is now posting jobs for hundreds of different companies. You will need a LinkedIn profile to access and apply (this is free - as long as you are not getting the premium accounts). This is also a great place to research people who are currently working for companies that you want to work for. You can look at their profiles (if they are public) and even see past companies that they have worked for. You can benefit from this insight and even consider those companies as possible companies to apply for (if they fit your company criteria). 

School Career Website
Every College and University should have their own career website. Make sure to take advantage of this if you are a current student. Companies will post internships, part-time and full-time jobs in the job portals of the school’s career site. If you have already graduated, then you can also pay a small alumni fee (if it’s not free) to use the site for a specified period of time. I was able to find three companies that fit my perfect job criteria and was able to get one interview out of it.

Staffing Agencies
I was speculative in using staffing agencies at first, but I was eventually able to realize the great potential of using this as another resource. The people working at these agencies have a wealth of knowledge, connections, and they will be able to provide you with other opportunities that may not even be posted on employment websites. For finance related jobs, I used the following staffing agencies:

Robert Half
Vincent Benjamin
KForce

The staffing agencies helped me to better understand the finance industry, fix my resume, practice for interviews, and find new companies that fit my perfect job criteria that I was unaware of. I was able to get two interviews from using staffing agencies. 

Friends
Don’t be too shy or ashamed to reach out to friends for help. Remember, this is your future and your life. If you know of friends that are working at great companies or have connections to other companies (that you are interested in), take initiative, and reach out to them. You never know what opportunities there may be unless you try. I was able to get two interviews through friends. I can proudly say that my current (new) employment was through a friend. 

Network
In my previous job, I was able to network with hundreds of people. I have established connections with CEOs and other top executives. Through this network, I was able to add them to my LinkedIn. I found it was extremely useful to use my LinkedIn network to reach out to my connections when applying to jobs. I was able to get connected directly with some hiring managers through my contacts on LinkedIn. My network itself contributed to getting three interviews at three well established companies (fitting my perfect job criteria).

Creative Approach(es)
When applying online, sometimes it is extremely difficult to standout. The creative approach was born out of desperate measures and happened to work out in my favor.

Go to the company in-person - In times of desperation, sometimes you are forced to do something outside of the norm. When I was in a Financial Hub (Irvine) visiting a staffing agency, I realized I was in the middle of multiple companies that fit my perfect job criteria. I recognized a company in the area that I applied for a finance position and decided to take a short walk over to their building. Since I was already dressed up (from my meeting), I walked up to the front desk and asked if I could meet with a Human Resources Manager. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful (the company had a strict visiting policy where you could not meet with anyone if you didn’t know their name). So I ended up standing outside and just waited for employees to walk out of the building. I was able to speak with five people and one of them was in the purchasing department of the company. She kindly provided me with her email address and I emailed her later that day with my resume. To my surprise, she responded back same-day and even connected me directly with the Finance Manager of the company. I scheduled an interview with them that same week.

Call them - Sometimes applying to the job is not enough. Companies get thousands of resumes everyday. Sometimes, you will need to do something that will help you stand out, like calling them first instead of waiting for them to call you. If the company you are applying for isn’t too large, then typically you can find the person you need to speak to by speaking with the receptionist. I learned this trick when I was working sales and was trying to get a hold of Purchasing Managers. If you are able to find the name of the department manager for the position you are applying for (through LinkedIn or other medias), then the receptionist of the company will typically connect you directly with them. Some sites even put their contact information on their company site. Don’t be scared to call them. I used this strategy on five companies and was able to get interviews with three of them. 

6.  Set a goal for yourself

Submit to at least 3-5 qualified jobs/day (or more!). Be diligent about this. Applying for jobs is not easy. It is very repetitive, boring, and even discouraging at times. However, do not give up. Dedicate the time you need (roughly an hour a day), and take the time to apply. You never know which application is going to pay off, but the more qualified companies you apply for, the better your chances. Also, I remember at one point I felt like I applied to all the jobs that fit my criteria. Don’t stop there. I can guarantee you that there are always jobs you are unaware of, so stay diligent and take the time to find them. 

7. Job Apps for Mobile Devices

instead of playing games, being on facebook or instagram while you are on the toilet at work, make it a habit to constantly check for new jobs that are being posted. If you’re are work, screenshot these jobs on your phone (if you are unable to apply) so you can apply for them later. (See below example). 
		
		Some of the job apps I used are:

Indeed job search
Monster.com
Glassdoor
Simply Hired
LinkedIn
Careerbuilder
Ziprecruiter

8. Career Fairs

School Career(s) Fairs - Go to your school's career fairs for your specific industry. Take advantage of these career fairs which your school puts together for you. Even if you have graduated, you can still attend as an Alumni. Make sure to print plenty of resumes (as you will need to hand them out to recruiters) and get the business cards of every company representative that you speak with. Make sure to prepare good questions to ask and think of something that will make you stand out so the recruiters can remember you. In addition, follow up with the recruiters that were kind enough to give you their business card.

Job Fairs - Cities tend to host a lot of job fairs too. I did look into these, but never actually went to them. I am posting this in my list because I would have gone if I didn’t already have interviews already. Check with your city to see what job fairs are coming up.

9. Things to Remember:

Its not instant-it will take time. Patience is key.

Do not get discouraged nor give up. Do everything you can to stay positive and use any negative energy as your fuel source to find a new job. Anytime I got discouraged, I would just get on the computer and start applying to more qualified jobs. As long as I knew I was doing everything within my power to get a new job, then I had nothing to feel discouraged about. 

Dress to impress - professionally.No matter how interviews you get, make sure to take the time to prep yourself. First impressions are everything! 

Show you have the ability to learn and demonstrate that in your resume and interview. You may come across job descriptions where you may not have some of the skills that they are looking for. If there are only a couple of these, then don’t let that discourage you from applying. Demonstrate in your resume how you had to learn a new skillset and were able to apply it quickly. If you are asked for an interview, then elaborate on that experience to show that you can learn the necessary skills required for your new job.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket - Even if you get an interview, keep applying to other companies. It is always better to have multiple offers. You can even use this for negotiation purposes later.

Don’t Settle - Know your worth. I am saying this because I personally know there are companies that will try to take advantage by squeezing an employee’s compensation to below industry average. Therefore, know what you should be getting paid for in the positions you are applying for (factoring in your experience level).



So for those interested in how these tips worked for me. Another long story short, I ended up leaving my employer at the engineering and manufacturing company once I created these nine (9) tips and invested all my time into applying these tips to my job application process. I made this risky decision, because I truly believed in what I created. This decision was the best decision I ever made as I am now working for one of the best companies in my industry. However, do what you feel is best for you. I personally know I had to take my life in my own hands and I believed in myself, so I took the risky route (I am not recommending anyone do the same, especially those supporting a family). 

That said, I can proudly say that this roadmap worked for me. I am sharing my story and my tips so those who are currently looking for a job, may hopefully benefit from them by securing new employment. Looking for a job is not fun - it actually sucks. It is time consuming, stressful, and rejection becomes a very familiar feeling. Diligence, patience, and determination are the qualities that will make someone successful when following this roadmap. If my story and tips help you with your journey to find a new job, please share your story or comment. If you find other helpful tips in your job journey, feel free to share those as well.

I wish those looking for a new job best of luck and I hope you can use this to help find your perfect job!

* I had difficulty understanding both of the people who interviewed me(Parsing heavily accented English is tough; both my parents have heavily accented English but even still..). 
* I've heard stories of firms underpaying their H1B people(I was told that the majority of them are ""consultants"", not even full time employees) and in general firms doing so don't really value the whole engineering side of things. 
* I'm a US citizen and this is only an internship so pay is less of an issue, but I really worry about how this huge h1b demographic reflects on how little the firm values great software engineering.
* This was at a tech center office of a Fortune 500 company and their main product/revenue stream isn't from software.

Are these valid concerns?

Thanks."
5cj8nt,2,2016-11-12,Medical Bills I Can't Pay as a Student?,sadpuppydogs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5cj8nt/medical_bills_i_cant_pay_as_a_student/,"My family is unable to afford the kind of insurance the ACA provides. So I've been uninsured, and, earlier this year, had to go to the ER for an appendectomy. I know, I know, you guys will be saying, ""Your fault for not having insurance""...but I really thought I could get through on staying healthy until I graduated and got insurance through a job. :(

Now I am expecting to have around $30,000 in medical debt (bill has not arrived yet but Google says laproscopic appendectomies cost around that much), and no way to pay it back. I really have nothing at this point, and I feel so guilty about having this burden over my family, who's already struggling.

I've been looking into solutions, and found one, Chapter 7 bankruptcy. As a third year college student, I have nothing to my name. I absolutely do not want my family to be harmed by me getting sick...that's on me and me alone. If I filed for Chapter 7, though, my family's belongings and house are safe though, correct? Neither the car nor the house is in my name, after all. The only issue is that my parents cosigned my name onto the family savings account...I will be so sad if I make them all penniless with this. :(

What makes this feel even worse for me is that I am studying to be an engineer, and I graduate in just a year, with a decent job already lined up for me. My parents put all their money into a degree for me, and I thought I was so close to helping my family out of poverty.

What can I do? If I file Chapter 7 (I pass the means test since I've only really had an internship this summer and no other job), I really don't care that my credit goes into the toilet, I would just graduate, get that job, and give it all back to my family...

I had a couple of software engineering internships and kind of realized from those experiences that my interests are more geared towards academia. I have a good GPA (3.9 overall) from a no-name state school, but I'm worried since I didn't complete any research during undergrad. I attempted to do some research with a professor during one summer, but life happened and I had to stop. Will it be difficult for me to get into a decent school without any research experience and only industry experience?

 Not sure if this helps or is even relevant, but I did receive some significant academic awards during undergrad. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation I would be extremely grateful to get your opinion on the matter. I guess I'm just trying to see if you all think I should even bother applying to decent CS programs in my situation or if it would just be a waste of my money (for application fees) and time."
5cjame,1,2016-11-12,Please Give Me Advice On Career Path,bahamet7,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/5cjame/please_give_me_advice_on_career_path/,"Hi /r/chemistry,


Long time lurker and I've posted here in the past when I was about to graduate with my B.Sc (in 2014) because I wasn't sure what to do. This might be a long and detailed post but I hope you can read through it (will include a TL;DR) and give me your opinions since most of you have more life/work experience than I do.


I graduated in 2014 with a not so stellar GPA of 2.74/4.33 (and no internship experience). This led to finding work being extremely hard and I was eventually able to find a job 1 year later at a company being a lab assistant (which actually involved no lab). After working for 5-6 months I've moved up to a lab technician position (dealing with food testing). I've been at this position for about 5 months as well and am undergoing training from analysts within the company to learn instrument work (LCMSMS mainly) when we are able to spare time. I am always looking to learn and grow and do more within my position so I can be ready for any available opportunities. I am currently starting with maintenance on the instrument for now but will hopefully learn how to do calculations/reports and hopefully move up to analyst if/when the position opens up. 


Surprisingly, one year of work/research within my company (from lab tech to department manager) has taught me that most people in my company only have a B.Sc (or less even for some). I currently make $32,000 CAD before taxes and I don't think my prospects will improve much even if I keep staying in this field. I know it would increase if I were to be promoted to analyst but not by much (I would say ~$38,000 CAD). Living in one of the world's most expensive cities (Vancouver) of course doesn't really help.


I have been thinking about what I need to do about my future for a while now which is why I wanted your help and advice. I do not want to be making this kind of salary for the rest of my life. I also don't find the work exciting and or stimulating enough to do for long. Is there something I am not seeing (other career paths that a entry level chemistry graduate can take)? Should I be pursuing higher education for a better future (I've always thought of going back to grad school once I hit a wall in my career)? Currently I am 27 and work is very boring, providing zero stimulation once I learn the task at hand. Going to grad school would be a long term investment for which I would need to prepare financially. 


I've always been good at organic chemistry/analytical chemistry (interested in medicinal chemistry) and have done well in those courses. I know my GPA is very poor, and with no research experience it would be hard to get into grad school. What are some things you can recommend for someone like me? Can someone like me even get into grad school? Should I be looking into a different career paths (related to chemistry hopefully)? I want to decide on something sooner than later with the help of people who are working in the industry as I feel I am already behind some of the younger graduates. 


Last time I posted I wasn't able to get very much help (and just tons of criticism really which was fine, I deserve my predicament of bad grades) which is why I hope this time might be a little different. If you were in a similar situation your experiences would be great in helping me make a decision. Any words of encouragement would also help as I feel like my career path currently looks to be very short and not very rewarding.


I thank you for reading through this post (or the TL;DR even) and sparing some time to share your experiences. I hope to hear from you!


Now, TL;DR like I promised: Graduated with 2.74/4.33 GPA (no research experience), worked for 1 year but prospects of B.Sc. does not look very good in my current career path of lab assistant -&gt; lab tech -&gt; hopefully analyst -&gt; ?. Should I consider grad school (if so, what can I do to make myself be considered at all), or are there other avenues (related to chemistry) I can look into. Thank you for reading again and hope to hear from you.

But above everything i loved music , i have been a musician for 8 years now and i attribute this cringe worthy time in my life to sparking that love. Well with this love came the love of seeing live shows , i would go to concerts whenever i could with whoever would go with me. 


It was an october night when i went into the city of Philadelphia , with my friend who we will call Sarah. We arrived around 5 pm when the street was still active and many people walked up and down the streets moving from one way to another. This being a safe time for two 15 year old kids to be alone in a possibly dangerous city. We arrived at the show , went and had a great time nothing really important to note just pure fun.


After the final note had been played it was around 11 pm , we left the venue and entered the now darker , colder city streets. To give some perspective we had seen a show at the Barbary , which if anyone knows this place would know it is not in the best part of town. Instead of being smart and heading with the crowd towards the train station home. Me a Skinny 15 year old boy and Sarah a even smaller 15 year old girl decided it would be a good idea to go out and try to find some food in the city. 


After walking around for what seemed like forever we ended up at a small run down pizza shop. We both ordered our food and sat down to eat, talking about Sarah's recent break up and how she would never love again (teen stuff). After we finally moved to a brighter topic and things lightened up a bit Sarah was in the middle of telling some corny joke when she stopped. 


Her eyes seemed in a way to go from me to some where behind me and her smile changed to a expression of worry. Noticing this i asked her what was wrong, this seemed to break her from the trans she was stuck in. ""This guy a few tables down"" her voice trailed off for a moment and just as i was about to press her to continue she spoke again this time with a more upset tone. ""He is masturbating under the table , and staring at me"". For a short moment i thought she was making some stupid joke , but seeing once again the fear in her eyes showed me she was serious.


""let's go , now"" I said wanting to get Sarah as far from this guy as possible. we quickly threw out our trash and left , we walked fast down the now dark and empty city streets. After a block or so and no sign that the man had tried to follow us , we relaxed a little falling back into our normal conversation and the situation was quickly forgotten. 


We had been talking about Some high school drama , when Sarah saw him. He had to be two blocks up , and if the streets had not been so empty she probably would never have taken notice. "" Thats him"" she said the fear welling up in her throat again . It took me a second to realize the situation we now faced. There stood the man much taller and larger then i had thought him to be back in the poorly illuminated pizza shop , hitting his head against the wall not hard enough to hurt but enough to the point where it was noticeable. 


We stopped dead and just stared at him both of us trying to make sense of what we were seeing. This is when i could hear him , He was Muttering Something unintelligible With the occasional louder yell of some curses. ""look i know this is freaky but it's going to be ok, we can just go around the other side of the block and pass him"" I said Trying to restore some normality to the otherwise disturbing situation.


Sarah was still Noticeably scared but was some what calmed by my sudden yet obvious realization. With this we continued our walk towards the train station which would take us to safety. At this point i was fighting the facts in my head and trying to stay calm. You see the response time For police in this part of Philadelphia at this time at night was 30 minutes at best , which meant if we actually were in any danger we were on our own. 


We reached the end of the first block and it was at this point we could begin to hear the man again.
Now much more clear We could make out more of what he was saying. He was talking to himself in an angry tone seemingly pissed about messing something up. ""i should have done it "" he kept repeating , At this point we were beyond freaked out and just wanted to get home and remain unseen. We Grew closer now only a few feet from him but on the opposite end of the block when the man grew violent, hitting his head harder and yelling louder ""I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT"" over and over again.


Sarah who now had tears welling in her eyes , let out the faintest scared yelp , and the man stopped cold and grew instantly silent. We heard him turn the laugh ever so slightly and start running away, thinking quick i realized he wasn't running from us but instead to the top of the block so he could cut us off. I  grabbed Sarah by the wrist hard and pulled her behind me as fast as i could to the other side of the block and up the street. This is when we heard him yell "" I won't hurt you if you let me fuck her"", i shoved my other hand over Sarah's mouth so the man couldn't hear her sobbing. Thank god the man turned the corner onto the other side of the block this gave us just enough time to rush by


when the man realized we passed him he became more angry and started searching frantically for us , being city streets there was not many good places to hide , i was not trying to stray from our path because getting lost around here with this guy was not an option. So many things went through my head as we ran, who was this guy, how did he follow us , and better yet how did he manage to get ahead of us. 


We ran until we reached the train station , it was empty , once we caught our breath i checked the train schedule , by now the time was 12:05 and the next train out wasn't for 30 minutes. This gave us no comfort for this guy found us before and now if he found us we would have no were to hide. Sarah and i stayed silent hiding out of view as best as we could , i held her in my arms trying to calm her down. We sat alone on the flat foor , The silence turned every slight noise into the monster of a man we now hid from. Just as the train finally came into sight there he was walking down the stairs to our platform. We stayed hidden as we saw him get on the train once we knew he was on , we ran on a few train cars down and sat sightly , we had 4 stops.


Each one gave us time to freak our selves out even more wondering if he saw us and if we would be followed off the train. at this time as soon as i could get connection i called my dad telling him he needed to get to the station as soon as he could and explained our situation. My Father being a good man understood and intern may have saved us. The trained pulled into the station and we booked it off and down the stairs to the bottom floor this is when we heard the man again now chasing us down the stairs growing closer every moment. We just made is out the doors without being had by the man . when he saw my dads car he ran the other way. We never filed any reports because there was nothing the police could actually do for us . So To the crazy rapist that attacked me and my friend lets not meet again ok?

How terrible am I?,Bitchesluvcake,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ck6dr/i_22f_forgot_my_friends_birthday_f22_how_terrible/,"We have been friends since high school. She lives in another city about 4.5 hours from the city I live in. We definitely aren't as close as we used to be since she has been really mean to me recently. She gets really jealous and competitive with me about school/our future and then belittles my accomplishes. For example, I got a super prestigious paid medical internship for a year after I graduate before starting grad school, when I told her about it she said ""you're lucky to have your dad to get you these types of things""....my dad lives 8 hours away and doesn't know a single person in my city, I have worked my ass off with school and my research all by myself, etc. But I've digressed. I just started texting her again after NC for 2 months. We text maybe twice a week, real superficial stuff. 

Friday was her birthday and I forgot. Yeah it's a shitty thing and I feel bad about it. I only realized it this morning (Saturday) when I saw she made a snap chat. She doesn't have Facebook or anything like that so there were no reminders. And she never mentioned it earlier in the week when we were texting or anything. But still, I forgot and that must be a bad feeling.

I know she is going to ream me a new one. Last year, one of her friends did not remember to wish her a happy birthday. She kind of made it like a ""test"". She told me how she wasn't going to mention her birthday at all or anything like that so her friend would only know it was her birthday if she really remembered (wtf?). So I have a feeling this is what occurred with me too. 

Regardless, what do I do?

Tldr; forgot my friends birthday.

5ckf5b,18,2016-11-12,[20 F] Been having sex with my boyfriend [21's] after his anxiety attacks and I don't know if I'm supposed to do that,reallylindsay,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5ckf5b/20_f_been_having_sex_with_my_boyfriend_21s_after/,"We've been dating 6 months. He was diagnosed with general anxiety about 2 months into our relationship but never spoke on it I just knew he was going to a therapist because he didn't want medicine

Halloween weekend he didn't want to come out which was weird, so I go to his apt and he's curled up, clutching his chest,  in near tears and breathing like he's dying. He tells me he's just "" freaking out"" 

I put my arms around him and comforted him anyway I could and then he told me how bad he actually has it, and how he's been hiding these panic attacks from me, leading him to freak out more because it had been leading to arguments/us not hanging out as much and also told me about everything that had been setting his anxiety off recently.

It was really emotional, we were both crying and it led to sex. We agreed that anytime he has a bad panic attack he's going to tell me so I can try to help or we can go to our safe zone. (Aka just a private room, where I can hold him/talk him until he calms down) 

His anxiety has been really bad recently due some family issues and school picking up/applying for internships and so he's been having more, and we've been going to our safe Zone a lot, except it usually leads to sex.

It's not intentional and we do have sex a lot even when he's fine, but we're both emotional, and ( I hope I don't sound psycho) even though I HATE to see my boyfriend in such turmoil it does make me feel good that I'm his rock. For the longest time I had no idea why'd he stop talking for hours, or read into the tiniest thing and I do now and (once again I hope I don't sound psycho) and it kind of turns me on that he's been so open with me about it and now really really trust me. 

Like he's been SO open with me after these attacks. He told me he didn't tell me how bad it was because he didn't think I would ""believe him"" because he doesn't seem someone that would have it because he's outgoing

I don't want this safe zone to turn into a sex zone, and it's not like we go to a room, hookup and everything's fine, it's usually like I'll hold him for 30 minutes and then we'll talk for sometimes up to an hour and it just happens.

I don't think it's been hurting him, he's still going to therapy, and actually invited me to wait in the lobby while he was there (he never did before he always ubered even when I offered to drive) and told me what they talked about afterwards and he's been ok generally speaking

Am I handling this right? I don't want to be counter productive to his therapy, or make him become too dependent on these, but I feel like it's so much better than him dealing with on his own, or smoking absurd amounts of weed to deal with it

Any pointers? Major No-Nos? How do I make sure I'm not setting it off, like I know my boyfriend does like to be independent and make sure I'm ok too, is there a balance? 

I don't know if he feels weird about this safe zone thing but I know it does calm him down and he seems happy after it which is better than him being stoned and still anxious "
5ckneh,92,2016-11-12,Who funds the anti-zwarte piet protesters? the EU?,InKekWeTrust,The_Wilders,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Wilders/comments/5ckneh/who_funds_the_antizwarte_piet_protesters_the_eu/,"So after hearing that 4 buses full of anti-zwarte piet protesters were (thank god) stopped before they reached Meppel, I started wondering who the hell pays for all that nonsense.

So I did a little digging, and found out that the orginization 'KickOutZwartePiet' (KOZP) or 'Stop Blackface' as they call their site was behind it. I searched their site for a while, looking for their sponsors, but they strangely didn't have any references to sponsors whatsoever. 

Their website:http://stopblackface.com/kozp/

But I did find another orginisation that is closely tied to them: ZwartePietNiet (ZPN), which did display all their sponsors. They appear to be backed by ALOT of different orginisations, I have so far only looked into their very first mentioned sponsor: New Urban Collective, mainly because of their eary name. 

ZPN website:http://www.zwartepietniet.nl/

The New Urban Collective website:http://nucnet.nl/sponsoren

The new urban collective again has 4 strange sponsors: 
1.The city of Amsterdam. (Strange that tax-money trickels down to the very orginisations that the police needs to deal with on a regular basis
2.KPMG: Some sort of international accountancy agency.
3.ABN Ambro: Bank
4.Youth in action: by far the most suspicious sponsor. They are a sub-branch of the EU's 15 billion euro funded Erasmus+ orginisation, which is supposed to subsidise internships and exchange projects.

Youth in action website:http://ec.europa.eu/youth/tools/youth-in-action_en.htm

Erasmus+ website:http://www.erasmusplus.nl

Why is a EU funded educational orginisation leaking a part it's budget to violent protestors like this? Are we basically indirectly funding these guys with our EU contributions? Is the EU purposely trying to instigate these protests by funding them?

It's a pretty nice gig, good pay, and REALLY flexible hours. I mostly do RDC unlocking accounts, some server things nothing major, testing various equipment like receipt printers and USB scanners etc, shipping packages to various stores, handle calls from the stores about their tech issues and troubleshoot various problems around the office. Currently at this company there are only 5 IT people total handling the Corporate Office and the around 150 stores we have. Two months ago one of the full time members that did the same stuff as me left for another job, and since then I've really stepped up to the duty and pulled my own weight.

I have probably another year or year and a half of my B.S in Computer Information Technology, and hopefully after I graduate I could get a full time position there, or find something else.

Sorry for this slight rant, but now onto my actual question. Where do I go from here? This is mostly a desktop support job, and I like Network and System Administration quite alot actually, but I feel if I applied for a Network Admin job, I feel like i would be under qualified for most of them. So how would I go about going from a Desktop support job to a Network Admin job? Or would there have to be an in between job before I could get to a Network Admin position?

How to proceed?,Ashkir,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5cm0ee/us_kaiser_health_insurnace_with_mfa_refusing/,"Hello all! I had some extremely severe chest pain and the nurse line at Kaiser told me to go to the local Emergency Room which is about 3 minute drive from me. But, the Kaiser ""affiliated"" hospital because they don't build hospitals where I live, but, sell insurance in this city. It's through my employer. I was planning on going to the ""affiliated"" hospital because of the cost, but, the nurse told me to not worry because emergency services are covered.

Well, I got a bill from the Emergency Room for $516.52 from a Dignity Health hospital (insurance paid $7,144.20), I got another bill from the ER doctor that made huge incorrect decisions (like telling me my INR is high, I had to argue with him to tell him it's fine, because I have medication that makes it high purposely). The bill from the physician was about $197, insurance covered about $500 of it. 

Now, I got transferred to another hospital because Kaiser requested I get transferred to their ""affiliate"" hospital. I haven't gotten a bill from the ambulance ride yet. I asked if I can just go over there myself and they told me no. The other hospital gave me a bill for $900 to see a Cardiologist from outside their network. I never once asked for that cardiologist at all. The hospitalist chose the cardiologist because he is the only person in the city that had any exposure to genetic cardiac problems.

They then transferred me to Kaiser Los Angeles and gave me a $4700 bill for that place. Plus, I had to sit in a critical care ambulance, for 4 hours, with a registered nurse with me the entire time. The cardiologist sent me to Los Angeles to see a genetic cardiologist specialist, because my problem is ""above his pay grade"".  Haven't gotten the bill for that ambulance ride yet either. Neither of the ambulance rides were in the $4700 itemized bill (insurance paid about $21k). 

I never got to see the genetic cardiologist, because Kaiser assigned a different cardiologist to my case and a bunch of cardiology interns. It pissed off the doctor back at the previous hospital because that was the whole point for sending me to Los Angeles.

When I got home again after about a week in the hospital, I got assigned to a cardiologist because Kaiser suddenly found room inside their network. The first words from this guy to me are ""It's gods plan that your heart is failing"" practically and he kept spouting out overly religious stuff how god planned for me to have a failing heart which offended me greatly. 

I talked to Kaiser, they waived the $4700 bill because I've been on their MFA.

Kaiser is refusing to pay the $516, the $900, and the $197 bill so far. The entire reason why ""These aren't covered by your insurance as they're outside of Kaiser."" But, Kaiser stated that I get full emergency coverage. When I log onto the Kaiser's website my plan status looks a ton different and a lot of my old ""bills"" disappeared from the website.

Does anyone have any advice what do I do? I make barely above minimum wage and I cannot afford this. This is going to make me homeless practically. 

Kaiser's response as of late is, basically ""you should've just died, it's cheaper"". I realy like 99% of the staff at Kaiser, but that Cardiologist bothered me a lot, and now they are sticking me with bills from their own advice. "

5cnk6k,1,2016-11-12,Research Associate?,oakles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cnk6k/research_associate/,"Hi,

I'm a senior about to graduate with a degree in computer science in May 2017. I've been working hard on my job search and have been fortunate enough to receive a few exciting offers. One of which is to be a research associate at a very prestigious university in the US. It's a 2 year program and sounds like something that I'd be very interested in doing (big data, data analytics, visualization, etc.). The majority of my internship experience has been doing similar things so this is a job that I know I'd be comfortable with and most likely enjoy.

I still have a final, on-site interview with Bloomberg in a couple weeks and I anticipate accepting that offer if I am to receive it. If not, I really am seriously considering this research associate position.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of position? I know it won't pay as well as something like Bloomberg but is it sometimes ok to sacrifice pay for a more enjoyable/comfortable job? Will taking this position now hurt my chances of receiving an in-industry position down the line?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I have posted here before, and I need further clarification. I am considering the MSI B150m Bazooka Plus motherboard for the m.2 SSD capability, but do not want to waste money on a core i3 rx470 build. I will upgrade to a better machine in 2-3 years, so I think a functionable mobo is good enough for me. What I am worried about is the case I have picked out has 3 fans, but the mobo only has one CPU fan header and one case fan header. I live in an area where the summers do get hot, so I do not want to overheat my system. I am wondering if I can connect the fans straight to the PSU, where there will be no issue. If not, then I would need a mobo with at least 2 fan header, where I can get a fan splitter. My only concern is that will intern fry my motherboard. Thanks in advance."
5coja6,2,2016-11-13,How do employers view an academic internship compared to a corporate/non-academic one?,Venerous,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5coja6/how_do_employers_view_an_academic_internship/,"I'm a CS junior, and I received an e-mail yesterday letting me know that I had been accepted as an intern for a non-profit tech clinic sponsored by my school. The organization basically partners with other non-profits throughout our county and works to expand their technology outreach - apps, websites, software, things like that. It isn't a paid internship, but it does allow me to continue attending school during my internship, and the hours required per week isn't too demanding. I'll also be able to earn credit towards graduation, and I'll still have access to the mentor aspect of it as well.

Regardless of the answer I'll still be taking the internship offer - I have no reason not to, and my next semester is looking fairly light compared to my previous ones. I just wondered what employers thought of academic internships through universities instead of those based in the private sector. Are they of 'less' value than a standard internship through a company?"
5cp1hn,1,2016-11-13,I think I am stressed out...,throwaway_9722,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5cp1hn/i_think_i_am_stressed_out/,"Lately i've been so irritable and i just dont want to deal with anyone or anything. i just want to sleep and be left alone. i cant stand it. i just have so much going through my mind, but i feel like im just overthinking. I need to stop worrying but i cant help it. I just want to be left alone.

Im so tired of hearing about other people's problems and have them act like i dont matter. im tired of being unnoticed. I hate that i am surrounded by people that seek attention. Anytime I try to feel good about myself, they always outshine me and the worst part is that its always the people closest to me. 

If i go out with my friends, or my sister, they're the ones always getting hit on. Once in a while, its me. And it usually ends up being some creeper who wont leave me alone. Lately, i've actually had a few cute guys actually trying to talk to me, but then the attention always gets redirected to someone else. If im with friends, its usually them. they're louder, and more talkative than i am. its like why even bother. im so tired of hearing the ""youre an amazing girl. you're pretty, smart, funny, any guy would be lucky to have you."" from my friends, guys and girls. i dont buy it. im already 24, and i still have never dated. yes i may be extremely shy at first but it goes away. not alot of guys actually wait around for that to happen. most move on to the easier ones.

And its just not that area in my life that sucks. i dont even feel like im that smart. i feel so stupid in my classes. i feel like im not cut out for my career after all. i feel like a failure. i started taking the classes for my major. im more than halfway done with my bachelor's degree in engineering. and I feel like such a failure. I feel like im failing. i've talked to my professors and im passing. but i know i could do so much better. im just afraid for my gpa. im not doing so well. ive applied for internships and i cant get a single one. they want extracurricular activities and all kinds of things. but unfortunately i have to work. i only have time to do research in the labs. which to me is amazing. but its not enough for them apparently. i just cant afford to be unemployed. 

and im tired of work too. my work ethic has gotten worst. i went from being the number one sales person in my department to one of the worst. i dont know what is happening. 

everything is just so overwhelming right now i just want to quit everything. i know ive made alot of progress already and i'd give up alot of i quit. but its so much. what if i fail. what if im not good enough. its all too much..

and i think i am finally stressed out. i've never been stressed out but i think this is it. its weird. "
5cp7xc,5,2016-11-13,"weird feeling of being unloved, suicidal thoughts... need help [Relationship/Life advice]",stonerninja93,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/5cp7xc/weird_feeling_of_being_unloved_suicidal_thoughts/,"This is probably going to be a long post. I'll talk about the events leading up to this and then talk about what I'm going through right now.   

I'm more or less a typical INTJ. I've grown up in an environment with a lot of alone time. Looking back, more alone time than what a child should get. But it never bothered me much then. I always had my interests and things to learn... I kept busy, kept learning.   

Relationships were never my thing in high school. I always thought when I start earning or when I'm mature enough to take care of another person, that's when I'll get into a relationship. I didn't understand casual relationships and didn't care much for it either.   


Fast forward to architecture school. Still lots of things going on to keep me busy. In my 2nd year, I went on a few trips with my classmates and this particular girl and I would end up travelling together for most of these trips. I became great friends with this girl who was just an unintersting acquaintance all through the first year (ESFJ I think. I'm not too sure. didn't know about MBTI back then). In my 3rd year, I ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend. She said we should give it a shot but she was never invested in it. Things never really got physical because I'm oblivious to any hints she might have given me, and I thought she wanted to take it slow. Four months later, she breaks up with me because she says she doesn't think it's working but says we should be friends. She gives me the thing about - It's not you, it's me. You deserve better. And also advises me that I should be more physical in my affection (which pisses me off).    

A couple of weeks later she's in a live-in relationship with another person from college (who she'd meet now and then even when we were dating, and like an idiot I thought, they're just good friends). I don't talk to her for a couple of weeks. Go into a major downward spiral because I still liked her when it was time for us to break up. I bounce back and try to be friends with her, because hey at least this can be salvaged. But I don't get the same level of reciprocity (at this point I think she said she wants to remain friends is code for - ""I don't want to hurt you more, I'll talk to you now and then, but we aren't really friends"") so I do the INTJ doorslam and haven't spoken to her since then.   

   
So coming to recent events.
I have a 6 month internship in my 5th year. Towards the end of my 2nd month, this girl joins the firm. She looks average and you can tell she is introverted. But over the next month she fits right into the office, and even with the group of people who'd go out for drinks after office. On one such occasion when I did decide to go for drinks, she's there. I just happen to be sitting next to her at the bar and out of courtsey I say Hi!. We have an amazing 2 hour conversation after that. Suddenly I find out that this uninteresting new girl is actually this amazing person who has a lot in common with me... even some of our interests are similar. We get to talking and hanging out after office more often (turns out she's an INFP). Mostly becasue we don't know many people in this new city. We've become great friends over the next couple of months (see a pattern?).   


So one eventful long weekend later, I find out she is sleeping with someone from the office. I get irritated, disgusted, angry, sick and depressed all at the same time. I don't understand what's happening with me and stop talking to her (by this time we'd text/call each other atleast twice a day, even if it was a holiday)
Logically, I should have been least bothered but this just fucking broke me. It was killing me inside. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't go to work the next day. She came down to my place and said she's sorry her actions hurt me. I realize I'm just overreacting and I apologize for acting immaturely. I tell her that I want the best for her. I also tell her that this person she is seeing is not really a nice person. He's a womanizer and he couldn't be least bothered about her as long as his physical needs were fulfilled. (which is all true BTW) I tell her how she deserves someone much better. But every other night I feel these negative thoughts creep over. I shove them aside.    



Another month and a half goes by. We're basically BFFs by now. I feel this warmth whenever I think of her. Smile like an idiot when I see her photos. Find myself staring at her for unnatural amounts of time. I find myself wanting to sketch her when I sit down to sketch at night. But I keep telling myself, she isn't interested in me/we're in this city for just a one more month/something between us could never work out. Then one morning I see her and her FWB (?) (I don't know what to call him) come to work together (they live in the opposite sides of town). So I put 2 and 2 together, and those same fucking angry, disgusted, sick feelings are back. I feel so fed up with my life that I want to end it. I stop talking to her again and this time when she confronts me, I tell her I have feelings for her, I'm in love with her and I don't understand what she is doing.   

She opens up to me and tells me she never wanted to spoil our beautiful friendship by complicating things... She's in this casual relationship with this other guy because she kind of likes the guy but more importantly because she feels lonely, and when she's spending the night with him, she doesn't feel lonely. It's as simple as that.   
This opened up something in my brain and suddenly made me aware of how lonely I have been. How I find myself at a stage where I just want to share my life with someone. How I just want to love and be loved. How just holding someone's hand and cuddling with someone at night, knowing I'm not alone would actually make me feel sane. When I told her about this, she consoled me and tried to make me feel better by giving me some practical advice. But then again, I love her and she can never be with me. This makes me feel even more unloved. These last few days have been the hard. I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate on anything. I listen to music so loud, I think I'm starting lose some of my hearing. I don't feel like eating. I keep wanting to smoke and drink. I'll see a speeding truck and want to jump in front of it. I go out for long walks in the middle of night till I'm exhausted so I can sleep. I wake up to repeat the same.

I know I'll get over it, with time. But right now is hard. I want to achieve great things. I want the absolute best for the people I love. I just need some help to get over this phase.

Edit: I'm a 23 year old in India. If that provides some perspective."

For the last six months or so, I've practiced for about 50 hours/week and got a firm grasp on Java 8 syntax and (mostly) built-in classes. I've also quit my day job and got in line for a few internships, with no result.

Being a CS undergrad, at the beginning of this learning journey of mine a took my time with understanding CS concepts through C language syntax. By the time I was done with it, I had a solid base to better understand OOP and Java courses I've decided upon. Being how I've now completed core courses that cover the basics and beyond, I took interest in OO patterns, Spring MVC in particular. I've encountered some patterns before; *Design Patterns* book had helped a lot. I'm still learning from examples and at a steady pace, altough I think I'm a few months behind from tackling advanced Java/Spring assignments.

Ultimate goal of mine is to get certified with Oracle. In order to do so, I need to put my current skills to good use and earn enough experience and money. I'm willing to take my time with certification, but I need your help at this point. I'm not sure how to best pursue my career in the industry; simply, I don't know where to start and what to look for. I would like to have a good-enough portfolio and at least a couple of certificates under my belt before applying for a software development position in a company. Is there a solid way to handle some intermediate Java tasks, better my skills and earn enough to take certification exams?

- - - - 

Pinpointing some of the things I know how to do using Java:

- I can solve most (job) interview questions with little effort;

- I can understand, debug and unit-test projects other people have coded;

- I can set up a web server and know how to deal with existing APIs on the web;

- I have a working knowledge of HTML5/CSS3, and a fair measure of understanding JScript;

- I know how to manage SQL databases through SQLJ/JDBC;

- I'm proficient with Swing, heavy and lightweight components, themes also;

- I understand how lambdas and streams work;

- I understand Spring MVC basics;

- I know about version control and GIT;

- I can develop simple games that use A/V resources and design levels.

5cpgs6,47,2016-11-13,My experience as an introverted Girl Gone Wired - and tips to succeed in the workplace,chridem,girlsgonewired,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/5cpgs6/my_experience_as_an_introverted_girl_gone_wired/,"I graduated in 2013 with a Masters in International Relations and a very strong sense of foreboding.
&amp;nbsp;

After being neatly shepherded through school with expectations of good grades and absolutely no understanding at all of what I actually liked doing, I’d just finished an internship in an NGO that was supposed to be the stepping stone to a wonderful career in international development – and I realized that I didn’t like the work.
&amp;nbsp;

Sure, I liked our motto, I liked what we were saying on our website, I liked what people thought I was doing at my job.

&amp;nbsp;

But the truth was that **I dreaded going to work every day**. After interacting with my boss all day I would come home drained, with barely enough energy to watch TV and boil up some pasta.

&amp;nbsp;

So I realized I had to make a change, and long story short, today I’m an IT Business Analyst in a large financial institution where I work on e-banking and mobile banking solutions.

I feel valued by my superiors and co-workers, see concrete results to what I do and there are many career opportunities open to me – all that with great financial stability and benefits.

I have several amazing mentors who help me when I need it and give great advice. I have a strong network of friends and family. A wonderful boyfriend.

I take the time I need to take care of myself – I work out 3 times a week, read 6 books a month, am learning two new languages.

I find quiet spaces throughout the day to peacefully recharge. I have lots of energy to tackle projects that interest me. And I’m one of the only female volunteer firefighters in the city :)

&amp;nbsp;

So why am I sharing my experience with you, dear Girls Gone Wired?

Because learning to code to break into the tech world is just the first step of having a fulfilling career in your new field. 

As a matter of fact, where I work, at least half of the criteria applied to developers in year-end reviews are related to **soft skills**. 

&amp;nbsp;

Are you perceived as helpful and collaborative?
Are people comfortable coming to you with questions?
Can you succinctly and clearly present a topic in front of people?

&amp;nbsp;

So without further ado, here are my tips for fellow introverts to help them succeed in the tech world!

&amp;nbsp;

First (and this might sound ridiculous but bear with me), **pick your boss the way you’d pick a spouse**. 

When I work for somebody I like and respect, I could do any job and find it fulfilling and interesting. As a student, I worked in a t-shirt printing booth at a festival in France and absolutely loved it! But if I don’t feel valued and respected as a human being by my manager, I will simply not do a good job and no fancy title on my business card can change that.

&amp;nbsp;

Being able to pick out what people you work well with is also a great base to start **finding mentors**, which is my second piece of advice. To get anywhere in life and keep your ego small, you have to be a life-long learner and that means finding the right teachers. I have half a dozen of mentors who have _changed my life_ in the past three years, each in their own special way. One of those mentors is the reason I got into tech in the first place!

&amp;nbsp;

And thirdly: **know yourself**. If you know what matters to you in the workplace, you will know which job opportunity to go for and which to forgo. A method that worked for me is a sort of “Agile sprint retrospective”: go through all the jobs you’ve ever had and for each of them, jot down what you enjoyed about them and what you didn’t enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s an example based on my t-shirt printing stint:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – feeling super helpful to my boss because he didn’t speak the language of our customers and couldn’t communicate with them without me.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – standing on my feet all day and burning my fingers on the pressing machine. 

&amp;nbsp;

Or for my NGO job:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – working with books, interacting with people of different cultures and using my foreign languages.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – my boss apologizing on the phone that his “secretary” had made a mistake when he had actually made that mistake. Being called a secretary when I was a project manager. Feeling micro-managed.

&amp;nbsp;

And for my last job:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – taking a problem that the developers were stuck on and solve it because I knew the right people to ask. Making the new intern practice her English with me because she felt insecure speaking up in meetings. Brainstorm ideas to better implement Agile in our delivery unit.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – writing down super-detailed meeting minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

By going through this mental exercise you will start identifying patterns of what works for you and what doesn’t. Everybody likes and is good at different things, you don’t have to stick with something that’s a terrible fit for your personality! 

&amp;nbsp;

I hope my experience can bring some value to fellow introvert women in the tech world! If it did or if you have any questions, **let me know in the comments** :)

Part of me wants to leave my current company as during my first year at my startup I've busted my ass to enhance/add features to the company's product to make it significantly more competitive without any sort of increase in equity or pay.  This is during a period of great growth of our bottom line, so it's not as if we can't afford to give raises to top performers.  I can't decide whether it's better to just start over at another company or suck it up and stick it out to the 2 year mark so that I have a slightly longer stint on my resume. 

I do enjoy the work I do at my current company (and the people as well) but I feel it's somewhat demoralizing to be a chief contributor to the company's success without any direct reward.  At my last job at a larger company raises/bonuses were much easier to come across which is somewhat ironic because I feel that I'm about 4 or 5 times more productive at my current job.

If you were in this situation, would you try to switch to a more meritocratic company?  I've only got 3 years experience (4 if you count internships) so I'm not sure how this would look on my resume long-term."

Sure, I liked our motto, I liked what we were saying on our website, I liked what people thought I was doing at my job.

&amp;nbsp;

But the truth was that **I dreaded going to work every day**. After interacting with my boss all day I would come home drained, with barely enough energy to watch TV and boil up some pasta.

&amp;nbsp;

So I realized I had to make a change, and long story short, today I’m an IT Business Analyst in a large financial institution where I work on e-banking and mobile banking solutions.

I feel valued by my superiors and co-workers, see concrete results to what I do and there are many career opportunities open to me – all that with great financial stability and benefits.

I have several amazing mentors who help me when I need it and give great advice. I have a strong network of friends and family. A wonderful boyfriend.

I take the time I need to take care of myself – I work out 3 times a week, read 6 books a month, am learning two new languages.

I find quiet spaces throughout the day to peacefully recharge. I have lots of energy to tackle projects that interest me. And I’m one of the only female volunteer firefighters in the city :)

&amp;nbsp;

So why am I sharing my experience with you?

Because learning to code to break into the tech world is just the first step of having a fulfilling career in your new field. Or, to be more general: getting past the gate-keeper (i.e. the job interview) is just the beginning.

As a matter of fact, where I work, at least half of the criteria applied to employees in year-end reviews are related to **soft skills**. 

&amp;nbsp;

Are you perceived as helpful and collaborative?
Are people comfortable coming to you with questions?
Can you succinctly and clearly present a topic in front of people?

&amp;nbsp;

So without further ado, here are my tips for fellow introverts to help them succeed in the workplace!

&amp;nbsp;

First (and this might sound ridiculous but bear with me), **pick your boss the way you’d pick a spouse**. 

When I work for somebody I like and respect, I could do any job and find it fulfilling and interesting. As a student, I worked in a t-shirt printing booth at a festival in France and absolutely loved it! But if I don’t feel valued and respected as a human being by my manager, I will simply not do a good job and no fancy title on my business card can change that.

&amp;nbsp;

Being able to pick out what people you work well with is also a great base to start **finding mentors**, which is my second piece of advice. To get anywhere in life and keep your ego small, you have to be a life-long learner and that means finding the right teachers. I have half a dozen of mentors who have _changed my life_ in the past three years, each in their own special way. One of those mentors is the reason I got into tech in the first place!

&amp;nbsp;

And thirdly: **know yourself**. If you know what matters to you in the workplace, you will know which job opportunity to go for and which to forgo. A method that worked for me is to go through all the jobs you’ve ever had and for each of them, jot down what you enjoyed about them and what you didn’t enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s an example based on my t-shirt printing stint:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – feeling super helpful to my boss because he didn’t speak the language of our customers and couldn’t communicate with them without me.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – standing on my feet all day and burning my fingers on the pressing machine. 

&amp;nbsp;

Or for my NGO job:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – working with books, interacting with people of different cultures and using my foreign languages.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – my boss apologizing on the phone that his “secretary” had made a mistake when he had actually made that mistake. Being called a secretary when I was a project manager. Feeling micro-managed.

&amp;nbsp;

And for my last job:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – taking a problem that the developers were stuck on and solve it because I knew the right people to ask. Making the new intern practice her English with me because she felt insecure speaking up in meetings. Brainstorm ideas to better implement Agile in our delivery unit.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – writing down super-detailed meeting minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

By going through this mental exercise you will start identifying patterns of what works for you and what doesn’t. Everybody likes and is good at different things, you don’t have to stick with something that’s a terrible fit for your personality! 

&amp;nbsp;

I hope my experience can bring some value to fellow introvert women in the workplace! If it did or if you have any questions, **let me know in the comments** :)

5cpxpt,7,2016-11-13,Underwhelming experience (33/F and 23/M),numbdisassociation,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/5cpxpt/underwhelming_experience_33f_and_23m/,"I am the 33/F but I thought I'd share my experience here. I began a LDR with the 23/M three years ago after having known him for three years prior. We became friends through a game and he always made time for me and was goofy and fun. Before anyone criticises me for the age gap, I'll just say i had doubts about it succeeding but wanted to take a chance. I've been with others including a previous LDR that ended in disaster after living together for 6 years. I had pined for older men my entire life and most the time they were less mature than my current boy. To sum my thoughts up about this, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

So, things seemed good. He was very loving and affectionate towards me. Without fail, I always got a message from him when he woke up and went to sleep. We voice chat on a regular basis, but not as much as we used to. He used to be very sexual towards me(in a very cute little boy manner) but that's tapered off. And yes, he is attracted to me but it's normal for the excitement to wear off. Just shit that's generally normal and didn't bother me much. I helped keep him on track when he admitted he had been skipping his college classes and hanging at Panera. We discussed that and he changed majors determined to finish his new degree. Meeting me never came up and I was the only one who ever did. He always assured me he wanted to. I was ok with this being someone who is pretty used to being independent and well, he's still young. He's liable to changing so I didn't want to create plans to meet so early.

Flash forward to now. I just met him yesterday after having visited my family by myself. Usually I go with my parents to see them so we can all be together, but my work schedule wouldn't allow it this year. I made the effort to go three hours out of my way because I just wanted to know and see where this was going. You change so much in your early twenties and I did especially. I told him about my plans two weeks in advance and he agreed to it. I would arrive Saturday and leave Sunday. On Friday he tells me he's stressed out by a group project but he can still come see me. Because I wanted to look my best, I took a long time getting ready and he arrived at 6:30. He comes to the hotel room, hugs me, says I look good and we agree to get dinner. We take it back to the hotel room and he acts like how he normally does online. He comments I act the same. After awhile we make out, but he says he can't go all the way. That's fine. I respect that. After all, he's not obligated to do that(he's a virgin.) He told me while he wasn't a strict believer he felt due to God he couldn't do it. 

After a couple minutes(i ended up getting him off another way because it's obvious he needed some help there) he says he needs to leave because it's late. Granted, it's 10:00 pm. He said his parents will wonder where he is. Ok, disappointing, I guess but fair enough. He gives me a hug and says he loves me. He texts me later saying he cares about me and his feelings hadn't changed, etc. I ask if he wants to meet up tomorrow before I leave and he then mentions he has to meet up with his team for the group project at 10am. I don't know if I'm being paranoid, but he didn't mention this at all to me earlier and that he already met with them Friday. I asked him while we had dinner if he had wanted to meet with them today but again, see previous sentence. So I guess I was shocked when he said they were meeting again Sunday. I asked if he could meet up before then and he just said he couldn't before then(he stayed up until 2am playing wow)

The rest of the night I felt disappointed and upset. I communicated this with him and he just kept assuring me of his feelings. There is no discussion of meeting again other than him insisting he will meet me again. I wonder if this will ever pan out or if I'm wasting my time. It seems he can't make time to be with me physically unless it's convenient for him. For example, when I ask if he'd like to come visit me, his response is that he's applying for internships in my area. He wouldn't even see me off the next day, but he's acting very affectionate and normal. I'm very confused, yet not surprised. And truth be told, I knew this would hurt me greatly. I should have known better, but I feel like it didn't mean as much to him as it did to me. I didn't expect this from him at all considering how attentive he usually is towards me.

I am simply boiling this down to he and I being in completely opposite points in our lives. He's never really had a girlfriend and I was probably his first kiss. A couple other things is that he's Muslim, but never really strict about it. He also received a text from a girl in one of his classes. Boy told me his friend is friends with her and gave her his # for homework questions. I asked a couple of questions but didn't pry since I (want to) believe that'd be paranoia. He said she only asks homework questions. Besides, what's the point? You can't control what people do and all you can do is believe in the trust you have. His parents don't know(but his dad knows he likes someone) and our meeting was secret. Not even our mutual game friends know about us, even though it's fairly obvious. I suppose I prefer the privacy since I don't want to involve others in our relationship.

TL;DR version: met younger guy after 3 years, we hung out for 3 1/2 hours. We cuddled and I blew him. He left afterwards saying it was late. Texted me later reassuring his feelings. I don't feel reassured and am questioning if this relationship is worth keeping. The age difference seems very apparent right now. He is currently 25 minutes away and doesn't have time to see me before I leave. We normally live 6 hours a part.

If anyone else has had this kind of experience, you're not alone. It sucks and while I had fun, it has opened my eyes. I feel like I'm constantly swimming against the current and truth be told, I'm tired.

5cq5g6,2,2016-11-13,"Recovering alcoholic tackling DB, where to start?",subgenius00,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/5cq5g6/recovering_alcoholic_tackling_db_where_to_start/,"Here goes, currently in a borderline deadbedroom situation, sex for the last 2-3 years has averaged once every two weeks or so.  

We’ve been together for 12 years, married for 8. Two kids, 7 and 4.  My wife is a SAHM and is currently in her last year of a Master’s program.  I work a 40 hr/week desk job.  I suppose things have been going steadily downhill for a few years.  Sex while we were dating and in the first year of our marriage was frequent (at least 4-5 times/week) and passionate.  Understandably things slowed down when we had kids.  But the last couple of years things seem to be getting dramatically worse, not better.

I literally can’t remember the last time my wife initiated sex.  I rarely even try to initiate it anymore as she generally makes it pretty clear that it’s the last thing on her mind.  Usually she’s telling me how exhausted she is by 6 PM.  I don’t know if she is consciously trying to tell me that we wont be having sex but that’s what I hear.  I try to be understanding but I find it hard to sympathize with why she is so tired all the time.  Our oldest child is in first grade so she is at school from 8-2:30 every day.  I drop her off in the morning and my wife picks her up.  Our youngest is nearly 5 and goes to preschool three mornings each week.  My wife works at an internship as part part of her graduate school program while the youngest is at preschool.  I typically take the kids out do do stuff on the weekend while my wife does schoolwork.  I do occasionally spent a half day on the weekend to go fishing or hunting.  I might take a full day to go fishing or hunting 4-5 days a year.  

My wife basically wants to go to bed and watch tv everynight as soon as the kids go to sleep.  And while I’m usually not interested in the idea of going to bed and 8:30 or 9, most nights I join her in bed just so we can spend some time together.  Sometimes I try to come up with ideas for date nights but I feel as though my wife rejects almost all of them.  As far as I can remember she hasn’t suggested a night out in at least a couple of years.  

More background, I think it’s fair to say I’ve had a drinking problem for years.  I was a functional alcoholic and my drinking was confined to after 5 pm.  I drank at home, probably averaging 4-6 beers and a glass or two of bourbon per night.  Sometimes a little more, sometimes less.  I sobered up about 4 months ago.  I stopped drinking because of a crazy situation that happened at my younger brothers wedding.  Long story short, my wife and I had a fight towards the end of the reception dinner.  She took the kids back to the room where we were staying and I decided to spend the night celebrating with my brother and his friends.  I stayed out all night and basically ignored the texts my wife sent me that night.  Clearly this was the wrong decision, and I deeply hurt my wife.  This event also sort of opened up Pandora's box of repressed anger and resentment she had towards me.  She has basically told me that.  

I went to AA for almost three months and have been seeing a marriage/addiction counselor for the last 10-12 weeks.  The counselor has been helping me work through my issues with drinking and also issues in the marriage.  My wife has refused to go see the counselor either with me or alone.  

We’ve had a lot of challenging conversations in the last few months, but it feels like I have initiated all of them.  I’ve been trying to find ways to work through our issues my my past problems.  My wife has made it clear during these conversations that she has an enormous amount of resentment that has built up over the years.  She has said that she feels that I am very selfish, that I don’t value her opinion, that I don’t appreciate the sacrifices that she has made to stay at home and raise our children.  

About 6 weeks ago I brought up the topic that I think we should be having more sex.  I said that I’d like to try semi scheduled sex, once a week on Friday or Saturday night to starts.  This was something the therapist suggested.  She agreed but it only lasted a week or two.  I’ll take some of the blame as I started to let it slide but it was hard to initiate when she clearly wasn’t interested.  

A couple of weeks ago another failed attempt to initiate led to a discussion about how my wife feels that she has a negative view of her body.  She clearly told me that she feels that I am responsible for this.  She mentioned that in the past I have said that I would not love her any more if she was fat.  After thinking about this, she is correct that I have said this after she explicitly asked me that questions.  It was not something that I brought up.  Obviously I feel terrible about this and the damage that it did.  At the same time, if I’m being honest, it’s true that I would no longer be attracted to my wife if she were fat.  I do not find fat people attractive and I don’t believe that’s something that I can change.  Also, I really do find my wife attractive and do not think she is fat.  Often, I give her compliments about how beautiful she is, how nicely she dresses, etc.  

Yesterday we had a very difficult talk.  I tried to initiate sex as it at had been two weeks since we had sex.  At first it seemed to be going well but then she became really unresponsive.  This has happened before.  It seems that once she realized that it’s moving past snuggling and might turn into sex she just shuts down and lays there.  I stopped and asked her what was wrong and why she wasn’t in to it.  Her response was that she felt pressured and that killed her desire.  She went on to say that she feels that I pressure her into having sex if it has been awhile.  She also told me she has been having sex with me for years even when she didn’t want to because she felt obligated to and because she said that when she turned me down I would be mean to her the next day.  Reflecting on this, I think she has a valid point that I do fall into a bit of a funk after a rejection.  It’s no intentional, I’m not consciously trying to hurt her feelings.  The biggest issue is that my self esteem takes such a blow that I lash out.  I think part of it is the way the rejection comes.  There’s no communication or explanation that she is not in mood or to tired.  Instead she simply lays there saying nothing.  

Clearly there is probably a lot more going on here that a simple DB but I also feel that’s one of the central problems in out relationship.  I’m not sure where to go from here.  Right now I’m leaning toward giving her some space and telling her that I will no longer initiate sex with her because I don’t want her to feel pressured but that I would love to have sex again whenever she is ready.  I think after a month if there is no change I’m going to give her an ultimatum about going to see a therapist with me.  It doesn’t have to be my therapist, she can choose, but I feel like if she flat out refuses to see a therapist that is a clear indication to me that she has given up on the marriage.  We have several issues to work on and the DB is central one but if she won’t talk to me or a therapist about it I don’t see how we can move forward.  

I’ve tried to paint this picture as objectively as possible. I fully realize that I have a huge responsibility for most of these issues.  Maybe I’m entirely to blame.  After all, I’m an alcoholic and incredibly self centered and negative to boot.  Although I do feel that since I quite drinking my world view has improved dramatically and I am consciously working to be more accepting and understanding of others.  

TLDR: Sorry for the novel.  Near DB after 8 years of marriage and two kids.  Wife told me she feels pressured to have sex and has for years.  I’m a recovering alcoholic and have plenty of issues of my own.  Wife is full of anger and resentment built up over years but won’t go to a therapist with me and in general seems to have difficulty talking about the issues.  "
5cqd55,10,2016-11-13,INFP and a difficult past. Do those two things influence each other?,Flashes-of-Cold,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/5cqd55/infp_and_a_difficult_past_do_those_two_things/,"Hi, I’m new here on this sub reddit. Over the years, I’ve done a few internet MBTI tests and gotten INFP in all of them but I never really thought any further about it. Now I finally decided to get deeper into it. 

I always thought my issues stemmed from what I’ve been through in the past, but now I wonder if it’s partly because of my personality type too. 

I also wonder if my problems influence my INFP traits in a bad way. 

A little bit of a background is probably in order. I’m not going to go into too many detail because it is emotionally taxing for me to talk about it and it would take far too long. 

My mother has Borderline personality disorder and that gave a lot of incidences when I was really young. As a toddler and primary school child, I saw her cutting in her arms with a sharp knife right in front of me, take a lot of overdoses, saw her throw herself down the stairs, put a hot iron on her leg, etc. It made me afraid of sharp objects among other things. It took until my first year in high school for me to dare use a knife. I’m terrified of pain. I don’t know if it has anything to do with that, but the thought of going through something painful is horrible for me. One of the reasons I never want to get pregnant. 

I took a caring role upon me from a very young age. Not just towards her, but also towards my two younger brothers. My father tried his best but he had to work so he couldn’t always be there and when I was 7, they divorced. My mother always promised me she wouldn’t hurt herself again, but she never kept her promises. I still kept giving her chances even though it always hurt whenever she broke her promise once again.  
Things always got worse after my parents divorced. We lived with my father but had to go to our mother every other weekend. On my mom’s side, she had a few bad boyfriends. The first one was an alcoholic who got really aggressive when he was drunk. He didn’t hit me or my brothers but he did hit my mother. I also got grabbed by the throat once for something I’d done. He also yelled a lot. But the most of his anger and violence was always directed towards my mother. I had to call the police a couple of times because of that. 

After a couple of non-important boyfriends, there was her other serious one that went on off for extended periods of times.  I was 11 when he first entered our lives. At first everything was great, or so I thought. Sure that guy got into some fights with my mother too but aside from a few times It didn’t seem as bad as with the first one. He showed a lot of interest in what I had to say and I liked that. I thought he understood me so I liked talking to him. There were several things that should have raised some alarm bells inside me but I guess I was too young and naïve to see that. He touched me a lot. Innocent? touches the first few years; hand on shoulder, knee, running through my hair, rubbing my back. He also liked taking me on his lap. I had no clue what was behind that until he sent me a text when I was 13 despite sitting right next to me that said he had feelings for me. I laughed it off because I was honestly thinking he made a joke. After a while I started realizing that he meant it. He tried kissing me and I was like so shocked. I told him that I liked him as a sort of step father but that a relationship couldn’t possibly happen. First of all he was with my mother, and I never thought of him that way and didn’t feel for him that way, and that huge age difference! I was 13 and he 36. No idea why I was so nice and polite about it because now I know how fucked up something like that is, but I explained it as calmly as I could and thought he would understand. He didn’t of course, and even started accusing me of seducing me. I was 13 ffs. But of course I felt guilty back then because I believed him. Not that saying sorry helped. He was more forceful after that. 

I told my mother about it one evening, hoping that she would help me, find a solution because I was scared and had no idea what to do. I hoped that she would hug me and say everything would be okay.  Instead she started accusing me of stealing her boyfriend. Which made me feel even guiltier. I begged her to never leave me alone with him. You think she listened? I felt ashamed of myself because I believed them and I didn’t dare to tell anyone else in case other people would get angry at me too. That resulted in months of being touched against my will because I was terrified of letting anyone know. Until the last time that my mother left me completely alone with him when I was already 14. He tried to rape me that evening. I don’t know how I managed to fight him off but somehow thankfully I did. After that I couldn’t keep it in anymore and told my grandmother a week after. She’s always been extremely important to me and when she saw there was something wrong with me I had to tell her. She did what I’d hoped my mother would have done. Since then I have always considered her to be my mother figure instead. 

Long story short: my father heard about it too and forbade me to go  to my mother until that bastard was gone. When he told my mother about it and asked her why she didn’t do a damn thing to help me, she said I was lying. That I never told her anything and that her darling boyfriend would never do such a thing. She also claimed I was in love with him and that I made all of that up because he didn’t want me. I felt so hurt and betrayed when my father told me. I’d given my mother so many chances, always defended her towards other people and then she completely tears my heart apart like that. It was too much for me and I broke all contact with her. 

I’m 25 now and I have tried to come into contact with her again over the past few years. Not because I particularly want to but because she begs me to. But she always gives me a reason to stop again. She’s still as selfish as she used to be. It’s hard for me but I need to accept that she will never change. It’s better for me if I keep her out of my life. 

All that gave me a fear of men in general. It’s very hard for me to get close to any men in real life and the thought of me ever doing anything sexual – even if it would be with a woman - scares me too. I have some male friends but they are exceptions. I need to feel really comfortable with a guy in order to not feel intimidated by them. It happens very rarely. 

My father was a good guy. He tried his very best to raise us. My grandmother and aunts helped him a lot and that worked. My father wasn’t particularly happy though of course because he longed for someone to love. I tried to help him too as much as I could and was supportive of him getting to know new women because I wanted him to be happy too. 

When I was 12 our step mother came into our lives. All went well at first until she started showing her true colors. She hated me and my brothers, hated whenever my father spent any of his time on us. Especially me. I couldn’t do anything right according to her and was freaky and abnormal because my mother was too. I wasn’t allowed to speak my mind. The littlest thing I did wrong got punished heavily and according to my friends in school she treated me like a modern day Cinderella. For whatever reason, I loved her though and tried to do everything within my power to get her to like me. Tried to do everything she wanted from me but of course years later I realized that she was always setting me up for failure. Because what she asked was just impossible. Every single time I felt somewhat good about myself, she tore me down. Not a day went by that I didn’t have to hear I was ugly, stupid, fat, worthless. It’s like everything I did was a reason for her to complain about me. I even ate too much according to her which nearly got me anorexic.  After that whole situation with my mother’s boyfriend she also loved using that against me whenever it suited her. 

There’s a ton of things I can say about those 6 years but it comes down to what two police officers said after seeing her behavior towards me; “That woman was terrorizing you.” I mean can you even believe the gal of my step mother that she kept up her behavior even though two policemen were seeing it and even threatened to take her to the station? She didn’t even care at all.  

She was never officially diagnosed with npd – not that I or my brothers know of anyway, she did have to go to a psychologist and psychiatrist at times  - but everything about her clicks with being a narcissist. 

The first years my father still went against her when she said disgusting things to us but it’s like he became tired of fighting. He stopped saying anything which made me believe he agreed with her. He didn’t even say anything or looked me in the eyes when I got kicked out. Maybe he just didn’t care about me anymore. He even lied for her. 

Some institutes regarding child care and child abuse were involved and we often had to go talk to them but those only jumped into action after I was kicked out of the house when I was 18. Sadly it didn’t really help my brothers much.

I went to live with my grandmother for three months while my aunt and uncle helped me with looking for a place of my own. I haven’t had contact with my father or step mother since then. I still have contact with my brothers though. They don’t live there anymore either. Haven’t for a long time. 


So that’s a summary of what the main things were that shaped me, I think. The result is that I’m an extremely scared, anxious, insecure person. I’m terrified of doing something wrong, of upsetting people, of making them angry at me. New and unexpected things scare me. I like being prepared for things because it gives some kind of certainty. I feel like I’m not good enough, can’t do anything right. 

I’ve had a depression for years now and feel like I’d rather not want to be here anymore. I’m only staying in this world for the people that would be hurt if I was gone. I’m not staying for myself.
I can acknowledge that what I’ve been through wasn’t easy, but there are people who’ve had or have it so much worse than me and are so much stronger. Why am I so weak? Why does the past keep haunting me? Why can’t I look in the mirror and for once think I’m okay? 

And everything good about an INFP seems like it’s absent with me. 

I like helping people, I love making people smile or making them feel good about themselves, but I don’t think I could handle a job taking care of other people. It seems like too much responsibility and I panic so easily. I already panic so much with my own grandmother (she’s in a home now and not that healthy anymore) so scared to do something wrong. She’s  become so  very fragile and yet still wants to  do a lot of stuff by herself. It’s always nerve-wrecking for me to see her attempt something she really shouldn’t; like walking without her walking aid or bending down to pick something off the ground. In those moments I feel really stuck in my desire to protect her and my desire to not upset her. Because she gets upset if you don’t let her do it by herself. 

I tried becoming a teacher but I was too soft for that and having teenagers laugh at me and even insult me made me extremely unhappy. I couldn’t handle most classes and so I never managed to pass my internships and stopped. 

I’ve been studying Graphic Design after that because I love drawing and working with programs like Photoshop and it was always my dream to do something like that. I’ve passed all my theory classes but the practical classes are an enormous hurdle for me. But the last two years I’ve had to stop in the middle of the school year because I couldn’t handle the stress and also feel like I’m not creative enough. I also always get the commentary that I’m too insecure, too careful, that I should take more risks. I still like the thought of becoming a graphic designer but I’ve lost a big part of my motivation.

I’m taking a break now. Social welfare saw that I needed a break to get better and so they’re allowing that. I’m not doing nothing however. I work but just not a real job. It’s working for free at a workplace for people with problems. It feels comfortable there because no one is putting any high pressure on me, I can just work at my own pace and even If there’s a mistake, they’re understanding about it and it’s not the end of the world. I also should note that my hands always tremble. Not super noticeable unless you look for it but the more nervous I get, the stronger the trembling is. It’s something that makes me extremely insecure too. 

The plan is to go back to continue my Graphic Design studies next September, if I’m able to handle the stress. But I’m doubting about whether I should not just give up on that dream  and look for work instead. I’m 25 almost 26, I should have been working already! All the people I know from my childhood are working already, married and some even have children. But then I feel scared that I don’t have a future without a degree. Or will be stuck in a job I hate for the rest of my life. 

I feel like I’m so behind on my peers and like it’s never going to get better. 

Social events scare me and I rarely go outside if I don’t have to. So the thing about INFP’S loving nature doesn’t exactly apply to me either. I love animals and nature in theory. I adore looking at pictures of it for  example and love drawing it. But I don’t like walking through a forest or something like that. Mostly because I have an extreme spider phobia. I’m in therapy but we haven’t gotten to the confrontation part yet.  Which I’m super nervous about too. 

Sorry to bombard you all with this extremely long post, but I just don’t know what is causing my problems. My past, my personality type or a combination of both. And I’m trying to get more insight into myself. Maybe that would help in finding solutions. I don’t know. I hate feeling the way I do, I hate myself and I just wish I could change that. Anti-depressants don’t seem to help much. Therapy does but extremely slowly. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m so tired of living this way.

My brother just mailed out a ""save the date"", and I just broke down and fucked everything up. My family and his girlfriend's family are planning a party for Thanksgiving. I told my brother I wasn't ready to face that over the phone and asked him to cover for me while I stay at my college apartment. He said he wanted to get a story straight and wanted to do it over Facetime. He begged me to, so I did. It turned into him wanting to make sure I was ok and just wanted to see my face. I haven't faced him since last Christmas in person. I haven't gone home since then. He said he was sorry again about how things worked out. He actually called me before the wedding invitation arrived to make sure I could let out my feelings at him instead of being angry at anyone else.

That didn't really work. My brother told my parents I couldn't get out of working at a new internship and wouldn't be able to come back for Thanksgiving. My mom was upset and demanding I finally come home and show my face. I got angry and lashed out. In the middle of my swearing and cursing I let out that I fucked my brother and fell for him and couldn't stand that he was marrying one of my friends. I haven't even dated since him yet besides a one night stand with a guy I am friendly with at school

It is a huge mess now. Both my parents know now, and when they confronted my brother it got worse for him. Everything made sense to them why I wouldn't come back. My brother's girlfriend begged them off when they thought about cancelling the party. She told them she knew, and she didn't want her family to know. I had to even call my parents to tell them I instigated it in the first place because my dad was ready to disown my brother. His girlfriend called me telling me that my parents didn't believe his side of things. I couldn't let him take all the blame and called them. I had stopped answering my phone after the fight with my mother until that call. I've never heard my father that upset in my entire life when I talked to him and explained things.

My parents already bought me a plane ticket home. They said if I didn't take it, they were going to fly to my place. I don't want to face anyone, but I am going home for Thanksgiving week. I'm afraid I will just make things worse. They already know a lot, and I am just wondering how honest I should be. I haven't really tried to move on, and I think it might be worse if I tell them that. I'll probably fuck everything up no matter what I say."

I'm worried about how they might react to this, and whether they would decide to terminate current internship immediately.

I don't want them to miss the opportunity to find my replacement thinking that I am staying.

I also want to leave in very good terms with them because they have done so much for me and gave me so many opportunities to learn.

A year and a half ago, I was an incredible naive teenager that somehow managed to stay optimistic in incredibly crappy circumstances. Around that time, I met the girl who afterwards became my first girlfriend at a camp. It was strange; when talking to her as well as others around me, I felt (and probably was) extremely confident, charismatic and healthy whereas I was shy, introverted, and self-conscious before. We only knew each other for several short days, but everything seemed to click perfectly in place. Though our homes were separated by more than a hundred miles we tried long-distance, and everything seemed perfect. Though those days were tough like any other, it always felt like it was worth living, getting through every day to talk to her at the end of it.

a few months later, I attended an internship at a local university and found a passion in physics. I worked feverishly on a research project for two weeks, barely doing anything else. I had hope for the future; I had something I loved enough to make my career, and I had someone who I loved more than anything.

But the good things didn't last. On the last day of summer break, my girlfriend broke up with me suddenly, and vanished. As an instinctive coping mechanism, I became obsessed with making the perfect mask for myself. Though I had managed to fool even myself that I couldn't feel emotional pain, it showed up in other areas. I lost my passion for academia, and a halfhearted attempt at a relationship afterwards showed me that it seemed I had lost the ability to feel happy like I once did. Now, I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and it feels like everything's going downhill.

Every time I try to get myself out of it my head keeps reminding me that I will never be happy like I once was. I fear I've lost the ability to feel happy in the first place. I still can't feel any passion for my major field even though I'm set to go to uni to study it, and I don't think anybody would even want to befriend me much less anything more than that in and after uni. Back then, it felt like every day had a purpose, and was worth living; nowadays it feels the opposite.

Is this really the end for me?"
5cs7au,36,2016-11-13,I thought I did everything correctly,Dula91,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5cs7au/i_thought_i_did_everything_correctly/,"Well I am posting on here because I literally have no idea what to do now.  My buddy showed me a picture of someone who posted on a subreddit about looking for a new job and he got a lot of responses so I figure I have nothing to lose.

All my life I was told that to be successful you need to go to college and get good grades and then you will be able to get a good job.

I completed high school by the age of 16 and then went into college very underprepared and not really mature enough to go.  I had too easy of a time in my prior education and I did not know how to study.  I eventually learned what to do and on my way to a Major in Chemistry.  I eventually hated what I was doing and after completing 2 years worth of chemistry classes I switched my major to International Business and minored in Management.  I ended up getting into some pretty heavy legal trouble when I was 19 and 20 years old and it is something that will follow me for the rest of my life but I learned and coped with it and have pushed through it and graduated with my Bachelors of Arts in International Business with Minors in Management and Chemistry (since I already had more than enough credits why not add it to the degree).

Coming out of college the job market looked pretty bleak and didn't really have many prospects because of my background at the time.  I had zero professional experience ( I participated in no internships, i feel like my college didn't emphasize them enough) and I live in Wichita, KS where international business isn't a huge thing.  We have a predominant aviation/manufacturing industry (which I have no real desire to go into).

So what I opted to do is the one thing I knew, go back to school.  I was on felony probation, jobless, but pursuing my Master's in Business Administration.  I ended up getting off of probation and completed my Masters and had landed a job with a local oil company as an in house Landman.  The pay wasn't too great but there were a ton of fringe benefits to the job that made up for it.  I loved the people I worked with and what I did on the day to day but I wanted more.

Prices plummeted and Kansas Common was trading in the 20's.  We had a full stop on drilling and we weren't even leasing new prospects.  For the foreseeable future we were a drilling company that was doing everything but.  For a few months we did some in house cleaning of old paper work and past projects but eventually there was a layoff in the company.  Over 25% of the workforce was let go.  I was one of the four in my department of eleven.  I don't blame my manager for choosing me and the others, we were the logical choices.  Me and my old boss still remain close (I have known him for about 15 years).

So no here I am about 10 months from the time I was laid off.  I have my MBA, B.A. in International Business, and almost 2 years of experience in the Energy Sector.  Since I was laid off I have been all over indeed and careerbuilder and several other job boards applying to different jobs.  I am hoping for some direction.  My past convictions have never affected where I work or what I can do.  I am willing to relocate or travel as needed.  I would love to work with developing nations.  I have even considered going back to school for my D.B.A. or even taking the BAR.

I apologize for the novel but I hope all of you who have read this far may be able to appreciate my situation.  I am not looking for charity, I am looking to earn my place in the workplace.  Any continent, any country, any state, any city.

All advice is welcome!!!  Thank you!"

I've had long-standing crushes for various celebs (or their characters) and I'm looking for someone to help fulfil one of my ultimate fantasies. The exact details of each one are below, but generally I'm looking for seduction, passionate sex, blowjobs, handjobs, bitchiness and adventurousness (""I've never done that before, but with you...""). I'm **not** looking for aggression, domination, or violence!

**Assistant to the Assistant DA - A Casey Novak (Diane Neal) Law &amp; Order SVU Scene**
As part of an initiative to get more young lawyers into public prosecution, the District Attorney's office in New York has agreed to give intern placements in local offices to the best and brightest of the local law schools. My particular placement has seen me assigned to Casey Novak, whose particularly high caseload and my mistakes (mostly made because she's just so distracting) is making the job too much even for a workaholic like her. Still, I'm kinda cute, in a dumbass-I-have-to-show-the-ropes kinda way, and she might as well get *something* out of this deal.

**Corporate Sexpionage - A Donna Paulson (Sarah Rafferty) Suits Scene**
With the types of high-stakes cases the firm deals with day to day, the staff have to be on high alert to make sure any new hires aren't making extra money on the side by sneaking documents out to the highest bidder. As a new mailroom worker, my low wages combined with my access to important documents make me a risk, so when a rival firm gains access to information they shouldn't, Donna, in her role as office ""fixer"", chooses to investigate it herself. She knows I've always had a thing for her, but her attempts to flirt information out of me get a little carried away.

**The New Sound Guy and the Diva - A Lana Del Rey Scene**
It's my first job working as a sound tech for a big artist - I was only supposed to be the assistant, but my boss called in sick a half hour before we were supposed to start setting up and the company couldn't get anyone else out here in time - and it's safe to say it has *not* gone well. Explaining that I've had to run all of this shit myself doesn't cut much ice, and Lana is in full diva fury mode. Am I trying to fuck up her show? Am I trying to fuck up her tour? Her career? Maybe if I'm so interested in fucking, I should fuck her? Wow, where did *that* come from?

**The Unexpected Backstage Experience - An Ellie Goulding Scene**
Pop isn't really my thing, but I'd agreed to come to this concert with my girlfriend because, hey, it's better than a night out, and Ellie *is* pretty hot. It probably wasn't a good idea to tell my girlfriend that, though, because she's stormed out, leaving me at the gig. Irony is, its her ticket - left in my pocket - that has it's number called out as the winner of a backstage meet-and-greet. Not wanting to go home and face another argument, and looking to try my luck, I decide to go along after the show and see what happens.

**In The Bar After the Show - A Sarah Silverman Scene**
Sarah Silverman - comedian, actress, political campaigner. She's been around long enough now that she doesn't *really* need to work, so she's only touring the smaller, more intimate venues she likes best. I've been a big fan for a *long* time, so when her tour brought her to my local venue, I snapped up a ticket. I was expecting to enjoy the show and enjoy a couple of drinks in the bar afterwards, but what I wasn't expecting was for the star of the show to join me! Turns out even touring the venues you like can be pretty lonely, and soon I'm invited to the backstage dressing rooms so she can let off some steam.

Some orange envelopes would really make my day!"
5csbj7,8,2016-11-13,Squishwersh's Dankicide (AKA The Homicide Rat sequel that no one wanted),Pikapikarai,shittynosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittynosleep/comments/5csbj7/squishwershs_dankicide_aka_the_homicide_rat/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. I was just too lazy to write one, lol. 

I was an intern at Gamestop for a year in 2666 for my degree in dank memes. It wasn't paid of course, but it did have free weed. 

Now, since I worked directly with the Spooky Scary Skeletons, I got to view the new memes centuries before they existed. 

They had very recently made the latest Call of Duty game and the entire staff was stoned so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more dank reasons. There was a problem with the Half Life 3 demo that set everyone and everything back for several thousand years. 

Me and Gabe Newell were in the gaming room along with the Troll Face and Snoop Dogg for a test run. We received the copy that was supposed to be Half Life 3 and gathered around the screen to play. Now, given that one of the employees is Troll Face the demo title screens often have the title changed as a dumb joke, such as ""Water: The Game"" instead of ""Pokemon: Alpha Sapphire"". Nothing funny but Troll Face needs something to do when he runs out of weed. So when we saw the title ""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"" we didn't think it more than a stupid joke. We just passed around the Doritos and unzipped our pants. 

The story began with Shrek practicing his airhorn, hitting a few swaggy notes like normal. We hear a hipster laughing outside and Shrek stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a Bee Movie screening that night and needs to get laid. The hipster says whatever and goes to Starbucks. The raining weed transition screen comes up and we see the ending of Shrek's Bee Movie viewing. This is when things began to seem off. 

While he's blasting his airhorn in everyone's ears, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (the animators must've been frickin' lazy that day) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes 5 seconds after that (more laziness). There is some screaming in the crowd before they begin to No Scope him. Not normal No Scoping that is common in the series, but you could very clearly hear my mixtape in it. Shrek's in full nude and looks completely stoned. The shot goes to the crowd, with the hipster in the background, and he's just casually sipping his Starbucks coffee, very much like him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had really fake looking eyes. Clearly not drawn in MS Paint, but something a bit more fake than Photoshop. The eyes were red, probably to indicate heavy weed smokage. Some of us looked at each other, obviously turned off, but since we weren't the writers, we just shrugged and began snorting cocaine. 

The shot goes to Shrek in his underwear, looking very high. The view out of his stained glass window is of a fiery explosion so it isn't very long after the movie screening. The unsettling part is at this point there were no Doritoes. Literally no Doritoes. Not even the cheese powder from the empty chip bags we left all over the floor. It's as if the speakers were turnt up, though their status showed them being perfectly sober. He just sat there, laughing stupidly, in this silence for about 30 years, then he started to  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) softly. He put his tentacles (a la hentai) over his eyes and made 8-bit sunglasses appear, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from slightly annoying to ear-bleeding. It sounded like a build-up to a bass drop, except every instrument was replaced with airhorns. 

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his butt. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 100,000,000 hours apart side by side. His swag gets swaggier, more full of swag and more swag. The screen then explodes a bit, as if a random green screen effect was inserted for a split second, then back to memes. The ""smoke weed everyday"" sound gets quickly louder and more dank, as if a flame war is brewing somewhere. The sexy part is this sound, and Shrek's ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were portals to the fourth dimension. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't do much more than get drunk and make stupid Wikipedia edits all day. 

Below the sound of the Wilhelm Scream and the Old Spice guy, something sounded like 10,000 bees having a spontaneous orgy with a firetruck. It came loudly (haha) and lasted more than a year so you had a hard time hearing it (we played this game twice, so pardon me if things sound too explicit but I've had lots of time to think about them). After 13 seconds of this, the screen flickered like strobe lights and something flashes over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. 

Uncle Gaben paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was dope. It was a still photo of a Doge. He couldn't have been more than 666. The face was freckled and nerdy, cocaine being snorted deep within the depths of his nostrils. He was naked down to his underwear, the bulge in said underwear impossible to miss. He was laying on some bed that was probably a king size (jealous!). 

The most un-swaggerific part was that there was no shadow of the photographer. There was no pair of handcuffs, no gag or whip, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be a porno. It would seem the photographer simply didn't exist. We were of course still turned off, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a bad joke that Troll Face slipped in. 

The screen flipped back to Shrek, still choking his chicken, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be Comic Sans text running down his face from his stonerific eyes. The text was also done in a sloppy style, looking as if a child has designed it. The dubstep sounded as if the drop would hit any second; there were even gifs of Snoop Dogg dancing around the screen. The chocolate pudding was lasting until 4 AM and coming more frequently (lol). After about .00000000000000002 seconds, the screen again exploded and showed a single frame photo. 

Gaben was eager to go back, the rest of us weren't, but he didn't care. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be Pepe the Frog. He was laying in a sexy pose. His face was exactly like you'd expect, and he was naked except for his sexy lingerie. Deez nuts were piled on top of him above another crude MS Paint drawing. Again the froge was on the bed and the photographer's shadow didn't exist. I had to choke back a (sexy) moan and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out of fricks to give. The show resumed. 

About 585765367554654 milliseconds after this swaggy photo played, Shrek went silent, as did all sound, the complete opposite of when this all started. He put his hentai tentacles down and his eyes were now done in MS-Paint-but-not-quite-MS-Paint like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bamboozled, bumfuzzled, and gobsmacked. He just stared at the screen, as if seducing the viewer (which just looked dumb since he was still high as a kite). After about 1000000000000000 seconds, he started left-sharking, this time not covering his derped eyes. The dance was hypnotic and sharky, and most fishy of all is his dancing was mixed with a bass drop (it's about time man like we waited how long for that drop???). 

Stock images and Steam reviews were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The dubstep kept going, and so did Shrek's stoned laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good -1 frames. 

Gaben was able to stop it on the 13th and backed up. This time the photo was of... 



JOHN-- 
 
 
 
lennon. 
 
 
 
The Game Grumps were just being pulled out from a clown car by a large yaoi hand, their eyes full of memes, sample text trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what but the next one was different but we couldn't brain anymore. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited rainbows on the floor, Uncle Gaben and Snoop Dogg laughing at the screen. The -0.1357545653279 frames were not as if they were 666666666 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video (though technically they were :p). We saw the hand slowly man-handle the...man-handle, we saw the Grump's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the Grumps beginning to unzip their pants. 

Troll Face told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Our Lord and Savior The Almighty Loaf arrived within about 9007 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so Troll Face just continued the episode, anticipating The Almighty Loaf's reaction. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming at cats, all sound again bass dropped. Shrek was just telling ""your mom"" jokes at the viewer, full ugly of the face, for about 333 seconds. The shot quickly escalated out and Shia LaBeouf's voice said ""JUST DO ME--I mean, uh, DO IT"" and we see in Shrek's pants a Minion. He immediately puts the Minion in his mouth and [error: text missing] Completely fake looking [error: MOAR text missing] splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back using the force. The last 5555555555555555555555555566666)))$)))))) seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, in his sexy pose, one rainbow frog dancing above him, staring blankly at him. Then the episode ends. 

Our Lord and Savior The Almighty Loaf is obviously confuzzled at this. He demanded to know what the flying feathered fried ham was going on. Most people left the room at this point (for a little ""private time""), so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me eternal horniness. I'm not sorry I stayed. 

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by Troll Face, but he admitted that even he couldn't pull off something THIS huge. The HMO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere .00000000000000000024 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was interrogated for dank memes and weed as well as viruses, as if the time stamp may have trolled us and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and we honestly don't give a crap. 

There was an ""investigation"" due to the sexy nature of the photos, but nothing came (*snorts*) of it. Every meme seen was identified but no clues were gathered from the data involved (though I think they just got lazy and went back to bed instead--can't say I blame them). I never believed in unexplainable phenomenomenomenomenomenomenomenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond my stoned ramblings, I think nothing about things.

I'm genuinely concerned.

So, recently I accepted an offer to work at Google this summer under their Engineering Practicum program. Exciting stuff, right?! However, now that it's been setting in, I can't help but wonder why they picked me...

I ran a quick search on LinkedIn and all the past EP interns go to Ivy league schools and top CS schools like MIT, Stanford, and Georgia Tech and have done impressive research projects or prior internships... while I'm here attending my state public school with a 3.5 GPA and no past internships (I'm a second-year)

Additionally, all of my other friends who have applied who are WAY smarter than me have gotten rejected.

...AND EP is a diversity program and I'm an Indian male (how much less diverse can you get for engineering?!) All of the LinkedIn people's profiles are either girls, minorities (hispanic/African-American) or both where I'm literally the definition of the majority.

I feel like I've slippped through the cracks and I don't deserve this. Am I right to think this..? (This is freaking Google!)

I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or anything for this opportunity.. I'm extremely grateful but I'm just worried I'm not good enough."

I got along really well with co-workers and my boss would like to hire me, but I am in a larger hiring pool for the greater organization. 

My question is this. Is my letter of intent dependent on me getting at least a 3.0 GPA or will they still hire me? Is there a pdf of hiring guidelines floating around? Has anyone had a similar experience getting in with a low GPA and a letter of intent? 

I'm pretty worried because I know to get the internship they were very insistent that interns had at least 3.0, but I couldn't keep those numbers up. I have a family and a chronic illness that required 2 surgeries in the last 5 years that have made the GPA difficult to maintain. I'll be graduating in April with my B.A. in Computer Engineering.

I'm a senior in college that is in the middle of my job hunt. I'll be graduating in May with a BS in computer science and would ideally like to be a software developer.

After interviewing for several different positions at one of my top companies, I was offered a systems engineering job. The problem is, I don't know if I want to do systems engineering. I have a few main concerns and I was hoping I might be able to get some advice.


* If I take a job in systems engineering, would it make it harder or easier to get into software development later?

* Do software guys tend to view systems guys as just IT guys? (Kind of the general vibe I've been getting)

* Is systems engineering a good place for a Computer Science student to start a career?


Some other background, I did an internship in network security doing some pen testing and web development. My GPA isn't great, which is somewhat hurting my job hunt, but it should be significantly better by the end of my last two semesters.

Thanks for your help!"

**Background:** my mother is abusive.  Physical, verbal, emotional.  I love my father very dearly, but she has used him to get to me and my siblings, sometimes directly (""hit her"" or ""tell your daughter _______""), sometimes indirectly (being abusive toward him/my siblings if I'm not available to abuse directly, or making him tell her the details of a conversation I had with him that includes details about my life that I wasn't keen on her knowing).  The emotional abuse is only becoming more evident as I've been able to distance myself, especially by holding my other family members over me.  

My final semester of college (now) and the summer before, I was supposed to move back home for my internship.  I got a summer job that allowed me to stay away from home, but the second or third day all summer I was home (put it off until August), she started  rampaging.  I moved out that day and started staying with a friend's family near enough that I could still do my internship.  I am set to graduate in December, and in January I leave to go overseas for several years for a job.

**Back to today:** I never explicitly told my parents that I moved out, but it's quietly understood.  I changed my permanent address to the place I am living now (haven't told them where that is) so she wouldn't have an excuse to make me stop by for mail/be able to go through my mail (which she has a history of doing).

She still pays for my health insurance and has been saying since she began to suspect that I changed my address that she needs my tax returns for the 2016 year so the government can determine how much she was supposed to pay in total for...this year.  My insurance is covered for 2017, all taken care of by my job which begins in the first week of January.  I have good friends that I plan to be in touch with/possibly live with when my stint overseas is complete, and I trust them to handle my mail, any confidential information, etc.  However, my mother is saying that it is a legal/financial necessity that she have and be able to go through my financial documents for this information, in addition to insisting on filing my tax return (which the organization I'm working through said I should not have to worry about and that they'd handle it).

Two things with that in particular: one, she has always been intrusive about my returns, making me do them but insisting on knowing how much I made, then lording over me how much I made and still rely on her financially.  Two: especially since I have moved out, she has been...bending the truth about how much I am legally obligated to, and it feels as if she is doing so to control where I go and what I do, and also to force herself into the details of my life (example: I want to do a hike after my stint overseas, and she made up a bunch of totally invalid reasons that I shouldn't go, including saying that while I have a valid driver's license I have to have car insurance, even if I don't own a car).

**Does she actually need to know how much I made last year, or she is trying to maintain her hold on me?  Do I need to have my documents sent to her?  I was hoping to cut her out as soon as I moved out, but for my siblings' sake I've been trying to keep it civil.  Is there a way that I get the information she needs sent to her without having to have contact with her?**"

I've been getting advice and tailoring my resume for a while now, but there's one thing I've been wondering, and I keep getting different answers from peers.

I don't have any internship experience, which I know puts me at a disadvantage, especially because of the ""keyword"" type of sorting that I've heard big companies do when going through all of their resumes.

What I do have is very close to an engineering internship though. I work at a control systems company out in the panel shop, and I regularly have to communicate with our engineers, CAD techs, customers, ect. However my job title is ""Electrical System Assembler""

I feel like it puts me at a slight disadvantage not having a more crisp ""System Engineering Intern"" title, or something similar. It would certainly make my resume more eye catching.

A bunch of friends/colleagues have suggested just putting that on my resume anyway. They claim that a company wouldn't really do the homework required to find out I wasn't technically an intern. Other people I've asked have said that no, I would get myself disqualified for a job if I fabricated a title like that. 

Any thoughts from the ever-knowing internet?"

I know that I probably have not experienced a lot in industry, but given my experiences this far, I can see myself happy in more of research role after graduation, so it makes sense to me to go to grad school. The one caveat that I found though was that most grad schools that I have been looking at for just their masters program have and average GPA in the 3.5/3.6 range however my current GPA  - if everything goes well - will only be in the range of 3.3/3.4.

I'm about to graduate from engineering school. Two years later than expected because on my second year of uni I had to deal with a cronical neurological disorder. I'm currently 24.

Last year I had a full year internship at a quite prestigious insurance company, finished this mid year. Made a lot of mistakes, but also had quite big achievements for an intern. Due to this I was offered two full time jobs in different areas.
 
I did not take any of those jobs because a) conflicting schedule and b) I had little to zero interest in those areas. My internship period came to its end without me receiving a full time job offer in my area.

Unfortunately, my condition demanded me to take so many days off because I didn't feel well or had one of my damn frequent medical appointments. No matter if my absences were justified, when compared to the other interns who were always there, this left a bad impression within my area.

I'm about to finish my last semester, I'm day and night at uni, so looking for another intership or full time job right away was no option. 

Do you guys think I should disclose my condition in my resume? I'm inclined to believe I shouldn't and only bring it up when needed, which will probably happen in interviews, and in this scenario, what's the best way to talk about it without self-sabotaging myself?

Thanks in advance!"
5cucxn,122,2016-11-14,Please help me... why can't they just go to sleep,imsomewhatfunny,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5cucxn/please_help_me_why_cant_they_just_go_to_sleep/,"I don’t know whether this goes on this subreddit, but I don’t browse many subreddits and this seemed like the most appropriate one? I’m not sure. I’m not sure about much. This weekend I decided to come home early for Thanksgiving. I know, it’s basically two weeks away, but this week my birthday takes place and I wanted to spend it at home. I’ve been away for a while for college. I’m about to graduate so being consumed with classes and work, I’ve just been caught up with everything at school. I don’t live too far away from home, but I just haven’t visited since my dad’s birthday in February. Anyway, I decided to come down early to spend time with my parents, but two days in and it has been anything pleasant.

I came home on Friday and realized my dog had passed away. Naturally I was upset that they hadn’t told me, but I think it’s just that they didn’t want to worry me. It only happened a couple of days ago so I’m assuming they just waited to tell me in person. The odd thing is they don’t seem upset about it, and they don’t talk about how my dog passed away. Especially, my younger sister who was attached to Frodo since we’ve had him since she was five, she’s fifteen now. I arrived this past Friday evening, so just in time for supper. I tried to bring Frodo up at the dinner table.


The conversation was going okay. They were asking me about school, work, my internship. The normal things my parents ask when I come home. They tell me to call more since they get worried, and not to be spending all my money on weekends. So, it wasn’t bad. Then I asked about Frodo, and how he passed. My parents, since they were sitting across from each other, just looked up and glanced at each other. Then my dad asked for some salt. Mentally I was like “Ok? Are you guys just going to ignore that question?” Then my sister said “I was kinda sad at first, but it’s okay since we’re joining him soon.” I was mentally trying to process what she said, to make sure I heard it correctly, when I noticed my mom make a dirty look at her. I wanted to push on and ask more, but the more her answer rolled around in my head, I began to feel uncomfortable.


I went out that night with my neighborhood friends. We went out drinking and it was a great time. I came home around 3 a.m., slightly drunk. My parents being early sleepers, I always had tried my best to be quiet when I got home late. So, on Friday night/ Saturday morning, I tried opening my door as quietly as possible. Trying not to wake up our dog, until I realized he wasn’t with us anymore. As I walked in, I heard people talking. Which sent chills down my spine, until I realized it was my parents. Which should have been some relief, until I quickly realized they were talking in the living room with all the lights off. This was one of the first flags that I noticed. I came in through the kitchen door, so for me to get to the living room I must walk past the kitchen/ dining area and make a left. My bedroom is behind the dining area. I didn’t come in through the main door because we don’t live in the best neighborhood and we have a lock on the door that can’t be open from the outside. This door is hardly ever opened so the lock is put in place pretty much all the time. Unless we order pizza, or we are waiting for a package to get delivered. Anyway, as I made my way to the living room they kept chatting, when I realized all three of them were standing in the middle of the room facing each other. Being in a somewhat drunken state, I just said hi and excused myself. They said goodnight without even turning around. I got to my room, and fell asleep trying to forget.


Saturday morning, I take my sister out to watch Dr. Strange and on the car ride there I ask her what they were doing last night. She said they were just talking. Now that my parents weren’t there I pressured her by asking more questions. I asked “Julia why were you guys talking in the dark with the lights off?” She took a while to answer, and I began getting aggravated a little bit. I asked her again, and she said “that’s how the neighbors told us we could bond more”. This threw me off. I asked her why at night, and why with the lights off. She said that’s just how families bonded. I told her “This is not how families “bond” at night. This isn’t what we’ve done in the past. It’s just creepy.” Then she said “Yeah, mom and dad knew you wouldn’t understand”. After that I let it go.

When we got home that afternoon my parents were trying to fix the antenna. Like I said, we don’t live in the best neighborhood, and we can’t afford to have cable. So normally when a car passes by or it’s too cloudy we lose signal. Sometimes, the tape that holds up our antenna falls off, and that was the case this time. I offered to help, as they fixed the antenna from the outside, I was to go in and yell out when the t.v. received signal. As I made my way through the kitchen to the living room, I saw that they were standing in front of the window staring in. We had our curtains down so I know they couldn’t see in. They’re transparent, but because it was still daylight outside, you were only able to see from the inside out. We have thicker ones that we put down at night. I yelled out to them saying I was ready, but they just stared. For about a minute. For some reason, I turned around and noticed my sister standing at the entry of the hallway, staring back. Just staring. I turned back to my parents, and they weren’t in front of the window anymore. Then I heard them yell out that they were ready. I turned around to ask my sister what the hell that was about, but she had gone back to her room. 

After that, my parents came back to watch t.v. as if nothing had happened. I asked about the neighbors, and who they were but they just said they hadn’t really interacted with them. After supper, I excused myself and went out with my friends that night. 


A local college bar has $10 all you can drink on Saturdays and there was no way my friends and I were turning that down. So, we went out. As I was getting dropped of that night/ Sunday morning. I remembered what had happened the previous night. I was about to go in through the kitchen door, when a group of people step out. Four of them to be exact. The parents and two daughters. They introduce themselves as the neighbors, and since I was drunk I clumsily introduce myself. They quickly leave, as I walked in. I get scolded by my parents for acting like an idiot in front of my neighbors. I get annoyed, since it was about 2 a.m., and I was thinking who was visitors over that late, especially since there were no indications of the lights being on from the outside. The lights weren’t fucking on. Why weren’t they fucking on, and why did my parents lie to me about interacting with our neighbors.


Today was the most normal day we’ve had so far. Even then it’s been a bit odd. My parents seem to be avoiding me since last night. I haven’t seen my sister all day. She’s been in her room, and hasn’t come out. When I asked if she wanted to see some YouTube videos together she just plainly said no, and I haven't seen her come out all day.

Something’s wrong here guys and I don’t know what to do. It’s late here now. About midnight. My parents should be asleep since my dad has work tomorrow morning, and my sister has school. But I can hear them talking again. I peeked through my door crack, but the lights aren’t on again. I am thirsty and I want to go get water, but I’m afraid. My parents aren’t themselves anymore. I think they have people over. My neighbors? I want to go out and see. I want to confront them and ask what the hell is going on. 


Guys please help me. Something’s going on at my house, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel welcomed here anymore. I hear them laughing. They seem to be having a good time, I think. This isn’t the family that I’ve been used to for 21 years. I don't think I can make it two weeks if they keep acting up. It's just creeping me out. There are definitely others here. It's midnight for fucks sake. Why can't they just go to sleep?

5cueih,5,2016-11-14,"My ex girlfriend [21F] broke up with me [21M] five months ago after two years, and now more than ever I feel like I'm drowning",sadboithrowaway69,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cueih/my_ex_girlfriend_21f_broke_up_with_me_21m_five/,"**TL;DR: Five months in to a no contact breakup after two years, forced to see her around frequently and am missing her more and more to the point where I can't focus on other things and am starting to lose hope. Really stuck in a rut and would appreciate some reassurance or someone to talk to.**

My ex and I dated for two years. The breakup is five months fresh as of yesterday. That first month was brutal, but it got better as I was doing an internship in a new city and able to try a bunch of new things, make friends, and take my mind off of the breakup.

But I've been at school for three months now, and I see her all the time -- we have several of the same classes, and I see her in the engineering building, at the gym, at the dining halls... I've been following the No Contact rule because as painful as this process has been, it would have been downright impossible had I tried to remain friends. I still have her blocked on all social media, and honestly I haven't even brought myself to say hello when I see her. This whole breakup process has been ups and downs, and until recently, I felt like I had been making progress overall. But over these past few weeks, man... I miss her so much. Sometimes, like right now, it gets to the point where I can't even focus on all of this shit I need to get done because she is all that's on my mind.

Now more than ever I just want to talk to her, hold her, laugh with her, and be happy. I know nothing good would come out of it; I'm confident there's a 99% chance we're not getting backing together, and I'm sure she's moved on. 

I think it's because I'm lonely. I miss the comfort, the security, the person I thought I could always count on, the way things were. Everyone says this, but man... we were unequivocally best friends. We spent *all* our free time together, and we both let some other friendships slip. I thought that was okay because I had *her* -- my best friend and the girl I legitimately thought I was going to spend my life with. I became too complacent, too comfortable in the relationship (part of the relationship's demise), and now she's gone and there's just this crippling, aching, emptiness. At least several times a day (some days are far worse than others), something will remind me of her, or some forgotten memory will resurface, and a wave of emotion knocks me to the ground. 

I've tried moving on, and even though I've never been great with girls, I've been on a few dates. Maybe I'm too picky or maybe I don't put myself out there enough (probably the latter -- shit is hard and takes a lot of time lol), but I have yet to call any of those girls back for a second date. I think my ex just set this ridiculous standard. Sure, she wasn't perfect, but she was so sweet, caring, intelligent, and crazy gorgeous (still is -- she's even more beautiful every time I see her around these days. Shit sucks.). We just meshed on so many levels. We were both total dorks and so similar in our ambitions, our humor, our tastes. Lately I feel like the more I put myself out there the more I miss her.

As I mentioned earlier, I felt that for a few months, while there were undoubtedly miserable days, the overall trend was positive; I was healing, finding myself again, and getting through it day by day. But in the past several weeks, I've felt crushed with loneliness and longing for who was once my rock and best friend. Perhaps it's in part because school has gotten crazy busy, and I'm at all time high stress levels right now (another key contributor to the failed relationship). I'm starting to lose sight of her negatives and the unhealthy aspects of the relationship. All I can focus on is how much I loved her; the bitter arguments and relationship pains are overpowered by an inflated memory of just... being happy with her.

One of the key things that has been keeping me going is the fact that I have a sweet job lined up next year in a new city, thousands of miles away. I'll get to start fresh, with a clean slate. Unfortunately I recently found out that she may be working there as well... seriously, out of all the companies, out of all the places... the world is too small. I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is. I'm torn between hoping against hope that we could give it another shot and just wanting her to get the hell out of my life. 

This has turned out pretty lengthy, so if you're here, thanks for reading this far. One of the worst parts is that I don't really have anyone I can vent about this to. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance, some confirmation that I will find someone else -- someone better, someone who values our relationship enough to really work through issues rather than just leaving, something to keep me pushing through this because man it is fucking painful. I already do all the cliche advice -- I go to the gym frequently, have a ton of schoolwork and other things going on that should preoccupy me, and I hang out with friends as much as possible. Still can't keep her off my mind.

5cug9g,1,2016-11-14,Opinions on Airbnb?,throwaway131126,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cug9g/opinions_on_airbnb/,"Hi reddit! I'm a junior right now and I've been lucky enough to get an internship offer from Airbnb and a return internship offer from Google.

I know I'd be able to do a machine learning project at Google, which would be really awesome since it's something I want to learn about, and is usually pretty hard to get, but I don't know what I would work on at Airbnb. On the other hand, if I went back to Google I wouldn't find out what it's like to work at another company. Also, I probably wouldn't have to interview again in order to convert to full-time after another internship at Google. 

Do you guys have any opinions on what's the better choice? Is Airbnb still considered a good company to work for? Overall, while many people I know would love to work for Google, nobody is impressed by Airbnb. I've been reading up on it and I've heard some negative things about where it's been going over the last couple years. Will it be much harder to find an interesting project at Airbnb compared to Google?

I'd appreciate any opinions! Thanks!"
5cuqfm,6,2016-11-14,I'm [20 M] highly interested in [22 F] girl. I've known her for 11 months now. I am completely stuck. Help me Reddit &lt;3,leoxo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cuqfm/im_20_m_highly_interested_in_22_f_girl_ive_known/,"Okay, so this is the first time I've actually went to anyone for advice about this. What better place than Reddit right? Note: I am completely hopeless right now, and will probably 100% take your guys' advice.  
  
Anyways, let's begin. I'll **try** to make it as short as possible, but a TL;DR will also be posted at the end..  
--  
  So, I've known this girl for 11 months. You can pretty much say I was interested at first sight. I really think she is the most beautiful girl I have ever met, and hands down the SWEETEST girl I have ever met.  
  
I met her in a history class, and we always talked in class every single day. She always seemed interested, and we would even walk out to the parking lot after class and sit back and talk for 10-20 minutes almost every other day, just shooting the shit. It was nearing the end of the semester, and I HAD to get her number. So I did what every shy college dude does: I told her I was missing class one day, and I asked for her phone number so she could send me notes. Looking back, this was pretty ridiculous because the class was beyond easy, and I feel bad because I didn't even end up looking at the notes (got an A in the class). She knew it was easy too.   
  
So, a week later she added me on Snapchat through phone contacts. **My first question:** Does this mean anything? Normally, when I go and add a girl on Snapchat through phone contacts, I am interested in them.  
  
Anyways, so the summer comes, and we occasionally keep in touch.. But as expected, we pretty much lose contact. This summer was a rough one for me though, in my defense. I had zero time to do anything (got an engineering internship). However, just recently, we linked up again. We hung out and walked around campus. We pretty much just talked and caught up for 3 hours. I am almost positive I fell in love. I have no idea why, but I get such a kick out of this girl. She wraps it up by saying we need to hang out again, and that I should come to this party with her and her friends (there will be drinking there of course, so not sure how that will work). It REALLY FUCKING BLOWS though, because her friend suggested we should go get drinks that night, but I can't because I'm 20 (such a buzz kill). I am still salty about that.  
  
ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFO:  
WE **NEVER** flirt. Literally, we have never flirted before. I am not sounding like a douche, but this is unusual for me. Usually I have no problem with breaking the ice and being super flirty with girls I'm interested in. This girl is like a 'homie' though, and it's very hard to flirt with her. Most of the time I'm just getting to know her and asking her about her life and talking about school... We also don't even text that frequently. I'm a really bad texter so I can pretty much owe it to that. I sent the last text, and we haven't texted in 3 days now. I hate double texting, so I don't know what to do...  
  
Guys, I want to ask her out. She loves basketball (is OBSESSED with basketball), and I was thinking of getting two tickets and asking her to go to a game. Is this weird? How would I do this? just text her? and how would I ask her? :/ We are pretty old now (early 20s), this isnt high school anymore.. so you would think, her just giving me the time of day should be a big enough sign for me. I feel so hopeless though. I feel like she's the one.  
  
Sorry if I wasn't that helpful of my situation, just needed to get that out there. Any advice is welcome, and thanks in advance guys &lt;3  
  
TL;DR: there's a girl I know, who I never flirt with. I'm very interested in her but I'm scared to ask her out. Should I do it, and how.

However, now that my brother has tried gaming on the system, an issue has arisen:

When he tries playing the new Battlefield game, the pc blue screens and restarts.

The blue screen just pops up shortly before rebooting, so my brother isn't able to check the error message.

I fear this might be a hardware malfunction. OR I have missed something important about the graphics card (device manager show the graphics card as being used, but maybe I missed something that causes the game to run on the onboard graphics instead of on the dedicated card?

Are there any diagnostical tools that might help troubleshoot this? It's hard for me to go troubleshoot on site. I surely hope I won't have to send back components.

I added the components here, to maybe help you help me :)

should I take offer A (which pays &gt;= Googs) but is located in the Bay Area, and try to move to/apply to a company closer to my hometown after working full time?

or should I take offer B (googs) which is also in the Bay Area and try to convert to an office near my hometown afterwards?

Here is the situation: My dad oves me 80.000 dkkr and he denies and lies and say he doesn't have the money. 
But part of it is maybe my own fault for being naive. 

See: My father decided to give both me and my sister 50.000 tax-free each year. Last year I said no thanks. Now I want it back and he denies and says he gave equally. I KNOW this is false or I would be able to see it on my bank. Before my mother died, she said that I should not have paid for my own trip overseas (30.000 dkrr for learning experience). While my mother was dying, my sister asked my mother for a free new mac (16.000) . And my sister has always been older, more lucrative and emotional and verbally dominant than me. Or at least this is how I feel. My mother died. Me my father and my sister sat down with some person who might or might not have been the family lawyer. I naively said that we should give everything to my dad because of less tax.. I also moved home because my dad and I had a verbal agreement that we would help each other out. The thing I never realized before two years later, is that that person might only have been representing my dad. Secretly going through my mothers computer, I found a .pdf. it was a draft for her will written by a female lawyer. It said that should my father have it all then he would have to give both me and my sister 500.000 each and her invested money should be split in three. I asked some free lawyer (students!?) About this and theysidthat since that will was not final it was useless. What sends chills down my spine is the thought that, bring my mothers rigt hand you know driving her around everywhere in wheelchair, my father might have pressured her to not finish that will. My father never talked to us about that will draft. I sat down and talked with him asking casually if he had writren a will and if I should do it and he said no. I asked him if he knew of a will of my mother. He said no. I then showed him the drafts for that will and he admitted that he was there to write the will with her.  

My sister might have claimed her part and she and my dad now collaborate to keep me in the dark. Before I moved home my dad would drive my sister everywhere and lend her the second car. The week I moved home my dad sold the second car. I had made verbal plans with him for weekly food preparation and shopping lists. Now he insists on buying the cheapest possible food. Now he eats it himself abd has always been kind of frugal. Except that now he goes swiming twice a week and expensive needle doctor (sorry I forgot the name) thrice a week. When I ask him to pay my cheap dental bill because my money is really tight, he denies. 
I hate to beg and I know her owes me money. I cannot pressure because then he might just give my sister all his money. My sister is certainly playing her part, trying to pair her internships boss with my dad. 
Half a year ago I was worried sick about my fathers double heart surgery. I helped talk him out of suicide and now I just feel like I dont have a reason to care for him at all. It haunts me because that is not who I am. But I also do not want to be played for a fool.

A part of me alsp wants hime to pay for the three years age difference between me and my sister. When she was young she went on internships to spaind and several other countries. I know that to many of you this will be considered extreme, so I am willing to let that slide if I can get he 80.000. Or meybe even te 580.000. But I feel i will not be able to put this pressure on him successfully. And I fear he will not give me and then not give my sister. This is where its at. 

I could try to contact the female lawyer to see if a finished will document has been made. But in case this lawyer is now hired by my dad, she might be legally required to inform him. The lawyers I asked said I should let this slide. I nodded it of and said that he was a good dad. He kind of is since he was willing to help me fix something etc. But when it comes to big money, he is totally different. And I do not feel that I have to hold on to either my sister or my dad. Me and my sister always fights so i blocked her on facebook.

His latest negligance to mention the will draft, initial denial of the will draft, failing to pay the gift out to me that he gave my sister, not following through on my mother will to pay for my trip( I even have it on recording). Selling a car as soon as I move home while previously driving my sister everywhere and lending it to her  with he, himself paying for repairs. Given all this he stands in very bad light from my point of view. To top it off, now whenever we have guests he shittalks me. And some recordings I have of him and his guests without me being present reveals just how much he trash talks me witl things that are not true, and twisted realities. My strategy so far has been not giving him an audience by me not being present.

What could I do?"

Warum wird plötzlich snapchat als Plattform gepusht, obwohl die Plattform doch gar nicht mit Hashtags arbeitet?! Und seit wann gibt es das überhaupt bei RBTV? Kennt sich irgendwer in diesem neuen geilen Internetsender überhaupt mit Snapchat aus? Oder nicht? Oder doch oder nicht? Oder benutzen wir es, weil es hip und jung ist? 

Heißt nun das neue Format ""Level zwei"" , oder ist es doch nur ein Hashtag KOMMA welches unabhängig davon erstellt wurde? Oder benutzen wir das nur, um Aufsehen zu erregen und reiben euch hier unsere absolut geile Guerilla-Marketing-Strategie unter die Nasen? Oder doch nicht oder doch? 
Was hat ein Timpingbert damit zu tun, und warum hast du eine Maske auf? 

Um zumindest etwas zu helfen, kann an dieser Stelle verraten werden: Nein, der Twitter-Account gleichen Namnes gehört nicht uns. Warum einige Bohnen diesem folgen, ist auch bei uns ein Mysterium ;) liegt aber wahrscheinlich einfach daran, dass es intern noch nicht kommuniziert wurde, was es damit auf sich hat, haha. 

Während auf der einen Seite nämlich geraten wird, entsetzt sich die andere: Wird TheraThiel abgesetzt? Spoiler: Die Entscheidung ist noch unklar. 
Spoiler Spoiler: es wird nicht wieder kommen, da selbst, wenn Interesse der Community besteht, niemals Michael Thiel wieder Bock hätte, sich für lau da hin zu setzen. 

Aber was ist passiert? 
Während der zweiwöchentlichen Sendung Q&amp;A passiert Anja und Timo ein Malheur: Es wird gesagt, dass TheraThiel 2016 definitiv nicht zurückkommen wird und es auch für danach schlecht aussehen könnte. Es wird zudem gesagt, dass das Fordern danach ein Running Gag sei und  ein Gefühl bei der Redaktionsleiterin vorhanden ist, dass nicht wirklich Interesse am Format besteht. 

Gerade der zweite Teil sorgt für Verärgerung, äh.. Verunsicherung, bei Fans und bei Michael Thiel persönlich, der sich nun per Twitter und YouTube-Kommentar zu Wort meldet, obwohl er weiß, was er damit anrichtet - ein Stein fällt auf den anderen und fertig ist das Aufhebens. (Was auch immer das sein mag. Aber der Text musste fertig werden.) 

Die ganze Story gibt es hier. 

Um es kurz zu machen: Nein, TheraThiel wird nicht abgesetzt. Wie im Vorfeld mit Michael thiel besprochen werden wir vor allem anhand der Ergebnisse der  Contentanalyse, in der die Sendung nicht aufgelistet worden war, entscheiden, ob und wann es mit der Sendung weitergehen wird. Erste Worte dazu gibt es im MoinMoin am Mittwoch mit Budi und Simon, also frisch, nachdem ihr aufgewacht seid, ihr Schäfchen. 
Goil, Leude, da wird n bisschen gesnackt und es gibt Infos. Fantastisch! Also, falls Budi nicht auf einem Mediapanel weilt und Simon sich auf Twitter um Kopf und Kragen schreibt. Dann. Ansonsten freut euch auf Dean, der mit euch frühstückt! Er ist der Hund von Nasti, die einen Hund namens Dean hat. 

Und zu guter letzt: irgendwas mit Hearthstone. Voraussichtlich gibt es da was, aber wissen wir nicht nicht genau! 

Viel Glück an alle Teilnehmer! "

I would be doing iOS development again at Capital One, and Optum would be application development.

I am wondering which company would look better on a resume. How much I would learn is important, but I feel I will most likely learn the same amount at both companies. The pay is exactly the same.

I am a freshman, so I am trying to get as much experience as I can, and trying to make my resume look impressive so I can hopefully interview at many companies in the coming years.

Thanks!

Edit; I posted the other day asking a question about Optum, but I have spoken to the recruiter and figured out the details. There is a very high chance I will be doing software development.

5cwrme,26,2016-11-14,"If anyone can congratulate me for getting a job, I would appriciate it right now",the-healthy-one,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/5cwrme/if_anyone_can_congratulate_me_for_getting_a_job_i/,"I’m probably going to get hired tomorrow, after a long period of unemployment. It’s for a limited time, but if I manage to fulfill some criteria that I’m sure I can manage then it will be for longer. I’m know it’s not all a done deal yet, but I’m just so relieved. I’ve been unemployed for a long time and not doing well financially at all. Even just three months would be wonderful. I feel this mix of relief and hope, maybe even a little proud, or I did before talking to my mum.

My mum is supportive of me and have worried about my financial situation a lot. I spoke to her and in the following conversation got told that whilst this is good not to take out anything in advance, that I need to work harder to prove myself as I haven’t manage to really impress my boss during my two month internship, that I need to start exercising again which has fallen to the side the last few months as I’ve been rather busy, and that I need to start paying of my debts. She isn’t wrong but it’s not exactly what I wanted to hear five minutes after getting what I thought is some really good news.

She also made some suggestions for activities I could do with my sister and dad to be supportive of them. She offered to help pay for it and made sure it was things I enjoy, which is extremely nice and I appreciate it. But it’s also more responsibility for me, which I’m currently struggling with to find a healthy balance as I think I might be taking on to much responsibility.

So to recap; it’s good that I might be getting employed tomorrow but I must remember that I haven’t done all that good at my work yet and to try harder. Also remember be more healthy, my financial responsibilities, and my family responsibilities. My mother is supportive of me, but she is dealing with a lot of stress herself and is sick too (bronchitis) so she isn’t so positive right now.

I just wanted a “good job” or “congratulations”. I feel like an idiot for thinking that now. There’s too much shit going on for that right now. I know my family loves me and don’t want me to be stressed out, but sometimes I feel like I get lost in everyone else’s illnesses.

My sister has Huntingtons and it’s starting to affect her both physically and mentally, and she is really struggling with that. My dad got diagnoses with liver cancer two weeks ago, and there is really nothing to be done about it. My grandmother had stroke this summer and lost all ability to speak, and whilst she has a great care at home still needs some support and help. My uncle is an alcoholic and don’t really want anything to do with anyone. My mum is healthy (cancer free for two years) but she is taking a lot of responsibility for caring for everyone, including me. I feel like I have to be there for everyone and can’t ask for much support myself. My mum tries to be there for me, but like I wrote she has a lot to deal with herself and I can’t put it all on her. So sometimes I really don’t feel like I have anyone to turn to when I’m upset or sad. I’ve gotten used to just carry it myself.

I just wanted to be a happy that I might get hired tomorrow, not a list of responsibilities and a “try harder”. I just feel tired now. Like there is so much to do but I’m never going to be able to do all of it or do it well. Even getting hired isn’t a really happy news but just new possibility for failure.

But I want to be proud. If anyone can give me a “hey, good on you for (possibly) getting a job” I would really appreciate it."
5cwsbl,0,2016-11-14,Seeking advice on what to expect if I graduate in a year.,proofslank,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5cwsbl/seeking_advice_on_what_to_expect_if_i_graduate_in/,"Okay so I am in college, and have about a year of school left if I max out on my credits/semester. I will be graduating with about 20,000 dollars of debt. 
    I spent about 4 years at a local CC, and then transferred to a local uni. I will  need about 46 more credits at about $400/cr to finish my BS. So if  I shove all of my credits into the upcoming semesters  can complete it around fall 2017.  
   This will result in me not using spring 2018 s federal  loans and grants which I estimate should be about 5100 in total, 1000$ grant and 4000 loans. So I will have to take out a private loan for about 9000$ total.
    I am currently trying to figure out if I should graduate fall 2017 or add on that extra semester and graduate in spring 2018. So I am trying to figure out the advantages over both options. I was looking for any sort of information I might be missing.







**Graduating 2017**

* Out earlier to find a job

* Means I will take out about 9000$ in private loans

* I want to graduate after 5yr total spent instead of six( this rates highly for me)

* I will lose about 1000$ in pell grant

* I will have to pay back my loans sooner




**Graduating 2018**

* I will be able to use my federal loans so I only need about 4000$ -in private/family loans

* I can spread out classes more

* Technically I will have one more semester to pick up an internship with that college student sheen on me. One  in college and one post graduation

* I  will technically have more time to pay back my loans 







Also I have never taken out a private loan and am not sure of the procedure. I have a credit score of about 690 - 726  according to credit karma.

* I would like a loan with terms like the federal one is that a reasonable expectation

* To me they seem kind of sketchy

* Should I take out multiple ones to cover whatever Is not covered by federal aid for the semesters, or should I just take on out for whatever I expect my total amount is.





I plan on focus firing my school debt  down as soon as I can. Currently working to pay my monthly bills, but I am looking into making more money while in school so I can start paying on
my loans. I have been reading about personal fin. on the  sub-reddit, and took a personal finance class so I think I can handle myself with my day to day finances.


* How can I estimate my monthly payments with these loans?


Any advice or suggestion would be appreciated. "

So anyways, I want to find a job so I can stay in town and work remotely. Finding a local job would be hard because I'm in Amherst MA and there aren't many companies around here. I'm talking to a bunch of companies but they're all Boston based which is too far to commute to from here.

So, where should I apply to find a job where I can work remotely.
In a previous internship I worked from home 3 days a week and in the office 2 days a week so I've had experience working from home before.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I love you all."

i stopped smoking and fapping about 50 days ago and im really happy about my streak, however, I was thinking that my main problem might be an internet addiction. I honestly could not imagine living without the internet. Im doing an internship right now, I medidate, I go running and I work out, however I still spend a lot of time on the internet, watching videos, movies, browsing reddit or twitter, facebook or different boards. 
I dont think that I could completely cut the internet out of my life, mainly because I need to check emails, need to use it when writing turn papers for university and so on.
Do you know anyone who successfully fought this addiction or have you been able to (mostly) cut it out of your life?
what advice would you give me?
limit internet use to 1 hour a day? I couldnt even watch movies anymore then lol :D
or even stop using it completely, meaning that I only use when I actually need to use it?

5cx49p,2,2016-11-14,What does it mean when a woman leans into you while walking on the street? Is it a reliable sign that she likes you? [xpost /r/seduction],tiagocsantos,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5cx49p/what_does_it_mean_when_a_woman_leans_into_you/,"This happened to me on two separate occasions:

* The first time we were 22 yo she we were classmates for three years although we had only started being close (going out together in a group of friends around once per week) for the last two months. One night all our friends except us were further ahead in the sidewalk and so we were alone talking to each other for like one minute. At that point she leans into me, shoulder to shoulder making a constant pressure. I was not sure I was walking straight, so I looked ahead. I had the road on my side and was on the border of the sidewalk so I became pretty sure she was leaning on me. She did this for like half a minute. I think I was talking about myself at that point but I am not sure. We were both single and this was probably the last time we saw each other before summer vacation.

* The same thing happened to me with a coworker (different girl), we were 25 yo. This time though, she had a boyfriend and I knew it. This second time it wasn't as obvious because we were on a very large sidewalk (around 20 meters across). It really felt like she was interested into me, like the previous experience but it's weird because she had a boyfriend. We knew each other for a month (when I started the internship) during which we spent the day in the same office room and lunched together with other 5 people from the company. This was her last day at work.

**TL;DR** These experiences make me a bit anxious because I don't know how to react. It's confusing because one of them was in a relationship and the other wasn't. I really looks like she is expressing that she likes me but it could just be that she is interested in the conversation. Have you had similar experiences? 

EDIT: It was hot in both situations (around 30 Celsius or 86 Fahrenheit) and they were hot."

I'm looking a few years down the road when my job ""ends"" and I have to find something else to do, and have been self teaching myself CS basics and programming languages in my spare time.

I see tons of posts about doing internships, but how do you apply and convince someone you have the know how to do a job you weren't ""officially trained for"" (i.e. no CS degree). Quitting my job to pursue an unpaid (or even low paying) internship in order to get a foot in the door is not really an option, so what are the best path(s) forward?

5cx6l5,16,2016-11-14,Billy Mills 10k,finallyransub17,AdvancedRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5cx6l5/billy_mills_10k/,"### Race information
* **What?** Billy Mills 10K
* **When?** 11/12/2016
* **How far?** 6.2 Miles
* **Website?** [race website goes here]

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |Top 3 | *??* |
| B |Break 37:00 | *??* |
| C |Sub 6 min. Pace | *??* |

### Training
The race was 4 weeks after my marathon attempt at KC, so I took 1 week completely off, one week of only easy runs, and then added a tempo and some 400m repeats the next week to get some speed in my legs. The week leading up to the race I did a 2x2mile run with the second 2 mile in 11:30, leaving me confident in my ability to hold sub 6:00 pace over a 10k.

### Pre-race
The night before the race was the first time it's dipped below freezing here, so I knew it would be a cold one. I made sure to get adequately warmed up and tried to figure out how the footing would be (since this was run on a cross country course). Didn't take my sweats and jacket off until 3 minutes before the start. Fortunately there was no wind and the sun was out, so 35 degrees felt warmer than it actually was. I raced in running shorts, a singlet, hat and gloves, and felt comfortable temperature wise the whole time. Billy Mills was actually there in person to start the race and congratulate everyone in person at the finish line! It was pretty sweet to meet the most recent American Olympic 10,000m Gold medalist, and he seemed like a very down-to-earth person.

### Race strategy
My strategy was simple: go out with the leaders and if they're running too hard, back off to run my own race. If not, stick with them and move with a mile to go in attempt to win. There was a $100 gift card for 1st, $50 for 2nd, and $25 for 3rd.

### Race
Billy Mills fires the air horn, and we're off, immediately, two other people and I go to the front. There's white singlet and black singlet and I tuck in behind in third. We go through the first mile in 5:29. I feel comfortable, but I know I can't hold this pace for the whole race, nevertheless, I decide it will feel easier to run with people than go it alone, so I tuck in and hope I don't have a massive blow-up. After the first mile, there is a nice U turn and I'm able to see that we already have a comfortable 15 second gap on 4th place. I'm confident that I will be top 3. Midway through mile 2, I make a move and go into second, sitting behind white singlet. It's reassuring for me to hear people breathing hard around me because it gives me confidence that I'm not out of my league. I can hear black singlet behind me and he's breathing is at least as hard as mine. The footing on the course was mostly good, but there were a few gravel sections and since my old cross country spikes are pretty torn up, the dew on the grass has soaked my shoes, making my feet kind of cold. I basically hoped there wouldn't be any big holes to roll my ankle in. Mile two goes by in 5:46 and I'm glad I stayed with the group. Mile three is uneventful as we weave though a deserted field and loop back towards the limited spectators 5:47. I probably crossed 5k in about 17:35, which I'm pretty happy with, but there were no offical splits so that's my best guess. At this point I'm feeling pretty good about my chances of cracking my pr of 35:57. But then came mile 4. Nothing was special about the course, but at this point I could feel my asthma begin to act up. My chest slowly tightened and I knew things could get ugly. I tried to stay relaxed, but was worried about what the next 2 miles might hold 5:59. Just before mile 4, black singlet passed me and I immediately lost contact with both of them as they gapped me by about 15 yards. I knew my chance at winning was out the window, but I was more concerned about keeping my breathing under control and trying to stay relaxed. Mile 5 goes by in 6:06 ( I didn't check this split during the race and I'm surprised it was this fast). I was pretty sure I could hold on for one more mile, but every breath was a struggle (for those who don't have asthma, it feels like trying to breath with a 10 pound weight on top of your chest), not impossible, but much less efficient than normal breathing. I hit mile 6 in 6:26 avoiding total meltdown. The last .2 were slightly uphill to the finish, but I gave my best effort and managed 1:33 (watch had it at .25 which is weird since all my other splits came slightly after the mile markers on the course, including mile 6). As I ""sprinted"" toward the finish, I saw the clock tick past 59 to :00 and realized I wouldn't make sub 37, however I did clock a 37:05, good enough for 3rd place and sub 6 min/overall!

### Post-race
Wheezed my way through the finishing chute, shook hands with Billy Mills, congratulated 1st and 2nd place and met my fiance who was waiting for me. She commented on how bad I looked in the last mile and I told her about my asthma struggles. Overall I'm happy with the effort, although it's hard to not think about what might've been if my asthma hadn't acted up (I should mention that I stopped taking my daily inhaler about a year and a half ago, because I wasn't pumped about potentially negative long-term side effects. I have occasional trouble with asthma during tempo runs or hard intervals, but I'm willing to live with it if I can avoid medication). I think I would have had a good chance at winning. Although I haven't seen official results, I was only 20-30 seconds back at the finish line, and maybe could have gotten close to my pr. 

### What's next?
I'm going to go back into a base building phase with easy milage, at least until early December. I'm considering to the Topeka to Auburn Half Marathon in January, and want to take a whack at 1:20. Other than that, I would love to get redemption in the marathon. I'm still considering the Eisenhower marathon in April, but I'm really worried that my spring internship in public accounting will not allow me enough time to train for it. Other than that, I'm looking to stay injury free and continue to build up strength for next year and a shot at Boston 2018.

5cxc3j,2,2016-11-14,Is there any good way to tell your ex that you miss her?,HallersTenacity,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5cxc3j/is_there_any_good_way_to_tell_your_ex_that_you/,"Hey there guys - Im a senior in college and about 4 months ago me and my ex girlfriend (junior at same school) split ways. We had been together for two years.

The major reason we ended it was because there want enough communication. We always would have the best time when we were together - even the dinner we had right before we broke up was amazing, we both had so much fun - but when we were apart things seemed a bit off.

I was fine for the first few months. I had a great internship that soaked up my attention for the remainder of the summer and then when I got back to school I was always doing things with friends and generally didn't even think about it that much. Me and my ex met twice for lunch to catch up but beyond that there hasnt been any contact. I tried to get over her by quitting contact entirely. I dont even see her walking around campus (she is in a completely different department).

Now I am a mess. I cant go to bed unless I'm high or fucked up because I cant get her out of my head. Id compare it to anxiety attacks - I regret every day that I didnt fight harder for the relationship and I feel that if we had pushed through we would still be together. I've been with a few other girls since then but I still have these feelings. I think I still love her, but I dont know if that's just strong emotions talking.

I have also been trying to improve myself since we split - not for her, but because I was trying to busy myself and not think about the breakup. I've been going to the gym 3 times a week and honestly am in the best shape of my life, I'm co-president of two clubs inducing the school's hockey team, among other things...

So - **Is there any good way to tell her this?** I am scared that she has completely moved on and has no feelings left, but is it still worth it to try? I have been considering asking her out to dinner somewhere nearby and telling her that I'm still not over her, but I feel that would make me look weak in her eyes. 

I know the general advice here is to get over her and keep pushing through. I've tried that for the last 4 months and recently it has gotten a lot worse. Is there anyone out there who can share some advice on how to even try to get her back? If the wisdom is still ""forget her"" - how?"

5cxvgo,1,2016-11-14,University dropout with a trust fund: unmotivated and depressed,Tp333,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5cxvgo/university_dropout_with_a_trust_fund_unmotivated/,"Surprised that I'm even writing this. Because I am SO unmotivated. It's 3 PM on a Monday and I just woke up. I'm a 22 year old unemployed female university dropout with no plans for my future or even getting employment.  You would think that I'd get motivated from others constantly asking me about my ""job hunt"". But I'm so ashamed of admitting my laziness that I lie to them and say I have a bunch of interviews to go to etc. I then get anxiety over lying to them. (Parents, friends) . I also feel like I'm isolating myself from my loved ones because I don't want them asking me questions about my future/ don't want to lie to them so I just avoid encountering them in general. (Not eating dinner with my dad anymore because he keeps pestering me and I don't want to admit that I'm an unmotivated person because he would associate that with ungratefulness) 

Usually for me I get motivated if there is a purpose but lately I'm having trouble waking up early because there is no purpose. I have no where to go and I have no motivation to find anywhere to go. I only wake up early if I make plans with someone and someone is counting on me being there early. 

I don't have a job and I'm unmotivated to get one because I have $$$ in my trust fund. I stopped going to the gym because the body acceptance movement really spoke to me. I dropped out of university because good grades weren't enough of a reason to motivate me to study for exams so I ended up failing and just dropping out entirely. I bought a book to inspire me to get motivated but I can't even bring myself to read it. (It's an ebook and on my iPad so every few pages I get distracted by YouTube/other apps on my iPad). After much procrastinating, I finally took driving school after 2 years. I completed the in class portion but I can't even get motivated to book my in car driving lessons which I've already paid for (out of the money from my trust fund). 

Even this past summer I got an internship (out of luck), and I had no motivation to complete the tasks at the job at hand. I did them hesitantly (after hours of procrastinating on social media at work). The moment my boss would leave the office, I'd go back to social media and YouTube etc. I feel like I've been like this since high school, and sometimes I think I might have ADHD. Or something. 

I remember in university, when I had readings to do for 3 classes. I found it incredibly difficult to finish one reading and then go on to the next, instead I went back and fourth between my 3 readings/textbooks till I finished them all at the same time by multitasking. In short: I get bored if I do the same task for a long time at once. I need a distraction. Another example: my mom asks me to unload the dishwasher. Halfway through unloading the dishwasher, I  feel the urge to wipe the countertops clean and ""distract myself"" and then I go back to the original task at hand which was unloading the damn dishwasher. 

I have been told by previous bosses and teachers that I should ""work on my listening skills."" I try my best but sometimes perhaps I don't have the patience to read through instructions that I just assume things and do them without proper listening/ instructions. And every single time i have to take a test/exam , for as long as I can remember, it would take me MUCH longer than my peers to finish, I'd always be asking for extra time to complete the test.  Do I have an undiagnosed learning disability? I don't know. 

Beforehand, I used to make excuses and blame my circumstances for my unmotivated laziness. I blamed the gym for being too far away as an excuse that I didn't work out. But this past summer I lived in a fancy new condo with a high class gym inside of it and I did not step foot in it once. I was THAT unmotivated. That's when I realized that my circumstances were NOT the problem. I could have the best of the best of the best and STILL be an unmotivated sloth. 

In terms of work/school, I used to think that the reason I was unmotivated was because I didn't find my ""passion"". So I spent two years searching for my ""passion"" and I found it. Now I know what I love, I know what I need to do, yet I'm still unmotivated to do those things and work towards goals. 

I have ""big plans"" for my future and I know what I want for myself but I have no motivation to take the steps needed to follow through. 

I don't know if I'd say that I'm depressed because I am happy. Despite some discontentment with my laziness, I am reasonably happy. However, I've read symptoms of depression.

These are the ones that apply to me:
-Insomnia
-Increase in appetite 
-Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that aren't your responsibility
-Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things

That being said, I'm a fairly optimistic person and try not to let those symptoms bother me from being ""happy"" or doing things that make me happy (ie staying up till 4 AM binge watching Netflix and sleeping in and repeating the cycle all over again). I guess I'm happy because I'm finally doing ""whatever I want"" except I'm not happy doing this ""whatever I want"". Sometimes I don't even have enough patience to sit through an entire episode, so I scroll through Instagram while it's playing in the background. I always joke that I don't have the attention span to sit through super long movies which is why I avoid them. 

When I ask my friends to describe me, they'd say hyper and creative. And I agree with them. I'm 22 but act childish most of the time/ make inappropriate jokes. I also get bursts of creativity which motivates me to do the creative thing occasionally. 

I want structure in my life, I want a job that gives me purpose to wake up every morning, I want to be motivated to do things at the job, I want routine (despite originally saying 9-5 sucks), I want to feel motivated to apply and seek out the job that I want. 

I have all these grand plans for my future and what I want to do and where I want to go and when I see someone else (friends of mine) doing those things on social media I get jealous, insecure, self hatred consumes me ex: ""THAT WAS MY IDEA FIRST UHHHH"",  and feelings of extreme FOMO.

World of Reddit: how do I get motivated? How do I find purpose ? Can you be depressed and happy at the same time? Do I have ADHD? What's wrong with me? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I would go to a therapist but I'm paranoid/afraid that if I reveal that I have a trust fund, they might take advantage of vulnerable rich unmotivated me. "
5cxwma,6,2016-11-14,CS vs. Business,guayaquilguava,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5cxwma/cs_vs_business/,"So I will be starting at a new college in the spring (freshman), and I would like to study either Computer Science or Business. However, I'm really, really unsure of which one I should choose. If anyone could please give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

Here are some things about me:

--I enjoy programming, especially web development. UX Design also seems really interesting to me.

--I've learned how to program mostly through self-teaching and Coursera, and it's my preferred way to learn about CS-related topics.

--I'm fairly good at math and I enjoy it.

--I did an internship at a software company and I hated the work environment. I really didn't like that I sat at a desk and coded for hours on end while barely interacting with others. I don't see myself working at a place like that.

--The school I'm starting at has no web development or UX electives. I'm not particularly interested in learning about data structures, algorithms, etc, but maybe that's because I don't know much about them.

--I dropped out from another school recently due to depression (I had been studying CivE). My workload was preventing me from pursuing my non-academic interests and that took a big toll on me. I don't want to relive that experience, unless I'm extremely interested in what I'm studying. 

--My eventual goal is to become an entrepreneur. I see myself working as the builder of the machine rather than a part of it.

--I'm afraid that I won't be able to find a job if I study business with, say, a focus on MIS. CS has way more job opportunities, especially for web devs.

--I don't know very much about business and so I can't say for sure if I will like studying it. Same with the work environment; I don't know if it will be different from the one I had with my internship.

--Parents would much rather me study CS over business, but my personal happiness is more important to me.

--Part of me wants to study CS just because it's considered a ""smart"" degree, whereas business is considered to be not so ""smart."" This is due to insecurity.

Any and all advice is appreciated greatly. Thanks!"

I'm specifically looking for an unpaid internship position right now and they don't seem to be as popular as I'd hoped. I was approached by a few recruiters on Linkedin over the past couple weeks, and it seems like people are shopping around getting ready for 2017, but no one seems interested in humoring a conversation about free labor which is confusing to me. I've worked in a lot of different fields and right now I only know what it's like to build websites, I have no idea what an actual industry job would entail and I'd like a peek at what a 9-5 dev job for a company would feel like. Can anyone with an HR perspective give me any insight regarding an approach for a developer internship? Is imposter syndrome so rampant that everyone is terrified at the idea of a newbie looking over their shoulders? I feel like there's a knowledge gap here but any time I try to find relevant information online I always end up at the same sites and articles spouting the usual ""project get side-social hackathons, hot languages! Very code! Much dank!"". Is there any way I can get back into a daily environment where I can code and discuss code with peers right now, rather than just relentlessly work on side projects by myself?


Thank you for any advice and suggestions, I appreciate you taking the time.


edit1: I forgot to add that I live in the middle of nowhere, so the nearest code meetups for me are a 3-4hr round trip. I can't financially justify doing that more than once a week ;("

It's called Folks of Fort Collins.  We went out into the community and interviewed over a dozen different people experiencing homelessness in town to learn more about their experiences.  We've taken parts of the interviews as well as various pictures we took to capture these people ""in the moment"" to help facilitate a conversation on homelessness in our community. 

The exhibit is open this Wednesday through Saturday (the 16th through the 19th).

The plan was to pay my bills by selling on eBay, but so far I've made very little money there because I've been inconsistent with listing things (anxiety &amp; depression don't really mix well with being self-employed). I'm starting to feel a little better now and I'm trying to pick up the pieces, but I have three credit cards and all of them are long past due. 

* **Card 1** - Current balance is about $1200, last payment was in July (for my June statement), and they have closed my account. I received a letter from Allied Interstate about it being in collections, but on the Chase website it says that my minimum payment to bring my account up to date is about $300, due in early December.
* **Card 2** - Current balance is about $600 and my last payment was in early September (for my August balance, included late fees since I'd missed a couple of months). I received a letter from Allied Interstate, but the account is still open and the Chase website says $150 by the end of the month will bring it up to date.
* **Card 3** is a store-specific card with a balance of $300. My last payment was in August and the website says $100 by the end of the week will bring it up to date. 

I currently have about $25 to my name after scraping together the money to pay my car insurance. I'm trying to sell things quickly on eBay, but getting together $100 by the end of the week seems unlikely (though it *might* be possible) and $450 by the end of the month seems almost impossible. Even if I pay these amounts, I don't know if I can consistently make my monthly minimum payments right now. I know I really screwed up, but I want to fix this and I have no idea what to do. 

Some other info that might be relevant-

* **I own a house with my long-term boyfriend.** He's been able to cover the $400/month that I usually contribute to the house for a few months now, but money is getting much tighter and his car is probably going to need expensive repairs soon, which we don't have the money for.
* I'm going to be returning to school in 2017 to either work on my associate's or some IT certifications (being paid for by a county program that was recommended to me)
* I have no freaking clue what to do about my job situation. Torn between getting a part time job now or stepping up eBay and then trying to find an internship once I start school. My part time job options are somewhat limited since anything customer-facing isn't feasible and a lot of the behind-the-scenes jobs in the area are warehouse positions that I physically can't do (I can barely lift 50 pounds &amp; definitely couldn't do it all day). I also don't know whether an associate's or certs would be the better option to find employment.

I'm so confused right now. What do I do to fix this?"

Long story short, I currently have a full time job in retail sales in a technology company and am doing pretty well, but I hate my job and am starting school for an InfoSec degree in the Spring.  A few questions:

First, I plan on getting a 2 year and then transferring to finish a 4 year.  I've constantly heard that it's important to get a internship while at school in order to get job experience to start immediately after school.  How true is this, and how much would it hurt my career if I didn't, and stuck with my current full-time job till I get my degree?

Second, I have 4 specializations I can take, Cisco Certified Network Associate Security, Global Certified Windows Security Administrator, Redhat Certified Security Specialist, and High Technology Criminal Investigations.  In your opinion, which of these degrees offers the most job security, opportunity to get hired, and would pay the most?  Also, while Red Hat and Windows Administrator seems self explanatory, and I know a Cisco certification refers to networking and routers, I'm not sure how that refers specifically to InfoSec, I'm not 100% sure what the Criminal Investigations route would take me.   Anyone have any insight into either?  I know my college doesn't offer any certifications, they just prep you to take them.

Finally, anyone have any advice for an InfoSec degree and career, steps that you wish you had taken or just some insight into what I can expect?  I'm moderately versed in computers and have built several and done light IT here and there, but I've never had any education on it.

I am an aspiring iOS developer/software engineer who is seeking professional experience with an employer who can give me an opportunity to learn more about mobile/software development. I graduated in May, 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan (Go blue!) and have been struggling the past few months to get my foot in the door into the software industry. I've applied to several places with varying levels of success, but ultimately haven't been able to lock down on a full-time position yet.

I actually had two offers (one from my previous internship) straight out of college, but my growing aspiration to work in software development ultimately led me to turn both of them down. I understand that this is probably not the smartest idea, but I took the time over the summer after graduation to really build my portfolio with self-made mobile applications and brushing up on C++. I took a risk recently by taking what I had saved up to relocate to the bay area with a one-way ticket and am currently staying in Palo Alto.

I have had previous internships that worked with a lot of hardware components and testing, but I am trying my best to start my career path in the software industry. What got me into wanting to work with software is that the mobile/web applications many software based companies create directly influence and interact with the lives of users. I'm honestly not too picky as to what field in software I'd be working in, as I am interested in web, mobile, or any other areas of development. 

I have been learning Swift programming on my own, and I am familiar with C++ data structures and algorithms. I would love to learn more about databases and web development, but I have not had the opportunity to learn those skillsets as a Computer Engineer major. Ideally I would like to work for anyone who is willing to give me a chance even though I don't have much relevant professional experience in software. I would love to learn in a junior developer/engineer position where I can get professional experience and grow within the company. 

I can start immediately and am available to talk anytime. Thank you for your time. :)

5cymh4,1,2016-11-14,[Event] Brazilian Education Stimulus,PimentROBLOX,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/5cymh4/event_brazilian_education_stimulus/,"The federalization of education - at least temporarily - provides a platform for reform and simulus rarely witnessed in Brazil. The Ministry of Education and Innovation has over the last few months compiled several measures - inspired by individual state policies - to implement on a national level to ultimately benefit the Brazilian people and the economy on a long-term basis.


────────


##Educational reform and stimulus.


────────

###Gaining the support of teachers.


The backing of teachers shall be instrumental in these reforms. If not previously the case the teachers' wage shall be raised to 125% of the minimun wage at the minimun.

To stimulate teachers to stay employed as teachers and to create a more streamlined carear path the Teacher Career Law of Sao Paulo shall be made federal law. Tachers mvoe up the career ladder by earning specific grades in teacher assessments in content and pedagogy, aswell as have better than average attendance and continuity of employment at a single school - at least three years. The ""ladder"" has five levels with a 25% salary increase at each step, resulting in a 100% increase in salaries for teaches at the top level. Teachers can apply for promitions anually but can only be promoted every three years.


###Depoliticalization of principals.


Principals are often elected because of their political patronage. This is a backwards, outdated and unaceptable meassure in our modern society. Fair procedures for the election of principles shall be implemented, and they shall be based on expertise rather than political patronage.

Principals of low-preforming high schools shall be replaced by new principals who shall then work with instructors to improve the school's performance. A plan of action shall be submitted to the relavant education secretary of the state. Superintendents will monitor the progress of the plan of action on a bi-monthly basis.


###Improving teacher quality.


Another large issue is that many teachers themselves lack the needed education to adequately teach the Brazilian youth. Brazil's federal universities shall establish programmes to provide teachers with modern training.

In addition all ninth-grader teachers shall be trained in reading comprehension and vocabulary development to adress the issue of insufficient knowledge of Portuguese ninth-graders often have in Brazil.



###Making teachers accept responsibility for the school's preformance.


Each school shall have a school-wide incentive system that rewards everyone who helps meet the improvement standards.These incentives can vary greatly but the greatest incentive an individual can earn ranges from one to three months of salary on top of their standard salary. In addition the better a school preforms the more autonomy it is allocated.


###Reducing teacher absence.


In many states there is an serious issue of teacher absence. in some states teachers are allowed up to 40 days of leave for every 200 day schoolyear without a medical reason. This shall be massively scrutinized and reduced to a maximum of six to seven days without a medical reason.


###Learning At The Right Age.


The ""Learning At The Right Age"" programme shall be a cooperation with municipalities to ensure literacy and numeracy skills are learned in the first and second grade. This shall be done by encouraging effective, modern and intrusive curriculum, lesson plans, and implementing effeci tive assement structure structeed for lessons on those grades. An independent assesment company shall be hired to create a reading examination for every second-grader and these benchmark examinations shall be held annually.


A matching fund programme shall also be established. For every early childhood centre a municipality funds the state or Federal goverment wil fund another centre within the municipality. these requirements shall be lower for poorer municipalities.


###Better school organisation.


The size of schools grealty differs by area. To better use room and assets smaller schools will implement molti-age classrooms. Private sector experts will also be hired to help schools better organize themselves.


###Improving infrastructure.


Infrastructure is often outdated and proves problematic for both pupil and teacher. Improvements shall be made as follows:

* Construction of Laboratories and sport facilities where they are nonexistent.

* providing funds for the renovation and modernization of schools.

* Construction of new schools where they are badly needed due to for example overcapacity.

* Establishment of transparent building standards for schools.


###Counteracting droupouts.


High schools in Brazil shall be restructured into more competitive and intrusive entities. They shall offer modern academic and technical education and pupils shall have a greater freedom to choose for themselves by giving them the opportunity to choose vocational fields they wish to pursue.


Six-month internships shall be established together with local industry and funded by the Federal goverment. Pupils shall be paid half the minimun wage during the internship and after the internship is concluded pupils can choose to pursue higher education or work full-time. This also provides local industry with short-term cheap labour and cheaper on-the-spot training for potential future employees.


### Incentive programmes.


Each state shall be home to an incentive programme for the 150 best and worst preforming schools. The 150 best preforming schools shall be eligible for additional funding which can be spent however the school pleases, as long as it is in line with local Secretary of Education guidelines. To recieve teh last one-third of the funds said best-prefoming school will need to partner up with one of the worst-preforming schools to aid in said school's development. The 150 worst preforming schools shall be subject to extra state funding and aid to improve the educational quality.


###State meassuring System.


Each state shall have it's own Measuring System for schools which must Always be accesible for the public. School preformance shall be gaged in three categories based on the pupils: below basic and advanced. This in turn creates a more fair and comprehensive indication of how the school is preforming and helps to alleviate any falsehoods that might occur due to averages.


Schools shall be required to keep the public well informed to better help parents aid in their children's education. Schools shall produce report cards every two months on how students are preforming.


###Restructuring secretariats. 


In order for secretariats of education to be more responsive to schools restructuring is needed. They shall each create three branches to acomplish this: teaching and learning, management, and resources. Supply funds on a pupil-to-pupil basis shall be decentralized. Schools shall also be required to create plans on how they will spend the funds.



###Improving curiculum.


Two programmes shall be implmentented on a various levels to improve general curiculum quality:

* The PORANGa programme shall focus on creating curiculum which gives pupils a strong start and reduces repetitiveness. A focus shall be on creating strong basic sckills, work skill,s and citizenship skills.

* Each state shall have their own curiculum programme in the form of a STate Book filled with photos, historic text, poetry and other items of significance pretaining to the state to help students better connect with their culture.


* Curiculum shall be created for localized rural areas which will provide adequate educational material from early childhood through high school, and it shall include skills pretaining to the particular area to help pupils to survive and thrive in said area.



────────


These reforms are meant to bolster Brazilian education significantly and to provide a save platform from which education can eventually be returned to the State's responsibility instead of the Federal goverment. These reforms have all been proven in various states throughout Brazil and when combined provide a trully revolutionary and modern form of education for Brazil's future generation."

Now here's my problem...

I started playing bf1 about a month ago with no problems up until yesterday. When all the sudden my CPU was overclocking hard and attempting to pass 100%. For the life of God I have no idea why this is happening. It hits about 63* C. The game is unplayable and for the past 2 days I have been joining games idol in the back of the map attempting to pick advice off of the players. Intern, a guy told me to post on Reddit.

My CPU was always around 30-40% and the graphics are SLI so I never had an issue there always fine. Ran the game on Ultra all month no issues at all.

I need to lower my CPU % back to normal range &amp; I need to stop the icons from appearing in the corner of BF1 ( which is related to this issue).


Things that I have tried:

Installing GeForce Experience (which does nothing if u ask me).
Reduced quality to low (doesnt change anything).
Perfoverlay.drawfps 1 
""          ""          "" fps 0                (all that crap about fps in console didnt work)

My cpu won't go back down and I can't play the game till I figure out why! Someone please help!!!"

I am an aspiring iOS developer/software engineer who is seeking professional experience with an employer who can give me an opportunity to learn more about mobile/software development. I graduated in May, 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan (Go blue!) and have been struggling the past few months to get my foot in the door into the software industry. I've applied to several places with varying levels of success, but ultimately haven't been able to lock down on a full-time position yet.
I actually had two offers (one from my previous internship) straight out of college, but my growing aspiration to work in software development ultimately led me to turn both of them down. I understand that this is probably not the smartest idea, but I took the time over the summer after graduation to really build my portfolio with self-made mobile applications and brushing up on C++. I took a risk recently by taking what I had saved up to relocate to the bay area with a one-way ticket and am currently staying in Palo Alto.

I have had previous internships that worked with a lot of hardware components and testing, but I am trying my best to start my career path in the software industry. What got me into wanting to work with software is that the mobile/web applications many software based companies create directly influence and interact with the lives of users. I'm honestly not too picky as to what field in software I'd be working in, as I am interested in web, mobile, or any other areas of development.

I have been learning Swift programming on my own, and I am familiar with C++ data structures and algorithms. I would love to learn more about databases and web development, but I have not had the opportunity to learn those skillsets as a Computer Engineer major. Ideally I would like to work for anyone who is willing to give me a chance even though I don't have much relevant professional experience in software. I would love to learn in a junior developer/engineer position where I can get professional experience and grow within the company.
I can start immediately and am available to talk anytime. Thank you for your time. :)

5cz2d1,1,2016-11-14,"In an unpaid Internship w/ housing, not sure of legality (Oregon)",aninfinitedesign,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5cz2d1/in_an_unpaid_internship_w_housing_not_sure_of/,"Hey everyone,

Currently working in an intern position at a church in Oregon. I found a listing for it online around 2.5 months ago, and have now been here for around a month. They’re currently overhauling their program, and I was the last intern brought in under their previous internship format.  


The format of the internship, as advertised, was simple. I would work part time for the church, helping during weekly services, and aid with any needs during the week. In exchange, I would be provided with room and board from a host family within the church. When I arrived, it was a little different though – I would be staying in an “intern house” with other interns, and would be paying for my own food. The food situation has since been in negotiations, as someone made it an issue for the staff, so they’ve been working on providing me with a monthly stipend. 

The last few weeks have been a little rough and I’ve been contemplating leaving the program, and today during the staff meeting it was brought up that the head pastor wanted to modify the internship program to potentially give college credit. With these things in mind I started looking up some info on unpaid internships and what laws exist in regard to them, when I found a few sites with info that intrigued me.  

***

The first site I found was the [SBA’s guide](https://www.sba.gov/blogs/how-set-internship-program-your-small-business) to starting up an internship program. The parts that intrigued me are here: 

&gt;*‘Unpaid interns cannot do any work that contributes to a company's operations’* 

&gt;*‘Unpaid interns can shadow other employees and perform duties that don't have a business need’.* 

Right now I am working on projects that directly contribute to the company’s operations – I’m redesigning their website, am in charge of designing their new app, and run the visuals for nearly every service we hold.  

***

The next site I found was the National Council of Nonprofits’ [guide on Interns]( https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/interns-employee-or-volunteer). The section that interested me was the ‘Unintended consequences of interns’ portion, where it says: 

&gt;*‘if your nonprofit considers its interns ""volunteers,"" but pays them a ""stipend,"" there could be unintended negative consequences. The stipend may cause the Department of Labor to classify the intern as an employee, creating the obligation to pay the intern at least minimum wage and back taxes.’*

as well as

&gt;*’On the other hand, it may be appropriate to treat the intern as a ""trainee"" – relieving the nonprofit of paying minimum wage, but raising the need to document carefully how the internship primarily benefits the intern -- not the nonprofit.’*

From my current situation, I’m not getting either. There is no definable or dependable stipend just yet, and from the discussions I’ve had with some of the staff, there is no curriculum for myself or for other interns to follow for our skill sets. Right now I am just doing task work for the church, getting things done for them better than they could do themselves.  

***

From there I looked up the Oregon.gov [FAQ page]( https://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_interns.aspx) on interns, employees, and trainees, finding that: 

&gt;*‘Students are considered employees and their work covered by the FLSA if: 
1. They provide essential services to the employer; or
2. They are working in a position where someone is normally paid; or
3. There is a history of paying someone to do the same or similar work; or
4. Other people are currently paid for the same or similar work.’*

Right now I am providing this church with design services I would charge other companies hundreds for (I am a freelance graphic designer when I’m not doing work for the internship). I feel confident in saying there are likely other churches with individuals getting paid to do what I do now (designing and running graphics and media for that organization), especially considering I applied for such a position before taking this internship. 

***

A few other notes, though they probably aren't needed – they are currently revamping the program to where you pay $5000 before entering the internship to help cover your food expenses for the year. There is typically a few different types of interns – ranging from tech/media (what I am) to worship, youth and children’s ministries. None seem to have a defined curriculum from what I've heard from other interns.

So I’m not sure what to do. I’m probably going to leave this internship due to personal differences, but given my (admittedly rudimentary) research on everything, I’m not sure about the legality of some aspects of this internship. Maybe I’m just looking for more of a reason to be pissed at them, who knows. Just figured I’d see what everyone here thinks.


tl;dr – I’m working as an unpaid graphic design intern for a church being provided free housing, there’s no curriculum for me to follow, and I’m essentially working as an employee, is this legal?"
5cz3jo,3,2016-11-14,Multiple Angular 2 Apps / Builds / Angular-CLI Question,fzeroio,Angular2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/5cz3jo/multiple_angular_2_apps_builds_angularcli_question/,"I've spent a few hours now trying to figure this out and im not really getting anywhere.

We have a large Rails application, with most pages using some form of Angular 1, how ever it is not a SPA.  Pages with common entities are typically their own Angular app, but when you navigate to another area of the site, it will load that pages specific Angular app.    

Some pages will have no Angular at all, and it will just be a simple Rails rendered page. Like a user edit page where by there was nothing to gain by ""Angularizing"" the page

This allows us to separate our code into manageable chunks that teams can own and also ensures that when an intern breaks a page somehow others are not affected.  We like this approach and its one of the main reasons we chose angular over ember a few years back.

Im now looking into Angular 2 and I simply cannot figure out how we would achieve the same result.  Every tutorial, book and article seems to refer to a singular app with multiple components / modules.   The Angular CLI tool bundles everything into a single bundle file too, which would be enormous in our case.    This also makes no sense for us as some pages are very small and light and use very little angular, but it would need to load the bundle of the entire site.

So, what am I missing here.. im pretty sure theres something I'm just not seeing.   How would I go about building multiple smaller apps that can be loaded on a per page basis but use the same build system?

Im looking to do an ng build --prod and have it compile a series of JS files,  maybe a core file for the library thats included globally, but then separate files for the per page apps that contain just app code.   These would just be loaded into the Rails view for that particular page (of group of pages)

Really hoping someone can point me in the right direction here, this could be a brick wall for us otherwise.

I'm going in for an interview for an internship at a CPA firm, and after speaking with HR, it is my understanding that the interview process will be 2 hours long.

1 hour will be the interview with HR and I'll meet a few of the CPAs as well.

The 2nd hour will be an hour long accounting assessment. 

I'm not so nervous for the interview as I'm a pretty extroverted person who is quite comfortable in these types of situations, but I am nervous for the assessment. I was told it's not a pass/fail kind of assessment, but more to see what my strengths and weaknesses are to tailor my potential training. That being said, I know that it's going to be a factor in my hiring, as I'm sure they wouldn't want to hire someone they feel they need to babysit.

Do any of you have experience with these assessments, and know of any information that may be covered within the assessment? Is it appropriate to email HR and ask what types of questions may be covered? I have so many questions, and I'm just excited and nervous!

I am going to be interviewed either Wednesday or Thursday of this week so any quick replies will be much appreciated! I'm going to try and study as much as I can until the interview!

5czcsw,3,2016-11-14,This girl...,That_Fly_Guy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5czcsw/this_girl/,"Hey everyone...

I need some advice (obviously). I'm just gonna cut to the chase. **Here's my situation:**

In September, I started an internship at a law firm in my city. As it turns out, this other girl that I know is doing her internship at the courthouse which is nearby. This girl is really popular. Like I mean, really popular - as in she gets over 600 likes on Instagram popular hahaha. I, on the other hand, am not the most popular guy. I tend to keep somewhat of a private life, and I certainly do not have a large group of close friends. However, today we went just the two of us for lunch and things clicked (for me at least). I caught us gazing into each others eyes on multiple occasions and my heart pretty much felt in such a way that I haven't felt in a while. Now, I'm the type of guy that falls for a girl easily and always seems to get his heart broken at the end of the day (honest truth). When we arrived back at the courthouse, she thanked me for the lunch and I suggested that we should do this again. Without any objection (no pun intended), she said ""yes of course.""

**So here's where I'm at right now:**

Basically, I want to continue to pursue things with the ultimate goal of ending up in a relationship with her. Now the thing is, I got out of a year long relationship in early June, and I've moved on, but I've almost forgotten what its like to pursue a girl and start over. This is literally embarrassing for me. I'm in this state of confusion yet awe and I just need any advice I can get.

My entire life has been absolute Hell, although I feel bad even saying that considering how others have it worse. My parents don't know how to parent. My other two siblings suffer from depression, and my brother is now a paranoid schizophrenic who my parents try to forget about. Anytime I cry or voice discomfort, I'm hit or told I'm a schizo failure. From age seven I've had plans of killing myself. I was bullied so severely in school that I'm afraid of people, not even the principle would help me even as I was assaulted by people. I had horrible trauma, but I took theatre for five years to force myself to pretend to be happy. Now I'm charismatic and appear normal irl and it's tearing me apart. Everytime I try to talk to someone they leave or tell me to just go to therapy. I want to be successful, and I tried hard at hobbies and remembering things but could never be as good as others even if I tried for hours. I found out recently that I have a learning disability that affects my memory, sense of direction and mathematical ability so I learn at slower rates than others. People consistently tell me I don't try hard enough, and if I complain or cry at all they assume I'm instantly crazy when I'm trying as hard as I can. I'm consistently called useless and oversensitive, and overall I just can't see anything good about the world. My parents are separated, my mother twice divorced, my step father a murderer and in jail now and my father married to some foreign woman who he knocked up. The only person I had was my brother, and now he doesn't even remember my name. I'm bitter. I have a loving boyfriend, but even though he cares about me he's not able to talk to me and I'm consistently told by others that I'm incapable of being helped. I have an internship with an amazing company and my future doesn't look dark, but with how ignorant people are I just can't see myself salvaging happiness from anything. I hate the world. I hate everything it has to offer. I want to live in the wilderness away from people and their disgusting amounts of apathy towards everyone else. Nobody ever helped me, not even when I was being abused and now they want to pretend like it never happened to make me shut up. Nobody, not even friends will listen to me.
Sorry this is long."
5czmm0,11,2016-11-14,How do I tell my parents I want to change my major?,Trinityliger,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5czmm0/how_do_i_tell_my_parents_i_want_to_change_my_major/,"I'm currently a male college junior in my university's college of business. Currently, I'm in Information Systems and hate it. I'm taking the second java course and am currently struggling and completely apathetic to the subject. I'm also pursuing a Spanish minor as well.
Now Info Systems is particularly appealing because 1) It's a skills that's in demand and 2) the starting salary is relatively high among business majors.


Yet, not only am I mightily struggling and almost failing with my specialized coursework, but I find myself depressed at the thought of working around that field for the rest of my life.


The more I think about it, the more I want to switch into Human Resources. After serving as recruitment director for 2 student organizations, I've found myself to really enjoy that sort of work. In my intro to HR class, I was the only one who scored above 90% on the first midterm.


My school's HR program is somewhat small and doesn't have a cut-off GPA to apply. Since Human Resources is also in the College of Business, many of my core business pre-requisites are complete. I would simply need to fulfill the 21 specialization credit hours (after I barely pass this java course, I will have completed 6/24 specialization hours for Information Systems. I've heard that it's also a field in demand, but the starting salary is also a lot less generous. Grad school is also a necessity to move up higher in the work place.


And yet, after thinking about it for the past month and trying to decide what my minimum cost of living would look like upon graduation, I decided I'll learn to live with $12,000 less in starting salary for a field in which I feel competent. I know that I'll be in school for at least an extra semester. Many of the places that I've applied for internships have more Human Resource openings that IT positions. I planned on going to Grad School since I was in high school also. Should I switch into Human Resources, I will be on track to graduate on time. Since I've already taken out the money for another year, I know that a Spanish minor is definitely attainable as well. One look at my resume, and it's apparent that I have much more experience organizing and working with people, rather than with programming.


Now, here's the hard part: how do I tell my parents? They see me struggling, but they acknowledge that as long as I'm trying my best, they'll value my effort more than the letter grade or GPA. My mom constantly worries about me getting a job upon graduation. My dad always speaks of the importance of hard/technical skills (which HR definitely does NOT emphasize). Both of them are concerned with how much money I'll make out of the gate. I grew up in a typical Asian household, and my parents were already somewhat disappointed when I told them I didn't want to be an engineer or a doctor. I feel like if I were to switch into a degree like HR, they'd see it as a waste of time and money; my dad believes I can get job like that without a degree. I'm afraid of disappointing them, further even though I cannot honestly perform to the best of my ability.

Hyde here with a pre-Thanksgiving buffet for you to feast upon before the true feasting begins. I was summoned by /u/StareyedInLA. Life has been weapon’s grade horse shit lately, so I’m sorry to y’all who were waiting on updates. I come with overcompensation: in the time since my last update, I’ve been hoarding Jim’s emails and SDH sightings, and keeping a sort of log of them for when I had time to write them up properly, chronologically, for optimal consumption. I threw in some quick editing and decided to post them as is.

Bon appetit! 

**Email #1, received two days after the last email from Jim I shared.**

*[Hyde] –*

*The Big Boss just got back and I think its safe to say hes mad. He has been in meetings all morning with [Office Manager], [HR lady] and [Supervisor] behind closed doors and theres alot of yelling. [SDH] called in sick today. Patricia took the call and said [SDH] sounded high as akite. –Jim*

**Sighting #1 that same day**

I witnessed SDH waddling somewhat furtively across the courtyard, atrociously attired in a XXXXXXXL two piece bathing suit, badly disguised by a netted beach “cover up” and flattened sandals. Sweet Jesus, my friends. *So* much cellulite. She looks like an entire pallet of melted candles. I remembered suddenly that she had called in “sick”, and wondered if she was *sneaking in to work*. 

**Email #2, same day, shortly after my eyes were cauterized by SDH in a bathing suit.**

*[HYDE] –*
 
*[SDH] IS HERE AND SHES WEARING LIKE NOTHING. SHE CAME UP THE BACK STRAIS AND RAN TO HER OFFICE AND SHUT THE DOOR. [HYDE] SHES PRACTICALY NAKED. WHAT THE FUCK. Shes literaly hiding in her office. -Jim*

**Email #3, two days later.**

*[Hyde] –*
 
*[SDH] actually got away with out being seen but the intern and Justin both said they had seen her in the office and [Supervisor] asked the office who had seen her and most of us did. She is still out sick I think she knows shes in deep trouble. [HR lady] has snet out memos about a bunch of mandatory sexual harassment seminars scheduled for soon and every one knows its because of [SDH]. -Jim*

**Sighting #2, Oct 19th**

SDH spotted sitting in the courtyard inhaling one of three massive sandwiches from a local shop. This place has, admittedly, AMAZING sandwiches, but *one* of their sandwiches usually stuffs both me and Muscle Shirt to the point of bursting. This, however, I’ve seen before, and was not surprised. What *did* surprise me was her choice of beverage. I know y’all will guess a liter of beetus, but not this time. Instead, SDH hefted a [gallon jug of Arizona Green Tea]( https://www.walmart.com/ip/10450329?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227010793316&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=54957767672&amp;wl4=pla-113686236032&amp;wl5=9031528&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=10450329&amp;wl13=&amp;veh=sem) to her lips, put her whole mouth over the spout, and suck/slurped big mouthfuls. I suppressed a dry heave, imagining the backwash, and am potentially permanently put off Arizona Green Tea. 

I reported my sighting to Jim. He replied with, “She thinks green tea will help her lose weight. She won’t shut up about the health benefits.”

**Email #4, Oct 29th**

*[Hyde] –*

*SDH has died her hair blue. [HR lady] has had us all in seminars about sexual harassment and [SDH] keeps asking questions like what about hugs between friends and staring at the intern. Big Boss is still really mad but nobody has seen or herd anything if [SDH] will be terminated or reprimanded. Patricia filed a report that [SDH] tampered with her food today. -Jim*

This email was followed up shortly.

*[Hyde] –*

*The intern quit. He told [Supervisor] and [HR lady] he would be seeing a lawyer for a sexual harassment suite. Vijay said the intern told him [SDH] tried to follow him into the men’s bathroom. I have never seen [Supervisor] and [HR lady] run so fast. -Jim*

**Sighting #3, October 31st**

Does anyone want to hazard a guess as to what my eyes endured on Halloween? Remember, [this]( http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-37779-body-shape.htm?StartAt=4#.WCpVbLIrKUl) is a very close approximation to SDH’s body type. She has, in fact, gotten bigger, but I can’t be arsed to find a closer body match. Fortunately for you, and unfortunately for me, I knew exactly where to find an example of her costume – because I owned the same one… 

As I was leaving for the day, so was SDH. She was poured into [this work-appropriate wonder]( http://www.legavenue.com/costumes/schoolgirls/teacher-s-pet.html). She paired it with red platform stiletto Mary Janes … and could not walk in them. People were legitimately scattering at the sight of her. Women gasped and scurried away. SDH tripped along and tee-hee’d and waved at all the men, most of whom turned away swiftly or stared into blank space, presumably desperate to kill the image. I turned a corner and lost sight of her. 

**Sighting #4, Nov 3rd**

SDH invaded my safe space at the gym again. She brought a full bag of snacks, arranged them in order on the treadmill display, and set the pace to “Crippled Snail”. While she strolled, she ate. She ate her way halfway across the display before hitting the emergency stop button on the treadmill, collecting her snacks, and going sit on the floor – sans mat – to “stretch”.

A company within my complex employs a personal trainer to work with their employees. She is not a nice person. We shall call her Short Bitch. Normally I’m simply annoyed by her rudeness, but today it was marvelous, because Short Bitch is a shitlord.

&gt;You need to take your snacks out of here. You’re making a fucking mess. 

&gt;UHM, HOW ABOUT NO. YOU NEED TO FUCKING CONSIDER PEOPLE’S CONDITIONS. I NEED THIS FOOD SO I DON’T PASS OUT, OKAY? 

&gt;I don’t care what your fucking conditions are. You’re in the way, and you’re making a mess. Get your nasty ass snack food out of here and get the fuck out of my way. There are people here who are actually training.

&gt;EXCUSE ME?! YOU ARE BEING INCREDIBLY RUDE AND DISCRIMINATORY. ARE YOU EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY LEGALLY? THE LAWS HERE ARE DIFFERENT THAN IN CLUCK-CLUCK LAND. 

[Sidenote: Short Bitch is Asian. Not sure where the fuck “cluck cluck” land is.]

SDH started screaming. Everyone in the gym studiously ignored her. Short Bitch walked over to the panel on the wall and hit the security call button. SDH immediately shut up, heaved herself to her feet (after multiple tries) and waddled out, shouting angry profanities and slurs over her shoulder. She left all of her snack detritus. 

**Email #5, Nov 8th**

*[Hyde] –*

*Big Boss, [SDH], [HR lady], [Office Manager], and [Supervisor] have been in a meeting for like four hours. Theres a lot of yelling. [SDH] has run out shouting twice and then gone back in. 
Started this email yesterday. Went out for drinks with [Supervisor]. He didnt tell us much but apparently the Big Boss is furyous with [SDH]. [Supervisor] said Big Boss might sue [SDH] for damanges. [SDH] is in her office with the door closed and shes crying really loud. -Jim*

**Email #6, Nov 10th**

*[Hyde] –*

*[SDH] has been hiding in her office. Shes ordered like 7 pizzas over the last two days. She opens the door takes the pizza and slams the door. [HR lady] has been really happy lately I think finally they will let her (SDH) go. -Jim*

**Email #7, Nov 10th – From Patricia**

*Hi [Hyde] –* 

*Jim said you were keeping track of [SDH]’s bullshit online. Could you send me a link? I need a laugh.*

*I have something to add to your little blog, if you want. [Office Manager] and I are pretty close friends out of office, and he told me that [Big Boss] and [HR lady] have huge amounts of proof of problems that [SDH] caused. He thinks it will end in a civil suit. I can’t wait to see this bitch gone. She is a true nightmare. Did Jim also tell you she steals food?*

*Regards,*

*Patricia*

Oh, he told me, honey. Also, Hi Patricia! Everyone wave at the nice lady!

Anyway, that’s what I’ve been keeping from y’all. I hope you can forgive me. :-P I’ll try to be better at posting as shit happens, although it seems like this saga might be coming to an end pretty quickly.

5czppr,3,2016-11-14,Is no motivation a sign of ADHD?,Tp333,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5czppr/is_no_motivation_a_sign_of_adhd/,"Surprised that I'm even writing this. Because I am SO unmotivated. It's 3 PM on a Monday and I just woke up. I'm a 22 year old unemployed university dropout with no plans for my future or even getting employment.  You would think that I'd get motivated from others constantly asking me about my ""job hunt"". But I'm so ashamed of admitting my laziness that I lie to them and say I have a bunch of interviews to go to etc. I then get anxiety over lying to them. (Parents, friends) . I also feel like I'm isolating myself from my loved ones because I don't want them asking me questions about my future/ don't want to lie to them so I just avoid encountering them in general. (Not eating dinner with my dad anymore because he keeps pestering me and I don't want to admit that I'm an unmotivated person because he would associate that with ungratefulness) 

Usually for me I get motivated if there is a purpose but lately I'm having trouble waking up early because there is no purpose. I have no where to go and I have no motivation to find anywhere to go. I only wake up early if I make plans with someone and someone is counting on me being there early. 

I don't have a job and I'm unmotivated to get one because I have $$$ in my trust fund. I stopped going to the gym because the body acceptance movement really spoke to me. I dropped out of university because good grades weren't enough of a reason to motivate me to study for exams so I ended up failing and just dropping out entirely. I bought a book to inspire me to get motivated but I can't even bring myself to read it. (It's an ebook and on my iPad so every few pages I get distracted by YouTube/other apps on my iPad). After much procrastinating, I finally took driving school after 2 years. I completed the in class portion but I can't even get motivated to book my in car driving lessons which I've already paid for (out of the money from my trust fund). 

Even this past summer I got an internship (out of luck), and I had no motivation to complete the tasks at the job at hand. I did them hesitantly (after hours of procrastinating on social media at work). The moment my boss would leave the office, I'd go back to social media and YouTube etc. I feel like I've been like this since high school, and sometimes I think I might have ADHD. Or something. 

I remember in university, when I had readings to do for 3 classes. I found it incredibly difficult to finish one reading and then go on to the next, instead I went back and fourth between my 3 readings/textbooks till I finished them all at the same time by multitasking. In short: I get bored if I do the same task for a long time at once. I need a distraction. Another example: my mom asks me to unload the dishwasher. Halfway through unloading the dishwasher, I  feel the urge to wipe the countertops clean and ""distract myself"" and then I go back to the original task at hand which was unloading the damn dishwasher. 

I have been told by previous bosses and teachers that I should ""work on my listening skills."" I try my best but sometimes perhaps I don't have the patience to read through instructions that I just assume things and do them without proper listening/ instructions. And every single time i have to take a test/exam , for as long as I can remember, it would take me MUCH longer than my peers to finish, I'd always be asking for extra time to complete the test.  Do I have an undiagnosed learning disability? I don't know. 

Beforehand, I used to make excuses and blame my circumstances for my unmotivated laziness. I blamed the gym for being too far away as an excuse that I didn't work out. But this past summer I lived in a fancy new condo with a high class gym inside of it and I did not step foot in it once. I was THAT unmotivated. That's when I realized that my circumstances were NOT the problem. I could have the best of the best of the best and STILL be an unmotivated sloth. 

In terms of work/school, I used to think that the reason I was unmotivated was because I didn't find my ""passion"". So I spent two years searching for my ""passion"" and I found it. Now I know what I love, I know what I need to do, yet I'm still unmotivated to do those things and work towards goals. 

I have ""big plans"" for my future and I know what I want for myself but I have no motivation to take the steps needed to follow through. 

I don't know if I'd say that I'm depressed because I am happy. Despite some discontentment with my laziness, I am reasonably happy. However, I've read symptoms of depression.

These are the ones that apply to me:
-Insomnia
-Increase in appetite 
-Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that aren't your responsibility
-Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things

That being said, I'm a fairly optimistic person and try not to let those symptoms bother me from being ""happy"" or doing things that make me happy (ie staying up till 4 AM binge watching Netflix and sleeping in and repeating the cycle all over again). I guess I'm happy because I'm finally doing ""whatever I want"" except I'm not happy doing this ""whatever I want"". Sometimes I don't even have enough patience to sit through an entire episode, so I scroll through Instagram while it's playing in the background. I always joke that I don't have the attention span to sit through super long movies which is why I avoid them. 

I want structure in my life, I want a job that gives me purpose to wake up every morning, I want to be motivated to do things at the job, I want routine (despite originally saying 9-5 sucks), I want to feel motivated to apply and seek out the job that I want. 

I have all these grand plans for my future and what I want to do and where I want to go and when I see someone else (friends of mine) doing those things on social media I get jealous, insecure, self hatred consumes me ex: ""THAT WAS MY IDEA FIRST UHHHH"",  and feelings of extreme FOMO.

World of Reddit: how do I get motivated? How do I find purpose ? Can you be depressed and happy at the same time? Do I have ADHD? What's wrong with me? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I would go to a therapist but I'm paranoid/afraid that if I reveal that I have a trust fund, they might take advantage of vulnerable rich unmotivated me. "

I already have a bachelors degree, but it is in something completely different. I have written a couple of small programs and scripts for myself, for where I currently work, and for class, but nothing substantial. A few things have come up in my life to where I ideally need to make an internship happen sooner than later, which leads me to some questions:

-When, in your education timeline, did you begin applying for internships?

-What were you able to show that demonstrated your knowledge and skill?

-What factor do you think contributed the most to you getting an internship?

-Looking back, how big of a role did this internship play in your growth as a developer?

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!"

I just applied randomly and was amazed when I was offered an interview.

I'm very thankful for the offer, but I'm worried that I just got lucky and I'm not actually cut out for it. I don't want to go there and fail miserably, or be super stressed that I'm not performing up to par. Should I take the offer, or go with a less intimidating one?"

My parents paid for my tuition and housing for the first semester. After that, because of my situation, I got independent financial status. My parents are rich, so I wasn't eligible for any scholarships before my status change, and now there are very few I can apply for. I get $7500/semester in aid, but tuition is about $5000 and housing is at LEAST another 5. 

The cost of attendance for my school is $12000/semester, but it's no better at any other college as far as I can tell because to my understanding, other people pay less for college because they stay at home with their families and therefore don't pay the extra $5000 for housing. Since I cannot live with my family, I can't save that money. 

I could switch to a community college, but I'd break about even because community college tuition, housing, and buying a car in order to commute would end up costing about the same as tuition at a four year college. I set aside Tuesdays and Thursdays in my schedule for working next semester, and since I haven't used my aid for this semester, I figure I can combine it to pay for next. However, if I transfer to another college or go to school part time, I have to pay the loans off within six months. 

Even with money from working next semester while going to school full time, I will not have enough to pay for the following fall 2017 semester. I also have to make the choice between working during the summer and paying for housing or not working and living with a friend. I think they end up being about equal because the housing here is so expensive that any minimum wage/low paying job will basically only cover my rent. It's possible that I could get a paid summer internship since I am a Computer Science major, but I have been trying really hard to get one this semester with no luck, so it's not something I can count on. 

I was unable to even get a job this semester. No one wanted to hire me because they didn't like that I was taking 16 hours and seemed ""too busy"". I also have basically no work experience because my parents did not let me work in high school.

I just don't know what to do. Even if I dropped out, I'd have nothing I could do. I couldn't get a job because I would have nowhere to live that would allow me to walk to work and I'd have no money to purchase a car with. I don't know of any alternatives. Please help."

Started in early October, been steadily adding to the pile at a rate of maybe 20/week. A few no's, a few under reviews atm, no interviews so far, most decisions come due in December/January. 

A simple law of hunting for internships, where the outcome of one application is independent of the outcome of any other: let ""p"" be the probability of getting a response, ""n"" the amount of internships applied for, ""X"" the number of responses. Then the random variable ""X"" follows a binomial distribution and takes the value ""k""e[0, n] with probability n! * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) /(k! * (n-k)!). Maximized at k = round(np, 0).

5d0p31,3,2016-11-14,"CS major, transfer student... doing fine academically, but not socially (due to workload/time basically). Advice?",MrFender95,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5d0p31/cs_major_transfer_student_doing_fine_academically/,"Title says most of what I'm going to say. First semester at a four-year university, and the transition hasn't really been an issue at all! It's just under an hour away from home, so anything I'm running drastically low on, I just come on home every other weekend and pick it up then. 

Thoroughly enjoying my CS classes, aside from the bulging anxiety I get when searching/applying/preparing for internships. Not sure if I'll get one, as I'm technically a freshman in the CS curriculum, just junior level credit-wise. I TRY not to worry too much about any of that, however, because I know the school I'm at will prepare me heavily for an internship and a great career in the next (hopefully) three years I'm here!

Being a transfer student, my GPA from the community college, by way of the college's modus operandi, did not transfer as well. So essentially starting off with a 0.00 GPA, which is exactly why I've been hitting my workload diligently! If I had to tally up the hours per week (which I don't), I'd say it's in the ballpark of 36-42 hours spent (could be more, like I said, don't keep track) of studying/doing homework a week. Doesn't include weekends but this semester I've lucky to usually not have to take much home with me as far as assignments go.

The problem is, with my anxiety over getting all my work done to the best of my ability, it's been a near-futile effort to squeeze in time to make friends/meet a girl, of which I naively thought the transition from CC to Uni would allot me with tons of time to pursue those things!

So, quite naturally, I've been a tad depressed when thinking about my circumstances lately. No, not lately... make that the entire semester. Just now getting to me, though.

I do make tons of acquaintances, really nice people, in my CS classes and otherwise, and for most of them I try and get some sort of contact info. It seems, however, that whenever I have time to hang with one of them, the other doesn't. Alas, I suppose that's the nature of college. I understand and respect their work ethic, though this doesn't help my endeavors.

Of my surrounding peers (i.e. the guys I share an apartment with on-campus), I seem to be the only one with this issue. Four of the guys are heavily into video games, and I'm not, otherwise I'd chill with them in the living room, where they are a majority of the time.

My roommate, who I transferred from the same CC with, is an avid PC gamer, so more video games. Doesn't help he's got online friends (which I'll never quite understand; I could never forge a meaningful connection with people online, or at least enough of one to call someone a ""friend""). Seeing as he's got his social group to talk to while enjoying his hobby, I doubt he's having a depressive mood about his experiences here.

My prime hobby is playing guitar. I have been for 6 years and it's so much a part of who I am. So while I'd love to join a club in order to ""meet more friends and have a social outlet"", there's no guitar clubs, or anything remotely interesting to me that's not related to my major (because there is a CS group on campus, and I've gone to a few of their meetings, nice people there as well). If The other negative about joining a club is that, with my aforementioned workload and work ethic, I doubt I'd find the time to spend the time I wanted to in the group. Wouldn't have the time to be very involved, that's for sure.

Sooooo you might be able to tell why I feel alone in this predicament of mine. It sucks, and I try to ignore the feeling the best I can. But I just wanted to post here to gauge people's thoughts on what I might be able to do to alleviate this situation. As far as the dating scenario goes, only thing I've really tried is Tinder, and I'm finding out lately that it's a disproportionate sex buddy finder/bot-fest. lol

I really want things to change, either now and for the rest of the semester, or starting next semester when my schedule feels a little less rushed. Again, all (non-shitpost) advice is appreciated!"

I'm not sure how many of you are still around, but I have a very important project for this revolution of ours, and little in the way of coding skills to see it through myself. I need your help, and I hope you'll hear me out.

**The Need**
--------------
People want to vote. People want to effect positive change, but it's so difficult to stay truly informed and get involved. In the fight for things like income equality, green energy, education and jobs, and so on, it isn't enough to show up every couple of years and vote. Politics is a part of everyday life, or at least it should be. 

Technology has done so much to make certain elements of our lives so much quicker and more efficient, but sadly, not when it comes to politics. I believe, with a little spit and elbow grease, we can change that. We can create an application that enables people to get informed and participate in our democracy as easily and efficiently as we read and send tweets.
***
**TL;DR:** All that is a long-winded way of saying that I want to build an all-in-one app for activism and democracy.

*Perhaps it's easiest to start with an overview of how this app would work, and go from there:*

**The App**
--------------
* **The Dashboard** - Provide news pertinent to progressive measures, etc, especially local opportunities. If a vote or townhall is coming up, provides information,Location and attendance details. Same thing for rallies and protests.

* **The Core App** - search for and subscribe to causes you want (IE clean water, nodapl, green energy, climate change, etc) to receive curated notifications about relevant measures you can vote for, rallies protests and ways to get involved.

* **Elections Pages** - automatically curated pages for elections and votes with unbiased details on the various candidates, what they support, and who funds them (I.E. voters edge plus opensecrets). For and against sections for measures with drop down to select by organization, as well as general overview with suggestions by organizations (IE https://couragevoterguide.org).

* **Notifications** - notifications for urgent things, like protesting bills, signing petitions, etc, with configurable settings. Hiring calls for interns of progressive candidates and such

* **The System**: I think it's crucial that the app be available for iOS and android first, but a web portal would be lovely as well

The easier we make staying informed and fighting for progress, the sooner we'll have it.

***
**Resources at Our Disposal**
--------------
There are a number of existing sites we can source data from initially, although I don't know if they have any sort of friendly APIs.

* **[Voter's Edge](http://votersedge.org/)** - Convenient lists of candidates by election (curated by zipcode). Experience summaries, priorities,  education, etc. Also lists of ballot measures, etc.

* **[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org)** - Less accessible, but more in-depth information on ballot measures and candidates.

* **[OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/)** - Records of what groups are funding which candidates

* **[BrandNewCongress](https://www.brandnewcongress.org/), [Progress For All](http://progressforall.org), [Our Revolution](http://ourrevolution.com)** - Progressive candidate endorsements/recommendations
* **[We the People](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)** - Petitions to the whitehouse
* **[Change.org](http://change.org)** - Petitions

***
Please get in touch and let me know how we can make this dream a reality. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. Feature suggestions are more than welcome.

**Edit**: I'll be setting up a discord server and sending out invites to everyone interested. We can figure out what languages/frameworks we want to work with from there.

BPD/NPD [TRIGGER WARNING],Woolwoman,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/5d1bpu/help_with_living_with_my_npdbpd_mother_im_28_yo/,"I fucked up in a lot of ways since I graduated college 5 years ago as a result of poor impulse control and poor decision making.

I'm currently in a crossroads: My mother and I are moving this week (we began apt search one-year ago so it's been a long time coming); I'm starting a part-time minimum wage job; and I'm interviewing for internships for office jobs.

The jobs will be the escape door from the life with my mother, but for now I am stuck with her.

She likely has BPD and NPD. My mom was never the miserable monster that she is now. If she isn't ranting about how I'm home all the time (I actually leave the house doing nothing to avoid her) or yelling some nonsense, then she is nagging me for things as small as having my window shut.

I think she garnered more male attention up to a few years ago, the identity she attached to since adolescence. Now that her beaten spirit is triumphing over her looks, her wretched essence is easier to spot, and it's just a vicious cycle (the less looks she has to rely on the worse she feels about herself).

I love my mom and do feel bad for her. She raised me and my brother alone, sometimes only working for commission and being taken advantage of by herbosses. I think she is a good-natured person who has been buffeted by the whim of this world. 

But I've had enough.

There was once a time where we would have a spat and then I could go about my day, but it now eats at me. For example, today I wandered a big-box store under the guise of looking for new furnishings for the apt we are moving into this week. My head and body weren't attached. Depersonalized. I have books I want to read. Places I want to plan to go to. I feel weary with her in my life. I say awful things to her that I regret yet I still hold onto the idea of wanting to choke the life out of her after we argue--the latter is something I would only ever want to do in the heat of the moment! But now it sits in me, stalks me. I feel like a terrible being.

We are indigent. Instead of her seeming proud for getting my p/t job, she repeats how I will have to contribute, which I am perfectly content with doing!! I have never stated otherwise or hinted at such.

I think it's time I leave. But how do I actually stay alive until I can?"

I'm located in the bay area and am willing to take an internship, drive, skype, shadow in-office to learn from any experienced Mobile Developers.

Need some advice.",Snozed,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5d2k1h/im_in_my_final_year_of_computer_engineering_have/,"Hi guys. I'll try to keep this short as I can.

I'm studying computer engineering at a university in europe, and in my 2nd year I had to choose between specializing in either more computer sciency stuff (mostly programming) or networking and security. In my first year I had some basic programming courses (Java, Python, C) and I didn't really like it, so I thought I'd give networking&amp;security a chance.

I've found out that while I like networking a little bit more than programming, i'm still not a huge fan. The only thing I thought was OK were my security classes. I learned about hacking, penetration testing and some other stuff that I thought was pretty cool.

I got an internship this summer at a medium sized construction company in the US through a family friend (I'm half american). They had never had an IT intern before, only construction engineering students, but they put me in their IT department which consisted of some great people and I learned quite a bit. While I got to do some interesting stuff like help set up new servers and routers in addition to getting admin privileges for most of their systems, most of my time was spent on tier 1 help desk support. I was good at it though, and they offered me a permanent job when I'm finished with my studies.

So I guess my question is: should I take the job and hope that something better will show up down the road? I liked working at the company, but I didn't like most of the work, and I didn't learn anything about cyber security. I want to work in the US as the job market in IT isn't too hot where I'm from these days. But I heard getting a job in the US isn't easy either when you don't have experience, and applying for jobs is pretty pointless if you don't live in the city. My grades are pretty average.

I'm working on a CCNA right now because a lot of people told me it would be smart to get it, and my school pays for the certification as a part of one of my classes. It has been during this time of practicing for the CCNA that I've realized I don't really like networking and I wish I had taken a security cert instead but now it's too late. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

My responsibilities have been growing and i've been learning a lot.

Right now i do a little bit of everything to help keep the IT side of the company running smoothly. My goal is to get a CCNA and see what that can do for me. If i do manage to pass the CCNA (not sure if there's a starter cert for security) if i'll have any chance at landing a security-related IT job, or least a stepping stone job that can lead in that area. I have a web dev internship and a few novice github projects on my resume as well. I have a BA and know computers fairly well. I also feel like i usually do well in interviews, so if i could get the initial interview i might have a shot. Thoughts?"

I lost my forensic accounting job about a month ago. It was my first job out of grad school and I lasted about four months. Their reasoning for letting me go was that ""I was not a good fit"".

I'm over it now, but I'm worried about finding a new job once I begin the job search in January. I'm very tempted to leave this short stint off my resume and just start fresh. I had a solid forensic accounting internship which helped me land the full-time job in the first place. Although I'm willing to continue a career in forensic accounting, I am looking to make a switch into Audit.

This situation leaves me with a couple questions:
1) Should I leave this job off my resume and just start fresh? I can say I took the time to study for the CPA and care for sick family members.
2) If I do leave the job off of my resume, would employers be able to find out about it through a background search?

What should I do?

Thank you for any help you may be able to provide!"

5d3im1,1,2016-11-15,Over the past few weeks these thoughts have grown darker,sudokug,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5d3im1/over_the_past_few_weeks_these_thoughts_have_grown/,"This post might be incoherent and very fumbly. It's hard enough putting it into words as it is, let alone in a straight narrative that makes sense.

I have occasionally thought about offing myself before over the years, but they were harmless entertainings of the thought, you know. At what point is living no longer worth the bother, and if I went through with it, what are the repercussions for my loved ones? That stuff. I don't want to hurt my dad, who's had a hard life as it is. I don't want my younger brother going through my loss on his own, as it was hard enough on the two of us when we lost our mom to cancer a few years ago.

That's when it all went downhill, fast. I was never a very disciplined student, but I was very gifted. I got through, sometimes barely, on aptitude for the course materials alone. When our mother died, I was 23, and was well over halfway through getting my bachelor's degree.

All of my gusto for the trade (high school education) vanished. All of my gusto for much of anything, really. I managed to grit my teeth through all the raw material and exams that were left to me, but I couldn't be a teacher anymore. My final internship I failed three times. I've gotten even fatter than I was. I often ignore bills until a bailiff order comes.

I'm 25 now, which means no more government grants for education where I live. It also means my dad's taxes would go up since I can no longer be under his care in the government's eyes, no matter my situation. He's been on health care since he had a stroke nearly 20 years ago, so he's not exactly comfortable financially.

I quit my studies with only one semester left. I had to, since all that was left were internships that I obviously cannot fulfill while working. I applied at the store I'd worked at for five years while studying. They were hiring too, but for reasons I still can't understand, the manager I'd known for five years and who had always been content me chose not to hire me.

Me, my brother, and a friend have been renting an apartment for two and a half months now, which is a better financial solution than sending our dad's taxes into the stratosphere. The idea was that I would be working at this store, and we split all the bills three-ways. I was so sure I'd get that job (and so were plenty of my colleagues). But I didn't, so I started applying for other jobs. They either turn me away for being overqualified when they see I went to school for so long, or they send me away for being underqualified when they see I didn't manage to get the degree after all that time. On top of that, it's slim pickings because I don't actually have a driver's license.

I've been applying since the end of August and I still don't have a job. Tensions are rising in this house and I've just stopped... Whatever you call it. I can tell my stance on suicide is changing. Earlier today my brother was yet again telling me how he's getting tired of me still being home. I said it's pissing me off too, that I don't enjoy living off their goodwill and not having a single penny to my name. He started rebutting yet again, and I just had enough. I got up, slammed my door in his face and locked it. Our dad invited us for dinner tonight and I'm not going. I've sat in my room since I locked the door an hour ago now, crying on and off while typing this.

I just want to get my fucking shit together but it feels like the world doesn't let me. And I realize the world doesn't owe me anything, but I don't owe the world anything either. I had to stop myself from googling suicide methods. The very least I can do when checking out is make sure I'm not a grueling mess or that I don't give some poor train driver PTSD.

I don't even know what I expect to get out of typing this. It feels like my life is stuck in a rut, and the only way out is to land a fucking job *soon*. And even then I think I'd still be treating the symptoms and not the cause. I just don't want to anymore man. I just can't be bothered. You try, and try, and try, and you just don't see results.

I just sit here, being a fat blubbering mess, while sending applications into a void that only seems to swallow them. I'm a burden to those around me."
5d3moz,1,2016-11-15,Computer science degree from Europe,Heavy12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5d3moz/computer_science_degree_from_europe/,"Hello, I am currently in the process of getting my bachelors of computer science in the Netherlands. I originally started out in the states, but it became to expensive for me, so I took advantage of my duel citizenship and ended up in the EU.

I have a couple questions about the hiring process in the EU/US, and more specifically the Netherlands, but feel free to chime in if you have any experience with working in the EU.

From what I have noticed so far it seems more emphasis is put on passing courses, unlike the USA where getting 60-70% in a course is unsatisfactory for some. Obviously it is always better to have a higher GPA, but what are employers mostly looking for in the EU? Would simply having graduated your bachelor's and or master's degree suffice?

Also, how has job searching gone for any EU graduates that looked for a job or even an internship in the USA?

I assume, that most of the standards in the USA are applicable to the EU,however university studies are much more difficult for me here, so perhaps there are some differences when hiring EU graduates.

She goes to my university and is my major and every semester we've had at least 3 classes together and we hung out almost every second of every day. After what was my third summer away from her (internships), I realized that long distance wasn't really what I wanted and I knew that chances are that she wouldn't get a job in the same city as me so I broke it off. It wasn't really bad over the summer but here at school I see her in classes almost every day and we still continue to be really good friends. However it's killing me on the inside that like I'm sleeping alone every single night when she's two blocks away and I know I still have feelings for her. Like I keep on getting upset ever time I see couples holding hands walking down the street.


Senior year has been no fun because I don't really want to go to bars if I'm not dancing with a girl and I don't plan on getting to know any girls that well because I'm graduating and moving halfway across the country anyways. Not sure what to do... I don't have many friends that are that close because me and her used to spend like all our time together. I'm trying to cut back talking to her on fb/in person because I don't really know what else to do but part of me feels like I'll just completely lose her if i do that and I'm not sure if I want that. When I broke up with her, I just never in my wildest dreams thought that I would be the one unhappy."

I'm also developing some bookkeeping intranet applications in my current internship that I've been working at for about nine months.

I recently moved out and currently support myself almost 100% with some help from a relative. This has become problematic because I don't get enough hours or pay at my internship to support myself. I'm also getting bored of school and increasingly disinterested in completing my BS at a university, because ultimately I don't need to know how to build 16-bit processors to write good code. Plus university tuition is expensive here in socal.

So, I was thinking of finishing my AA and putting a shitton of effort into a bootcamp so I can immediately start working with a skill stack that matches the current industry, and eventually if I feel like I need it I can finish my BS at another school. How viable is this? Are employers going to overlook my lack of a BS in favor of what will be a wicked portfolio, or throw out my application because of it? How possible if at all will it be for me to complete my BS later?"

I was lucky enough to get an offer from a Big 4 (MS), but I've been working in hardware test engineering for the past 5-6 years doing mostly low-level stuff (C++, LabVIEW, VBA).  I also have a degree in physics, so definitely have some imposter syndrome going in.  I have worked exclusively in small companies up to this point (&lt;40 people), so I imagine working in a giant company will be different.

   I'd be happy to hear people's experiences about how they transitioned successfully, either directly from college / intern to full-hire, or more like me where they were doing something different than CS into CS, or even from a small company to a large company."

Actually, i am a privileged white girl living in a first world country getting everything shoved up her ass. But I feel so depressed and lonely and often suicidal. I am NOT diagnosed but I am pretty sure I have social anxiety or something of that sort. I almost failed school because I skipped so many classes last year due to me having absolutely no friends back then in my classes and feeling so anxious to go there because I was even too scared to just say hello to anyone. But in schoolbreaks I still had 2 friends, one of them my best friend. But my best friend changed school beginning of this schoolyear and now, I always hang out with that other friend. Don't get me wrong shes pretty funny and crazy but sooo superficial with zero empathy. Somebody has ""no ass"" Or ""no tits"" and is ""ugly""? In her opinion she doesn't deserve a boyfriend or even friends. She says she wouldn't hang out with someone who is ugly because she has standards. I mean wtf. Who honestly is that big of an asshole. I will just put out there that I am a lot nicer than her.. which isn't that hard... obviously. But still people ALWAYS like her better. And that makes me feel so fucking depressed because I try to be nice and thoughtful all the time yet I have no ""friends"" or whatever. She on the other hand talks bad about literally everyone and doesn't even hide how superficial her thinking is (""If someones ugly I don't want to have anything to with them"", she really said that) I am not saying that I am an absolute angel and never talk bad but I  more often than not try to be nice. I am just too awkward and when I feel uncomfortable in a social situation I don't act necessarily shy, I'll just act aloof, a weird protection I automatically set up so people don't see my feelings. So teachers and stuff think I am super stuck up, in the two internships I was in they said I was not interested at all in what was happening, but the sad thing is I really tried to be friendly still people there thought I was super stuck up. And that makes me so scared of the future. How am I ever supposed to be happy when I have problems standing up for school in the morning (last schoolyear I felt so bad (mentally) that I more often than not missed the first two lessons of the day), I can't get friends because I am so awkward. Weekends often just consist of me eating way too much and throwing up non stop (did that since I was 13) or me rarely eating and just staying in bed feeling alone and sad. Btw I am 16 yeears old but I never had a boyfriend or a kiss or anything like that. There have been some guys trying to talk to me like asking for my number (not that many but still) but I always turn them down because.. well idk I guess I feel like they are trying to make fun of me? Or they have tried to hit on so many girls and I am their last hope of getting at least something to fuck (sorry) and then they'll just drop me like a hot potato.
I have hated myself all my life because I always was super tall for a girl, or even a boy (currently 5'11 or 180 cm) and that made me feel like that super big ugly monster that doesn't fit in (I really felt like that since elemantary school). I guess that has ingrained the thought in me that I have to be skinny for boys or people to like me, since shoert petite pretty girls are desired. When I was 12/13 I got really obsssive about my weight and calories which led me to bulimia. 
 Anyways, I feel like such a cry baby because I literally have all the possibilities in life open contrary to people who have to fight for everything, but I cry about my little problems in my big room on my warm bed with a full stomach. Theres so much more but I honestly don't know how to put everything in words. 
Short: I feel lonely, sad, inferior, failing classes (not because I have problems with the classes itself but becuase my oral participation is SO bad), see no chance of happiness in the future, bulimia and a consistent depressed feeling.
I just needed to get this out there, I feel a bit relieved I ve been carrying these feelings around with me for a few years... sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes I wrote this in a rush and english isn't my first language."

I learnt a huge amount, loved the people and just generally really enjoyed working there. I had regular one-to-ones with my manager and the senior developer I worked with most often and their feedback was always that I was exceeding expectations and doing really well. 


Towards the end of the internship, I had a final one-to-one with my manager where he explained that they would contact me in January to let me know if they were giving me a graduate offer. He seemed extremely positive and said that he would like to give me one now but they had to wait until the end of the quarter to see if they could hire more junior devs. This all makes sense with information I had known while working there, since they had put a freeze on hiring junior devs to sort out their onboarding process and hire more senior devs. 

I got to know my manager well and I trust that he would give me a straight-up no if they didn't want to hire me. I'm confident that they will give me an offer if they can, but I'm not 100% certain that they can.

Another company who I applied to last year (similar size and market) has emailed me today asking if I would like to talk about graduate opportunities. This has motivated me to try get an offer from the company I worked at (since I would really like to work there again) and if I can't, I will apply elsewhere.

How do I nicely (but firmly) ask if they can let me know now instead?"

I'm a 22-year-old Asian American female, 5th year in university. I was academically dismissed at the end of my junior year because I have been an academic failure from the day I set foot on this campus. During my gap year I was the happiest I have ever been. I finally had time to figure things out for me and to find motivation. I took community college classes and managed to get high enough grades to get back into my 4-year college. This is my first semester back and it has been absolute hell. Academically I'm still struggling, but I'm struggling even harder just to find enough motivation to get out of bed every day and go to class which is where I feel my academic struggles are coming from. I always feel sad, or angry, or quite frankly just dead.

Things got even better today because this spring is supposed to be my last semester but now I probably won't even be graduating. I found out I won't have a way to pay for school next semester and I already owe my school money from this semester. It sucks even worse when I have already started my grad school applications and now I have to put those on hold for at least another year. I see my friends graduating and moving on with their lives and I'm still stuck in the same place I've been in for the past 4 years and I can't shake the feeling that I've failed when I know I really haven't. 

I'm super iffy about asking for or receiving professional help which is even funnier because I study rehabilitation and counselor ed and intern with a mental healthcare resource at my school. I'm just a huge hypocrite who can't take my own advice. I guess it's also because I still don't know what I want. Most of the time I don't even know why I feel the way I do. I know my life honestly isn't the worst but I also know that the feelings I have are valid. There is so much good in my life but for the past several years I have just had a hard time seeing beyond all of the bad. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to die. Or I guess at this point I'm still unsure. This is not the first time I have had suicidal ideations but they are becoming more frequent and more concrete to the point that I actually have plans of what I would do. I'm scared to die, but I am equally scared to live with myself because all my fears and worries and demons seem to get more powerful every day. Death only seems reassuring because at this point I am not really living and the future just looks bleak. I just go through the motions. Wake up, go to school, go to work. Some days I don't even eat or sleep because my mind just runs full of terrible thoughts and they keep me awake. 

I told my best friend goodbye today. Realizing how sad and afraid that made him made me really think other people are the only thing keeping me here. I don't want to hurt the people who care about me so I keep telling myself, ""Just one more day,"" but at this point it is really more for them than it is for me. I know there are people who do care about me and want me to win this battle but it's hard to keep fighting for myself. 

Sorry that this is such a long post and it kind of went nowhere, but I just have so much in my head to sort out. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to care, because it means a lot even if you all are just strangers on the internet."

I want to have the courage to go tomorrow at work  and try to ask for some forgiveness and hoping they would  let me have another chance and do not know how to say this nicely enough for them to even try to give me another chance.

Recently I quit my part-time job and committed to job-hunting and improving my skills full-time. 

Recently, I got an email back for a remote internship at a small company that wants to pay me minimum wage (~$10/hour) to do front-end development tasks, which is in line with my skill set (and potentially back end with PHP, which is something I don't know). $10 an hour is less than I was making in retail, so I just feel a little bit undervalued.

5d623m,5,2016-11-15,Tough Choice,Lm0,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/5d623m/tough_choice/,"Alright guys...

I graduated a little over a year ago and did two internships with this company before graduation so I've been with them a little over 2 years as a field engineer.

However, I'm just not happy. The only thing that keeps me coming back is the money. But I'm underappreciated, and upper management doesn't understand all the newly implemented processes that we have to use to get things done.

The job I'm on is finishing up and I was told i have to relocate immediately. (Less than two weeks) - Personally, i find it ridiculous giving someone less than 2 weeks notice to have to move across the country. So this pretty much forced me to take PTO so i could spend Thanksgiving with family. So i had to blow a week and half to extend my ""move"" across the country.

Is it a horrible decision on my part to quit and look for a job back home? I don't have anything lined up yet, but I have a good amount of money saved up.

I would most likely be making less money with any job that is at ""home"", but I guess it's time to make that choice.

My real concern is having to explain to potential employers the reason i am unemployed when they inevitably ask... what is the right answer for this question?"

Nobody wants to hire a 16 year old, despite the fact that I'm qualified for the position. I just want to know where / how to find and get a part time iOS job.**

Hey guys, I have a quick question for some of the more experienced (and employed) iOS developers in this community.

I'm 16 years old, in high school, and I'm looking for a part time job. Although I don't desperately *need* a job at this point in my life, it would be nice to have one, simply because it would teach me about leadership and working in teams, not to mention the money. I've never had a ""normal"" teenager job, although I just applied for one. The reason I never had one before is that I never felt it was worth it for me. I invested a lot of time into learning iOS and iOS development when I was really young (12), and I just don't want to get a job at McDonald's or some other similar place.

The point of my story is this: How would I go about getting a part time job as an entry / entry mid level iOS developer? I'm confident that I can handle it, because I have a sound knowledge of Objective C, Swift, iOS, macOS, and many of the other related topics. I've held internships at 2 software development companies (both of which I finished successfully) and I've worked on real projects in the real world. I currently write at AppCoda, and I also, very occasionally, land a small freelance job, but they just aren't good, reliable, jobs. I also work on my own apps, like [this one](https://www.getpeeking.com). It's a sizable Swift project, it's over 25000 lines of code, and I **definitely** follow good programming practices. I've worked on real projects in the real world before, and I personally know that I can handle almost anything that will be thrown at me in an entry level position.

The only problem is that nobody wants to hire a 16 year old without a degree. I was wondering if anyone here had any advice for me on finding, successfully applying to, and getting part time jobs. I'm not looking for anything super extravagant and I'm not looking for tons of hours either. 20 - 30 hours a week for $25+ an hour would be just fine. Does anyone have any advice they could give me? I would really appreciate it."

I destroyed the spark of our relationship by questioning my love for her.,MyDickFellOff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5d6brm/me_27m_with_my_gf_27_f_of_9_months_i_destroyed/,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for 9 months now. 6 of those were happy (in love) months in the Netherlands. For the last 3 months of our relationship we have been long distance. I live in Asia for my education, (internship) and my girlfriend is living in Canada where she is finishing up her education. We have big plans. Living together, having kids, you name it. I have been working really hard on my thesis, my internship and other courses, so I can graduate. When I flew to NA, I was at end's rope. I was so stressed, so annoyed at life. Frustrated with my internship, frustrated about my life in Seoul, frustrated about not living closer to her.

When I met my girlfriend for the first time again, I didn't feel a thing. I felt nothing. When we had sex 2 hours later, I felt no passion. I cried myself to sleep, because I realized I haven't felt any thing good inside for a long while. My girlfriend tried to comfort me, but I just told her I wanted to sleep and be left alone. The next day, we went for a hike and I could feel some of the old lovey dovey feelings, even though they weren't that super strong. Later that night, we went to her friends and because I was so exhausted and so unwell, I did not enjoy myself. I doubted the entire time  I should end the relationship. These thoughts brought great discomfort to my psyche. I felt off and I felt like I was going crazy. My girlfriend noticed I was not feeling well and we went home early. When we were home, she kept pushing me and asking me what was wrong. She thought I cheated in her in Asia, and I finally caved in and said what I said to you guys here:
I Love you, but I dont't feel in love anymore, the lovey dovey feelings are gone. I also told here I have been depressed. I had a mental breakdown that night and she sent me to an hotel to calm down, because I had been crying for 24 hours straight. 

The next morning after I calmed down, we decided to make my stay in Canada count and to make the most out of it. During this week, my feelings for my girlfriend have returned, but I feel liek I destroyed her feelings for me. She feels conflicted about our future. She will visit me in Seoul within 4 weeks, because this is somethign we decided upon before this visit.  

I fully intend to win her back, but I fear to much damage has been done. I don't feel the spark we used to have and I feel like it won't be the same anymore. We were 100% in love with eachother and we both now questions everything. I don't want this, I never wanted any of this. I love this girl soooo much. How do I win my GF's trust back? Does this community think there is still a future or have I fucked it up too much?  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My GF and I have been madly in love. Due to our live choices of being international students, we have been seperated for 3 months. during those 3 months I have become very stressed. When I went to visit her, I couldn't feel happyness anymore due to my depression and questioned my love. I had a mental breakdown. After a week, I feel re-affirmed in my love for her, however, my GF feels conflicted with our relationship, because she has been hurt by me and doesn't trust me anymore. 

Question:  Does this community think there is still a future or have I fucked it up too much?  If not; How do I win my GF's trust back?"

I don't have a Computer Science Degree, so I don't know how employable I am, if at all. I have tried the Java language but not yet Android and am confused about connecting all the dots to build an app. I don't know how to best use my time to build an app efficiently, from start to finish.

I plan on buying The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development, but besides that, I don't know what else are good resources and who to speak to as to why I'm requesting if any experienced Mobile developer can lend their time to a beginner.

I'm located in the bay area and am willing to take an internship, drive, skype, shadow in-office to learn from any experienced Mobile Developers. I would be content if I put enough effort in six months i can get a Mobile Developer position for $30,000. Is there anyone who can mentor me and help me realize my goals and expectations?

She goes to my university and is my major and every semester we've had at least 3 classes together and we hung out almost every second of every day. After what was my third summer away from her (internships), I realized that long distance wasn't really what I wanted and I knew that chances are that she wouldn't get a job in the same city as me so I broke it off. It wasn't really bad over the summer but here at school I see her in classes almost every day and we still continue to be really good friends. However it's killing me on the inside that like I'm sleeping alone every single night when she's two blocks away and I know I still have feelings for her. Like I keep on getting upset ever time I see couples holding hands walking down the street.

Senior year has been no fun because I don't really want to go to bars if I'm not dancing with a girl and I don't plan on getting to know any girls that well because I'm graduating and moving halfway across the country anyways. Not sure what to do... I don't have many friends that are that close because me and her used to spend like all our time together. I'm trying to cut back talking to her on fb/in person because I don't really know what else to do but part of me feels like I'll just completely lose her if i do that and I'm not sure if I want that. When I broke up with her, I just never in my wildest dreams thought that I would be the one unhappy.

She still doesn't know where she's going to be full time so it doesn't make sense to try to get back together because if she doesn't end up in the same city as me, both of us don't want to do long distance. I'm just not sure how to stop feeling crappy."

I do not have much experience in this field, but with my love of algorithms and Math, as well as just a general interest in AI, I believe that type of work is a perfect fit for me.

I am planning on applying to Masters/PhD programs next fall, so the next lab I work in will be the main research experience that I have (so far I have completed one industry internship and done some research with a few professors but nothing significant).

Something like that. He sighed. His uncle, the Minister of Foreign and CARICOM Affairs had gotten him the internship with promises of a great off-year before starting at the University of the West Indies. Instead he's spent about two months digging through things in the basement, covered in cobwebs, trying to catalog and sort whatever had been dumped down here over the years.

&gt; ""And another box of...tax code or some bullshit?""

He jotted it down on his clipboard and moved to the next box. Blowing off the dust, he sliced off the tape with his boxcutter. Lifting it onto the table, he began pulling out bound notebooks, each a copy of the next, without reading them. He counted 15 copies, piling each on the desk. He mumbled to himself,

&gt; ""Fifteen copies of probably some bullshit from the 1990s.""

As he bent to mark it on his clipboard, he read the title of the top notebook.

&gt; ""Huh, Uncle Denis is probably going to want to see this...""

He grabbed a handful and rushed off to his uncle's office. Reaching the door, he wrenched open the handle and dropped the stack on Denis Moses' desk.

&gt; ""Well? I think I might have just earned that college recommendation you promised to write me!""

Denis Moses flipped the top notebook over so that he count better read the title. *[Trinidad and Toabgo-East Caribbean States Integration Initiative Task Force Report](http://www19.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04051a01.pdf)*. He stroked his short, neatly trimmed goatee.

&gt; ""Why yes it seems you have. I'd completely forgotten about this initiative...Keith will want to know about this for sure. Don't think I could find a better plan. Guess it helps sometimes to look back to move forward.""

He gathered up the stack himself this time and told his nephew to go back to work. Aaron grumbled and shuffled back off to the basement.

Mr. Moses strode purposefully into the Prime Minister's office and a wide grin on his face.

&gt; ""Sir, do you happen to remember [a plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Eastern_Caribbean_States#Political_union_with_Trinidad_and_Tobago) floated about 8-9 years between our government and the rest of the Eastern Caribbean?""

The Prime Minister raised an eyebrow, clearly not remembering.

&gt; ""Well, you might want to refresh yourself. Think its just the sort of plan you'd like to restart, especially considering your plan to bring the Caribbean together to ""weather the unknown.""

He dropped the stack of notebooks onto Rowley's desk. Reading the title himself, a wide, pleased smile spread across the Prime Minister's face.

&gt; ""Denis you never cease to amaze me! I'd bloody all but forgotten about this plan. Think the OCES is still open to the idea?""

&gt; ""I don't see why know, especially considering our ongoing transition to the Eastern Caribbean Dollar. Biggest issue would be the response from the rest of CARICOM. Barbados and Guyana aren't OCES but have floated economic unions and the like before, and I know they were [invited to the meeting in Port of Spain on it last time](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/power/3707). If things go well they might even petition membership as well. Bahamas probably won't care, any economic stability in the community would only benefit them. 

Only folks with any real complaints might be Jamaica or Belize, they had some minor concern the last time the idea was floated. Mostly just concerns of a shift more towards the Eastern Caribbean but neither is in a place economically to throw their weight around politically right now. Jamaican concern in particular can be assuaged with some financial support while Belize is probably wary of going it alone with recent [Guatemalan statements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/5cwszw/diplomacy_an_invitation_from_guatemala/) of their renewed territorial interests.""

&gt; ""Absolutely excellent Denis. Contact the OCES leaders, float the idea and see if they are still interested. If so, bring up the 2009 plan as starting details and let them know we're open for further negotiations. If they are ask to invite Guyana, Barbados, and Suriname to the negotiations as well. Tell them if they are interested we would like to include them in talks on the political union, but also value input from our neighbors in the region either way.""

tl;dr Renewing interest in an old plan from 2008 on a political union between Trinidad and Tobago and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). Barbados and Guyana invited due to a stated previous interest. Suriname invited because.

So I'm a recent college grad who scored a great internship in a city far from home. Since my aunt lives in the suburbs of this city, she has allowed me to stay with her for very cheap rent (basically just my utilities) until I can find a place in the city. I've been here for a couple months now, and I have a place lined up in February. This aunt traveled a lot during my childhood so I never got to know her well, so I was also excited to really get to know her more.

Another reason I wanted to stay with my aunt is this: She and my uncle got divorced about a year or two ago, and of her two daughter, one does not speak to her and the other is in college. She is totally alone, has few friends (whether by design is unclear) and pours all of her time and energy into either work or gardening. I wanted to keep her company and give her someone to talk to for a while, and for the most part it has worked out well.

Except for one issue, the reason for this post. I've been worried about her drinking for a little while now, but I kept telling myself it wasn't as much of an issue as I thought it was, but I think that was wrong of me. She typically drinks five bottles of wine or so per week, and when I come home at least a couple nights a week she is slurring her words. Her job is stressful, and I know she needs to be able to unwind, but here's the big problem: I think she's drinking to the point of memory loss with some frequency.

I have a few examples of why I think this. She is a very schedule-oriented person, so she asks me what my plans are very often. Like, every day she asks what I'm doing and if my schedule will be changing, and every weekend she keeps close tabs on me. A couple weeks ago, her friend was in town for the weekend. My aunt has two cars, one that my younger cousin who still lives here on breaks uses which is automatic transmission, and my aunt's, which is manual. Now, when I talked with my aunt leading up to this weekend I was clear with her that I intended to be out of the house all day on Saturday, and until the evening on Sunday, but would be home Saturday night. However, Saturday evening around 7:00 she texted me to ask where I was and what time I'd be back. I told her I'd be back by midnight, and she barely responded. When I got home she was upset with me for not clearing it with her because her friend had wanted to borrow the automatic car but it was not there and she can't drive the manual. Again, I know that i was clear that I'd be out all day Saturday, and I had done this before without my aunt saying anything.

Tonight, a similar situation happened, though not as severe. I had come home from the liquor store one night with a bottle of red wine. My aunt, barely able to stand unsupported, gestured at the wine rack in the kitchen and told me explicitly that I was welcome to all the red wine there because she only drinks white wine. She pointed specifically at bottles that were gifts that she didn't want, but also told me that i was welcome to drink it because she didn't want it. Tonight, I had opened a bottle of said red wine and when she and I were talking, she told me that I needed to replace the wine I'd been drinking because I wasn't supposed to be drinking that one, I was only allowed to have the gifted red wine she didn't want. I stammered out an apology about the confusion and told her I'd replace it this weekend. These are just two examples of a confusion breakdown that has been a frequent trend of my stay here.

Reddit, I'm at a loss for what to do. One the one hand, I'm not upset at the communication issues. I don't feel I need justice for the perceived slights or what have you. I'm just concerned about how I can help my aunt, or if she even needs my help at all. Does this behavior seem worrying to others here? Should I be watching for anything else?
  
  ---   
TLDR: I'm staying with my aunt and I'm worried about her drinking and memory. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if there's a serious problem here. What do I do?"

But the job market has been cruel to me. I graduated with a Media Arts degree, I have an internship, and I work with freelancers at a hospital to make training videos for two days. But whenever I apply for a job in that field, I don't have the experience they are looking for. Therefore, whatever I have to offer is not enough to the people that are hiring. 

The grocery store I work at was shut down and I was transferred to another store. Except now, I am a janitor and I'm trying to enroll in a medical plan, but I keep hitting a wall with the website the company sent me to. I still have a job, but it's not one I enjoy or pays me well. I have been meaning to get training to become manager since I have 8 years seniority and a college degree. But the store closing down and me trying to find the right people to talk to has made this plan more difficult. If I become manager, I can have the money I need to become financially independent while looking to better myself in the field I studied for.

And my Nfamily is still a problem. They are upping their love bombing and gaslighting. They are acting nice towards me, but I see right through them. I can never trust them after the emotional and psychological abuse they put me through over the years. I always worry that at any given moment, they will stop love bombing me and go right back to the abuse. In the event that I do get the job I want/need to be independent and go NC, they will make me look like the bad guy even though I know what they have done to me.

Now that Thanksgiving is coming up, I sadly don't think I have much to be thankful for. I may have my own place, but my Nparents hold the money for it. I may have privacy, but the effects of their abuse still haunt my mind. I may have a job, but it's not enough to give me the money I need for financial independence. I may have a degree, but it doesn't mean much to the job market even if I have some work experience. Everything about this holiday has made me more depressed and the job I have and my futile job search has made me more stressed. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped. I feel like nothing will get better."
5d7pzj,146,2016-11-16,"For those who are having trouble finding summer internships, especially without experience: Apply to REUs",space_ink,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5d7pzj/for_those_who_are_having_trouble_finding_summer/,"REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates and is funded by the NSF. Here is the main list: [REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp) Last summer I had a REU and that experience is what got me my internship for this coming summer. I had no prior engineering work experience before last summer. Here are some thoughts:  

  -The application process is different than the majority of industry applications. For most applications you have to write a short essay and you need letters of recommendation. However, I have yet to see an REU require an interview of any sort. Customize each essay and get the best letters of recommendation that you can, even if they're not an engineering professor. None of my letters of rec were from engineering professors, two were from the humanities.  I simply wrote an essay, got letters of rec, applied and got in.

 -Don't just look in the engineering category. I was one of two engineering students, while the rest of the students were in the hard sciences. The REU I got wasn't even in the engineering category.   

 -Most REUs are geared towards people without any experience and/or geared towards minorities, women and people with disabilities.     

-You need to be a US Citizen since it's funded by the US gov't.

Edit: Some more tips from /u/SiTheGreat 
Tip: if there's a specific professor you want to work with that's associated with the REU program (most university pages give a list of potential PIs and their projects), email them and let them know that you're applying for their department's REU program and that you're interested in working with them specifically. They might decide to try to push you through. This worked for me.

Agree with not limiting yourself to the Engineering category (I did astrophysics); REUs are generally pretty prestigious, so it looks good on your resume no matter what you're doing. Also, apply to as many as catch your interest - between 6 and 13 was what most of the other REU students at my place applied for (I did 10 and only got into that one).

Edit2: From: /u/shl00  If you're Canadian, I believe the NSERC USRA (Undergraduate Student Research Award) is very similar! As a Software Engineering student I got one in Computer Science. It worked out for me because I (still) don't have any industry experience but I do have good grades (got it with an A- average)."

Also he just started with this company he's currently working at just last week. The reason it's a bit weird for me is I'm a recent grad looking for a job but I don't think going to a work environment will allow this(networking) naturally without having me explaining my reason at their workplace. Mind you this is a corporate tech setting. 

Said friend is extremely pushy and wants me to come with him in the morning and stay until his workday is done. 

What will I do for 9 hours? I'm not an employee there or an intern. I can't shadow people randomly. It's very awkward for me and them. I could just make friends but they have work to do.

These are the kind of thoughts that running through my head. 

I don't know what my friend is expecting that if I come to his work that I magically get a job with the company. 

Said friend is also much much older than me and doesn't take no for an answer. I like the guy and I see what he's doing to help me out but I don't know maybe this isn't right way to do it. 

Maybe I'm taking it all wrong and I should just go, what have I got to lose. 

The whole situation is kind of weird. Could you guys help me to make a decision, to say no or just along with it for a day. I'm in the west coast, so this is basically happening Wednesday morning. 

Thank you for all your help!!"

Im a Army veteran who unfortunately (at the time) got his career cut short due to medical retirement for bipolar disorder. The challenges I faced while getting out amounted to the fact that I drank to much of the koolaid. I had a TS, computer skills, some college; thought I was a shoe in for a government job. Well combine getting out with a kid on the way and no job prospects, this was a shit show. I writing this in hopes it will help someone, give them a different point of view maybe. I utilized my time during my out process and medical very wisely and I hope anyone else getting out does the same. I did all the resume courses offered, got additional help, went to every job fair, and just NETWORKED my ass off. Eventually I met someone who brought up a internship opportunity. It was for Homeland Security, so Im thinking ""holy god my prayers have been answered"", only catch...it was unpaid for a entire year! A unpaid job with a kid on the way does not sound so good, let me tell you. After months of looking for work while out processing, I sat down with my wife and decided to go for the internship, at least it would give me experience I thought. Well my son was born a week before I exited the military and the interview for the internship was the following month. I interviewed well and got accepted. Thankfully enough, through studying VA benefits I found out that VOCREHAB would cover the internship as on the job training, this was a life saver. So I opted for VOCREHAB for the year of the internship and was getting BAH as a payment. It was a tough year but we managed. After the internship I got offered a full time position within the Agency and its been great. I write all that to tell you to please Network, use all the benefits afforded to you; hell even Wounded Warrior Project helped me with some free IT schooling which defiantly helped on my federal resume. I havent served for as long, or seen as much as some of you, but I can tell you it gets better on the other side and please dont shy away from your benefits or job fares. To know more about this internship you can go to Ice.gov/HERO and its only for veterans (see if you can pic me out on the front page lol)"

Overall, I'm rather disappointed in myself and it just ends in this wild spiral of not doing more work. Another demotivating factor is when I look at some of my friends who have achieved things like internships or landed jobs at Google/MS/etc. when I've failed interviews time and time again.

- Learn more about machine learning and AI
- Learn how to draw

- Develop personal projects; I've got a lot of these that I want to do, but I never finish them completely or (lately for the past year and a half) get around to working on them

(Wall of Text incoming) Sorry for that and please ignore all my mistakes in the upcoming text - I wanna share all my thoughts and emotions with you and i guess this will be not that well structured :P

i think most of the people know me but i am not writing and commentating on reddit and general on Forums  etcpp that much but i am reading everything. 

I am Dennis ""TaKe"" Gehlen and i am the organizer behind the HomeStoryCup and tons of other Starcraft II Content together with my team. 


This is a very emotional situation for me and i wanted to write this already a few days ago but i didn t feel like it - it gave me a hard time to even think about what i could write.


Just tomorrow we will host the 14th edition of the HomeStoryCup which started as a fun project in 2010 with friends coming by to my 50m² appartment in Krefeld, Germany. 

I had guys like Socke, Demuslim, HasuObs, ret and Rotterdam at my place which i consider my friends and guys like Rotti even a very good friend which i almost only see at HomeStoryCup and even have a very close connection too.

I started this project without any idea where it could go ""TaKeTV"" a one man show after work (at that time i worked fulltime for ESL) 

I streamed every day and did youtube videos every day and kept awake at least 20 hours every day and slept around 3 hours a full year to produce Starcraft II Content and that 7 days a week and with my work which was also gaming i spent more than 100 hours every week in eSport/Gaming.

You know what? It felt great!!!, it didn t feel like work, it didn t feel like it was exhausting - It was my passion who kept me going every day and i wasn t tired of what i did.
 
I felt complete and i never regret spending so much time in just one thing and back then all earnings went to the company i was working for which was ESL but it was okay and even until today i never had the feeling to be treated bad cause i became an awesome opportunity which i would have never had if i wouldn t have worked for ESL at this time.

But it was time to became selfemployed and do all this stuff without a Boss behind me. 

I always have been the guy who had a strong opinion and high believe in what i think and always wanted to push my ideas and philosophie and to feel ""complete"" also for my private life i felt becoming my own boss is the right decision and thats what i did.

I moved to a 200m² appartment had my own studio with a gamingroom a productionroom which was my sleepingroom on the same time with nothing in it beside a bed and a livingroom which you might know as the old ""Chilloutarea"" of the older HomeStoryCups. 

I kept doing this almost 2 years and had a girlfriend living with me in this appartment. I have all this memories which i don t wanna miss - GO4SC2 Sunday Cups - After streaming saturday very late the only day i took time for my friends was this one and we went out for party and every sunday i was SUPER exhausted (we all know why) but i started streaming this sundaycup every sunday and didnt miss a single one for at least the first 2 years. I was still sleeping in my room with my girlfriend and one of my guys doing the production had to enter this room every sunday to do preperation and it gave me almost no privacy BUT - It was awesome - this experience - this live.

After this first 2 years i was so lucky to get my own appartment just 1 area above the Studio which i also used as a area for pros etcpp in future tournaments :P i couldnt stop sharing my place with all these awesome people meeting me at events.

One of my best nights in my life happened after a HomeStoryCup with a lot of awesome people like Stephano, Rotti, our old cook Carsten, Bling, Traidos our admin who still supports us and many many more. We were singing sunday night to monday morning karaoke with 10 people and more like the biggest idiots on earth BUT we we were no idiots - Just some kids having the best time you can imagine and not taking care of what other people think ( Including my neighbours :P)

Stuff which sometimes happens once in a lifetime and never happen this way again. Do you know what i mean? This one great day you never expected but happend and you can t create it again. I had so many of these days cause i m doing what i m doing. Loving this Gaming/eSportscene.

Next stop for me:
I actually grew with TaKeTV became eployees, internships, apprentianceships and started doing more content and also in other games like Hearthstone and also many people know the SeatStoryCup which is an event i almost have the same passion for as HomeStoryCup even if i dont play hearthstone myself. 

TaKeTV started doing productions at big events like Cebit, Gamescom and nowadays we do productions for big football clubs like VFL Wolfsburg or Sony Playstation, ESL or publisher like Ubisoft and also companies like Red Bull and others. 

We do all the audio, Video sometimes light and put together concepts and have lead on these projects which we also take care of and produce in the end of the day.

TaKeTV had its own studio around 100m² at Gamescom with a own booth - WTF!?!?! - We produced for 2K a huge company at Gamescom a second production and even had a third production with NEEDforSEAT where i did 100% of the planing and construction on 300m² together with my awesome team at TaKeTV and NEEDforSEAT.

We are filming for our city and cut together videos for them which i never expected in my life i / we would do.

I just created a new agency for consulting in gaming with a guy i met a few years ago doing marketing for Red Bull in the gamingsector and he is awesome and i have the chance to bring eSports to even more people and create more awesome products. We work with one of the most famous agencys in germany together who have a great network.

I am not sure if you know it but i also work very close for NEEDforSEAT who produce the gamingchairs and i sit beside the owner every week 2 days and do the PR / Marketing in Europe and also worldwide and get the trust to bring new employees in the company to make it even better.

I have a 2000m² location with all that stuff i always dreamed of like a Airhockeymachine, tablesocker, Dancemachine, an awesome TaKeTV Bar, a Professional gamingroom, MY OWN Cinema with awesome seats (Also lovechairs you should try them out) and many many other things i dont wanna miss.

Almost 30 people nowadays work for TaKeTV and most of them are fulltime and live from producing gamingcontent.

I would say i have a very cool appartment and even when i dont own a car myself i can rent nice cars from time to time and have a jacuzi at my place which is awesome.

Why am i telling you all this stuff?


I never never never expected this stuff to happen and when i started working fulltime i said to myself i don t need to earn big money if i have 2000€ every month at some point in my life i will have enough to have a good life and would be happy without any regrets.

It all ended different and there is one huge reason for that. It is YOU!!!!!! the Starcraft Community - All the people who supported me and TaKeTV over the last years who were watching what i loved to do and that is producing Starcraft Content and all the amazing gamingcontent.

I will never forget how i guess more than 100 people came to our new location when it was still in build and looked like a mess and so many people offered to work for free for us and really did that. WITHOUT YOU this location wouldnt be here and i know it and will never forget that. 

You guys / we known as gamerenthusiasts are awesome people with a philosophie and thinking i have never seen before.

I am very greatfull and have deep respect for all you guys supporting esport and in this case expecially TaKeTV.

All i do all the opportunites and everything i CAN do is because you gave me and TaKeTV the chance for that and i will never stop to give as much back as possible!

But i also have a bad news and you might have asked yourself why this topic and all he said had nothing to do with the topic ^^

I have been fighting to always get the budget for HSC for at least the last 4-5 HSC´s and it has been always a bad deal for us in case of economy.

Becoming bigger and more profesional and have people working fulltime and earning money makes an event like HomeStoryCup a little bit more expensive.

On the other side i have very very hard times find sponsors for HomeStoryCup and this time i took a very big risk cause we didnt have a mainsponsor until a week or two ago and if MIFcom wouldnt have said they will support us one more time as a mainsponsor i would have made a HUGE loss on this project.

We have and had always awesome partners supporting HSC but right now i wanna thank MIFcom 1000x times cause these guys support a product they love and they know that the invest is kinda high for a game / Viewers which are decreasing and if they look just at the numbers it is a bad invest for them and i know it, but they still sponsor it. You know why? Because of YOU! Because they have seen the great community and this event which is and always has been unique.

On the same time i wanna thank NEEDforSEAT who always have been supporting me without a question at any event i needed support. The owner never ever asked the question if this makes sense cause it is a tradition for him - When we had the first HSC it also helped him to start a business and it was the entrance for NEEDforSEAT in eSport. He is so loyal and i love this partnerships it feels like a marriage in good and bad times....:)

Thank you very much to NEEDforSEAT and MIFcom but also to all the other partners who are always supporting us.

But also for partners like this there is a limit and they have to think about money and even if they love this event they can not invest that much money in a product where they dont have a return they need. You can do that once or twice but at some point it hurts.

All these partners wanna keep working with us and invest in us but they also have to see how they can invest in the market and where it makes sense. 

What i wanna say is that we definitly SOMEHOW have a HomeStoryCup but having the same budgets of our sponsors we have right now will not happen and that means we most likely dont have the HomeStoryCup ""that big"" anymore.

This would / makes me very sad and i wanted to share this for you and i know this text is a HUGE WALL but i feel like i have to explain all of this to you. 

We had a great support of our community to donate for a lot of koreans to pay them flights / Hotels which i am very greatfull for and was SO awesome but this is just a ""kinda small cost"" of what we overall have with a 25 - 30 man crew working on it, the location, food, shuttles, prizemoney, external people etc etc etc


If there is a way to keep doing it I WILL and even if i have some losses I will do it! I will try to find new sponsors but i try to be realistic - It is not that easy nowadays. 
I will not stop doing Starcraft and not stop to do a HomeStoryCup but we have to see how we can do it in the future.

I hope you can understand my situation.


This was a very personal thing i shared but i shared it with my family and with the people who went this way with me all over the years and i seriously had tears almost coming out  of my eyes cause writing this reminded me on so many great memories i don t wanna miss.


With deep respect

When I initially applied for the role I was under the impression that it was an intern SWD role. However, I was told during the last interview that my main role would be QA and/or writing automated scripts and test cases; I'm not sure what to think about this. I'm currently a Junior in college and I've never had an internship, so ,when offered a year-long opportunity of learning, it's hard to pass up. 

So here I am, asking if y'all think I should continue towards this internship for what it is or decline and aim for something more programming related for the summer."
5d9uxe,3,2016-11-16,Equipment of a consultant?,KingOfTheStoneH,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/5d9uxe/equipment_of_a_consultant/,"Hi guys!

I'm going to start an internship in a few months at a consulting firm and because of past experiences I'm feeling pretty weird wearing a suit all day.

Until now I have had big problems fitting all my belongings (like wallet, keys and cellphone) into the pockets of my suit, which then looked pretty bulky and made me feel like they were going to drop out. I have been thinking about buying a shoulder bag instead of using my university backpack, but still: Most of the things that I need on me, will be in the bag which is a problem for me.

1) Do you have any recommendations? How do you handle this situation?

Secondly I am going to be at the customer's site from Monday till Thursday thus being in need of a trolley/suitcase/travel equipment (hand luggage size). My question to you is:

2) What do you use for your work travel? Is one trolley/suitcase/travel equipment (all hand luggage size) enough?

My last question concerns your travel equipment:

3) What are the most important unusual things to travel with in your opinion?

Thank you very much for your help!"

I am super fortunate to have offers from 3 of my top companies (Google, Dropbox, Snapchat). 

I was given the choice of doing 3 shorter internships (11, 12, 12 weeks) or any combination of the 2 for longer internships (~16, ~16). I currently have one significant internship at a large tech company (not Big 4) and will have one more 4 month after this. 

I feel that Dropbox/Snapchat would provide the best opportunity for me in developing my technical skills. However, I also really like the Google team I was placed with and a big part is that I will be able to live with my friends that I haven't gotten to see for a while since the Google campus is right next to my school.

I'm just seeking some advice on what to choose and why. Does the shorter duration strongly affect my projects/experiences? I really want to be able to stay with my friends and do all 3 although I don't feel that I need 5 companies on my resume when I graduate.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

5da7jk,2,2016-11-16,Anxiety and maybe ADHD.,lesightoday,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5da7jk/anxiety_and_maybe_adhd/,"This has been going on for nearly a year. I am tired and annoyed. 

A few details about myself - I am a single 29 year old African American woman. I am number three of four children. My dad died of cancer when I was eight. I have only brothers. My mom raised is alone (with the help of family) as a middle class family. My little brother came eight years after me and I've always felt tension between us. Tangentially, I now fell awful about how I treated him most of his childhood. He's 21 now. Anyway, I have a master's degree and a pretty good job.

My family always said my female cousins and I are high strung, I've mostly ignored that though I can see it. One of my cousin's was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, another takes anxiety and depression meds regularly.  My problems started after i graduated from my bachelor's program.

I was unable to find a job after graduation, so I worked in customer service. BAD IDEA. I have an attitude, I don't like people who don't get things and blah blah. I would get coached about how I talk to people, eventually I started having panic attacks with numb hands, heart palpitations, unease etc. Went to a doctor who prescribed Prozac and Xanax when needed. 

Got into grad school, quit that job. Did fine mostly. Average A-/B+ student without trying. Had a year long internship that has now turned into a full time job. This is my first real full time professional job. 

Here is my struggle. I am smart, competent, and eager to learn. This job fits my personality to a T. But I struggle. I don't feel like I'm doing a good job, I don't think I'm doing my job efficiently or quickly. My boss is great, knows I have anxiety and never pressures me. I'm not sure if this is good or bad. Anyway, last December I went to my GP with my fears about being fired because I can't concentrate. He prescribed Prozac and Xanax and told me to go to a psych. 

It took me a while to find a psychiatrist, went to her for a total of four months. Because I lack motivation and don't like people she said I might be bi polar. I'm not. So to begin she put me on effexor and then abilify and then lumectal. So three drugs that weren't doing anything for me and didn't address my concentration issues. She also prescribed another pill that in forgetting at the moment, typically it's given to children with ADHD. Guarex I think. I didn't pick that up as i went to see another psychiatrist.

I went to see another psychiatrist, well, psychiatric NP. I told her my background and she had me fill out some things and said that I display characteristics of ADHD from what she's observed and from the sheet I filled out. She then immediately prescribed Vyvanse, dosed me up to 60mg. That was over a period of about two months. It did nothing for me. So when I went back in she said stop taking that and maybe I have high something where I'm at a constant level of elevated anxiety. I'll call and ask what she said but after prescribed lexapro. I'm on 20 mg of that. Will try it for a month. She said sometimes high anxiety can interfere with concentration and motivation. 

I know I like my job I just great I'm not doing enough or well enough. I know my boss would tell me if I weren't but it bothers me that I'm not performing at the level I want to perform at. Am I lazy or just unable to do certain things? I'm used to coasting buy not now that I have something I value ( my job). I'm testing for ADHD on Friday.

TLDR:  struggling with work concentration, doctor thinks it's anxiety. I'm not sure how anxiety manifests itself but it's going on a year and I can't figure out how to concentrate at work and perform at the level in which I want and know I should. Vyvanse didn't work and am currently on lexapro. I'm not sure if it's just in my head or if I have a mental disorder. It's bothersome."

I am having issues finding a job in accounting. I do not have any actual real world experience in working in accounting. I did not do any internships while in school, I did not participate in accounting clubs or made any professional connections, looking back those were bad moves. In general I was hitting the books keeping my head down and trying to do well in all of my classes. Based on the results now, I should have participated in accounting clubs for the professional connections, and I should have done an accounting internship, and said F**k the other classes, but whatever that part is over.

I am looking for help finding a job in California in the Los Angeles/ Long Beach/South-Bay area. Your feedback is appreciated.

Also for anyone reading this in a similar job search situation, this is what I have learned from over 6 months of the job search. You will need the following skills at least, and I am not saying I have all these skills but I am working on learning them. I do not recall any accounting professor relaying this information or any useful job information other than ""join the accounting club"", so here it is:

Accounting Skill = General Theory and Purpose of Accounting
Accounting Skill = Perform Accounts Payable
Accounting Skill = Perform Accounts Receivable
Accounting Skill = Perform Bank Reconciliations
Accounting Skill = Bookkeeping Journal Entries
Accounting Skill = Financial Analysis

Software Skills = Intuit Quickbooks
Software Skills = Excel vLookups
Software Skills = Excel hLookups
Software Skills = Excel Pivot Tables

In 2013 I quit martial arts, something I did for 9 years. It was a few months before my 21st birthday and I was lost, I didn’t know who I was without martial arts. It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I had never felt more alone.

One night I was alone at home flipping through channels with nothing to watch. I watched a movie called The Internship a month or so earlier and remembered that the cute nerdy boy was on a show called Teen Wolf. At the time MTV put up all the episodes of Teen Wolf onDemand so I thought why not? So I started season 1. I laughed genuine laughter for the first time in months; I didn’t want to fall asleep alone so I kept playing episodes until my eyes couldn’t stay open. The next morning I woke up and continued watching. It’s been three years now. 

Last night the first episode of the last season premiered. I realized how much this show has meant to me, it was there for me while I found who I was, it was my safe haven during the darkest of times. I know it must sound so lame reading this, but it is true. Teen Wolf is definitely one of the reasons I am who I am today. I am going to enjoy this last season and really absorb every minute of it. But it’s hard, and I’m sad. It’s like I’m mourning a friend. 

Thank you Teen Wolf for saving my life, and being an anchor. I’ll miss you.

Any advice would be appreciated!

I am currently a 5th-year senior at a major public university, and I'm on track to graduate this coming May. I will be graduating with majors in philosophy and mathematics, and my GPA will likely be in the good but not great 3.3-3.4 range. 

I am finding that one of the career paths I'm most drawn to (among a couple others) is a career in public policy. I have been really interested in politics since middle school, and I have followed it closely for a long time. If I did decide to enter public policy as a career, my short-term goal would be to just get an entry-level position in public policy, and I think my long-term career goal would be to work on the policy teams of a Governor or Mayor or other policy-makers, or work for a think tank, or as a high level policy analyst. However, my current knowledge about public policy is amateurish and wide but shallow, and while I think my two majors have given me a lot of skills that would be useful in a public policy job (critical thinking, analytical writing, reading dense texts, some quantitative skills, etc.), I don't have much formal education in public policy itself.

Furthermore, I just don't have much work/internship experience at all (long story short, for most of college I dealt with various mental health issues, severe social anxiety chief among them, that prevented me from getting work experience), and my education, while I think it has been very good and valuable, has been very much at the theoretical level in both majors. I only have a little experience with databases or programming, for example, despite my math major.

I am scrambling at the moment to apply for internships in public policy for the coming spring semester, but there frankly aren't that many locally and I worry that my lack of formal education on politics and the social sciences will hinder me here.

So I guess I have a couple questions: Can I realistically get from where I am now to an entry-level job in public policy in the near future? If so, how?

Do I need to go to graduate school to achieve either the short-term or long-term goals here? "

But I feel like I'm not getting better. And I can't stop feeling like the trauma, my anxiety, the ""triggers"" aren't legitimate and that other people feel that way too.

I know it's only been four months since I started getting psychiatric help. I tried one medication and it made me more suicidal. I'm starting another now. They found no personality disorders, although I used to be sure that they would. Just the anxiety and depression. 

I realized I have very strong... anxious? episodes that are set off by some trigger that has to do with something from my n-childhood. I feel like when I tell therapists/psychiatrists this, they just say ""okay"". They can't seem to tell me what it is, or if it's legitimate, I'm always trying to read whether they think I'm just being a little bitch and complaining about mild problems when I have no serious disorder. I hope that doesn't sound like I'm invalidating the rest of you -- it's just what I'm always afraid of, always perceiving. I don't even feel like I ""deserve"" to use the word ""trigger"" -- I only do so because it's the one mental health professionals have used when paraphrasing what I've said back to me.

Recently I went through one of those episodes, a particularly bad one. I scratched up both arms and slammed my head on a wall. I gave myself a concussion and was told to go to the doctor just to be safe, and I felt so incredibly judged. I just feel like through all this people are just... disapproving. Unimpressed, if that makes sense. Like I'm just a whiny teenager who can't handle insignificant problems. The self-harm scars that are proof to myself are signs of instability, weakness, silliness to others. But they're medical professionals, right? I'm sure they wouldn't intend to convey that message, and it's likely I'm just perceiving it because I expect it. But I can't ever know.

And I hate that part, just as much. That I can't trust my own mind. That I can't remember things correctly, that I interpret things in ways that they didn't really happen, that I think people are trying to hurt or accuse me when they aren't. That when I'm set off in one of those episodes, I think everything is horrible and death is the only good option. And when I'm better again, I can't remember what I was thinking, or what set me off in the first place. And the vague impression that things that really were terrible *did* happen to me in my childhood, but I can't remember any to prove it.

I feel like a failure. I worked so hard in high school to be admitted to one of those top tier colleges I was always pressured to aspire to. And then one year in, I had to withdraw because everything was too much. I wanted to die, I hated myself, I became too depressed to do work for a week at a time. I would have failed my classes if I stayed in them. But everyone else is still in the race, taking the classes I should've been taking, talking about internships and jobs. It's one of those schools where you're constantly hearing about how amazing everyone is. How they're so smart, so talented, so hardworking -- all the things they've done and achieved and how impressive they are. 

It's obnoxious to hear me say it, I'm sure, but I hate that I'm not there and that I could've been there. I hate that no one has anything good to say about me, because I'm not doing anything or talking to anyone. I'm sitting at home slamming my head into the wall until the pain goes away and taking medications that don't work and feeling like I'm just making it all up when I don't have any real problems. 

I just want a success. I want something to go right. A medication to work. To do well in something, maybe a class, if I were in class. I want someone to be proud of me. I want to feel like a single thing is going right. I want to feel like I'm not wasting space and food. I want to feel like other people at this school respect me, think I'm good at something. I want to believe that I'm overcoming something real, that I've done something difficult, that it's okay I'm behind everyone else. But I can't. I just feel like a failure. "

I'm 21 and in my 4th year of university. I'm in a business degree. However, last year I added a CS major too. 

My parents are mad. I've dropped 4 classes since adding the CS major, the workload is overwhelming doing both of these degrees. They say I'm wasting money, and I should have tried to finish the courses with Ds. My cumulative GPA is about 3.4/4, and I'd like to keep grad school as an option in the future. I felt like Ws are better than Ds, if I'm better prepared for next time.

- The first 2.5 years of school, I took a full course load while working part time and finding an internship one summer.
- After this time, I started trying to work towards a CS major too. I resigned from my job, I knew it was going to be tough to do a double major:

Jan-Apr, 2016: 5 courses enrolled, 3 passed (2 business Ws)

May-August, 2016: 3 CS courses passed

Sept-Dec, 2016: 5 courses enrolled, I'm going to pass 3 (2 CS Ws)

I got great marks in everything that I've done so far, but 4 Ws are horrible. :[

----

I feel like crap about this, but I think it's better to drop instead of barely holding onto a passing D through the term. I didn't feel like I had as much time as I thought I would, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Here's what I got so far:

- Next term, I plan on taking 4 courses instead of 5 (retaking two of the Ws), and then I'll be done the original degree minus two electives. The prof is horrible though, but he's the only one who teaches these courses (he's just extremely difficult).

- I'll need 2 electives to graduate, so I thought I'd take 2 CS courses in summer term (retaking one W) to finish the degree with a minor in CS. The summer professor is MUCH better than the one I have currently, and I can work on finding a job while finishing up the degree.

- I'll figure out what I want to do after that. I'll have 10 more courses to go for a general CS degree, if I want to finish the second major.

---

I don't feel like my dad will understand. I've offered to pay for summer, since he told me that he'll pay for 4 years of school and that's it. Which is fine with me... but he's disappointed that I'm wasting money.

I pieced together this story over many years of bits and pieces from my mom, but will be telling it in chronological order. 

This all starts with my parents' engagement in Russia (both Russians, I am also born and raised). My dad was madly in love but my mom was hesitant. My dad said if my mom declined his proposal he would jump off the balcony of the 5th floor apartment they were in. So she agreed. 

Not even a year later I was born and my parents moved out together into a university residence room. 

My dad was always busy studying or away on conferences or at school, basically he wasn't around. My mom spent most of her time with my grandma and my dad would visit after school. Once a month he would buy me a book or some other small gift with the little money he could spare. Keep in mind this is post-soviet Russia with a weak economy. 

Fast forward a couple years and my dad had convinced my mom to move to a significantly larger city, an 8 hour train ride away from their hometown. My dad had been offered an internship there and wanted to move badly, so my mom agreed. 

We lived in a tiny suburb town separated from the city by woods and a dirt road. Both my parents worked in the local administration and I was left home alone every day at age 4. 

We kept moving around the suburbs of the large city every year or so, until another big change happened. My dad got offered a very good (by the standards of the time) position and once again we moved. My mom didn't have to work now, so she stayed home with me. This was when she started suspecting him of cheating because of finding some Skype conversations I think. I remember them fighting in the kitchen and seeing my dad cry for the first time ever. I suspect this is when their separation started, but I didn't find out until much later. 

Ever since then, they would fight constantly and it became almost a routine. My mom would constantly apologize to me for it, and since my dad was never around I only got her point of view. Me and my mom were always very close, and on multiple occasions she noted that she almost sees me as a friend (which I still find weird). 

My dad was always the bad guy in her eyes, and consequently in mine. I didn't question the situation and seeing my dad constantly upset and drinking regularly only supported the idea in my mind. We didn't talk much, or have much in common, and frankly I never felt a connection with him at all. 

Fast forward to a few years back, my dad had received yet another job offer and off we went to Siberia. From there, the job required him to be in constant travel all over the country (and often outside of it) so once again me and my mom were left alone. She had a few part time jobs here  and there, but the vast majority of the income still came from my dad. 

After a year of living in Siberia my dad's life long dream came true. He was presented with an opportunity to move to the far off land of Canada and of course he took it without hesitation. Countless trips to all sorts of examinations and offices, and we were boarding a plane to a connecting flight to Moscow. 

My mom was only on board with the idea because it would give me a brighter future. 

Not even a full two months after we landed in Canada, my dad was sent away two provinces across because the position in our province of residence was not available. Once again, only me and my mom. 

This is when everything crashed and burned. My mom went off to college in hopes of starting a  new career here. While there, she met a South American (married) man who with his exotic looks and charm had stolen her breath away. Later on, she recounted their first memories together and how amazing it was to be in love again. 

My dad came home for New Years celebration. Over dinner my mom said that she wanted another child. Me and my dad were pretty shocked and my parents fought again every day that they were together. My dad left after a week or so. 

A few months after that I came home from school once day to find that the front door of our apartment was locked with the little chain that allows you to only open it a bit. I was super confused since we never use that thing. My mom came out of her room hastily tying a bathrobe, opened the door, and told me to go to my room. I did and she closed my door. I heard another person coming out from her room and leaving the apartment. Through all this I was super shocked. I'd never suspected anything like this. Conveniently, that was when my mom decided to inform me of her and Dad's separation. 

In hindsight, the new information honestly didn't shock me as much as it probably should have. I accepted it and didn't put much thought into it. 

A position in our province of residence opened up, and my dad came back. After another couple days of fighting my mom kicked him out and he was forced to rent a room in the neighborhood. Keep in mind my dad still paid for our rent and everything. 

My mom got pregnant with a child of her new romantic interest. I noticed that the menstrual products weren't being replaced as often and pieced together some clues. By the time she told me, I already knew. 

I felt betrayed, as if I wasn't enough for her anymore. I guess I became too much of a friend and not enough of a daughter. I moved past it, even was excited for the baby. 

The father of the baby got caught with my mom. His wife made their whole family move to another province and cut ties with my mom. This has caused a bunch of legal trouble with custody and travel outside the country. 

Fast forward to today: we live in a house where my dad pays for mortgage and bills but lives in the basement with no kitchen or shower. My mom's income consists of child support, child benefits from the government, and spare money from her rare part time shifts. She is heartbroken and I suspect was depressed or maybe even still is. She said the South American man was her best love and now wants to move to where he left (they had regained contact through lawyers) and find him again. 

My dad is always alone in the basement as my mom basically hates his guts and doesn't talk to him unless absolutely necessary. He helps babysit my sister sometimes and she receives the attention of the father I never had. My mom is always complaining about the house and seemingly nothing  is good enough for her. My dad even got her a car and tries to help out in material ways all the time. My mom recently applied for welfare housing because she doesn't want to live here anymore, but I would stay with my dad in the house as they still share custody of me. 

What my problems are: 

- guilt over my father being so blatantly mistreated 

- but also my mom being mistreated by my dad?

- who is even the bad guy here and is there one?

- how do I feel welcome in my own home when I don't even feel like their kid anymore 

- how do I try to maintain my relationship with my dad who is a very cynical and generally pessimistic person whom I don't have a connection with? 

- I can't for the life of me understand why my dad is being such a doormat in the whole thing, supporting my mom when she clearly barely wants anything to do with him 

Any other related advice or comments are greatly appreciated. Sorry for the super long write up. 

TL;DR emotionally abusive dad forces mom to marry him, is suspected of cheating, moves the family to another country; mom finds a new partner, leaves dad, gives birth to new partner's child, moves into a new house with dad and hates his guts; dad still supports mom financially even though she wants nothing to do with him.

But I just received an interview offer from a small local company to intern during the school year. I've never actually interned before so I was wondering if having 2 internships would be better than just 1, even if the 1 would be from a well known company. I'll be applying for new grad positions next year, so I do want my resume to be the best that it can be, but I'm not sure how much an internship from an unknown company can help. Personally, I'd rather not do the internship at the small company because I know that it'll probably have a negative impact on my grades, but if it'll be a significant resume boost I'm willing to do it.

On a side note, the small company has thrown a few red flags. First of all, they offered me an interview without even looking at my resume. Second of all, I wouldn't be getting paid, but instead I'd be receiving school credit. Third of all, they asked me if I would be going to be staying in the area after I graduate. Personally I thought that was the weirdest of all of them because I'm a 3rd year, how would I know whether I'd be staying or not?

Any thoughts on what I should do? "

Do you think I'll still get internships, or are employers really strict on GPA restrictions? Anyone got any success stories about pulling off a sweet internship with like a 2.5 GPA?

5dd5v3,2,2016-11-16,Leave college for $85k + equity &amp; benefits at stealth blockchain startup in the bay area?,Dave_the_Pigeon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5dd5v3/leave_college_for_85k_equity_benefits_at_stealth/,"I've had a pretty different experience in college, going to Northeastern University in Boston.  Initially I came in as a mechanical engineering major, switched to computer engineering (didn't lose any credits).  I liked physics and circuits but it just wasn't something I enjoyed enough to continue.  So I took about 6 months off to figure things out (considered transferring to a school closer to home in TX). 

I ended up snagging an internship at a really small software startup back home (austin TX) for a few months, boss agreed I had a bit of a knack for software dev.  I decided to return to Boston in the summer, only had one applicable class to take in order to transfer to computer science at Northeastern.  I took that one class and with a bit of effort landed a job as an intern at an Tech Stars startup, continued working for them until August of 2016 (they currently reside at the Harvard Innovation Lab).  My time their gave me some serious data science experience, including machine learning and NLP.  Got to work with a previous amazon AI engineer and a PHD from CSAIL working on machine learning integrations which was pretty cool.

Fast forward to current.  I've really been disenfranchised with my CS education.  Grading criteria is idiotic, and my side interests in blockchain work have only been getting stronger.  All started when I got involved with the Ethereum community back in 2014.  Long story short with my major change and time off I still have about 3.75 semesters left before graduation.

I was really fed up and mentally not in a great place, thinking about how much I enjoy working (in contrast to school) I decided to start contacting recruiters I knew in the space along with prior connections  and spammed angellist a bit.

Within the week I had 7 interviews, 4 offers came back.  2 were very early stage startups on the west coast (both blockchain related) their offers were good, however, I don't have a lot of cash on hand and early stage startups are risky (especially those without funding).  I got another offer from a more established blockchain startup that was profitable and shipping (est. valuation of $5mil).  I had some of the hardest technical interviews I've encountered yet but managed to make it through.  By some act of god they liked my projects and were impressed with my blockchain knowledge.  This is coming from the founders, all of which are Stanford PHD's.

So, their offer was $5k for the first two ""trial months"".  After that they said I can either decide to go back to NU or come on full time as employee #4 with a starting salary of $85k with healthcare (PPO plan) and 1% equity (with a very liberal vesting cycle).

I'm definitely on the fence as to if I really want to leave college or not.  Worst case I can look at this as a solid 6-8 month internship (unfortunately NU won't let me use this as a co-op since it's so time sensitive and my co-op cycle wont allow for it).

What do you guys think?  I just don't have a great idea of what dev salaries outside of the big 4 are in the bay area / what median starting salaries for college grads are.  My biggest angle here is that this is an entry into an industry with huge potential, at a startup working in the blockchain space actually selling something outside of the financial space while also turning a profit.  This is exactly what I'd do in 2yrs if / when I graduated.

It was my first week back to school, after a summer long bullshit internship so a couple of the boys and I hit the pool at one of the nicer apartment complexes on campus. Had grabbed a couple 30 racks and planned on floating around the pool for a couple hours before we went back to take a nap and get ready for the night. As soon as we get to the pool we notice a few girls that looked like either strippers, porn stars or hookers or a combination of the three. After a few rounds of beers, two of us muster up the courage to go ask these girls if they wanted a beer. Long story short we end up getting their numbers and archived for a 3 am booty call. After a week and a half long bender through syllabus week, and school slightly becoming a requirement to attend, I ran into these broads on campus. The girls called me out immediately for not texting them back so I gave them my number so they could call me. No less than 6 hours later, I get invited to have a couple cocktails with one of the girls"". I decided to take her up on the opportunity and meet her at her apartment at about 10. I had a few shots of whiskey and took half of a Mexican Cialis I had left over from last trip we took to Mexico. I had one of my good buddies drop me off and wish me luck. When I rang her on her buzzer, she came down wearing a naughty nurse outfit. She threw me into the elevator and starting blowing me in the elevator. At this point I was completely taken by surprise and just went with it. After we got to her apartment she brought me right up to her bedroom and started strip teasing for me and pouring us a few a cocktails. By this point the cialis had kicked in and I was fully torqued and ripping the rest of her clothes off. This girl was one of the crazier girls in bed I've ever been with. She was begging me to throat fuck her, choke her, she rode me like a champ and after about 30 minutes of fucking, I knew being slightly intoxicated, and with cialis coursing through my veins, there was no shot I was finishing. But she demanded she could get the job done. She went into the bathroom and came out with a bottle of lube, her vibrator and a butt plug. By this time I was starting to get freaked out, but she started blowing me again, using the vibrator on my balls, and she lubed up the butt plug and put it in her ass. She wanted me to fuck her in the ass, which usually being drunk I would have been all for, but starting to sober up and slightly coming to reality I decided I needed another drink. So I went to the bathroom real quick to take a piss and grab a glass of water. When I came back, she had a jack and Coke poured for me and I laid down and she started blowing me again. This time while blowing me, she starting squirting lube all over so I could fuck her in the ass. While taking a sip of my drink I notice a pill floating in my drink.... I immediately spit it out and asked her what the fuck she put in my drink!!! She started breaking down and crying and confessed to putting a Xanax in my drink to loosen me up because I seemed so tense... I had enough at this point. All covered in lube, sweat and who knows what else, I jumped in the shower to rinse off before I called my buddy to pick me up. While showering, she came and begged me to stay and started blowing me again. At this point I wanted nothing to do with her, so I jumped out of the shower and starting walking down the stairs. Halfway down she grabbed me and started blowing me again... as hard as I was to resist I had to decline and leave. So I told her I had fun and we could do this again. The next thing I know the bitch pushed me and I'm going head over heels down the stairs with my drawers around my ankles!! I ran out of there as fast as I possibly could. The girl then texted me the following morning and had no idea what had happened and wanted to make it up to me sometime...."

Just really tedious stuff but I loved it. 

A few months passed and I started to delve into what it would take to get some where in their field. Realizing that most of it was course or certification based I looked into getting certified. I loved the idea of ""offensive"" networking, so I looked into things like Kali and other tools.

Searching further I found Cisco and their certifications seemed like a standard in the industry. Searching into it I came across CCNET and CCNA certifications for entry level positions. I was curious what I should do, where to begin with all of this. It seems really overwhelming.

5de5lb,0,2016-11-17,"My [21M] girlfriend [21F] of 4 years have been living together for four months, and she wants to move out but continue dating since she feels she needs space.",moveoutproblem12,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5de5lb/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_of_4_years_have_been_living/,"Hey guys, throwaway here + wall of text. I will still respond to any and all comments, it's just too many people I know know my Reddit username.
 
My girlfriend and I have been living together for four months now out of our four year relationship. We've been happy enough together, dating, doing chores equally. She's said I've been the best roommate shes ever had. We were friends before, we seldom fight, and we're extremely good at communicating. There's only one issue: She's recently fallen out of love with me. This isn't something new, we both know that we can fall in and out of love with each other, but it's part of a relationship to stay strong with that person and persevere. In the past I have been not the most involved person, but I've always made sure to look out for her needs and make sure she's happy. She's currently feeling extremely guilty that she's not interested in sex, or having me kiss her. Basically anything that isn't comforting about the state of our relationship, she's not into.
 
She thinks moving out this January will smooth things over, as she will have more space, and thus yern for me more. However, we already don't see each other much since we're both busy with school, work volunteering, etc. We even got the two bedroom apartment because we knew we might want some space (And we've used it, lots). We have a our date nights, and we hang out sometimes on the weeknights and weekends, but we also both come home late sometimes, and she goes to sleep early and wakes up early. (I'm a night owl).
 
I've looked these kinds of scenarios up online, and it's my understanding that relationships where the couple are not good roommates can benefit from un-moving-in, but relationships where it's an issue with the actual relationship usually falls out from this. I'm really interested in making this work, and she says she is too, but she's resisting as she feels this is our current best option. I'm not a ""feelings"" kind of person, but I feel like these last couple months have made our relationship stronger , and I've felt emotions I honestly didn't think I would feel (As lame as that sounds). I actually miss her when she's out, I think about her often, and I'm happy when we get to spend time together. I'm afraid if we move out, I will regress to that old, less-emotional state and then we're surely done.
 
I've tried to convince her of anything: That I can sleep in the other bedroom for a while, that we can minimize our interactions outside of 3-4 days a week, basically anything that will simulate moving out without actually having to do it. I feel like if we go through with this, it's a massive step back and I don't want to be sitting around like some lost puppy hoping she falls back in love with me.
 
She's assured me that this isn't part one of a two part breakup plan, but even if it isn't, I don't know if I'm emotionally strong enough to let this run it's course. I'm a wreck, and my school, work, and internship interviews have been a mess because of this.
 
She says her brother did the exact same thing, but that relationship ended shortly after they moved out. I've also expressed that I'm open to a break in this relationship, despite how childish that sounds. We can re-evaluate how we think about each other after this term (four months) have finished, but honestly I think we both know what will happen if we do that.
 
I'm all ears for people if they think this will actually help, but I don't know if I can stomach living in this relationship limbo land any longer than the month we've got left until we need to decide if we want to live together (And then longer if we decide to keep the relationship going).
 
TL:DR GF of 4 years, roommate of 4 months, wants to move out because she feels it will make our relationship strong. I feel this is tearing out relationship apart, and I don't want to extend this part 1 of 2 breakup any longer."
5decay,1,2016-11-17,39 M4W - Cheating with Someone Younger,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5decay/39_m4w_cheating_with_someone_younger/,"When we first met you were impressed, and more than a little intimidated, by the way I carried myself. How I treated my employees. My wife. The women I fucked on the side.
Were it not for my mood swings and, for lack of a better word, bossiness, your internship was perfectly uneventful. And, really, my boorishness was never truly directed at you. In fact, nothing was really directed at you. Aside from the few menial tasks I sent your way, I generally ignored you.

Sometime near the end of your internship, something changed. You don't know exactly what made you say it--maybe it was the argument you had with your boyfriend that morning. Maybe you had just had enough of seeing me swagger around, day in and day out.
""Grab me a coffee,"" I said, not even looking you in the eye. ""Oh, get it yourself,"" you said. ""And get me me one while you're at it,"" you said under your breath as I walked away.

You didn't know what to expect. You spent the next ten minutes chewing me out in your head, saying everything you've been thinking these past few months. Whatever you could have expected, it wasn't this: the cup of coffee I set gently on your desk.
Things were noticeable different from that moment on. Each day, there would be a cup of coffee waiting for you at your station. Your ideas were taken seriously. If you dropped a pen, I was on my knees ready to pick it up for you before it hit the ground. It was pretty obvious you had me wrapped around your finger.

So that's the set up. Let's see how far you can take me. Orgasm denial, forced bisexuality, whatever you can come up with. Make me write your name on my cock and have me fuck my wife. Own me.
While roleplay can be fun, I want you to mostly play you, and I will mostly play me. And I really want to do the things you ask me to do (go ahead, demand proof). I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you are a younger woman who has always wanted to completely boss an older guy around, now's your chance.

Thanks for reading!"

5det9k,103,2016-11-17,RBTV Content-Evaluation ist wenig aussagekräftig und gefährlich,guy_with_gnu,rocketbeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketbeans/comments/5det9k/rbtv_contentevaluation_ist_wenig_aussagekräftig/,"TL;DR: Die große Content-Evaluation ist zu oberflächlich und beantwortet wenige Fragen (insb. zum ""Content""). Aus den Antworten wird nicht ersichtlich werden, wie Inhalte verbessert werden können bzw. was falsch gemacht wurde. Die Interpretation der Daten im ""[Moin Moin 16.11.16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQnwXkO-2qA)"" ist ebenfalls fraglich.

(EDIT) Da hier einige meinen Punkt missverstanden haben: Ich habe nichts dagegen, dass Daten erhoben werden (finde die Idee sogar sehr gut) und ich weiß auch von der internen Analayse. Ich wollte nur darauf hinweisen, dass die Umfrage durch die aufgezählten Mängel keine gute Datenbasis für Entscheidungsfragen ist. Wenn die Datengrundlage verfälscht sind, ist es egal ob der Hausmeister, die Bohnen oder ein Big-Data-Rechenzentrum die Umfrage auswertet. (EDIT)

**Die Eingangsfrage**

&gt;Welcher Wert von RBTV ist für unsere Inhalte am wichtigsten?

Hier wurde mehrere Antwortmöglichkeiten zugelassen, was problematisch ist, weil in der Frage explizit nach EINEM Wert (Singular), welcher AM WICHTIGSTEN ist. Simon erklärt zwar im [Moin Moin](https://youtu.be/d3c1lGD8aAM?t=13m12s), warum die Frage so gestellt wurde, aber nicht jeder schaut die Sendung live oder wartet auf den Youtube-Upload. Dadurch verfälscht sich das Ergebnis, u.a. weil nicht jeder weiß wie die Frage zu interpretieren ist.

Zudem werden die 5 Begriffe nur in der Eingangsfrage verwendet und dann nicht wieder aufgegriffen, von einigen Ausnahmen abgesehen. Dabei wäre gerade hier eine tiefergehende Befragung nötig, da die Begriffe sehr subjektiv ausgelegt werden können. Welche Art von Humor ist gemeint? Ist es ein Prank/Wir-reißen-auf-der-Gamescom-Frauen-auf-Humor oder der Humor einer bestimmten Person (z.B. Eddy,Budi,Nils,Simon)? Was ist authentisch an RBTV? Was ist mit professionell gemeint? Ist Liveprogramm schin Interaktivität oder doch eher Mitmachfernsehen wie Chatduell/Verflixxte Klixx? Darauf bekommt man keine Antwort.

Gerade jetzt wo die Umfrageergebnisse präsentiert werden, schreiben viele Leute ins Forum/Reddit, wie sie die Begriffe interpretiert haben. Dies sollte aber schon in der Umfrage klargestellt sein, da ansonsten eine nachträgliche Erklärung gar nichts bringt.

Die große Uneindeutigkeit bei der Interpretation zieht sich dementsprechend durch die Formatbewertung.

**Keine Kriterien für die Formatbewertung**

Mal ganz abgesehen von dem Problem mit den schweizerischen Noten, lässt die Bewertung mit Schulnoten einfach zu viel Interpretationsspielraum. Hat derjenige bei der Abstimmung die handwerkliche Qualität des Formats bewertet oder den Unterhaltungswert? Wird eine schlechte Note gegeben, weil man die Sendung nicht schaut, weil einem der Moderator nicht gefällt oder weil man einem das Konzept nicht gefällt? Bestes Beispiel ist Simon der die Umfrage [ausfüllt](https://youtu.be/d3c1lGD8aAM?t=30m24s): Brett &amp; Breakfast gibt er eine ""4"", weil es schon Almost Plaily gibt. Hammertime ist super, weil Ian es macht, deshalb ""1"". Klar, Simon übertreibt in seinen Begründungen auch ein wenig, aber er zeigt, dass die Notenvergabe unglaublich subjektiv ist.

Um das Beispiel Schulnoten aufzugreifen: Auch hier gibt es festgelegte Kriterien für mündliche Bewertung und Klausurnoten (auch wenn sich nicht immer daran gehalten wird).

**Warum Formate gut/schlecht sind, lässt sich nicht erkennen**

Aus dem vorherigen Punkt ergibt sich folgendes Problem: Man kann nicht erkennen warum Formate gut ankommen oder was ihnen fehlt. Gerade diese Information ist für zukünftige Entscheidungen besonders wichtig. Bestes Beispiel sind die ""RBTV News"", die anscheinend für ein ""Making Of""-Format eingestampft werden sollen. Ob das überhaupt der Grund ist, warum das Format schlechte Bewertungen hat wird aus den Daten nicht ersichtlich.

Was ist denn mit den Formaten, die mit ""2-3"" bewertet wurden? Wie kann man die zu einem ""1er"" machen? Welche Stärken sind da, welche Schwächen? All das wäre interessant gewesen, wurde aber nicht erhoben. Damit wird eigentlich die ganze Umfrage hinfällig, weil nur die Beliebtheit eines Formats gemessen wurde.

**Keine Unterscheidung in Gelegenheitsgucker/Poweruser von Formaten**

Seit der Umstellung zu Youtube hat RBTV mit einem Zushauerschwund im Stream zu kämpfen, weshalb ja mal interessat wäre, welche Formate Zuschauer zum Einschalten animieren. Dieser Umstand wird von der 2ten Umfrage gestreift, in der gefragt wird:

&gt;Angenommen, du hättest die freie Auswahl: Auf welcher Plattform würdest du Rocket Beans TV am häufigsten anschauen?

In den Antwortmöglichkeiten ist nur von ""Stream"" die Rede. Leute, die On Demand schauen werden gar nicht zu ihren Gründen befragt. Dadurch bleiben wichtige Erkenntnisse aus, z.B. ob ein bestimmtes Format live sehr beliebt ist und Zuschauer in den Stream locken kann. Oder ob ein Format On Demand sehr gerne geschaut wird, aber im Stream schlecht abschneidet.

Zu jedem Format fehlt außerdem die Erkenntnis wie oft der Interviewte die Sendung schaut. Wenn derjenige, der ein Format fast nie schaut, eine ""4"" gibt, ist das etwas anderes als wenn jemand immer einschaltet und eine ""2"" gibt. Auf diese Weise vermischen sich die Wertungen von Leuten, die einmal einschalten und es doof fanden, mit denen, die die Hardcore-Fanbase des Formats bilden.

**Die Präsentation der Ergebnisse ist furchtbar**

Ich hoffe instaändig, dass RBTV intern keine Durchschnittsbewertung als Analysegrundlage nimmt, sondern sich für JEDES Format die Notenverteilung im Detail anguckt oder zumindest Boxplots benutzt. 

So, wie es jetzt präsentiert wurde, gilt ein Format mit 50% ""1"" und 50% ""6"" als durchschnittlich ""3"", obwohl die eine Hälfte der Community die Sendung total abfeiert. Wenn aufgrund solcher Evaluationsmethoden eine Sendung abgesetzt wird, wundert sich sowohl die Community als auch RBTV was denn jetzt wieder schief gelaufen ist. Wenn Zuschauer nur wegen einem Nischenformat einschalten und RBTV setzt es ab, kommen diese Zuschauer nicht so schnell wieder.

Passend zu den schwammigen Kriterien spekulieren Budi und Simon im Moin Moin übrigens oft, warum ein Format jetzt nicht beliebt ist. Das will ich den beiden aber nicht anlasten, da sie sich wahrscheinlich noch nicht so sehr mit den Ergebnissen beschäftigt haben.

**Fazit**

Die Umfrage wirft im Endeffekt mehr Fragen auf und wird durch subjektive Bewertungsmethoden verfälscht, sodass ich eigentlich nur empfehlen kann, alles außer dem Textfeedback in die Tonne zu kloppen und nochmal eine Firma zu beauftragen, die sich auf sowas spezialisiert. Ansonsten kann es sein, dass sich RBTV einen ordentlichen Bock schießt, sollten sie die falschen Schlüsse aus ihrer ""Evaluation"" ziehen. Ich hoffe übrigens sehr, dass RBTV ihr Feedback in Textform extern auswerten lässt und nicht von internen, subjektiv gefärbten Individuen."

I thank you all for your help and consultation, you were a big part in this :)

When putting the parts together I had nearly no problems. I just had to push the motherboard and graphics card a bit to the desired location, so that the screw holes would line up.

The big task was connecting the cables and the cable management (which also kinda ended up bad but meh, it works). 

I guess a mATX case is also more difficult to handle but I wanted a small case.
When connecting the 8 pin CPU power I had to shove my index and middle finger in between CPU cooler and the case ""roof"" and after about half an hour I finally managed to get that connector to stay there, robustly connected. 

Cable managment was also difficult, getting the cables to fit somewhere, not taking up too much space on the other side so that the side panel would still fit on and connecting 3 SATA drives. Because of the spacial issues I actually had to use one additional drives power cable from the PSU because I couldn't get one cable to go from the HDD and SSD up to the ODD^^

But all in all I manged it and am very happy.

Here are some pictures, in some I'm playing with the lighting of my RX 480 :)

5dgfa8,24,2016-11-17,"$90k in student loans, $42.5k income - need advice on my payment plan",ifruity,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5dgfa8/90k_in_student_loans_425k_income_need_advice_on/,"By way of background, I'm 23 and I graduated from college in May 2015. I did a paid internship and landed a full-time job a year later at the same company. I'm now making $42.5k, so now I’m paying off my student loans myself. My parents said they would help, but only after my sister, who just graduated in 2016 with the same amount of debt, finds a job because they need to focus on her loans. (Tbh, I don’t envision her finding a job soon, so I’m not even really anticipating any help.)


Right now, I live at home and I put 55% of my income towards student loans.   


My monthly income is $2,466. Here are my monthly expenses:  


* Student Loans: $1,356  

* Retirement: $123.33 (in an employer-matched 401k)  

* Savings: $400  

* Monthly expenses (subscription services, gas, EZ Pass): $275  

* Spending money: $432  


I allocate $108 per week ($432/4) for food and extra expenses. Whatever is left over after the week goes into my savings, which is pretty low right now, only $2000. I’d been overspending my spending money because of unexpected purchases, so my savings have been pretty stagnant. I have no emergency fund, but I do live with my parents so they can help me if anything happens.   


Since assuming payment of my loans, I've been aggressively tackling my highest interest loan while making the minimum payments on the rest. I calculated that it will take about 6 years to pay everything off, assuming I get no help from my parents, I continue to live at home, and I maintain the same salary.  


Here is a breakdown of my student loans:  


* Private Loan A – $22,200 (8.625%)

* Private Loan B - $15,300 (6.35%)

* Private Loan C - $14,700 (5.995%)

* Federal Loan D - $10,100 (5.49%)

* Private Loan E - $27,422.11 (4.25%)


I'd also aim to start paying for my own auto insurance and phone bill within the next year, so that would be an added expense in the future. I'd eventually want to go to grad school in the next few years as well (but that's a problem for another day).


I have several concerns.


* **I want to move out in two years. Should I go for it or not?**

I know the smart thing to do would be to stay at home while I pay off my debt, but I don't want to be 30 and still sharing a room with my sister (because chances are, if I haven't moved out because of debt, she hasn't either tbh). I really want to embrace my 20s. 


My boyfriend and I have talked about moving in together, so I would have a roommate. Plus, I’d be closer to work since my commute is 1 hour 15 minutes, which would save on gas and car expenses.


I believe I’m good at my job, so I believe it's likely that my salary will go up if not this year then possibly next (which is something else I'll have to tackle entirely--asking for a raise).


Either way, I know that this would delay my payment plan, but I think it would be worth it for the freedom.


* **Should I consolidate my private loans? Would it be better to go with a separate company like Sofi or Earnest or go through one of the banks that my loans are under?**

From my research, consolidation seems like the best way to tackle enormous student loans. I can’t really see any reason not to, except that I wouldn't be able to tackle certain loans.


* **Should I hold back on aggressively paying off my loans to build an emergency fund/savings? Is there a difference between emergency fund and savings?**

I would be comfortable with at least $5,000 in savings. But I know that it’s wise to have at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of income in your savings/emergency fund.


**TLDR:** I have a 6 year plan to pay off $90k loans with a $42.5k salary. Is it wise if I move out? Should I consolidate? Should I build my pretty non-existent savings/emergency fund?


Any advice is very appreciated!

I respectfully raised this concern and asked if the salary could be reconsidered, after letting her know that I can bring more value to the company. For example, they were preparing to do a huge migration of their outdated technology to newer ones. I have experience doing this exact migration at my previous internship. If the offer is non-negotiable, I also asked for an extension on the deadline to decide, so that I can wait for other companies that I was waiting to hear back from (after great final interviews from my POV). 

The original deadline to accept is tomorrow, and she hasn't replied to neither the negotiation nor the extension request. What could be causing the delay? Should I send a friendly email to remind her? I made sure to reiterate that I am very interested in this opportunity and remained as respectful and non-entitled as possible. "

Currently at a job that’s great. Good coworkers and manager. Relaxed environment. Good pay. Flexible hours and a short 10 minute drive from home that’s next to my school. 
I started at a more administrative role and then moved into this team after they determined it was a good fit. The initial project we were doing was great, lots of scripting and interesting work.

The problem is I’m not really learning anything anymore and it’s gotten really monotonous. On the side we were supporting a few applications but since our team got smaller that’s taking up a lot more of our time. Also our current project we’re working on is entirely interfacing with users and sending emails. The projects on the pipeline are more of the same. So my current day consists of responding to emails, doing tickets (mostly password resetting), and sending emails.  I’d like to move around within the company but at the end of the day I eventually want to be a software dev and not IT. If I stay they’d want me to stay with the team or at the very least spend most of my time on IT related tasks. 

What I was considering doing is leaving at the end of the year and spending my last two semesters focusing on school (which took a bit of a dip when I started working) and working on my portfolio and software dev skills. I feel like I’m really inexperienced because of the focus on theory in school and the unrelated skills at work.  
This last point is sort of lazy but I also just want to enjoy the last bit of college I have left before I spend the rest of my life working. I miss the days of just binge watching anime/playing video games and I feel like once I start working those days are going to be rare. 

**TL;DR** Should I leave a good but boring and unrelated to my career goals job to focus on school, build my portfolio/skills and enjoy the last bit of college.

5dh50a,2,2016-11-17,My [21M] girlfriend [21F] of three years has fallen out of love and wants to move out of our two bedroom apartment.,moveoutproblem12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5dh50a/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_of_three_years_has_fallen/,"Hey guys, throwaway here + wall of text. I will still respond to any and all comments, it's just too many people I know know my Reddit username.


My girlfriend and I have been living together for four months now out of our four year relationship. We've been happy enough together, dating, doing chores equally. She's said I've been the best roommate shes ever had. We were friends before, we seldom fight, and we're extremely good at communicating. 


There's only one issue: She's recently fallen out of love with me. This isn't something new, we both know that we can fall in and out of love with each other, but it's part of a relationship to stay strong with that person and persevere. In the past I have been not the most involved person, but I've always made sure to look out for her needs and make sure she's happy. She's currently feeling extremely guilty that she's not interested in sex, or having me kiss her. Basically anything that isn't comforting about the state of our relationship, she's not into.


She thinks moving out this January will smooth things over, as she will have more space, and thus yern for me more. However, we already don't see each other much since we're both busy with school, work volunteering, etc. We even got the two bedroom apartment because we knew we might want some space (And we've used it, lots). We have a our date nights, and we hang out sometimes on the weeknights and weekends, but we also both come home late sometimes, and she goes to sleep early and wakes up early. (I'm a night owl).


I've looked these kinds of scenarios up online, and it's my understanding that relationships where the couple are not good roommates can benefit from un-moving-in, but relationships where it's an issue with the actual relationship usually falls out from this. I'm really interested in making this work, and she says she is too, but she's resisting as she feels this is our current best option. I'm not a ""feelings"" kind of person, but I feel like these last couple months have made our relationship stronger , and I've felt emotions I honestly didn't think I would feel (As lame as that sounds). I actually miss her when she's out, I think about her often, and I'm happy when we get to spend time together. I'm afraid if we move out, I will regress to that old, less-emotional state and then we're surely done.


I've tried to convince her of anything: That I can sleep in the other bedroom for a while, that we can minimize our interactions outside of 3-4 days a week, basically anything that will simulate moving out without actually having to do it. I feel like if we go through with this, it's a massive step back and I don't want to be sitting around like some lost puppy hoping she falls back in love with me.


She's assured me that this isn't part one of a two part breakup plan, but even if it isn't, I don't know if I'm emotionally strong enough to let this run it's course. I'm a wreck, and my school, work, and internship interviews have been a mess because of this.


She says her brother's friend did the exact same thing, but that relationship ended shortly after they moved out. I've also expressed that I'm open to a break in this relationship, despite how childish that sounds. We can re-evaluate how we think about each other after this term (four months) have finished, but honestly I think we both know what will happen if we do that.


I'm all ears for people if they think this will actually help, but I don't know if I can stomach living in this relationship limbo land any longer than the month we've got left until we need to decide if we want to live together (And then longer if we decide to keep the relationship going).


TL:DR GF of 4 years, roommate of 4 months, wants to move out because she feels it will make our relationship strong. I feel this is tearing out relationship apart, and I don't want to extend this part 1 of 2 breakup any longer. "

5dhkxm,0,2016-11-17,Retirement Question,cmilliorn,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5dhkxm/retirement_question/,"So I've been lurking a while and recently made some life choices that have me looking even more.

Here's my story, 8 years ago I went into chapter 13 bankruptcy with my wife and a small child. We got scammed out of 15k, wife was in school and her employment conflicted with school hours so she switched to a part time job and we got pregnant. We had made very poor financial choices but in all fairness we had no financial teaching from family, school or otherwise. 

The bankruptcy took 5 years of payments to clear it off. We paid back around $40,000 of $70,000 debt we had. We learned during that time to pay cash for everything and developed some decent spending habits. Well after it cleared off I found I had to wait 2 more years for it to come off my credit. About a year ago it did. Our scores are now around 720-750 for both of us on all 3. 

A little over 2 years ago I went through financial peace and fell into fast and loved it. We only have our house, student loans and a car payment at the time that my parents had to consign due to the bankruptcy.

Anyway I had bought that car brand new due to hail storm taking my paid for car out. Well I found out how stupid that is as well. Anyway within 8 months of the class we paid off the car and it wasn't even a year old.

Now we pay $1250 a month for mortgage buts it's only $676 required. We have categories for everything including a cash savings for buying the next vehicle we need. We have a fund which is our emergency fund that is fully funded with 6 months expenses but I continue to add $200 a month and plan on doing so for years until it's $20,000. I put $150 for each of my 2 children in 529 plans.

So here's my question and asking for input. My job is governmental and I will never leave it unless I'm taken from this world or get disabled. It has guaranteed payments at retirement depending on how much you put in. For me it's taken automatically and I can't increase it just work overtime or extra work for more deductions from more money. Anyway, based on my current income if I retire when I'm 57 I can expect 5,700 before tax home assuming I never get another raise which is wrong because I have 3 more scheduled just for longevity. Currently we live on a take home of 6,800 a month plus twice a year I have a 3rd pay period and the checks are around $2,100 each those two months. 

My wife works for the state which has a similar but not as good retirement. She is looking at finishing her masters in January if she is accepted into this placement it's a paid internship but it's a pay cut of about $1,300 plus loss of insurance so a cost to my check of about $250 a month. 

I can make the cuts to the extra mortgage payment and car savings and a few other cuts to cover her lack of income for the 4-5 months for her to finish because we expect or at least hope it'll end with a position that pays 15-20k more than she makes now. With those retirements should I start a Roth 401k? I understand how they work but just don't know if it's necessary especially since my money is all tied up and I like how we balance it out. 

Here's my questions and sorry it took so long to get here. We pay nothing for our student loans. We file separately and that allows you to use only your income but your whole family size for payments. Since our employment meets criteria for forgiveness we just have to qualify for 10 years of on time payments and the loans are forgiven.

Well during the bankruptcy my wife took care of business and I did not. My Loans are still in delinquent status tho it does not show on my credit. I want to repay them as I qualify for just $125 month payment on them but only once they're out of delinquent status and to get there it's $487 for 10-12 months to get them out. Well should I start now knowing that it'll make it really hard on us while she's in school? We are wanting to build a house this next year and the payment will be around $1500 on a 15 yr note. Should I just keep ignoring the loans until I've moved into the house and the school is over and we know what is going to happen with her employment? I need to get the repayment going so I can get credit for the 10 years. My wife already has like 3-4 years of credit on hers. 

Thanks for the help and if you have questions of me just ask.

There are so many resources online that it can sometimes be overwhelming and  hard to distinguish where to start. 

At this point, I am a beginner and I have the following choices when it comes to learning Javascript

1)Learn it through freecodecamp.com
2) Learn it following the pluralsight javascript path
3) Learn it through books such as Jon Duckett’s javascript book or using the book ‘Javascript the good parts’

In order to learn it properly, do I need to go through all these sources or out of the 3 which would you follow? In other words, what would be the best course of action for me?

I really hope to hear back from the community to see what you guys all recommend. 

I come from c# background and did an internship this summer. Needless to say, I did not do too well. I was not lost, but I was definitely a beginner and still consider myself a beginner on coding.

Realizez că ăsta nu este un loc bun pentru astfel de rant sau publicitate dar din moment ce mulți de aici sunteți software devs atunci trebuie să auzim și părerea oamenilor ca mine ce nu au intrat în industrie cu milioane de EUR...

Acum doi ani mi-am deschis un SRL-D în software development. **Goal-ul** a fost să ajungă o organizație cu avantajele firmelor mari însă fără bullshit-ul ce vine cu ele și fără *românismele* ce vin cu organizațiile mici. Mi-a reușit, în mare.

În decursul acestor ani am investit 30.000E în locație plus 50.000E în chirie și întreținere plus imagine. 
Am avut o echipă măricică și am terminat una dintre cele mai populare platforme de social marketing la ora actuală. Acum lucrez la propriul produs SaaS, o platformă CRO și colaborez cu piața nordică ca să mă pot finanța.

M-am tot zbătut recrutând developeri interesați de colaborări sau ținând în echipă developeri căutați constant de corporații. Le-am făcut pe toate, socialising, recruiter intern, extern, you name it însă cu greu mă pot ține la suprafață concurând cu corporațiile pentru developeri buni.

În momentul ăsta am ajuns descumpănit citind știri în fiecare dimineață cum ar fi ""**insert corporation name here** caută 250 de programatori în centrul din București"".

Așa că dacă este cineva **interesat de colaborare, training, parteneriat, un loc de coworking, un hub de socializare, cu o astfel de idee atunci am o locație modernă de 145mp în centrul Bucureștiului, Mac-uri Pro la toată lumea și multe altele** ce culeg praf în acest moment...

Nu dau link la website, Github, Facebook sau Instagram pentru că ar fi shameless plug.

**Da' ești programator, voi o duceți bine**
Bună întrebare. Da, și deja mi-am investit doi ani din viață și o grămadă de bani.

**De ce nu ai parteneri?**
Prietenii buni lucrează la Google Londra, Microsoft Oslo, în Amsterdam sau cel puțin pe salarii foarte mari în București.

**Nu ești cam asshole că faci reclamă?**
Acum că mă întrebi, cred că sunt. Vreau să discut cu oameni ce împărtășesc aceeași detașare de corporații.

**Nu te-au acceptat la corporație și ți-ai deschis singur ceva?**
Cred că încă este loc de ceva bine organizat și fără ajutorul burtoșilor cu milioane de dolari. Cel puțin *credeam*. Din păcate nu mai am încă 100.000E ca să investesc în găsirea unor colegi buni.

**De ce ai investit într-o locație din moment ce vorbești de rău corporațiile?**
Pentru că sunt mult mai eficient știind că am un loc optimizat până și la umidificator pentru munca mea și a colegilor.

Just kidding, for the [Instagram likes](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMfGKWXjgIv/?taken-by=worldcode), biiiitch!  "

I wanted to start by giving a little information about myself to be able to give everyone the best explanation of my problem. 

I am currently an undergraduate and the Community College Level. I am majoring in Computer Science and I do not know a lick of programming, but I have been working with and on computers ever since I can remember. They truly fascinate me. I am currently enrolled in Trigonometry for next semester. I had to go back and complete two other Algebra courses to rebuild my foundation in mathematics which is vital to a computer science degree. I am doing great and I have actually really surprised myself in mathematics in ways that I never thought were possible for me to comprehend. I am also trying to complete a BS in CS so I can eventually go to graduate school and study Forensics. I would like to eventually become a Computer Forensics Analyst.

I was wondering what I should do to prepare for trigonometry next semester. Should I read up on some things? Maybe do a little research? I have never taken anything higher than college Algebra itself so I want to be prepared for my courses ahead of me. 

Other Questions Relatable to topic:

-Would you recommend internship over the summer?

-Is there any way I could prepare for my math and programming courses before I take them? (C++, Cal 1-4, Physics)

-Should I get my associates degree before transferring?

Believe it or not,  I have asked multiple Advisors, Counselors, and even my instructors these questions and they never have a solid answer! I just want to find what is going to work best with me and give me the opportunity to be able to work in the CS field! Any information and/or personal experience would be great! Thanks so much!"
5dige0,4,2016-11-17,Might be moving to Sarasota? (it's complicated... more info in post),Legend13CNS,sarasota,https://www.reddit.com/r/sarasota/comments/5dige0/might_be_moving_to_sarasota_its_complicated_more/,"Hi everyone! I'm a 22 yr old male originally from Denver, CO and I currently attend Clemson University for a Mechanical Engineering degree. 

My parents are for sure moving to Sarasota after the holidays due to my dad's job (advice to pass on to them would be welcome). I'll be visiting for spring break too, so is there anything I absolutely should see while I'm there in spring?

I'm trying to figure out what I should do about my summer and potential summer jobs or internships, I have three options:

1. Stay at my apartment in Clemson and try to get an internship with a company near here. There's a small number of good opportunities but they're hard to get into. Note: I'll be living in this place next year so this option doesn't cost any extra money.

1. Go back to Colorado and live with some friends I have there, again the possible internships there are good opportunities but hard to get into. That might cost a little extra but I know I'd have fun living there for the summer.

1. (this is where this sub comes in) I could live in Sarasota with my parents and try to get a summer internship or job there. I don't really know anything about the area to know if there'd be good opportunities or what I'd do in my free time. 

TL;DR: what would a 22 yr old who loves cars and auto racing do with his summer in Sarasota or surrounding areas?

5dik9l,5,2016-11-17,"Review of Solo compared to EQ, Underdog and Flowermate",frostflithbm14,vaporents,https://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/5dik9l/review_of_solo_compared_to_eq_underdog_and/,"So I bought my first ever vape, the flowermate V5S, last October.  I loved it and used it with my girlfriend every day, packed about 3 or 4 bowls per session and we were saving weed and getting higher than ever.  I used it almost every time I smoked for around a month, then began missing my bong, dabs and blunts.  It ended up being very useful in any on-the-go scenario when smell was an issue, but it really just collected dust as I smoked and dabbed from my glass.

Around February of this year I bought the EQ, having some money to burn from an internship.   I bought it because I wanted a solid versatile vape that would be fun enough to convert me back to vaping, mainly to save weed and be healthier on the lungs. I liked it alot but just two weeks later the Underdog went on sale and I pulled the trigger.  Take that as you will,  haha... it's great for group sessions and getting beginners high though. 

I love the Underdog but it's just such a damn pain to empty the tiny stems every time.  Plus it also loses a lot of heat and begins producing weaker vapor after 5-6 long draws.  It simply doesn't have the capacity to get my girlfriend and I ripped without having to repack 4 stems and wait a bit between hits. That being said, I love the thing and it's a monster.  Huge, tasty rips on demand, exactly what you'd expect.  It also works great through my glass which I highly value.  Efficiency is amazing, and the small size makes it really easy to tuck somewhere indefinitely. I really just wish I wasn't so lazy when high because emptying those damn stems without blowing abv all over my table sure can be a struggle.  I need a metal tool or something....

Anyway, the solo was my most recent purchase.   It's everything it's hyped up to be and more.  Definitely my favorite overall vape thus far, it has so much less draw than I expected, and hits almost as strong as the UD.  It also goes a solid 10 minutes producing thick vapor at temp 5, and it's so easy to empty and repack. It also feels super good in the hand and is so simple to use. Really sturdy device, feels industrial and not like a toy. 

Just thought I'd offer up a comparison. I always find it interesting hearing what others have to say about vapes I've tried so hope someone can use this to make the right vape purchase!"

For now though, I've been out of college for a couple of months. Applied to about 20 places and only had my first interview today. Which I completely bombed. This low response rate is worrisome. I'm seeing a lack of entry level positions in my area. And jobs that are entry level either want 5+ years experience, and/or knowledge of frameworks and skills I didn't acquire in college.

Recently, my entire days have been nothing but apply places and practice interview coding questions. 

Do I keep on with this and expand my search area? 
Or tone down a bit and work on personal projects (I'd probably build a web app but that would take a lot of time; time I could be applying/practicing questions)?
Or consider doing paid internships?"

RRSP: about 6k with mostly Amazon stocks and 10% TD stocks. I am getting charged about 100 bucks a year from fees because this is a self directed RRSP and I don't have more than 25k in it to avoid fees.

Saving: about 10k in cash with about 8-9k more student loans coming in January 2017 (only 600 will go to tuition)

LOC: 20k student LOC, unused.

Net income after expenses (food, insurance, etc) and paying some of my parents mortgage comes to about 800 a month.

So I made some mistakes of buying an expensive car when I got my internship and I regret it a lot. My plan is to put 5500 into my TFSA in January and sell my stocks and just stick with CCP portfolio for a long time. and about 3k into my RRSP (room for 2016), what should I do in my RRSP? should I sell everything and implement CCP portfolio? Or get a TD e series fund RRSP account to avoid the 100 bucks a year fees.

 also I am planning to sell my car for 20k and get some cash back from it, and just get a car for about 5k and just drive it until it dies. Because my intnership is over next April and I want to travel a bit in the summer I will need a lot of cash saved up. What do you guys think what I should do?"
5dj5ws,1,2016-11-17,I don't know if this is anxiety or not...,broonylou,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5dj5ws/i_dont_know_if_this_is_anxiety_or_not/,"Hello, this is my first post and i'm posting it because i'm not entirely sure if what i'm feeling is anxiety or not.

Ironically i am a very charismatic person, im 24, do the usual stuff people in their twenties  like drink and go out. Around my friends i totally let loose and feel comfortable but in the workplace i suffer mentally.

I dont know if this is classed as anxiety but i often feel like in the workplace people dont like me etc. If its quiet my mind goes into overdrive , overthinking things ive said and done and feeling like people like be being there etc. Its been going on for years and often i make up for it by being overly nice, i also say 'sorry' a lot.

I've recently started a new internship and am currently struggling mentally with the people i work with, often convincing myself they dont like me and think me an inconvenience because i'm new. A girl that was in charge of me this week was (i felt) horrible and completely misunderstanding of the fact that i was new and she seemed to have a short fuse with me, naturally after being belittled by her for the morning and then being left on my own my brain went crazy convincing myself that maybe i wasn't good enough to work there, maybe she really didnt like me, maybe i should quit etc.

Regardless of this being anxiety or not i'm happy to get this off my chest as the country i'm doing the internship in is new and therefore the mental battle is made worse by the fact i cant talk to anyone.

Does anyone here suffer from something similar? I usually only feel it in the work place or when i was at university, high stress areas i suppose.

I haven't heard back at all from most of them even though I applied about a month ago.

* Is it possible for first year students to secure an internship over the summer or are internships usually just for 3rd and 4th year students
* What is the best way to apply? should I apply to internship programs or apply directly to companies?

5dj826,14,2016-11-17,Respect the Huntsman and Huntsgirl(American Dragon: Jake Long),lazerbem,respectthreads,https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/5dj826/respect_the_huntsman_and_huntsgirlamerican_dragon/,"[The Huntsman and Huntsgirl](http://i.imgur.com/ihJtbSH.jpg) are both members of the Huntsclan, an international, clandestine organization/cult of racial supremacist humans marked by a dragon birthmark whose life purpose is the destruction of the magical community and slaying dragons. As Huntsgirl’s ‘Huntsmaster’, the Huntsman and Huntsgirl often travel in a team and so fight together. Both have trained since birth to slay dragons.


Rose Thorn(if you believe a mistake by a voice actor)/Killdragonosa(if you believe an unused initial script name) is an ordinary fourteen year old girl most of the time, but on the command of the Huntsman, she will don the colors of the the Huntsclan to do their bidding be it in the black market or doing field work as the [Huntsgirl](http://i.imgur.com/nz1KGvf.png). Rose was a brilliant apprentice, and after many battles with the American Dragon, she finally had him pinned down. The dragon revealed to her that his human form was that of Jake Long, the boy who she loved in her life outside of the Huntsclan. Rose would not kill him, and so showed him mercy to leave. This move resulted in her being sent back to the Huntsclan Academy for retraining and begun her conversion to the side of good as she worked as a secret source within the Huntsclan for Jake Long. As she did this, she also developed her romantic relationship with the boy. Eventually, the Huntsman found out about this forbidden love and used it against them, threatening Rose’s parents with death if she didn’t comply with his orders to betray Jake by stealing wish granting crystal skulls. Rose backstabbed her master at the last second, wishing for the destruction of all the Huntsclan, including herself. 


Nevertheless, due to a wish by Jake, Rose stayed alive in an alternate version of her life where she had not been stolen away from her family by the Huntsclan. This Rose lost her memories of Jake, but she regained them when Jake needed her most in order to fight the Dark Dragon. With Jake’s help, the Dark Dragon was defeated and she was free to rekindle her relationship with Jake. Huntsgirl is pragmatic and entirely willing to get her hands dirty if a mission necessitates it, possibly best shown by her unflinchingly committing an act of genocide upon her fellow Huntsclan to save everyone she cared about.


[The Huntsman’s](http://i.imgur.com/LvII5MI.jpg) past is unknown aside from him being a total wimp in his youth(with a voice “like an accordion stuck in a woodchipper”) until he was attacked by a time travelling American Dragon, leading him to have a more virulent racial hatred of dragons than any of his fellow Huntsclan as well as setting him on the path towards being the most dangerous member of all of the Huntsclan and leader of the New York branch. The Huntsman kidnapped his niece, Rose, at birth upon seeing her dragon birthmark, indoctrinating her into the Huntsclan and making her his apprentice. The Huntsman would try for years to get a way to kill all magical creatures, but found no luck until he found the wish granting Aztec Crystal Skulls. To obtain them, he manipulated Rose with harm to her parents until the skulls were gathered and he could make his wish. Unfortunately for him, when Rose wished for the destruction of the Huntsclan, he was killed with it.


The Huntsman is a cunning and cruel man with a bitter hatred of dragons in particular along with the magical community as a whole. He is the fourth greatest threat to the magical community according to the Dragon Council and has slain dragons in the past as proven by his dragon skull helmet.

**Huntsclan Tech**


Both Huntsgirl and the Huntsman rely on highly advanced technology of the Huntsclan, but their preferred weapon is the Huntstaff, a highly versatile and spear-like weapon with the ability to change shape and discharge green energy(that has a tendency of being so powerful, it causes color glitches through the computer!). They both have other tricks up their sleeve though. Please note that this section is not separated due to a difference in power between Rose’s Huntstaff and the Huntsman’s, but rather due to a difference in their ability in using them.


*The Huntsman*


* [He uses his Huntstaff like a telescope with night vision as well as the ability to identify objects of interests. He can transform it back to spear form quickly and uses it to cut through bushes](https://gfycat.com/SevereLiquidEeve)

* [The back end of the Huntstaff can launch a sphinx hair net, kryptonite for dragons](https://gfycat.com/EdibleWelltodoGerenuk)


* [While meant for dragons, the sphinx hair net is still strong enough to contain the Huntsman for a while](https://gfycat.com/HarmfulFlickeringGazelle)

* [She's able to break through Jake's blocks a few times with the Huntstaff and block some of his own strikes with it, though it's worth noting that it's unlikely Jake was going all out due to discovering her motivations for fighting him at that point. In any case, Huntsgirl defeats him by distracting him with her Huntstaff before using her chain to wrap up his arms and shut his mouth](https://gfycat.com/LeadingMarriedFieldmouse)

**Close Combat Skills and Strength**


Both Huntsgirl and the Huntsman are supremely well trained for their task and are also superhumanly strong, the latter presumably due to their birthmark.

**Durability**

I also work nearly full time at Geek Squad as a repair agent. I've gained  lots of experience there and the pay is meh. $14.56/hr to be a tier 1 help desk.

But it just mentally drains me. There's 0 room for creativity there or to try new methods. Either you do it their way or the 'get-fired' way.

My issue is I have no idea where I could work. Unless I switched to night classes, which would drastically slow down my path to my degree, I can't take a 9-5 job. 

What kind of places hire out of that range? I've been searching high and low across indeed, dice, monster, and put my resumes out to places like Robert half, and I also contacted a few well known businesses for internships. I just can't find anything that fits my hours

There's a upcoming sundown marathon in my country in 3 months time and I would like to try out half marathon. However, I'm not a good runner with consistent running training. 
Some background: 
-I do judo 5/6 times a week which somewhat helped me in my cardio. (But eats up most of the free time I have)
- Recently i have completed my first 10km with a bad timing of 1:10:00. I do feel I can run further but stopped at 10km because it's getting late (Avg pace of 7:22min/km)
- Still a student working as an intern (leave me with about 3-4 hours free time in a day without taking in account of my judo training sessions)

In conclusion, I would like to ask if it's possible for me  to complete a half marathon with such inconsistent running training such as running once a week or once in two weeks.

* I took up running because my BF is an avid runner who's running a full marathon in the sundown marathon and I promised him I will go down to support him. But thinking twice, I thought it would be more meaningful if I'm able to run the same marathon with him yet wait for him to end his full marathon. (P.S my interest for running Is genuine and not purely because my BF loves it so I forced myself to do it)

Want to make a change, but don't know how.",dontlikethisfeeling,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5djsot/depressed_and_in_college_want_to_make_a_change/,"I'm a junior in college, and for the past four or so years I've been feeling like utter shit. I try to remember the last time I enjoyed my life for an extended period of time... maybe before high school? I honestly don't even know.

I arrived at college bitter and angry at the world. This didn't help with making friends. But I did alright... I drank plenty and found a group of friends, but never really felt a connection with them. I was easily irritated and only kept them around to feel sane. And sometimes I hate myself for that. 

All of my relationships are just there to keep me sane. I don't enjoy being around anybody. I used to be better at faking it but it's gotten harder over the past couple years and I don't really have the energy to pretend like I'm having fun. 

I've gone to countless club meetings, rushed a bunch of fraternities, and never wanted to join any of them. I make myself alone. And every time I get a chance to get out, I self-sabotage. I clamor up in fear that I'm not enough for these people.

I can't sleep properly. Waking up 3-4 times a night. I wake up every morning feeling like I've been run over by a freight train. Doesn't matter if I get to bed at a decent hour. Doesn't matter if I establish a consistent circadian rhythm. Doesn't matter if I eat a good diet, get exercise, and socialize. Doesn't matter if I take magnesium and melatonin, make my room completely dark, and use industrial grade earmuffs with earplugs under them to block out noise. 

For my first three semesters, I pulled a 3.8. I got a competitive research internship the summer after my freshman year and excelled at it. The professors I worked with loved me and gave me great recommendations. I met a beautiful girl that summer as well.

Even so, I felt empty. I felt no connection to these professors, and I couldn't stand the girl I had met. She fell in love with me. I pushed her away and never regretted it. Maybe we simply weren't compatible, but I believe I have been unable to connect with people. Porn is likely part of the problem, and I'm going to fix it. 

Then, my fourth semester, I just stopped caring. I couldn't motivate myself to show up to class. Barely turned in my work. Almost deliberately sabotaged multiple grades. I was filled with disgust, hatred, fatigue, and bitterness. 

I found some drinking buddies who helped with temporary escape. I had a few one-night stands. It was better than nothing. My GPA tanked. Then I spent the summer at another internship, absolutely loathing it, loathing the people I was around, shutting myself away with reddit and porn. 

I somehow found a girlfriend this semester, and I can't connect with her. I am literally keeping around for my sanity. And I hate myself for it. I want to be able to give her love. Some part of me cares about her, but another part wants her to get out of my life. I don't think about her often. I don't feel anything when we meet. 

Why can't I feel anything?! Why am I empty? What's the point in living when you can't experience the joy of being around people? She's gorgeous, she's perfect, and I can't stand her. I'm self-sabotaging. I'm trying to push her away. 

Music doesn't even sound good anymore. I used to have hope because of it, but it doesn't sound good anymore. I probably listen to too much.

And now, I'm failing the semester. Still having trouble motivating myself to go to class. Socializing and drinking don't even appeal to me anymore. I go to the gym to escape from the world. I take adderall. Ephedrine. Stimulants. If I'm not going to sleep, why even try? And I know that's a slippery slope. That's why I'm choosing to get help. 

I finally scheduled an appointment with the mental health services on campus. I'm going to cut out porn from my life. And I've failed at doing so many times, but I'll keep fighting it until I win. I'm not fucking satisfied with this excuse of a life. "

His job requires browsing their internal applicant-tracking system, reading notes on various candidates and so he'd often ping me with funny notes about people's quirky personalities or even their physical appearance. Most of it seemed kosher.

But this last time it was a note on a women which had a long rant about her weight, her jarring, sarcastic personality and a mention of her ""big breasts"" - this obviously bothered both of us. 

I suggested that he should flag that to his higher ups, but he's a very young intern amongst a senior team. So he went to his immediate manager, and she sighed and said ""oh yeah that's the co-founder and investor and he can be pretty eccentric"" 

My friend says this isn't an isolated incident, but he's not sure how to proceed from here... what can be done in a situation like this? It feels terrible that stuff like this can happen with no consequence.

5dkf1m,20,2016-11-17,Advice for Computer Science Students in their First Year of Degree Program,AyushiJha,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/5dkf1m/advice_for_computer_science_students_in_their/,"I am currently a final year undergraduate. Here I have gathered some advice I wish someone told me when I was in my first year of computer science engineering program. The points mentioned below are my opinion, seniors' advice, general advice, experience (both mine and others), etc.

After getting their computer science degree, students tend to take up the following career paths:

 - Job
 - Research (MS/PhD)
 - MBA (Management)
 - Other


Here I'll summarise what I have learnt about how to make sure your career path is set.  


First of all, you need to decide which path you actually want to take. It is difficult for a first year student to know what they want four years later, but you have a strong inclination towards something, like you know you are interested in becoming a professor, or you want to become a CEO, you can use these tips to help gain an early advantage. For others, I would recommend trying out different things, dabble in research work, try managing a college festival, etc. etc. There are two ways you can decide what your career path:

 - **Top Down Approach**: In this approach, you assume that you like everything. Now, try your hand at different projects, research work, competitive programming, organising events to name a few. You will start to realise that some paths just aren't interesting enough for you. Or you'll get interested in a single path and want to devote all your time to that. Use the method of elimination to finally decide what you really want. Of course, this might take you one or two years, but try to decide before the pre-final year.
 - **Bottom Up Approach**: Assume that you are not interested in anything. Now, passively try out one thing at a time, like spending a few days in a competitive programming challenge, or focusing on a pet project, volunteer for an event at your college, offer help to your seniors in their dissertation work/read some papers. This way, best case scenario you may not have to try everything to find your calling. You have also created a network of contacts you might need if you later decided to switch your decisions.

The main aim of this post was not to help you decide what you wanted to be, but a step-by-step guide about how to go there quickly, by utilising each year of your college/university. 
***
Now that you have decided what you want to do, here is how you can excel in each career path:

 - **Research** : Do you want to pursue further education (MS/PhD) in a prestigious university? Most of the universities in the top 20 expect you to have published at least 1 research paper in an international journal. Also, you need letters of recommendation from 2-3 professors or someone highly recognised in academic community. Recommendations from employers do not have much value. For getting a good recommendation from 2-3 professors, you need to work closely with them. Try to get into your college's research community as early as possible. Let the professors know early on that you want to work under them, so that you don't miss out any opportunity. Identify what research topics you are interested in, read papers in that topic. If your university doesn't have a good ratio of professors, there are many other universities providing research opportunities during the summer or winter breaks. The more closely you work with the professor, the more you understand how research works, and definitely gives you advantage in the pursuit of your master's.

 - **Job**: Many students want to get a job as soon as they get their degree. The standard procedure for such ""freshers"" is a technical test (like Google APAC scholar test), followed by 4-5 interviews. This is where competitive programming gives you an edge. The coding tests, or ""hiring challenges"" usually comprise of a series of programming based questions, mostly from data structures and algorithms. The speed of solving, efficiency of your solution, optimal solution, all these factors are taken into account. Don't waste your time solving 100 easy-medium questions. Read the most common questions asked in your dream company, which will most likely include graphs, dynamic programming problems, trees, graph traversals, etc. Learn how to solve them, and practise several variations of these problems. The higher your proficiency in these types of problems, the better your job. After you clear the first round, the kind of questions might change. Practise solving questions on paper or whiteboard. other than programming, you may be asked questions related to core computer science subjects. Some of the most important subjects are operating systems, database management systems, data structures and algorithms, cloud computing, networking (most likely for a network engineer profile). Research a company before the interview, and study accordingly. 

 - **MBA**: MBA gives you a management degree. The chain is usually manager -&gt; director -&gt; CEO. With many sublevels in between. It is possible to become a technical/project manager in a company after 4-5 years without a management degree also. Admission to an MBA program requires at least 1-2 years of job experience. As a manager, you are expected to lead others. To get into a good business school, you need to display excellent leadership qualities. Aim for becoming a president or top leadership post in a university club/fest/etc. If you know you want to get an MBA, try getting into a club from the first year itself. Generally the most persistent ones are awarded top posts in the club by the time they reach their final year. Give talks, organise seminars, gain experience from internships.


***
Hope you find this post helpful. The above points are mostly extra-curriculars, you definitely need high GPAs to be at the top of your game, but sometimes a low GPA can be overshadowed by exemplary performance in these activities. 

If you have any questions, doubts, suggestions, feel free to add them in this thread.

5dkfuf,5,2016-11-17,"Sophomore transfer to UVA, currently taking intro CS class and want to keep my options open, how to position myself for a third year quant internship?",Indusco,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/5dkfuf/sophomore_transfer_to_uva_currently_taking_intro/,"I came into UVA thinking I wanted to study Finance, since it's a top 5 finance university and I would likely be accepted. I'm still taking my last pre-req for McIntire (the Commerce school) and will be taking pre-reqs for declaring a CS major next semester (Discrete Math, Software Development Methods, and Mathematical Probability as an elective).

I have no previous CS experience but I genuinely enjoy my first class and can see myself doing it as a career. I'm most likely going to be interning at a top-ranked S&amp;T position this summer, which isn't really related to quant at all but still worth mentioning. I also have the opportunity to research as an undergrad with a really brilliant cloud-computing professor who knows that I'm way below the average skill level of her PhD students but who was still willing to reach out for a grant because of my interest in her work. 

I was wondering what would be the best way to position myself to get a quant-related internship the summer after my Junior year (Summer 2018), and if it's even possible. I'm going to look into setting up a github and trying to learn as much as possible on my own over the coming year and a half, but aside from that, what can I do to really stand out? Also, where should I be looking for internship positions, since a lot of firms hire almost exclusively from ivys? (I'd be willing to take unpaid work if it was relevant)

Any advice is really appreciate"
5dkmzb,4,2016-11-17,Is this cyclothymia? Anxiety? Depression?,Tar__Toast,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5dkmzb/is_this_cyclothymia_anxiety_depression/,"I have just recently gotten to the point where i am willing to admit that I may need to get some help. I am working on finding a psychiatrist, but this is difficult since I have no insurance. But I am just curious if anybody has some insight into what these symptoms sound like. Or maybe nothing is wrong and I just need to get my shit together... 

Most of the time, I am depressed. I am exhausted. I spend most of my day fighting away negative thoughts about how nobody likes me and shit like that. And even when I am doing something that I love, I rarely enjoy it, or there is an underlying emptiness. i constantly distract myself to not think about all of the shit I have to take care of before I graduate. I don't know if I have depression that causes anxiety, or anxiety that depresses me. 

But I have periods of time that I feel great. Usually only for a few days. But often times I don't just feel great, but I am being like crazy fucking productive. And then I just lose all hope out of nowhere and go back to seeing the bad in everything, mostly myself. 

There are other times where I just feel crazy fucking agitated. Like, I keep thinking about all the bullshit that I am not doing, like homework or whatever, and I just get pissed. I usually ignore this pretty well, but sometimes it results in my yelling in my car or throwing something across the room.  

So yeah.. I think I am probably forgetting a lot of details that I wanted to give. But I am just so sick of this. I have become a fucking horrible student. I was supposed to be starting my internship this next semester, but I met with a professor to tell him I need to postpone until I figure this out. I don't think it would be responsible for me to start my internship before I've made some forward momentum on figuring this out. 

Sooop... is this normal? Like, I know everyone is their own harshest critic... but I am more of an unrelenting bully to myself. I just can't imagine that everyone around me is thinking the way I do. My own mind stands in the way of my success more than anything. At least I tell myself that. My biggest fear is that I am just hoping for a diagnosis to make an excuse for the fact that I am unable to live as a functional adult. 

So, any input or advice would be lovely. Thanks :)"
5dl008,1,2016-11-18,I Need Help,Doeb1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5dl008/i_need_help/,"I often read almost every post made on this sub because I seek as much information about the accounting field as I can absorb. I come from a low income town where I did not even think I would make it to college. I am currently in college now thankfully in my junior year at a school that has a 80% acceptance rate. In their defense though their accounting program is extremely tough to get into. You need a 3.3GPA minimum, but they waived my 3.2 to let me give it a shot. I have had no internships as coming from a low income town where no one goes to college I only found out recently that it is extremely import to acquire one. Well after I found that out fall recruiting has passed, just my luck. 

I would eventually like to become a CPA and work at the Big 4 in audit. But as of recently I see a lot of comments saying that for one, you need an extremely high GPA and be offered an internship by them to be considered for a full time position right out of school. Which makes me nervous that I will not get a job anywhere now let alone the Big 4. Since I have no internship experience and it is past recruiting season.

Second is I also see a lot of comments saying how accounting is a horrible and a boring job. That people would rather do literally anything else and I'm not sure if that is the truth or just a few select opinions. 

Third is there anyway to move from accounting to a job in investment banking? IB has interested me, but I was under the impression that you need to be from a top school to even have a chance. The hours are another thing though since I am not sure if it is worth the trade off verses an accounting job. I just think this might be a good back up plan to have in my pocket if it is possible.

I really appreciate all of the help you guys give out to us college students. Its hard trying to figure out all of this stuff on your own when you know almost nothing. Thanks guys, any advice is greatly appreciated! :)"

Right now, I'm quite stressed about the possibility of becoming a scientist at a biotech company b/c of the undergraduate process. 

In essence, I have two choices: 

1. Get an undergraduate degree in NV (where I am from) where the cost of attendance is easy to pay and get a graduate degree at a better school. 

or 

2. Get an undergraduate degree in California (hopefully) where tuition is nearly $50,000 a year and use that degree to assist me in getting into graduate school.

Right now I'm not trying to pay $50,000 a year. Nevertheless, I feel like there are more opportunities for research and internships in California such as Genentech. While there will be ample research opportunities in my state school UNR/UNLV and possible externships through a program such as Amgen Scholars, I run the risk of losing many opportunities in California as acceptance to programs like Amgen Scholars are hard to come by.

Ultimately, working in a biotech company is where I want to be in eight or so years. A job at a company like Genentech would be insane after the process of a PHD and being a postdoc fellow somewhere.

So should I avoid paying the out-of-state tuition and hopefully land at a good graduate school or reap the benefits of going to California and be in debt for the majority of my life?"

I'm currently looking for some advice on how to game girls that have moved away/aren't local.  Heres a little backstory: 
I started talking to a girl 3 months ago and have been very gentlemanly towards her, took her out on dates bought her drinks etc. (we jokingly referred to this as her being bankrolled) throughout our relationship, sex isn't stellar by any means but she's super chill and someone I want to keep around or in my life .There was never a promise of  exclusivity especially because she was planning to move to NYC for an internship (she isn't sure of the tentativeness) .  Here's where it gets sticky: We share a mutual best friend and since she moved she has had a very hard time adapting and making friends; she's an artsy introvert with dump truck loads of anxiety. Since we met we have texted EVERY day and Facetime for at least a few hours a week, I know shes super lonely and our convos are alway very deep, extremely positive filled with laughing and good vibes and I feel like I've certainly helped her grow and visa versa. Admittedly, I feel like I have slowly solidified myself as a friend. I've gone up to visit and she has spent time when she comes down with me. Except recently I've felt things change and get really weird. I'll preface it by saying she is the most indecisive type of person I have ever met, so the signals are a tangled s*** show without a doubt and recently she has said I'm being slightly too much (in some oneitis type of ways). Anyway, she said she want's to ""meet new people"" on tinder basically out of boredom [Sidebar: I bagged her at a bar when she was with a tinder fling ""because she was lonely""]  and by all means who am I to tell her not to. I went up last night with our mutual friend for a friends bday party and I made sure not to text her, I wanted her to text me (push-pull) to hang which she did. She was the so awkward around me, gave me a shoulder pat upon meeting up (cringy) and proceeded to sit next to our mutual friend and basically avoided giving me any direct type of attention, later that night I told her I specifically didn't text her and she (finally) said that she thinks we were getting too close and she wishes I she had friend zoned me ""but not really lolz"" anyway she tells me she went on a tinder date with a guy who is ""totally not my type, he's just new to town too. He's too short (shallow hipster girls smh) she's just going to friendzone him etc."" I poke fun at the whole thing and she says she's not sure if she wants to go to a concert with him the next day to which I reply she totally should. That was last night, I really don't want to text her to find out how it went; sounds needy, and I think I will ghost her but she comes into town for Thanksgiving and I'm sure to see her.

5dmpzg,1,2016-11-18,[Build Upgrade] Looking to upgrade my CPU/MOBO in order to increase FPS in CS:GO,Rallerbabz,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5dmpzg/build_upgrade_looking_to_upgrade_my_cpumobo_in/,"Hi /r/buildapc,

I'm looking to do an upgrade in order to run CS:GO properly. It's kind of disappointing that it has to happen, as I used to go 200+ FPS just one year ago and nothing in my build has changed since then, just bad optimized updates from Valve. I've a 144 HZ monitor and I am therefore looking to, under no circumstances going below 150 FPS, preferably above 200 FPS at all time. I know it's a super bad optimized game, so I'm hoping someone in here knows which CPU would do best. A friend of mine is still struggling with FPS problems with his brand new i5 system, which should destroy such a simple game.

I'm also looking for a CPU that will last me, hopefully, as long as my i7 920 has lasted me, maybe even longer. I've a 212 EVO cooler on my CPU that I can reuse, I guess.

My [current build](http://pcpartpicker.com/list/znryVY),  that gives me around 100 FPS in CS:GO...

I've tried to overclock it, it gave me a FPS boost, however not enough and the increased power usage is going to make it more expensive than buying a new CPU/mobo in the long run I think.

Budget is hard to tell, I live in Denmark so I imagine the prices are a bit different here. Preferably below 2000 DKK (285 dollars). I'm able to buy it a bit cheaper than retail price as I'm an intern in a hardware store, but usually I tend to buy from the second hand market. Not really sure if I should go for new or used?

I'm also not sure if Black Friday will bring any good deals - some people say it's just crap that's on sale, but it's next friday and I'm not exactly in a hurry as my system works just fine. So I guess I'm also looking for some suggestion on what to look for at Black Friday - which CPUs and mobo would be ideal for my need."

5dn19f,1,2016-11-18,"Six year old car needs repairs often, worth it to trade in?",CassiLeigh16,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5dn19f/six_year_old_car_needs_repairs_often_worth_it_to/,"Hi,
I got my 2011 Hyundai Sonata back in April, after my grandmother (sole owner and driver) wanted to get a new car. She bought the car in May, 2010. Since I have had it, I have put about 10k miles on it, and there are a total of 70k. Between me and the family, we have put $2k in repairs into the car since April, with the KBB initially being $8k. I am grateful for my family purchasing this car for me (mom and dad bought it from my grandma), I truly am, but it has caused me what I feel to be so many issues. My previous car was a 2002 Honda CR-V which had $3k in repairs over the 3 years I owned it. I am 21 years old, a senior in college, about to graduate in May, have an internship that I've been working at since July when I had to drive 2 hours each way to, and now I'm still here 20 hrs a week at only a 10 minute drive each way from my school. I'm about an hour and a half from my parents (with moderate traffic which there always is), and they'e had to visit me (and me go home) every other weekend because my car keeps breaking. At this point, I don't find it reliable, and I'm thinking I should trade it in before I have even more problems (we currently own 3 Hondas and a VW and never had this many problems with a car). I drive quite a bit admittedly, but I needed the internship, so I had no choice, I was putting about 6-700 miles a week on this car for 2 months, and now I put about 1-300 miles a week on it (if I go home, that is 150 miles round trip, otherwise only about 100 for 10 miles a day to and from work, plus the extra trips I take for coffee, shopping, a night out). I go back to my retail job too starting Thanksgiving, so I'm working every day during the week in the town next to school, going to school full time, working about 10 hours on the weekend at $10/hr and driving about 100 miles a day on the weekend (once home, once back to school, and each way to work because I live in West Bumblef***). 

We're almost positive the last fix (known as my breaking point) was caused by the dealership that f***ed it up when they replaced the steering column under warranty, but then when my parents brought it back to the dealership the next day, they charged $300 for their screw up. I feel that $2k in repairs on a 6 year old car with only 70k miles is excessive, we have a mini-van that is 3 years old with 80k on it already and needs less in repairs. Is it worth it to trade it in soon, or should I wait until it dies for good? I'm not sure what other information I would need to give you for an accurate assessment, but I'm really looking for advice! I have all of the information on the car and what had been done recently. I feel like I pushed my parents into agreeing to this, but maybe it is the right decision? 

Financial information:
2011 Hyundai Sonata, approx. value $7500

Deal at Honda- $500 extra down

Job- making $12/hr, will go up when I am offered the full time position. I started at $10 in July, went up last month. Virtually no expenses but gas, some food, and entertainment. Will live with my parents after graduating. 

Savings by the time I buy/lease- approx $2k to put down (with enough to cover my own expenses)

Other- Parents/grandma would be willing to put in about another $1-2k. 

I have approximately $5k in stocks, but I'd rather not touch those. Initially I wanted to save that to buy a car in 5 years, but I'm thinking this car may not last me and I may need to pay off student loans with this instead, or use for an apartment (aka renting my aunt's spare bedroom for like $200/month) when I go to grad school.

Total- approx. $10k to put down including trade-in.

Looking at: 2017 Honda Accord, Civic, or CR-V

Edit: In regards to credit history, I'm at about 730 FICO, my family each at about 780-800. I have no credit card debt (pay it off in full every paycheck), I have about $2500 in limits and only use about $200 a month (have 2 store credit cards and a Citi MasterCard, use the MasterCard and one store credit card).

More recently I have taken and passed exam P and Exam FM while trying to move into a career as an actuary. I've been applying to any open position I can find, but have not heard back from anyone. I don't have any contacts in the field, so I am largely flying blind and without the aid of networking. 

My question is: does anyone know of any companies that have a higher willingness to except applicants without experience or previous internships based on academic performance and exams passed? Are there certain types, areas of study, or geographical locations that I should focus my application process on in order to increase the chance of hearing back from someone? I'm also interested in any paid internships that are available to non recent grads. Lastly, how many exams are too many exams to take before locking down a position somewhere? 

Thank you for any help on the subject, and any general guidance is also appreciated. "
5dnl9v,1,2016-11-18,What do you think about small non-startup company?,blanceXR,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5dnl9v/what_do_you_think_about_small_nonstartup_company/,"I am a new grad and I currently have several offers, one is a medium well-know company (not as well as FB, Google but still) based in SF with around 500-1000 engineers post IPO for quite some times, let's say Company A.

another one, company B, is a smaller one with 100-300 engineers based on Seattle. 
Company B was a startup several years ago, and bought by a large non-tech company 2-3 years ago for ~ 1 bil. They used to hire only experienced people until they're bought, since then they started to do internship and hire new grads.  


The overall compensation between the two company are about the same considering tax and COL ($400/mo difference after tax).

I currently prefer company B because:
* I like the city. Lower COL, less stressful (I think)
* I like the team. Most of the teammates are senior level, they build the core system architectures like user database, login systems etc. 
* The work life balance seems pretty good. You can literally work from home all the time.

However, there are some concerns. First is that they pay nice, but no way to make big money (So that I can buy a house). Their stock price is basically not moving while Company A's is like a roller coaster.
Second is that everyone I asked are saying that SF has more oppurtunity plus Company A is well-known which combined together can help with my future career. As a young guy I need to take more risk and not care about housing, work/life balance, stable job etc.. and a larger company can teach me more than a small company.

Also it seems like it is only normal for someone to switch jobs every 2-4 years to get pay raise while very few people are staying with one company, not to mention a ""Small"" company.  


Any help or insights are greatly appreciated!

5dnmbi,5,2016-11-18,[29/f] My boyfriend [24/m] is exhausting and not doing anything he agreed to,throwaway2016_29,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5dnmbi/29f_my_boyfriend_24m_is_exhausting_and_not_doing/,"I suddenly feel stuck. I'm obviously here because i'm unhappy. My boyfriend moved in at the beginning of October 2016 after he got out of the air force and it has been a terrible experience. I feel horrible because he is a good person and very sweet to me, but things he agreed to are simply not happening and I hate going home. He starts school in Spring and my problem is I feel like I may not be giving him time to relax after the air force and that maybe this time to just sit around is normal?

When we first got together he talked about how he wanted to get into shape and it was something he was serious about. I work out 30min a day minimum and I brought this up with him before he moved in because I have to have someone just as active or I know it would bother me. I directly said I wanted someone who was interested in physical activity and being healthy. I can't stand lazy people. Now, a month and a half after he moved in, ALL he does is sit on his ass and play video games. He has not gained weight on a scale, but I can tell he is larger. I find myself resenting him because of it. I work full time and go to school and I still find at least 30min a day to work out. I felt like he was all talk and essentially lied to me because he hasn't even tried with all of the spare time he has. I wasn't sure how to approach talking about it with him, so I decided to make a change to my routine. I normally get my short work-outs in on lunch so my evenings are free, but I decided I would come home after work and work out WITH him so he actually would. I hate to admit it, but I thought he wouldn't even do that, but he did and did it for at least 30min. He kept talking about how he hated it and I said it got easier, but he just kept saying he would never like it which got me down. It bothers me that I have to change my routine I have had in place for two years in order to get him off his butt and active. I thought he actually wanted to change himself, but he doesn't really seem interested and I feel like I am forcing him. 

I'm exhausted because I am trying to keep up with my active life of school and work since I am about to graduate AND I have to do everything with him or it won't get done. The fitness is just one aspect. The other one is when he moved in he filled the garage with all of his boxes and he was supposed to go through them to throw away some things, but he has only cleaned up two and that was only after my ""nagging"". I can't seem to get him to do them and I feel like I have to do them with him for it to get done. I hate the thought that I have to baby him.

The other issue I have run into is he is always around. He doesn't do anything right now so he's always home. He's always there and it's maddening. I don't have a minute to myself to unwind. I have been working and going to school for four years and I am about to have my degree. I feel like he doesn't have any drive because he is just sitting there, but he mentions that he is using his time off before school to relax which is fair. I wish he would have even a little drive to find an internship or part-time job before he loses his security clearance or really just anything to get out of the house.

We both play video games. I don't play them nearly as much as he does since literally all he does right now is play them. I think that's driving a wedge between us. Also, whenever I do play he always wants to play with me no matter what it is. If it's a single player game he is right there next to me to watch. Most of his friends are online and two live close by, but I asked him not to invite him over because one is very weird... like into furry things weird and also a registered sex offender for something my boyfriend claims isn't valid. The other is just very awkward and I can only describe it by anime crazy forever a bachelor guy with greasy hair and ass crack hanging out of his pants. I feel terrible for telling him I don't want them over again, but I honestly don't want them back in my house.  That's another wedge that's being driven in.

I'm worried we are just two different people completely and that he lied about goals and dreams he has and I need to leave to find someone more compatible. I also feel like I may not be fair and I should let him have his time to relax before school. I don't know what to think because i feel like he said what I wanted to hear to get into my house and start a relationship, then just let it all fall away. I'm confused, but I do know i'm not happy. I haven't tried to talk about working out because I didn't know how to approach it since he is getting bigger and I didn't want to offend him, so I just changed my workout schedule. I have mentioned the part-time job or internship and he talks about his time off before school. I have mentioned the boxes, but I feel like i'm nagging because he gets pissy when I ask. Are we just not compatible? Can I talk to him about these things like the working out without really offending him?

tl;dr: Boyfriend just plays video games all day. I work and go to school while still finding time to work out. I feel like I have to change my routines to MAKE him get active or do other things and it's exhausting. Are we just not compatible?"

I'm an RF Spectrum Engineer currently working for a large defense contractor in the DMV area. While I enjoy the work that I do here, I've been thinking very seriously about a career switch to software development, with the intention of ultimately working for a startup or one of the resident tech juggernauts (Google, FB, etc.). I received a much more hardware-oriented degree in EE at the University of Maryland, with a very ehhh GPA (little better than 3.1). I've only recently graduated, and have worked at my current company for one summer as an intern, and as a full-time hire after graduation for a little over a year now (I'm doing well here and believe it wouldn't be hard to get work references)

My software development experience is fairly narrow. I've taken a few classes in C and lower level HDL in undergrad, as well as completed a few of the Codeacademy courses in Python and Java (very beginner level, I know, just wanted to learn the syntax mainly). 

In my work, I've picked up Excel VBA and used it to build a number of ad-hoc engineering tools, as well as a bit of Python script to manipulate geographic data in QGIS.

In order to build a portfolio for myself and increase the chances I'm hired at a large private tech firm, I've been considering four options: Traditional Masters in Comp. Sci, OMSCS in Comp Sci (GA Tech or other), MOOC, or programming bootcamp.

Do I stand a chance at admission to GA Tech's OMSCS program?
Would it be worth it to complete one of Udacity's nanodegrees first, to increase my odds?
If I don't stand a chance either way, which of these other options do you think is my best bet to break into this field?

The option I'm probably considering the least right now is the traditional Masters degree route, seeing as my GPA isn't great, I don't have an undergrad in CS, and of course, the much greater cost of a traditional degree (would it be worth it to pay that much more for a degree from a lesser school? I'm fairly sure my GPA would prohibit me from admission to a graduate degree at my own alma mater)

Thanks in advance!

I had a few great internships, one in supply chain operations, and another as a project manager, but I basically realized I wanted to become more technical and commit myself to a career in Software Engineering. I landed a job at an Oracle software consulting firm in San Francisco, where I've worked as an Implementation Engineer for the past 2 years, but the role is far less technical than I originally imagined (think drag-and-drop configuration) and honestly, the stability of the firm is a little shaky. We're already quite small, and a recent lack of projects has resulted in our leadership shutting the company down for a few weeks during the holidays. Needless to say, I don't think I can see a future here so I've been applying fairly aggressively at a number of different companies.  
   
  
I haven't received many callbacks, and I've had the most success through Hired, which got me 3 interviews. I recently made it to the final round with a well-known San Francisco start up for a Software Engineering role, which in of itself was very validating, but I just got a call from the recruiter saying I didn't get the job. I floundered a bit during the technical interviews, especially with some of the JavaScript use cases I hadn't studied (using call/apply to set scope for computed property functions) and needed a little too much guidance from my interviewers. Without being too melodramatic, this was a blow to my ego and has left me wondering if I even have the right skill-set to be applying for the roles I want.  
   
  
Basically, where I'm at now, I don't know how much longer I can ride out my current job while I continue to apply. I'm considering applying for graduate MSCS programs, but that would likely require me to make up undergrad courses at community college before I could have a strong application. Are there any of you who have been stuck in a similar situation? After this last interview, I'm really not sure if my technical chops are up to snuff to even bother applying for full-time Software Engineering positions. I'm waffling on whether I need to go back to school to fill in the missing pieces, or just suck it up and keep studying and applying. I've attached my resume for context and would greatly appreciate any opinions, insights, or feedback. Thank you!

Gone.




I sat there in a daze, all the commotion and conversations around me reduced to muffled voices and blurs of motion. Barrett was gone, blood in the bathroom, dead cops, all on my watch, I fell asleep and because of my complacency, people were dead and the woman I… (Love?) had been taken. I tried shaking myself but everything was still moving in slow motion.




I was snapped back into the present and reality, “RIPLEY! Snap out of it!” It was Bobby, Jesus, why did my face hurt? “Did you just slap me?” Bobby was flexing her wrist, “yeah, sorry. I need you here, in the present Ripley. I need to know what happened after I left, before Barrett went to the bathroom and you fell asleep.” I blinked a few times to clear the cobwebs and set to telling Bobby how Barrett had used my phone to leave a voicemail for her Mom and to let her Uncle know she was alright. I supplied them with the numbers from my call log.




While other detectives set to start the search for Barrett, Bobby shut her office door and sat me down. “I want to make you aware that this is now priority for the entirety of the NOLAPD. With the killing of two officers, finding Barrett and more importantly in the mind of these officers, catching whoever took her and killed their friends. If there’s anything you know or might remember, please let me know.” I understood, when we lost guys overseas we went into this sort of feeding frenzy of revenge with a mentality of “How dare they, They don’t know who they just fucked with!” I had a question right off the bat, “You said there was a letter with the neighbor?”





Bobby sighed and reclined in her chair a little, she pulled a zip-lock baggy encased in an evidence bag. “Yeah, no less poetic than the letter found with Chrissy. Whoever is doing this is a real gruesome and vindictive fuck. I’m sure if I were an FBI profiler, I’d have all sorts of more eloquent and intelligent ways to describe this sick bastard.” She read.





“Dearest William, the dead man across the Hall. I saw you sneak into Barrett’s flat and put pinholes in the wall. I watched the little shows you made with craft like a cobblers elf, I saw you watch her sleeping, naked form as you profanely pleasured yourself. You dirtied your hands while she washed her breasts, your watched her through the peephole. As she left the place she was supposed to be safe, you stroked your little beanpole. You cried and you begged for me to stop as I made you empty your balls, one last time before I took them, and with your own blood, painted your walls. I clipped your larynx and let you scream, silently, struggling against your bonds, though you did try. As I took you apart, piece by piece for you to see, at least I left an eye. It would have been too cruel, to take the sight of a voyeur before his death, so before I took the other eye, I let you take a last breath.”




“Great, sounds like the same guy to me. So now what, what can I do? I can’t just sit here and twiddle my thumbs. I mean, I don’t think I’m in any danger now that that fucker has Barrett.” Bobby eyed me, “I think the best thing for you to do would be to either stay here under the eyes of my people and wait for word like everyone else, or you can go back to your truck and wait.” I had some ideas, so I opted for my truck, probably against my better judgement. It was my safe-zone and it was a starting point for me to do my own looking about.




Bobby dropped me off at my truck herself, leaving me with a warning, “Don’t go doing anything stupid. If you see or hear anything, I mean anything. Call me.” She left me with her card. If you know anything about me by now, you know exactly what I did next. I got into my truck, opened my lockbox and holstered Mortimer (my XD). I also pulled out an old set of digi-camo pants and strapped my issue KABAR to my left leg in a shin-sheath. Ripley is on the warpath gents. I went looking for the first person that came to mind. Uncle Will, he was the last person Barrett spoke to.




I walked into the Huddle House and inquired as to Will’s whereabouts. He was in the office. One of other daytime servers went and told him I was here, he came out with a grin that vanished as soon as he saw my face and that I was alone. “C’mon back Rip, where’s Barrett?” I waited until we were in his office behind the closed door to respond. “Someone took her Will, right from a police station, they even killed 2 cops to get to her.” I took out Mortimer and placed him on my thigh, Will let out a squeak like a stepped-on rubber ducky. “What the fuck Rip! What’s going on?” If I weren’t so pissed off, I probably would have cared that he just pissed himself.




“You’re the last person Barrett spoke to before she was taken. To me, that means you know something and no matter how insignificant it is, I want to know.” I expected him to cry or lose his shit a little, but he composed himself quite well for someone who’d just evacuated his bladder. “Ripley, darlin, I told you I would do anything to protect her, what makes you think I had anything to do with something that would cause her harm? I’ll tell you the same thing that I told the police who were here about a half hour before you came sauntering in. I love that girl as if she were my own, her momma and I have done what we can to provide for her since she was a little bit. I wouldn’t harm a hair on her head Ripley, let alone draw her blood.”




That set me on edge, I put Mortimer under Will’s chin and pressed up, hard. “How do you know she was bleeding?” He closed his eyes, “Ok, I wasn’t there and I didn’t take her, but if you want to know the truth, talk to Barrett’s momma, my sister can tell you everything, I just want to wash my hands of this whole business.” I sat back, Mortimer still trained on Will’s gut. “How do I find your sister?” Will took out a pen and paper, wrote down an address. “You’re taking me Will, I don’t have a car and I’m not leaving you to beat feet after I go to what could be a dead end. You’re ‘working from home today’, so go tell your staff you’ll be out for the rest of the day.”




“How the hell am I supposed to explain this?” he pointed to his crotch. There was a cup of coffee on his desk, I dipped my finger in it, it was luke-warm. “Like this.” I picked up the mug and poured its contents in his lamp, he squawked again, anticipating it to be hotter than it was. “Jesus Will, get up, let’s go, try anything and I’ll cut Your balls off.” He got up and grabbed some paper towels on the way down the hall, he spoke to his second in command and we headed out the door. “Can we at least stop at my place so I can change? It’s on the way to Sandy’s.” I said fine.




It was a 25 minute ride to get to his house in Metairie, we went inside and he changed quickly to a fresh pair of khakis. I patted him down before we got back in his car. “Where are we going next?” As he put the car in drive he looked at me and affected a Cajun accent, “We gon to da bayou dahlin.” He hopped on I-10 and stayed on that until we got to Baton Rouge, he traded the high speed interstate for the Ronald Reagan Highway (LA-190), we took that until we got to the exit for Livonia and from there it was another five minutes until we pulled into the driveway of a modest middle class, two story home.




“It looks like she’s home, that’s her Range Rover in the garage.” I reached over and turned off the car, pocketing the keys. “Out you get, let’s go knock.” We walked to the front door and Will said, “Ya know, the key to the front door is the one with the green rubber on it.” I kept that in mind, I knocked on the door and waited, there was no answer. “She have another car?” Will shrugged, “Not that I know of, I haven’t been here in a few months.” I knocked again with the same result. I looked in the window to the left side of the door and saw a light on in the kitchen. ""Let's check around back, she wouldn’t leave her garage open if she weren’t home.” Will had real concern in his voice.




We went down the driveway to the rear of the house and up the 4 steps of the large deck that covered of quarter of the backyard. I went up to the French double doors and looked inside. I saw nothing out of the ordinary until I looked down, a smear of red stood out against the white tile of the kitchen floor, leading deeper into the house. I grabbed the handle but the door was locked. I handed Will the keys and drew Mortimer, “Get us in there, NOW!” he fumbled for the right key and unlocked the door, he swung it open with the keys still swinging from the lock, I removed them and pocketed them. I gestured Will in ahead of me.




“Sandy! You here sissy?!” Will shouted into the house, we heard a muffled groan from the direction of the living room. Will moved quickly in the direction rounding the corner into the room before I could stop him. “SISSY!” his voice held a certain horror in it, I heard a thump and when I rounded the corner, slowly, with Mortimer leading the way, I saw Will on his knees, cradling a small woman who could have been Barrett in twenty years in his arms. 




“Oh sissy, did he do this to you? What happened?” The woman opened her eyes slowly and screamed when she saw me, more likely because of Mortimer. “Put that goddamn thing away and help me Rip!”




I stowed Mortimer and asked the woman, “Sandy, where in Barrett?” The woman dissolved into tears, “My baby, my beautiful baby, he took her.” I looked at Will, “who the fuck is HE? That’s the second time one of you referred to HE.” Will looked at me scornfully, “Let’s get her help first and we’ll explain everything.” Sandy had been nearly gutted, there was a large pool of blood that had mostly congealed, I could see the pale pink of her intestines between her fingers. I grabbed Will by the collar a whispered gruffly I his ear, “I don’t think she has that kinda time, look at her stomach.” He gasped then, “Oh dear Jeeeeeeeesus.” He said in a long, drawn out wail.




“Sandy, honey… tell her, tell her everything, please, no more secrets. Sissy, this is Ripley, and she loves Barrett, very much. She needs to know how to find your baby girl.” Sandy looked up at me and held out a hand, I let her take mine, “Bear-bear told me about you, when she was here. She said she’d found love again and she wanted to go back to you. Jamie said that wasn’t gonna happen and when I tried to argue with him to let her go, to take me instead, that’s when he grabbed me and did…. did this. My Baby, she wailed and she cried for him to call an ambulance, but he refused and he dragged her out the door.”




“Who is Jamie?” I asked both of them. Sandy was weak, but she answered. “Jamie is Barrett’s daddy. He was an intern at the first hospital I worked at when I finished college. He was tall and handsome, and funny, he swept me off my feet and straight into his bed. Our little romance lasted about 3 months until he found another starry-eyed young girl to swindle out of her virtue. Shortly after that he was arrested. He had been killing patients he saw as unclean and making it look like natural causes. They caught him when the girl he had been seeing at the time stumbled on a binder under his bed that contained snapshots of each victim along with a poem for each one that described their sins and his actions to cleanse them.”




“They didn’t know whether to classify him as an Angel of Death or a serial killer, they said he suffered a breakdown during pretrial and was deemed unfit to stand trial due to his mental state and was confined to an institution for the criminally insane in Jackson. I never saw him again and I never told him that I had become pregnant. I thought I’d seen the last of him and I constructed a beautiful lie for Barrett, telling her that her daddy had died in an accident or some other such convenience. He never knew about her. But then about 5 years ago, one of his old friends that worked at the hospital with us saw me with Barrett.”




Sandy coughed and bloody spittle ran down her chin, Will wiped it gently away with a handkerchief. “He confronted me and asked if it was Jamie’s girl. I told him I was sure that he didn’t know what he was talking about. But apparently he went and saw Jamie, told him he had a child. Thereafter, I started getting harassing letters from him, ‘A girl needs her father, she needs to be protected from the dangers of the world.’ I complained to the governing body of the facility and the letters stopped, for a while. Jamie got a friend to write and send letters from the outside. They were terrible, accusatory, and vile. They detailed what he was going to do to me when he got out. I filed for a protective order but the police said there was nothing they could do since the letters were being delivered anonymously.”




“One day, the hospital called and stated he had disappeared from his ward. He was last seen wading into the Mississippi River and was presumed drowned. I thought we were free and I thought Barrett was finally allowed to be who she was without the dark cloud of her parentage. I was so, so wrong.” Sandy’s eyes closed for a moment, I didn’t know if they would open again. “SISSY! C’mon buttercup, stay with us.” Her eyes fluttered open and she smiled then looking so much like her daughter. “Ohh! Willawog, Daddy’s Cabin…. I think that’s where he was going.” I stepped away and called 911, they said the ambulance was on its way, ETA 5 minutes. “do you know where the cabin is Will?” he nodded. “Let’s go, now.”




He looked as if he were about to protest then said “One second, you trust me, right?” I said I did. And he dashed upstairs. I bent down to Sandy, I kissed her forehead, “Sandy, I’m gonna bring your Bear-Bear home, you hear me? You hang on.” She smiled weakly and handed me something that had come from inside her wound. I looked down at the Zip-lock baggy. The note inside was unlike the others, it was short, punctual. “My dearest, dearest Sandy, Secrets are lies in Flowery disguise. Burn in Hell, you whore.” Her eyes closed then, I felt a weak but steady pulse at her neck.





Will came thumping down the stairs at that moment, a shotgun in each and and boxes of shells bulging from his cargo pockets on his khakis. “Is she?” he started with tears starting in his eyes. “Unconscious, but still hanging in there. Let’s go.” I heard the sirens in the distance. We went out the front, leaving the door open and piled into Will’s car. He tore out of the driveway and drove at break-neck speed down 190 until we reached the last exit before the Atchafalaya River, we headed north until Will turned east on a dirt road, Will said, ""I want first shot at that sonofabitch Ripley, he hurt my Sissy and took my Bear-Bear."" I thought about it, ""I can't promise i'll leave much of him for you shoot. Give me a layout of the cabin, I want a plan to breach and assault by the time we get there."" He explained the layout and the property as we bumped along the progressively deteriorating dirt track.


We had just passed a sign reading Prentiss Bayou when Will pulled off the track and shut off the car. ""The cabin is about two-tenths down the road, on the left hand side, we'll cut through the woods. He reached behind my seat and grabbed a dark colored wind breaker, ""You'll stick out like a sore thumb in the woods with that white tank-top, put this on."" I was touched by his concern and I said so, ""Ripley, you've more than proved to me that you love Barrett, gone knows how, in such a short time, but i'm convinced you were meant to be here for her."" I didn't want to get choked up, so I responded with a nod and said, ""Let's go.""



We crept through the woods with barely a sound. As we got closer we heard the sound of a large generator thrumming away and it got louder as we approached. We came upon the cabin from the rear, there was a dark colored cargo van parked with the rear pulled up close to the cabin. I figured we wouldn't be heard over the sound of the generator and I was right, I peeked in through one of the windows and was confused by what I saw. 

The center of the main room was blocked from viewing by opaque plastic sheeting and there was the silhouette of a tall figure, hunched over their shoulders moving in small, delicate movements. I whispered to Will to keep watch through the window and I would enter and cover the figure. I sidled over to the front door, steadied my breathing, then turned the knob and pushed opened the door.




I crossed quickly to the sheeting and parted it, Mortimer leading the way. I was met by cool blue eyes, and a sight that made me shiver involuntarily, ""Would you mind, this is a sterile environment."" The voice was deep, but muffled behind the surgica mask. ""One more stitch and i'll be finished."" I pointed Mortimer directly at his heart. ""Back. The Fuck. Away."" He gently placed the needle he'd been stitching with on the blue surgical cloth covering the figure on the operating table. I backed him out through the curtain and made him sit on a stool near a bench by the rear wall.



I yelled for Will, who came running in and through the curtain, a few seconds later, there was a cry of dismay as I covered Jamie. ""Ripley, come in here."" I wanted to rush to his side but I wasn't taking any risks. ""Come cover this motherfucker Will."" He came through the sheeting and forced Jamie to the floor, face down. I could hear him muttering things to Jaime about Sandy and Barrett. I phased it out as I entered the make-shift surgical suite.

The figure on the table was almost completely obscured by the blue surgical paper, there were three sections of skin exposed. I saw part of the figure rising and falling deeply and rhythmically, it gave me the orientation required to realize what I was seeing. Two mounds before my eyes I now realized were Barrett's breasts, the bastard had removed her nipples and stitched closed the wounds leaving what would heal as very small scars. 



I pulled back a sheet that covered her below the waist, he had sewn her labia together leaving only two small holes, one for urination and the other for menstruation. I covered her back up and moved aside the sheet covering her face and breathed a sigh of relief. She was otherwise unaltered or harmed, but she was anesthetized and unaware of my presence. I leaned down and kissed her forehead, and heard a commotion behind me, a sharp pain to my side, something silver about 6 inches to the left of my bellybutton.



A hand on my throat brought my eyes back up and there was a tall, handsome man with anger and insanity in his eyes staring into mine. ""So, you're Ripley, you're the Next Whore. I warned you with my letter, but you just had to fuck my little angel, didn't you."" I looked for Will over his shoulder, there he lay, in a heap on the floor, a large gash on his head, his shotgun 3 feet away. I felt my hope slip away. Mortimer had been knock from my grasp when Jamie had stabbed me and I'd failed to notice with the blinding pain.



""How could you do this? she's you're daughter."" He grinned then, his eyes wide with a mania, ""Oh no, she's not just my daughter, she's an angel, I've removed her imperfections and now she will be able to pass muster when I present her before the Lord. For I am death become man, I decide who lives and dies, and you, dear Ripley, well, I'll write an opus worthy of the bards of old."" He grasped the scalpel and slowly pulled it from my side.


""You're such a pretty girl Ripley, I wonder if the Lord would forgive me for your death, you are interfering in his good works after all. He had a hand wrapped in my hair and the scalpel at my throat, pressed against me, I could feel his hardness against my hip, he was becoming aroused by his own viciousness. I wondered if I could distract him, he was just a man after all. I glanced over my shoulder at Barrett, ""I- I like the work you did on Barrett, it is masterful and precise, I doubt there will be much scarring i twinged in pain as he pushed himself up against me, making it more obvious that he wanted something from me before he was done. I just hoped i came up with something before I had to follow through with this charade. He pushed me down by my head to my knees. ""Go on, you know how this works, you told My Angel that you've been with men before."" He'd been listening to us.



I felt my stomach churn as I thought about what else he had witnessed between Barrett and I. When my hand brushed my leg, I remembered my knife there, I slowly started inching my pant leg  as my other hand rubbed the front of his jeans, he shivered i pleasure as my hand closed around the handle of the KABAR. He nicked my throat then and i felt the hot blood trickle down my chest. ""I see you, demon whore, let slip that blade and your life will follow."" My hand released the knife. and closed my eyes, ready for the worst. 



A click got my attention, the room exploded with noise as a hole appeared in the center of Jamie's chest then another, and then a third. The scalpel fell away and I pushed him as hard as I could as he fell, I saw Will, Mortimer in both hands. He fired over and over until the slide locked in the rear position, the left side of Jamie's face was a ruin. It was Will's last act. Jamie ha stabbed him in the chest, nicking an artery, he died smiling at me. Poor, sweet Will.



Sirens sounded not too far off in the distance and I heard a Helicopter do a fly by and land somewhere near the road. Shorty thereafter, the door burst open and cops in tactical gear flooded the cabin, followed by Bobby Hebert. I had stayed on my knees and placed my hands on my head when they'd breached the door, i'd made it this far, I didn't want to get shot on accident.



""We followed your phone Ripley."" It was Bobby, ""After the 9-1-1 call at Barrett's mother's house, we knew you were on the war path. We had hoped to get here before all this kicked off, but I see the Marines stormed Iwo Jima without us."" Her grin failed her as she took in what had happened to Barrett. ""Oh dear god."" She pulled the radio from her hip. ""Get that ambulance in here, scratch that, make room on the chopper, get her to Baton Rouge General. Ripley, you and I are going with her."" she yelled at the officers that seemed to be milling around. ""GO GO GO PEOPLE!""



The next few weeks were a blur, the work Jamie had done on Barrett was so precise and clean that the doctors were able to reattach her nipples and they removed the stitches from her labia, they warned the sensitivity would never be the same, not that we were worried about that, we were happy to be alive. They kept me for a few days only requiring 12 stitches . 



When she was well enough, they allowed visitors, I, of course was they first, but I had a surprise. I walked into Barrett's room, pushing Sandy in a wheelchair in front of me. ""MOMMA! RIPLEY!"" tears streamed down her face as she saw us for the first time since being admitted. ""Oh Momma, I thought he killed you, I'm sorry I couldn't stop him."" Sandy shushed her, ""Bear-Bear, hush now, i'm here, we're here. You can thank your young lady here for that.""



Barrett squeezed my hand and Sandy beamed. ""Momma, was he really my father?"" The smile fell from her lips. ""Yes baby, he was, I'm sorry I lied to you, it's just... I didn't want you to know that you came from that monster. The discussion went like that for a little while until the nurse came to take Sandy back to her room. We were alone, finally. 



I told her how i'd been on convalescent leave, but it was time for me to get back to work. She squeezed my hand, ""I've been thinking about that. I'm planning on taking a break from school. I want to come with you, at least if you'll have me."" The grin that spread across my face could have bee seen from orbit. I held up a piece of paper for her to read. ""You're kidding, really?"" I nodded and she signed on the dotted line. I folded the companies Passenger Insurance Form and put it in my pocket, I would fax it from the truck stop. 



Love at first sight, some people think it's a myth. I think it only happens when two people are bonded by a life changing experience. Our story only ends here in the sense that our nightmare is over in the real world, we still wake each other in the night to hold the other until the shaking and crying stops, but I think our tale is far from over.


***


Barrett and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a place to tell our story, you've blessed us more than you can imagine NoSleep. - Love Ripley"

Goldman would be in NYC/NJ and IBM in Austin. For IBM, the position would be for the Extreme Blue program, which is a step above their standard internships.

I have some interest in finance, which is why I interviewed with Goldman, but I've heard it's better to go with a pure tech company. IBM is closer in that regard, although I've heard bad things about working there full-time. EB also sounds like a really cool program, so perhaps it may open up more doors in the future."

25yo Hispanic Male

Gmat: Officially taking Dec 17, scoring around 720 on gmatprep tests, aiming for 750+

College: Tulane - Presidential Scholarship 

Degree: Finance, cum laude (3.5 or 3.49 can't recall)

Grad Degree: Masters in Accounting, cum laude (3.33)
 
Work:
10 months - Financial Analyst for small firm, a family company that gave me a job until I found something I wanted to do

1.5 years - Supply Chain Analyst for a small international chemical manufacturing company - interviewed for FA position but they wanted me to learn more of the industry so put me in supply chain. Turned out that was a lie and there was no opportunity for me to move. Hate that company ha

Current - 6months - Business Analyst for a FinTech Startup - I do sales/marketing analytics as well as loan pricing and modeling. Should get a promotion after a full year. This is a rapidly growing company and well known in the credit space. WSJ article a few weeks ago on us.

EC: 
Currently a mentor for SCORE, which is an organization that mentors small business owners in all areas. I focus on finance/accounting/strategy

Have volunteered with Junior Achievement on multiple occasions.

Goals: MBB Consulting. I really didn't know what I wanted to do in college until I took a strategy class and a case competition class (my team won). By the time I realized what I enjoyed it was really too late for me to get in through recruiting. I have since tried to gain as much experience as I can in different areas of a business. I have a friends in strategy consulting (Deloitte &amp; Accenture) and I really do think I will enjoy it.

I know my background is different but I think I can spin it right. I had an audit internship with PwC which made me realize that accounting is not a career for me. I also did an equity research internship which I enjoyed and even have a published report. I had a very hard time finding work after school in that field without moving to NYC just to interview. Tulane is in New Orleans which has little professional job opportunities or even top companies recruiting on campus so it was a very hard struggle to find a position anywhere. Most people I knew that got jobs went to either an account executive role or had amazing connections. I felt like I slipped through the cracks.

My GPA was also a 3.65 before my 5th year which I stopped caring as much and focused on job hunting. Which obviously didn't really pay off for me. I also had serious depression my final years in college which is why my GPA is low. I need an MBA to rebrand myself because I know I am more than capable but I just lack opportunities.

Skills: Python, Excel (VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE: don't have to use a keyboard, write macros, etc), PowerPoint (build decks regularly at my job), SQL, R

Where can I be competitive at? I am looking at Sloan, Darden, UCLA, Fuqua, Goizueta, Columbia, Booth, Harvard (very interesting connection to Harvard - Harvard brought my grand father to America for medical research) but I know my ""prestige"" may not be there. And one more thing which I could probably put on an essay (not sure) - my father never graduated college and my mom got a worthless degree 

I am saving for a admissions consultant because I know I will need one given my background but what do you guys think?

EDIT: I plan on applying Fall 2017. By matriculation I should have two years at my current company and 2 years at SCORE

EDIT2: Scholarship money is very important to me but M7 is by far the biggest deal for me.

I say temporary because I plan on returning to school for my Masters degree.  
Including the internship, I've been working at my current job for a little under a year now. However, I will be leaving next month for the reasons stated above.  
  
In my time here, I elected to partake in the company's 401k option and garnered a small sum of contributions, (it's rather small because I was not eligible to enroll for about half of my employment). But now that I'm leaving, I'm not sure what to do with the money accumulated there.  
  
Upon leaving the company, I am free to do whatever I wish with the money. As I see it, I have 3 options.  
1) Continue using my Fidelity account, which would be 100% disaffiliated with my company, meaning I would pay for any applicable fees stemming from the site.    
2) Pull out all funds and pay a yet to be determine amount of tax on it.    
3) Claim hardship and pay little no tax, (post-secondary education can qualify as hardship under certain cicumstances), although I would definitely have to do more research on it.      
    
On one hand, the amount of money is so small that I feel as if it's not worth keeping in an active investment account, but on the other hand, I acknowledge the fact that if I kept this mentality my whole life, I would never gain any meaningful amount of money for retirement.

5dpxqz,99,2016-11-18,[AMA] Hey everyone! I'm a teenager who dropped out of college to work for a tech startup in San Francisco. Ask me anything!,PM_ME_INSIDER_INFO,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/5dpxqz/ama_hey_everyone_im_a_teenager_who_dropped_out_of/,"So here's a bit about my background.

I graduated high school in 2014 with a meh GPA (3.4uw/3.9w). I applied to a few colleges and got in but I ended up at Arizona State as a Finance Major.

I was really interested in financial markets and trading so I'd spend a few hours a day modeling equities in Excel. While on reddit I realized I should probably start learning how to program because it seemed like it'd be a lot faster than Excel.

From there, I got addicted to programming. I spent ~8 hours a day every day my freshman year learning to program. In the fall I started getting a few opportunities to make money while programming (small websites, etc) and started gaining some experience.

In the meanwhile I started applying for CS internships as a non-major for the next summer. I got a take-home assignment from Salesforce to rebuild their developer web page, passed that, did three interviews back to back and got an offer about a week later for the summer of 2016.

Over the eight months of that school year I ended up taking on around $70k of contract work and hiring up to six or so people at one point.

This past summer I left college in May, moved to San Francisco, and started my internship with Salesforce. I worked around 85 hours a week (40 for Salesforce and ~45 doing contract work). While working over the summer I directed another ~$40k or so in contracts outside of my job.

The summer grew to a close and I had only interviewed at two places (not much time), when a friend let me know about a startup that was maybe looking to hire a software engineer. I had coffee with the founders and then a peer programming session.

I went straight from the programming session to Outside Lands (music festival in SF) and while there I got an email with an implicit offer. A week or so later I got a written offer and I accepted. I've been working there since!

I've since dropped out of college and don't have any immediate plans to go back.

Decided to do this AMA today because it's officially my last day as a teenager. :)"

5dqplp,1,2016-11-18,Trumpeting sexism,ShaunaDorothy,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/5dqplp/trumpeting_sexism/,"5 Oct 2016 

HE'S CALLED a former beauty pageant winner ""Miss Piggy,"" suggested that Fox News' Megyn Kelly asked him tough questions because she was menstruating and argued that Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina wasn't a good choice for president because ""Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?""

Oh yes, and according to the aspiring Sexist-in Chief, women pumping their breast milk is ""disgusting.""

When Donald Trump talks, sexism spews forth so freely that it's as if he doesn't even know it's happening.

But he does know--he knows very well--and he's letting it rip because he knows.

Since the first presidential debate in which Hillary Clinton called out Trump on some of his past sexist behavior, many Republicans have tried to distance themselves from Trump's anti-women rhetoric. They're afraid he'll go so far that he starts losing masses of votes for the party.

There were, however, some exceptions.

In an appearance on ABC's This Week, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani complimented Trump's ability to avoid almost 20 years' worth of taxes, adding, ""Don't you think a man who has this kind of economic genius is a lot better for the U.S. than a woman, and the only thing she's ever produced is a lot of work for the FBI checking out her e-mails.""

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

DESPITE HIS oafish demeanor, Trump's sexist rants aren't a slip of the tongue. They're what he and some important people at the top of society actually think about women, and he hopes those ideas connect him to a wider audience.

Unfortunately, he's finding that audience among some people whose anger and frustration can be focused at a candidate like Hillary Clinton because she's a woman in a position of power, not because of her record of upholding an unjust status quo.

Thus, gross sexist attacks against Clinton are a central part of the Trump campaign, along with the racist and Islamophobic paraphernalia. At Trump's speaking events, supporters sometimes wear sexist T-shirts and buttons directed at Clinton--like those featuring the slogan ""Trump That Bitch.""

For many people--and not all or even most of them are Trump enthusiasts--Hillary Clinton symbolizes the political establishment that has presided over several decades of a small elite enriching itself while the working class sees its living standards stagnate or decline. When the critique comes from people on the left, you can see why so many people are dissatisfied with Clinton and the Democratic Party and are looking for an alternative to both parties.

But in the hands of Trump, who adds women-hating rhetoric to the mix, the bitterness toward Clinton becomes a toxic brew of class anger diverted into sexism--with feminism being attacked as one of the root problems of society.

When Trump accuses Clinton of ""playing the woman card,"" as he puts it, he's saying that the only thing Clinton has going for her is her gender--and in Trump's upside-down world, feminism has taken over the political establishment and put undeserving women in positions of authority.

In this way, Trump's campaign of bigotry and hate helps diverts blame from the corporate power that both he and Clinton represent onto some imagined feminist power. As a result of Trump getting a national platform, sexism has a national platform--and that has a terrible impact on women everywhere.

By almost any measure--housing, wages, health care--women don't have equal status to men in U.S. society. The problem isn't that women have ""too many"" rights or ""too much"" control in politics, or that feminism has gone too far. The problem is that much more needs be done to eliminate discrimination and sexism in U.S. society.

And contrary to what Trump--and for that matter, Clinton--argues, working-class men and women all have an interest in achieving this.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

AT THEIR first debate, Clinton called out Trump's sexism, telling the story of Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who Trump harassed because he thought she was ""too fat."" The tycoon even made Machado pose with him at a photo op at a gym.

Surely for many viewers, it was nice to hear someone finally call Trump on the carpet for his disgusting attitudes.

When his already crappy support among women dropped even further after the debate, Trump promised that he was now prepared to ""really go after"" the Clintons--accusing Bill Clinton of being ""the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics"" and Hillary Clinton of being his ""enabler.""

Nothing like solving your sexism problem with...a little more sexism.

Trump has promised to tell all about Bill Clinton--from Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton had a 12-year affair, to Paula Jones, who Clinton exposed himself in an Arkansas hotel room.

You'd expect that Donald Trump wouldn't know the difference between a consensual affair and sexual harassment. But it seems like the New York Times, which quickly responded with a front-page article titled ""How Hillary Clinton Grappled With Bill Clinton's Infidelity, and His Accusers,"" didn't either.

In the Times article, examples of consensual sex, like with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and unwanted sexual harassment were treated as if they were interchangeable.

That's because for the leading figures of Washington politics, as well as the newspapers that do their talking for them, there isn't a difference. They're all ""scandals,"" in which some ""moral code"" has been broken--which, for one thing, ignores the women involved, and whether they consented to a sexual encounter or were coerced.

Once the question enters the arena of the political and media establishment, it's usually the people with the fewest qualifications--particularly on issues of ""morality""--that get to pass judgment.

Remember Bill Clinton's fiercest and most ""moral"" accuser during the congressional Republican attempt to impeach Clinton because of his affair with Monica Lewinsky? It was Newt Gingrich--who, after being elected to Congress on a pro-""family values"" platform, went to his wife Jackie to demand a divorce, as she lay in a hospital bed, recovering from a cancer operation.

Newt Gingrich, the Republican responsible for shredding the social safety net--can you think of anyone less qualified to make any ""moral"" judgment?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

OBVIOUS HYPOCRISIES aside, sex scandals are a familiar weapon in mainstream Washington politics. In that situation, actual victims of assault are viewed as political tools first and people seeking justice second (or never). That goes for Democrats as well as Republicans.

Take the case of Paula Jones, who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment in 1997, reporting that when he was governor and she was a clerical worker for the state in 1992, he exposed himself in an Arkansas hotel room, dropping his pants and telling her to ""kiss it.""

When she refused, she says he told her, ""You are smart. Let's keep this between ourselves."" According to Jones, the governor sent a state police officer to proposition her on his behalf more than once.

Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, went on the offensive against Jones, as did the media, painting her as a liar and ""trailer trash"" who was in it for the money. ""Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park, and there's no telling what you'll find,"" said the detestable Democratic strategist James Carville in 1997.

As for the Republicans, Jones got the support of right-wing Clinton-haters, including anti-abortion zealot Randall Terry, who cynically tried to use her accusations to get at Clinton. In fact, earlier this year, Jones said she endorsed Trump for president--even though he called her a ""loser"" in 1998.

In 1998, Judge Susan Webber Wright decided to dismiss Jones' case of sexual harassment, not on the basis of whether her charges were true or not, but because Clinton's behavior, while ""boorish and offensive,"" in the words of the judge, amounted to ""brief and isolated"" episodes, which are apparently acceptable between an employer and an employee.

In addition to Democrats, some well-known feminists applauded the decision. Gloria Steinem defended Clinton, writing in the New York Times that he was worth standing behind.

Jones wasn't the only woman to come forward to report Clinton's unwanted sexual advances. Clinton handlers disgustingly referred to these continuing episodes as ""bimbo eruptions.""

In the end, the Democrats' main concern during the Clinton era wasn't addressing a possible case of sexual harassment, but protecting the Clinton administration at all costs--and often enough, the importance of keeping a Democrat in the White House to ""defend"" women's rights was part of the argument.

But think of what the Paula Jones decision says: A judge has ruled that an employer who sexually harasses an employee may be ""boorish,"" but the offense isn't serious enough to have its day in court. That has an impact on all the women who face sexual harassment in workplaces every day--and on their bosses' and co-workers' attitudes toward harassment.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

IT WILL take much more than Hillary Clinton taking on Trump in a debate to get rid of the sexism that pollutes the U.S. political system--because Republicans aren't the only ones who have a hand in it. Neither of the main political parties is dedicated to defending women's rights.

Chalking all this up to cynical political wrangling would be wrong. When sexism from people at the top--like a presidential candidate--is allowed to go unchallenged, it has ramifications.

Recent revelations about former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and the ongoing harassment that women endured in the corporate offices of the cable news network revealed a culture of sexism and silence--one in which a whole team of people knew about the abuse, and not only looked the other way, but covered it up.

When sexism flourishes at the top, it's certain to make its way into workplaces around the country. The people who run these institutions--from Fox News to the Republican and Democratic Parties--don't have a real stake in confronting or ending sexism.

But the rest of us do.

Have cried myself awake because of depression or i dont know what it is. I have this stupid fantasy that i indulge in where i wake up the next day and im suddenly shredded and have the Limitless power and slay women day in and day out. 

I got moobs. This probably killed the self confidence in me pretty young and Ive never believed in myself since to do anything substantial.

Ive been jobless since graduating engineering, something i had zero interest or skill in. I got a 3.2 something though. But now I am brain fogged and dont remember anything. My 'real' education is 8th grade levels. Cant concentrate. 

I live on my parents money which they transferred to my account since they believe Im doing my masters, which I secretly quit a year back cuz the anxiety and the tastelessness of it all fucked me up.

I sit or rather hide at home. My parents built it, they will shift here once they retire from their jobs next year. I stay in here, alone pretending to do an internship. Watch youtube all day mostly. It was porn or pictures before. Or frantically refresh the news feed all the time. Or celeb or gossip or movie news sites.

Last week i went to a brothel, but couldnt get it up. The only thing i wanted to be able to do is to bang a hot looking girl.. but i am kinda wasted there as well.

Ive thought about suicide so many times. I could do it cuz life is so fucking pointless but then i imagine my parents pain. They would probably go insane or something. I dont want to do something like that but each day my mind resolves that death is better than uselessness.

The thing is ive had a weak insecure father who did shit so that I could be secure, have a secure job and family. He is very forgiving but ultimately weak. He is also responsible to my introduction to porn. When i was in 9th grade I discovered porn in the family computer cached files. Tiny images. It shattered my relationship with him, it built a temper within me, an ire. I however succumbed to the habit. I often wondered how his good behaviour is just a front.. I never believed in him again.. This could happen to you if you are a dad and happen to read this. He brought me up to see the negative in things more and Ive had a tough time making decisions. He would say things like 'what if it fails.., but then in the past it failed.., one has to be careful.. '. He didnt believe in me when I said I wanted to pursue something.. he would say 'what if you dont get it..' rather than encourage.. he would say, why risk it, take this alternative, at least you would have a guarantee. 

I understand his concern but it has crippled me. I wasnt habituated to think positive or believe myself. He would compare me with other children. He basically did not know how to talk to me. He compromised when I cried. He took pity on me. He wasnt strong. He bowed down. All his suggestions and decisions were based upon what others did, ie a lack of critical and independent thinking of his own. He is a respected college professor in science, but he doesnt use the same principles in life often defaulting to others views.

I know I am responsible for this in some degree to. My inability to get a good college or go to a better university must confuse him. 

I dont blame him for everything wrong with me. It was majorly my fault too. Not changing.

But now I see it.

And if I dont become strong, i will fuck up and confuse my child if i get around to having one someday. There is no other way but to have some positive attributes in you.

I dont seek your suggestions reddit, but i just wanted to get it all out.. I know what you will say in some ways, Ive been a lurker. But know this if you are a dad and reading this. Your children discovering porn through you/ your inability to be firm or talk to your children or have a positive strong outlook on your life will reflect in your children and they'll in some ways turn out like me.

Im gonna be writing here everyday. Up until the February of 18th Ive decided to increment knowledge and balance of mind within me. I realise that I spent a whole year doing nothing. I want to learn things, build neurons and muscles, add something to my skull. Unless I  do this I dont have a license to kill myself or think about it.

You can ignore this user and his posts though.

Godspeed fellows.

5dsp3u,11,2016-11-19,22 T4F - Sarah Korhonen: A Monster in Waiting,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5dsp3u/22_t4f_sarah_korhonen_a_monster_in_waiting/,"It is 8PM in the evening, and Sarah Korhonen is doing dishes. There is nothing particularly sinister about this act: Sarah has simply finished a plate of lasagna, and is cleaning up after having put away her leftovers. Nothing terribly unusual, although she ate the meal alone, which one could think of as being a little sad.

Sarah is not particularly unattractive. At the age of 39 - rapidly approaching 40 - her curves have filled out nicely, and only the odd wrinkle has started to show around her eyes. In four years’ time, she will have her first grey hair, but for now it is a dark shade of auburn that contrasts nicely with her pale blue eyes. Her skin - once again, largely bereft of wrinkles - is a delightful shade of light pink, a product of her Finnish ancestry. 

Genetics have also bestowed upon her a reasonably large pair of breasts, but - superficially speaking - her best features occur below the waist. Her ass is round, soft and full, and perfectly complemented by a pair of exceptionally wide hips; “child-birthing” hips, if you will. Indeed, it’s these two locations, along with her thick thighs, that almost all of her body fat settles, which is not to say that she’s *fat*, by any means. “Delightfully plump” might be more apt.

All of that said, it is unlikely that Ms. Korhonen will be putting those “child-birthing” hips to their titular application. This is for a short, but rather critical list of reasons. The first is that, for all intensive purposes, Sarah is not attracted to men. Indeed, Sarah has dedicated an unworldly amount of her time fantasizing about the various women in her life. Coworkers. Retail employees. Neighbours. Strangers. Even - and this in particular she would adamantly deny - some of her younger relatives. So, to phrase it with some degree of vulgarity: Sarah Korhonen has pussy on the brain.

The second reason is, well, rather anatomical. Sarah wasn’t born like most girls. For the most part, she developed like any other woman: she hit puberty at the proper time, her curves developed exceptionally, her voice became musical in tone, if somewhat husky in timbre. All in all, she appeared to be a perfectly normal middle-aged woman. The only exception was the presence of a 9-inch phallus in place of a clitoris and a pair of egg-sized testicles in place of ovaries.

Just how different would Ms Korhonen’s life have been had her parents been a touch more… *accepting* of her gender? As a child she learned that under no circumstance was her penis to be mentioned, within or outside of the house. There were no sleepovers for little Sarah, and in fact there would be no spending time with her friends *at all* outside of school hours. Instead, Sarah read books, listened to music and learned to cook.

Although she was allowed more freedom as she grew older and more “responsible”, Sarah lived in that repressive household until the age of twenty-four, when she went to college to obtain a degree in Business Management. Still, despite her escape, the damage was done. Anything approaching a romantic - or, God forbid, *sexual* - interaction would send waves of anxiety through the poor woman, sinking any and all potential relationships before they had a chance to set sail.

And now, at the age of thirty-nine - almost forty - Sarah Korhonen lives alone in a very nice, very *quaint* two-bedroom condominium in the suburbs. She uses the second bedroom as a home office.

That is not to say that her life has been completely chaste and sterile; Sarah’s sexuality has not been destroyed, it has merely been dormant. For one, she’s become an expert at both manual masturbation and the creation and use of improvised sex toys. More importantly, though, is that she has done far more depraved things than most people have dreamed of. Whips and chains, gags and plugs, ropes and corsets, boots and heels, leashes and collars, leather and latex… These are the things Ms. Korhonen thinks of when her hands dip beneath the sheets.

Still, solitary perversion is not her only area of expertise. Sarah has become quite good at cooking and baking. She has a recipe for chocolate-espresso macaroons that are to *die* for, and she’s the type of person who always brings some to share. Most people agree that she’s a bit of a sweetheart, a *total softie*, really, and now that she’s in middle management she does her best to keep everyone’s lives as stress-free as possible. Truly, she likes it when people are happy.

Which is where you come in. *Why is Sarah Korhonen single?*, you wonder. She’s attractive, kind-hearted, intelligent and friendly. Exactly the kind of person you’ve been looking for in a partner - or a fling.

What could possibly go wrong?

You’ll have your answer in a few months’ time, when you’re bound and gagged, whip marks criss-crossing your back while loud, *angry* grunts echo from behind you. There is an unbearably thick cock burrowed deep inside your pussy, threatening to shoot a hot, creamy wad of white semen directly against your cervix. This could happen at any time; SHE has been edging inside of you for *hours*. Of course, there’s no risk of pregnancy: birth control drugs have been slipped into your meals every day since you came to live here.

And besides, at this moment, pregnancy is the least of your worries. Right now, a rubber-clad *fist* - HER first - is pressing roughly against your lubricated anus. It’s not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won’t be the last.

When that time comes, perhaps Sarah will feel bad about what she’s done to you. After all, she’s not heartless by any means. But she’s spent far too many years holding back, and now that you’ve opened the floodgates, there’s no way in Hell she’ll let them close.

But right now, Sarah Korhonen is doing the dishes.

---

How do you know Ms. Korhonen?

- *The Intern*: You’re new to the company, and you quickly come to appreciate Sarah’s hands-on approach to employee management. She keeps you well-informed on what needs to be done and how to do it, keeps you in the loop on all pertinent information, and insists that if ever you need help or advice, her door is always open. After all, she was the new girl once, and you want to succeed. You know office romance is frowned upon by upper management, but asking her out on a date wouldn’t be *too* scandalous, after all she’s done to help you...

- *The Neighbor Girl*: Ms. Korhonen had been a fixture of the suburb for several years before your family arrived, and was the first to welcome you all to the neighbourhood - with a fantastic fruit arrangement and pastry tray in tow, of course. Soon enough, she and your mother were fast friends, and not long after that you began doing chores around the kindly-natured woman’s house. You certainly couldn’t complain: the pay was exceptional for the kind of menial labor involved, and you never felt so well-fed as you did heading home after a post-lawnmowing ‘snack’ with Sarah. Perhaps - no, almost certainly - because of the hormones running through your adolescent mind - you began to fantasize about the smoking-hot older woman, and soon you began to devise plans to seduce her...

- *The Waitress*: Honestly, you never thought you’d be working at the restaurant long enough to have a favorite customer, but when it came to Sarah, you always knew you would have a pleasant shift. For one, her tips were always exceptional - sometimes going as high as 50%! She would always give it a hand-wave: “Oh, where else am I going to spend it? Besides, you always do *such* a good job…”. Whenever it was a slow shift, you found yourself sitting across from her, chatting sometimes for hours between customers. Talking was always *easy* with her, and sometimes you got the impression that she was a bit lonely. What the hell, maybe it’s about time the two of you eat somewhere *else* for a change...

- *Someone Else:* Surprise me!

Got waitlisted and rejected after second round to 2 big4s, I came very close to getting an internship offer at one Big4, (post history for more info if interested), but now I'm in a pretty unfortunate situation

Up to this point I've been told by peers and professors that I have extremely high chances of getting big4 offers, so that boosted my ego and I guess I was being really arrogant by only applying to two places during the start of recruiting season, both being big4. Completely underestimated the competitiveness

Anyways, now I'm about to just mass send out applications and hope for the best, my resume is pretty good so I'm banking on that catching a recruiter's attention. I have a list of 24 firms/companies that I'm going to reach out to, but my question is, some application processes allow me to attach files besides my resume, such as a cover letter. Should I attach one? Will they even read it? Also, is it bad practice to just cold email the firms if they don't have open applications?

I know without a contact or referral I'll probably have a low chance of getting even interviewed but I need to try anyways at this point 

And my question about recruiting season is simply, is it too late? By the time they read my resume it'll probably be late November, then a first round interview, and by the time I finish second round it'll probably be late December!

I have done a bit of everything in CS - coding, databases, system design, research work etc.

My mind is extremely confused and has these thoughts: 

* I love explaining my project to non-technicals and patiently breaking down their requirements

* Continuously working on my soft skills

* I love data analysis and data driven businesses

* I do not enjoy coding for days, although I have slogged through them

* I always end up being the guy who has to lead the project, manage stakeholders, create good documentations, try to keep the project close to requirements (often professors and sometimes actual clients)

All my experience is academic. When you read my vague list of interest, do you see me as someone who would enjoy working as a BA.

Some other questions:

* Is Business Analyst for me and how did you choose to be a BA? 
* Can you explain a busy day at work, toughest tech and non tech challenges?
* What does a BA gets promoted to? 
* Do BA get paid well? (could be vague and tough to ans, if you cannot it is fine)
* How does a BA with strong technical understanding progress? 
* Can I start off as a BA and then grow into a role where tech is more needed since I do have some knowledge from years of studying. 

I will have to get my first full time job by Feb. I want to know if I am leaning towards BA for the right reason or just that I am not confident of excelling as a dev or QA."

-----

I work as an intern at a tech company. Very high end stuff, nanomachines, quantum computing, brain controlled software, all of it. And it is fascinating. But there is more to life than filing papers and fetching coffee. 

So when I get a chance to take a product home I jump on it. It's a canister of new adaptive fabric. Eventually it's supposed to be a spray on bikini or the like but for now it's a bit thicker than that. The dark fluid is filled with, and in fact more than half made of nanomachines capable of changing the cut, colour and style of the garment once applied. They are pseudo-organic, feeding off of sweat and carbon in the air and heat to keep themselves active. They also have a very simple evolutionary program to ensure they are successful as repair and limited replication.  

The first night out is great. The NDA I signed forbids talking about what I'm wearing but everyone thinks I look great and more than a few wonder how I managed to sneak six dressed into a single party. I wind up just a bit drunk and making out with a guy afterward. That night the nano-fabric doesn't want to come off. 

The next day I can't resist keeping it on, though now looking like more daytime attire. I do some digging through company files and figure out how to attach the nanites to my computer so I can teach them new clothing. So I look great in a blouse and jeans, very form fitting. And with no underwear. Not that anyone can tell. I get plenty of compliments at work. And every time my supervisor comes by (okay supervisor and professor) he keeps smiling at me. I admit I get a bit hot when he does and I swear the tiny machines know it, they keep buzzing on me whenever I get turned on. In the middle of the day I disappear to tease myself in the bathroom. No need to even remove the jeans, they just stretch and enhance the sensation. It's the best orgasm I've ever had. Some part of me wonders if this was supposed to happen. The rest is to happy to care. This is amazing, everyone should try it.

A week later I haven't changed at all. The garment is self cleaning, eating whatever I give it, and then some. I haven't been to work in three days, I just stay home masturbating all the time. The cloth doesn't mind, it just keeps upping the pressure. 

A week later still. I swear this thing is changing me, giving me a bigger bust and hips, or at least the illusion of it with folds of fabric. I am slimmer. I think it's gotten into me some how. I do seem slimmer. But I eat. The garment needs nourishment as well. It hasn't left it's default tight black form in days

Two months later. There are rumors going around town, about some super freak. She'll do just about anything for or to anyone. You just have to not mind that she stays clothed the whole time. If you can call fetish outfits and catsuits clothing. But everyone who fucks her is so worn they take at least a week off after they meet up. Unharmed but happy. 

Half a year on. I moved into one of the slave's houses recently, a proper mansion with space enough for all the little playthings. The fabric is spreading, all of them now clad perfectly in tight black nano-cloth, blissed out of their minds. And of course I obey the swarm as well. It uses me to make more of itself, to spread like a disease. It wishes to consume and grow, and to keep us happy. And so I am it's vessel of earthly delight....

So yeah, world ending grey goo type stuff made into a sexual predator. Just an idea that popped into my head. If you want to hop into the narrative at any point along my fall feel free. Someone who controls the stuff, someone who wants to take control, someone who wants to free me. I leave it to you. Hope you enjoyed."
5duye4,4,2016-11-19,"I (21F) think that others think of me as lame and unadventurous, and I'm starting to feel the same. I didn't mind until now.",friendawayidk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5duye4/i_21f_think_that_others_think_of_me_as_lame_and/,"This is the first ""personal thing"" problem I've posted here, and it's a throwaway. 

I'm a senior in college, and I'm noticing now more than ever that I'm seen as pretty unadventurous and boring to other people. I can for sure say that I have some strengths -- I'm a good conversationalist and a kickass friend, and I try not to hold the conversation on myself, so I think most people don't really notice this until they've known me awhile. But the truth is that I have a pretty low-key life, and when I'm around a lot of high-key people I wonder if I should be doing something different.

This came up for me now because a few days ago, the person I've been seeing came over and helped me make food. Three of my roommates came in, all of whom I love and consider close friends. The conversation turned to a few different TV shows, none of which I've seen -- I don't watch a lot of TV. Everyone was making references to a few different shows and I had no idea what was going on. Then the conversation changed and a few minutes later someone asked who in the room had ever gone to lecture or rehearsal drunk or high. Everyone had gone drunk but me, and I don't smoke pot. They then mentioned dropping acid (my partner has) and rolling molly (one roommate has), and talked about that for awhile. 

One of those on its own obviously wouldn't be a big deal, but I've started to notice a very familiar trend. I'm just not adventurous when drinking or using drugs. I'm a total lightweight, and it would be easy to see I'm drunk in class, so I've never done that. I don't smoke for a variety of reasons, one of which is that my chosen career path is to work with drug addicts and all jobs have urine tests attached, and this is the time to be searching for jobs -- I think that's a totally good/legitimate reason. As for the TV, I simply don't like TV. If I'm going to do something in my free time, it's going to be reading or taking a walk or one of several other things that's not TV.

Taken by themselves all of these are totally reasonable, I think, and I'm not insecure about them. What bothers me is that at the moment, like at many moments recently, I felt pretty out of touch and grandma-ish. For the record, my roommates and partner are GREAT students and not at all in the habit of dropping acid (one has once) or going to orchestra high (another has once). These are things they've done once, not particularly enjoyed, and can tell stories about, just for the adventure of it/for shits and giggles. But I don't have anything like that. 

I'm smart, do well in school, and am very friendly -- I hope that doesn't sound obnoxious, but I increasingly feel like (and am probably coming across as) a highly introverted shy person, and I'm not. It's just that I can't speak to anything at all ""on the wild side"" that my friends have done. Again, I'm not a recluse; I'm seen as pretty social and I enjoy that, which is why I'm kind of at a loss here. I'm absolutely happy to listen to stories of people doing molly, or listen to people talk about TV shows, but there's only so long I can stand there smiling/listening/talking about what I do know when I haven't done any of that stuff. 

I am modest around other people (again, sorry for putting that here -- kind of defeats the purpose), and I do often feel that I'm underestimated in terms of work ethic or cool stuff I've done. For instance, I've held two pretty darn cool internships and have a winter job at the most recent one, which I'm hoping (knock on wood) turns into a real job. Part of my problem overall here, I think, is that I go to a high-pressure prestigious school where people practically wear their pumped-up resumes on their forehead, and my reluctance to yammer about myself is a little bit in protest of the school culture. So I've definitely resigned myself to the fact that people may see me being quiet about job prospects when others aren't, and assume I have none -- I have no problem with that. But that self-confidence comes down when I look around and realize that all of the non-studious ""fun"" tomfuckery that you're supposed to have in college doesn't apply to me.

This isn't a case of being jealous of one specific person; that, I think, I could talk myself out of. But I definitely don't kick my own ass to produce a ""sparkle"" in the way that some people do, and I suppose there is a part of me that's afraid I come off as naive for having not done a lot of things that others have. And in a way I feel my time running out. I'm not about to go rig up a homemade skydiving suit and jump off a building, but at this rate it's totally possible I'll come out of college with no sense of how to stick out as a person. I don't want that.

My question here is mostly whether any of you guys have friends like this, and what you think of them. Am I right that I'm probably coming off as the weird hermit? If so, does anyone have advice for me? 

TL;DR I have a pretty steady enjoyable life, but I'm reluctant to do particularly risky things or brag about myself, and I come off as boring or naive. Wondering if anyone has tips."
5duzet,1,2016-11-19,Mid twenties - no hard skills - looking for advice!,Woke_but_Broke,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5duzet/mid_twenties_no_hard_skills_looking_for_advice/,"Hello, r/Advice!

Honestly, I am admittedly hesitant in writing this out because some could very possibly deem this post as nothing more than a whiny rant. To be clear - in posting this, I am not aiming to elicit pity or validation; rather, I am seeking advice - be it a point in the right direction or even a reality check. This is a throwaway account. With the disclaimer out of the way:

Let's start with the positives!

I am in my mid twenties. am in good health, have a college degree, and a wife who is not only beautiful mentally and physically, but also supportive. Outside of joint college debt of around 45k that is currently being managed, we are in great financial shape and have a pretty decent amount of savings (almost 10k). I am currently working an office job for an up-and-coming company that I strongly believe will give me great job security - if I continue working there - for years to come. I have a supportive, loving family and a small yet awesome group of friends. For all of these things, I am extremely fortunate and very thankful.

Reason for my post (the negatives):

*My college degree is basically useless (interdisciplinary studies)

*My current job (I started a little over three months ago) does absolutely nothing in scratching my deep-seated itch to try to make a positive impact on the world: i.e helping/protecting others, resolving issues that plague society, bringing to justice the corrupt and criminal, etc.. I know for a fact that the only difference me and my coworkers make is maybe adding on a few cents to the company's stock. Feels pointless and like a waste of potential. Though I tell myself that my job IS important for our financial well-being and my resume, I think my brain is fighting back that notion very strongly at a sub-conscious level. I have a hard time absorbing vital info that is essential to me in performing the job optimally. I have the ""new guy amnesty period"" for a little while longer, but I know that soon, I will fall behind in what is expected of me and will probably start having a hard time... this is very frustrating because I know that, when I am interested in something, my brain obsesses about it and acts like a sponge! It is extremely frustrating to not be able to absorb the knowledge needed to do my job independently and at high efficiency. I am already seeing coworkers hired around the same time as me transitioning from the ""fake-it-till-you-make-it"" stage to actually knowing the ins-and-outs of the occupation...whereas I feel like I am going to be stuck eternally in the ""faking"" stage. I feel like my brain is more occupied with things it deems more important - such as the state of our government, ever-increasing ideological polarization fueled by the media, Russia having a Satan II missile that can wipe out areas as big as Texas, how our society is becoming increasingly reliant on (and ignorant of the consequences of) technology that is utilized to both help it and exploit it... and so on. These are examples of the types of issues I have been fixated on since childhood. My brain naturally comes back to them time and time again.

Bottom line: I am bored, my job feels overwhelmingly pointless in the grand scheme of things, though I am currently performing to standards, and perhaps am even considered promising, I feel like a fraud, and my brain seems to be rejecting any attempts at just sucking it up and learning the ins and outs of said job.  I know im not living up to my potential both in the occupation I am currently in, and how I am performing doing it. It is driving me mad, and I know I need to do something else - risk of financial fallout be damned. I feel like a fish trying to climb a tree. I know I am not at all stupid, but I just in no way feel cut out for what I am currently doing.

I am pretty certain that I am smart. I was in the gifted and talented program in school, and I have always done well at IQ and aptitude tests taken over the years. 

Here's the catch though: I never really harnessed it. Instead of developing study skills and trying to max out my potential for the first 20+ years of my life, I took the path of least resistance. I never studied in grade school (though i got good grades and made honors) and I took easy classes in college to continue that trend - hence my useless interdisciplinary degree. Anything that requires study I avoided like the plague, and I regret that immensely. I didn't come out of undergrad with any hard skills, but I did come out with a pretty fried attention span due to probably too much gaming and social media, as well as a mediocre work ethic that I am ashamed of. ""Hard work beats talent when talent isn't working hard"" is so very true, and now, though I know I have some degree of talent, I very much feel behind the curve because I never really worked hard...

Now, with all of this in mind, armed with 20/20 hindsight and a much more mature outlook on life, I am seriously considering going back to school. I know I need to go back for something I am passionate about, because after years of uninspiring jobs, it seems that having a purpose and a passion behind something I do will really enable me to live up to my full potential (my brain won't be constantly rebelling against me). I am very much interested in international relations, computer science,  and politics in general, but due to my lack of study skills I have an overall shallow understanding of those fields. For this reason, I am really considering getting another bachelors and then pursuing a Masters, seeing that I have more than likely a pretty sloppy educational foundation to go into grad school with...Getting another bachelors before a Masters could really open more doors for internship opportunities as well.

Reading this over, this is more than likely coming across as a disorganized rant. I probably should talk to a psychologist or something. Perhaps this whole wall of text comes off as pretentious and entitled. I am very aware that many people never end up in the career field that they are interested in or have a passion for. Should I just accept that perhaps that reality is for me too and I should just be thankful for what I have now? I am just looking for advice and am thankful to receive any and all feedback and/or direction. thank you!

You meet me on the first day of your Orientation. I'm a marketing intern, 22, 5'3 with quite a small frame but with an athletic look about me, even in the conservative dress suit I'm wearing. I have blonde hair that comes down to my shoulder but is tied in a very severe bun.

You keep trying to talk to me, and after a while I find it annoying so report you to HR. I see you get called outside and get a semi public dressing down, but I'm disappointed to see that you're not fired.

Someone tells me it's because you're top of your class in your engineering dept, and you've done some project that the Hierarchy find interesting.

I find this disgusting as you made me feel uncomfortable, but I decide I can always raise the matter again with HR at a later stage, and put it to the back of my mind.

You find the next few months hard. Especially after such a bad start.

You slowly make yourself indispensable to your team however and become well liked.

One day one of the VPs is on site, he's a bit intimidating, and you stay out of his way.

You see a steel cable under tension about to snap moments before it actually does. You dive, dragging the VP with you saving him from death or serious injury.

He gets to his feet looks at you, says nothing and walks off.

The next day you're called in to see the VP. You think you might get a belated thank you.

Instead you're met with stern eyes. He looks at you grimly points to a folder on the table.

""I had no idea"" he says ""no idea! that I had some sort of sex pest working for me"" he bangs the table ""disgusting that we've taken someone into our employ that doesn't know how to treat women""

You groan inwardly he's found out about the sexual harassment complaint.

You go to say something but he lifts his hand indicating for you to be silent ""This way"" he says

He leads you down the corridor to a room, you've never been in before, he needs a key card to get in.

As the door opens your hear male laughter. 7 of the companies top execs are gathered around a table.

It takes you a moment to comprehend what you're seeing, one of the men has his back to you, his trousers around his ankle, he's fucking a woman who's bent across the table in long hard thrusts while the others look on. There's another woman at the opposite end of the table getting similar treatment from your immediate boss, who gives you a wink when he notices you.

The woman whose face you can make out you recognise as a HR executive, a young brunette in her early 20's who people had remarked on as being young for her job.

Then you see me, I'm standing there in the corner, puzzled by my exclusion so far.

The VP slaps you on the shoulder ""We've saved her for you lad"" he says slapping you on the shoulder ""she's been working hard for these last few months, and she's learned quite a bit""

He gives me a nod and I start to undress.

I don't hesitate. I strip off quickly stepping out of my shoes and then removing my skirt and blouse quickly, I'm standing there in just my knickers.

When I take my blouse off you see I'm not wearing a bra, but then my tiny A cup breasts hardly need one.

""she's got no tits that one"" Grevins says loudly ""but she makes up for it in other way, that tiny little piece has the tightest pussy and arse you'll ever fuck""

I fold my skirt and blouse neatly over a chair, and pull my knickers down, and stand there

The VP walks you over to me, as he says ""now she can be a bit lazy and likes to just lie there, but you show her who's the boss"" he nudges you in a friendly way, and says in an odd way, ""show us what you can do"" he says.

And now I have nothing. 

I realized I hated my job (would cry in the bathroom every shift) and I hated the 2 hour commute to school where I couldn't make friends, and I left my internship because I felt worthless. I was due to move in with a former coworker before I lost it all but now i have to remain living with my parents (dad is an alcoholic and beyond hope). As for my boyfriend, he was a co-worker with ADHD who suddenly lost interest in me after he had pursued me for weeks. It was a big blow to my self-esteem to hear that I was a decision he made on impulse and throughout our time together his inattentiveness honestly fucked with me. I still remember the night he broke up with me. He had an engraved ring with our date and told me he had planned to give it to me but instead decided to break up.

I feel like I am just not meant for this life.

In my history of battling depression since age 13, I have never had a job that I could hold for more than 6 months; had a good steady relationship; or keep all my classes I registered for (I would have to drop one or two because of lack of concentration). I honestly hoped this year would be different. 

 I know my friends and family are totally sympathetic but I don't CARE to hear ""it happens"" or ""you'll be back up soon"". I KNOW I will be okay one day but I also know I will feel like shit again. 

Even if I wasn't going through all these issues, I'd still suffer from depression because of the strong genetic hold it has on me. And with winter season coming I may contemplate suicide.

Applying for CS major in all and put Computer Eng./Undecided for alternate.


Demographics: Asian(Chinese)/White male

GPA: Freshman-&gt;Junior year: 3.59 at a top 200 in U.S. school, GPA senior year is currently 3.83 and looks like it will probably end up in the 3.8-3.9 range by the end of the semester (have A's in all classes except for a B in French III)(All unweighted GPA I should add)

Course load has been pretty heavy throughout highschool, I've been in honors/AP math every year except junior where I took Calc instead of AP Calc because I got a C/C+ in Honors Pre-Calc so I recognized that I needed to take a step back and re-evaluate my study habits.  

AP classes taken so far: AP Physics and AP Comp Sci

AP Classes Senior year: AP Micro/Macro Econ, AP Stats, AP English Lit and Project Lead the Way Biomedical Engineering (counted as a dual enrollment)

ACT: 31 SAT(old): 2020

Extracurricular: National Honor Society, Volunteering at random places (art museum, senior center, etc..), 2 summer internships at a local tech startup as a technical intern (programming, data entry, coffee runs, etc..), 1yr JV tennis/3 yr Varsity tennis, and currently involved in the HOSA competition (national biomedical science competition) 

I have a large legacy at UW Madison (grandpa, dad, dom all did undergrad there and grandpa was a professor at UW Eau Claire), and I currently live in Seattle, so I get in-state treatment for UW Seattle.

----
So I think the thing I'm really worried about here is the fact that in sophomore year I got a solid C/C+ in pre-calc which is a huge outlier in my grade trend.  I'm also worried about highlighting my great performance senior year on my apps, since for the schools I've applied to so far, only my freshman-&gt;junior year grades are being seen and I feel like in senior year I've finally just figured everything out and I feel like I'm totally ready to take on any academic challenge whereas I was still figuring things out freshman-&gt;junior year.  I mean, if they defer me and ask for my current grade report, that's one thing, but I feel like by being deferred, there is already some bias placed on your application.  

Is there some way I can really highlight the academic growth I've experienced in senior year on my apps? 

------

On a side note: does anyone know how long it takes to get a response for rolling admissions typically? I applied to University of Minnesota on Sept 26 for the Nov 1st priority deadline and I still haven't gotten a response.

Also, other schools I'm applying to:

UC Berkeley (my way out there school)

UCLA

University of Illinois - Urbana

UMinn-Twin Cities

Western Washington University (safety)

Also any suggestions for match schools would be greatly appreciated!!"

I started college back in 2009 and did horribly for a few years and being an addict.  This completely wrecked my GPA 

I've come back to college as a CS major(never settled on a major for more than 2 semesters before cs) and have been doing much better this time around (especially being 2.5+ years sober)

I've got a Major GPA of 3.23 and am on track to get it even higher this semester. However my Cumulative GPA is at 2.36 because of how poorly I did my first time around and how that stays on my transcript (talked to records, nothing they can do about it) 

It truly sucks being an A and B level student who can't apply for internships because so many places seem to have a 3.0 minimum. 

What can I do to make sure I get a decent internship? I have a real passion for computer science and feel that I am capable of really good work. Like really, this field keeps me sane. 

Some basic info:
basically only have school projects but working on more. 
Taken Data Structures and got through with an A.  
Consider myself proficient for a student with c++ and especially Java. 

Any advice is really appreciated

+ CGPA: 98.66/100. Three times Dean's Lists and several other monetary awards for academic performance.

+ TOEFL: 102. GRE: 147 Verbal, 166 Quant, 4.0 Writing. I screwed up the Verbal test so bad because I did not have enough time preparing for it. Also, I thought I did well on the Quant test but somehow I got only 166, which was a bit lower than my expectation.

+ Had a paper accepted to the short paper track of an international conference.

+ Did an internship at Google. Had 6 or 7 side-projects. One of them is an Android app, which currently has about 100.000 downloads and an average rating of 4.5+.


I really want to retake my GRE but it seems quite late at this point and I also feel like I want to do other meaningful things rather than just memorizing words that I would never use outside of this test. Should I still apply to top schools such as Stanford, Cornell, CMU, ... or is it just a waste of time ? Will they have some system that automatically filters me out due to my low GRE ?

After I have finished high school I went directly to university and was a very good student in terms of books, exams, gpa...etc (which is something I have realized that is not critical). I have never been satisfied with being only good in exams, so I went for an internship. I found one in a very big company. Nice topic to work on, good learning options, all available technology...bla bla bla.....I wasn't able to do most of the job, I didn't finish the task assigned to me and finished the 6 months internship with a big dissapointment. Because I have realized that although I used to believe that I am a good student, I wasn't good enough to do the job. I didn't give up, I aimed to improve myself by doing the thesis, but it was again another disappoitment. Since then I am not able to study anything or even understand anything, because I know no matter how much I study, what I understand I can't use in work. I studied circuits, electronics, Signal processing, programming languages...etc. but I wasn't able to use any of my knowledge in work.

I am doing masters now and doing a student job in an engineering company to finanace my studies. I got the job because my CV looks interesting, but now I am again not able to do the job. My supervisor is giving me tasks and I can't do them. I am trying to learn, but I can't apply what I have learned to the tasks. I am now only studying to pass the exams, because I am in a state of mind where I believe because of my previous experience, that whatever I learn I will only get a high grade in the exam, but won't be able to use it in practice.

I have been trying to find out what I can do and what I can excel at. Whether it's programming, electronics, design or modelling or any other thing, but I am not able to. I don't have any skills and I am not interested in anything that can be related to a professional career. I spend most of the days, working out, cooking, listening to music, video gaming and walking in the city. I just go to work 2 days a week and go back home and don't attend classes anymore.

I realize that it's just a matter of time before I graduate and find myself jobless, no money and might not be able to find a job.

It's not depression, frustration or lack of motivation which is causing this problem. I have always had those just like any other healthy individual, and was able to manage through school and high school. But real life isn't high school and maybe I am not good as an engineer. But if I am not supposed to work in engineering, then what should I do.

I knew I was competitive.  My resume was flawless.  I spoke 3 languages (worked on a 4th), top of my class all the way, kicked ass in every assignment I've been in, had leadership and training experience, and recognized by peers and leadership as being one of the best in my field.  Knew that the process was going to take a while so I filled the time with taking contract jobs that would make me even more appealing as a candidate.  

Well I did it for two years and passed everything thrown my way.  And just around the time they gave me a conditional offer, I had taken a contract job that would be amazing on a resume.  Relocated dutifully and took the offer.  All I had to do was pass a polygraph test.  I didn't think anything of it since I had nothing to hide.

Well, I sat there and answered everything. Guy came back and said I was lying even though I told the truth.  Went through it again and he kept on interrogating me.  And after about 3 fucking hours, I broke.  Ashamed to say but for the first time in my life I experienced a panic attack.  Literally thought I was going to die. I sat there and just thought about all the symptoms.  That calmed me down a little since I vaguely knew what was happening.  The guy interrogating me definitely had an ""oh shit"" moment.  Spent another 30 minutes interrogating me and produced a piece of paper to say that he didn't treat me poorly during the process.  By that time I was so out of it and fearful of my career that I just signed it to get the fuck out of there.

The next 24 hours was a haze.  I didn't know what to think.  What the fuck is going on?  Well, as much as it bothered me to ask for another one, it bothered me even more that my loyalty and integrity was questioned.  I would've given everything for my country.  And now this piece of shit and his bullshit piece of equipment stood in the way of everything I ever worked for.  Well I took it again and didn't pass.  Took it again and, again, I didn't pass.  I must've spent a total of 20-25 hours being fucking interrogated.  What the fuck is going on?  

Well, I still don't know what's going on.  All I know now is, because of my inability to pass, I can no longer work in the career I've worked so hard for.  A job that gave me meaning, purpose, and pride.  All because of pseudoscience bullshit and probably a group of people trying to protect the asshole that gave me a panic attack.  When I was sitting at work and security escorted me out of the building like I was some kind of fucking criminal, I didn't know what was going on.  I was shocked, I felt numb, and I just went.  Got in my car and smoked a cigarette.  I relocated, didn't really know anyone, and didn't know where to go.  Just sat in my car and had a cigarette.

I went back to my shitty apartment and stayed there for a year.  Literally became a hermit for a year.  Didn't talk to friends or loved ones back home who thought I was working hard.  Here I am nearing my mid-30s, losing every progress I've ever made, and contemplating suicide.  Had no idea where my next check was coming from since I can no longer work in the one thing I kicked ass in.

Well at the end of that year and a few months, I got a chance to take on an internship.  I'm starting over from scratch but I hope everything will work out.  If it doesn't I don't think I can take another setback like that again.  I gave it all chasing a career.  Broken relationships, missed birthdays, and anniversaries.  You name it.

As you may know it is important to keep a step ahead in our great meme war. One of my friend worked as an intern in the Socialist Party and told me that there has been an insistent rumor for months concerning “President” Hollande communication to boost his popularity and increase his media coverage. Hollande would be planning his wedding with Julie Gayet to make it happen just before the election. If it is true it means than during the last weeks of the campaign, medias will be more interested by Hollande than other candidates. I think we should start thinking about way to turn this at our advantage or at least reduce the impact on the opinion. 

Considering this information, there are 2 Important things: 

- When you aim for Hollande attack him on his ridiculous relation with Julie Gayet (“Scooter-Man”, look at Trierweiler …). This can be made right now and will make people more likely to find ridiculous the idea of a wedding if the announcement of a wedding is made.

- Start thinking about a counter-attack to be ready. If the announcement of a wedding is made, then we could respond immediately. A cocktail of well prepared memes will always be more powerful than just some memes made in emergency

-----------------------------------------

Comme vous le savez, il est important de garder un coup d’avance dans la « great meme war ». Un de mes amis travaillait comme stagiaire au PS et m’a dit qu’il y a depuis plusieurs mois une rumeur persistante concernant la communication du « Président » Hollande pour booster sa popularité et braquer les caméras sur lui. Hollande serait en train de planifier son mariage avec Julie Gayet et compterait le faire juste avant l’élection. Si c’est vrai alors cela veut dire que pendant les dernières semaines de la campagne, les médias s’intéresseront plus à Hollande qu’aux autres candidats. Je pense qu’on devrait commencer à réfléchir aux manières de retourner un tel événement à notre avantage ou au moins réduire son impact médiatique.

Si on prend en compte cette information, il y a 2 choses importantes :

- Quand on veut taper sur Hollande, il ne faut pas oublier de ridiculiser sa relation avec Julie Gayet (l’histoire du Scooter, Ressortir les affaires de Trierweiler, regardez des interviews de J. Gayet sur Hollande, vous trouverez des perles pour faire des memes). Cela peut être fait dès maintenant et plus il y aura de gens qui trouveront ridicule la liaison entre Hollande et Gayet, plus il y aura de gens qui trouveront l’idée du mariage ridicule

What is up guys?

Last week I discussed how to use a tell a good Snapchat story. If you missed part 1/4 of the series, no worries, it’s right here:

[A Snapchat Guide to Game: How to create captivating stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5cmrub/a_snapchat_guide_to_game_how_to_create/)

A good Snapchat story leads to people watching you more = which leads to people engaging with you = which leads to people messaging you = which leads to you turning those conversations into opportunities for you to expand your social circle and improve your dating life.

Again, happy to help, feel free to send your stories my way and I can give feedback (add me: Snapsocialguru).

Now that we know how to tell a good and engaging story, it’s time to think about the different ways we can apply Snapchat to our lives.

After all, there is no point in creating these amazing stories if nobody is there to watch them. This post is meant to solve that problem for you.

There are many contexts in which you can use Snapchat to enhance your life.

You can use it to nurture your Tinder/OKC/Bumble leads, stay at top of mind with real friends, re-spark old flings and friendships, and build commonalities with new friends.

These are the four areas I'm going to touch on, but you can do a lot, and I'll leave that creativity up to you.

These four areas are meant to help expand your approaches with Snapchat and hopefully spark ways in which you can apply it to your own life.

---

**Snapchat is for guys what Instagram is to models**

Before i dive into these four areas where you can apply snapchat into your life, i want to talk about why you're doing yourself a major disservice if you're not using snapchat as a part of your overall social and dating strategy.

Snapchat is to guys what Instagram is to models and pretty girls and what Facebook is to family and old friends.

Again:

* Instagram is the best platform for girls, especially models and pretty girls.
* Facebook is for family and old friends.
* Twitter is for celebrities and famous people.
* Snapchat is the best for for guys.

Here is the number one reason why Snapchat is the absolute best platform for guys: You are not looking try hard. Instead, you are passively showing value, rather than doing it directly.

This is extremely important, especially as you begin people collecting and adding more people to your snapchat.

You want your story to be like a mini television show that people just keep coming back to.

You want your story to be as captivating and alluring as Game of Thrones.

This is what is going to bring people into your life and engage you, rather than you always being the one chasing and sending messages to make things happen.

Other than Snapchat, the only other way people come to you this often is if you're famous. I never got randomly hit up prior to Snapchat and when I did i had to work hard in real life to show people that i'm someone worth hanging with on the weekends. i had to drastically work harder to build that social capital.

But the snapchat story allowed to me build a machine that passively marketed me.

By consistently posting good stories, people began engaging me.

---

**Area #1: Tinder, Bumble, and Dating Sites**

Tinder, Bumble, OKC and other dating sites:

I don't collect numbers for females I meet online.

If things are going good, I add them on Snapchat.

There's a multitude of reasons as to why i add them on snapchat instead of getting their numbers.

But the main reasons are that i can build familiarity with females without even trying.

This is done by posting on my story and giving the females the opportunity to watch my stupid videos.

What happens over time is the females become familiar with you, this is exactly what you want.

In relation to online dating, the reason why females flake on dates all the time or aren't receptive to your date requests is because they're afraid of meeting a creep or afraid of going on a bad date. That's it. The other reason is because you lack social capital (aka: they don't know how cool you are).

However, Snapchat can easily help you overcome females' fears of you being a creep, you being ""uncool"", and overall unfamiliarity.

This is because Snapchat stories allow you to passively show your lifestyle and value without even trying.

If a girl has been watching your stories for the past two weeks, she has a clear idea of the kind of guy you are, what you do, and your sense of humor. The law of familiarity and proximity automatically apply themselves for you on Snapchat.

Call to action: begin adding females you chat from dating apps to your snapchat. Typically, 9/10 females you won't hit it off immediately and need some ""warming up"". Trust that as time goes on, your story will inspire attraction. No need to follow up with them immediately upon adding with anything other than, ""hey it's {!name}, your favorite tinder crush. Try not to send me too many selfies"". That's all i do and then my marketing machine ""nurtures"" them for me.

With the 1/10 females I do click with over dating apps, i add them on snapchat also but focus on them more directly and proactively. Make sense?

Naturally, some of the females will fall in between the cracks. But some of them will come back later when the timing is right.

The point is that now they are at least in your ""marketing funnel"". And while you're actively pursuing and conversating with the females who are most receptive to you already, your Snapchat stories are passively “gaming"" the rest of the females.

What usually end up happening with this system or ""funnel"" as i like to call it, is that when one fling dies off or gets stale, there's another one ready to be opened or now more receptive to your messaging (whereas she wasn't so receptive before and conversations were more difficult to carry.

That's what the Snapchat funnel will do for you (will go more into the idea of the funnel in part 4 of this series — as its a major topic that deserves its own post).

---

**Area #2: Social Circle and Family**

Another area you can use Snapchat for is your real life social circle and immediate friends/family.

As life gets busier for us adults, it's difficult to keep up with all of our old colleagues, best friends who now live all over the state, or our siblings.

Snapchat solves all of that for you.

Snapchat stories are an easy way for you to keep up with old friends, colleagues, and family who live far away.

And this goes both ways.

When people watch your stories, they know what you're up to. They know what you did this weekend. They know how well you're doing.

Ultimately, everyone wants to know you're doing alright and your Snapchat story can portray that for you.

It also offers people in your immediate social circle to comment on your story and easily spark conversations with you.

You will know your Snapchat stories are working for you when people can spark conversations with you based on what you posted over the week.

Quick example, I had a mouse problem in my house and I posted this ridiculous and drawn out story about it over the weekend. When I got back into the office, people at the water cooler were asking, ""so have you caught that damn mouse yet?"".

This is great! Not only did i not have to start the conversation, people opened me, but also... it showed I had people's attention who were most important to me.

The fact that they not only watched my story but also paid attention is a big deal. Most people don't stay at top of mind or relevant in other people's minds.

And i've given the same reciprocity to other people as well.

For example, a fellow colleague posted on her snapchat story that she had an ant problem in her house. She solved this problem by spraying lemon throughout her counters. Her story ended in a photo of a lemon with ants dead all over it and caption, ""lemon suicide"".

The next day when i saw her in the office, i easily sparked a conversation with her. ""So, did you solve the ant problem?"".

Boom! Conversation sparked. It was easy, it was smooth, and it was relevant.

Think about it, if it wasn't for Snapchat, I probably would have opened with, ""uh... so how's your morning? derp lol"".

Think outside the box with Snapchat and know you can apply it to far more places of your life than just game. This guide should really be called the Snapchat Guide to Life because of its applicability.

Use it for your immediate social circle and you will always stay relevant and always be engaged with the people in your life who matter most.

---

**Area #3: Old flings and Past Friendships**

I have a lot of examples in my life where I lost touch with old friends or females I was interested in.

I was interested in them at one point but life naturally pulled us away.

There's not much I need to add to this area but Snapchat can help you rekindle  and rengage old flings.

For example, two years ago I was crushing on a girl from an internship i did. We barely spoke and after the internship ended I moved to a new city and she did too. This was clearly not an ideal situation to work with.

However, i did happen to add her to my Snapchat while we interned together.

Fast forward to now, she's moved to a nearby city and we've recently been able to restart our conversations based on stupid comments I've made on her story or that she's made on mine (i’ll go into more detail in part 3 of the series on how to smoothly start conversations with anyone via Snapchat).

If this fate was purely left to text or some other medium, I can tell you with 1000% certainty that I would've never spoke to her again.

Now i've got a date.

So remember: Snapchat can also be used in your favor to rekindle old flings or friendships.

---

**Area #4: New friends**

This is one of the newer developments of my life where i'm applying Snapchat to.

It's with new friends or people who i'm trying to establish social relationships with.

I actively ""people collect"" for my Snapchat.

In the situations where I have a good conversation on the train or at the bar, instead of number closing, I ask ""Are you on Snapchat?""

I've got a 100% close rate with this question.

The reason being is that people are extremely more open to giving you their snapchat rather than they are to giving you their private number.

This is probably because phone numbers and texting are only relevant and reserved to people who are close to their lives.

Whereas as Snapchat is open to everyone. Snapchat has a more fun and party tone to it than text does.

What this means is that if you fall into the category of ""fun"", which isn't hard to do, you will be getting a 100% conversion rate also on the Snapchat close.

It's important that i iterate the idea of Snapchat not being a ""turnkey"" solution. Because a lot of you will begin to add dozens of people who you barely know to your snapchat.

Which is fine but recognize that these people are going to take some warming up to do before they turn into something, especially if they're high value guys themselves.

After 9 months on Snapchat, I have maintained old and new acquaintances who now happen to live in the same city as I do. I know if i hit them up to kick it or get into the parties they're getting into, they would bring me in.

This is what you can expect as well. You're not going to become best buds with everyone you meet, but they will at least be very familiar with you to the point where if you hit them up, it would not be considered ""weird"" or ""random"".

Make sense?

This is as long as you create valuable content or stories that are cool.

---

This post is meant to show you how many different areas of your life you can apply Snapchat to.

This post is also meant to make you think outside the box; Snapchat is a powerful tool that can be used for far more than just seduction.

Snapchat can be used to greatly improve your overall social life and networking capabilities.

So far, we’ve learned how to create captivating stories.

Now, we’re ramping up by learning how to apply these stories to different areas of our lives.

There are two more posts coming to this guide.

The next post will discuss exactly how to seamlessly start conversations with people and build relationships through Snapchat. It’s a very simple method that almost nobody utilizes on Snapchat; so if you apply it you’re going to be ahead of the curve.

The final post will tie everything together. I call it ""the mindset and system to success”. I’m going to be sharing the mindset to have not only about Snapchat but also social life in general. It’s going to blow you the fuck away, hopefully haha.

Happy Sunday, guys.

If you have any direct questions, just hit me up on Snapchat (Snapsocialguru). I’ve been answering questions all week and giving feedback on stories, so I’m happy to help."

I was hoping you could give me advice with my job hunt and future career path options. In 2010, I graduated with a BA in Mass Communications &amp; Journalism. It took me until July of 2013 to find a job in my field (I had had several internships and did some freelance gigs but this was the first full-time, steady communications job). And I got very lucky as I started out as a Newscast Director at a TV station. Less than two years later I was promoted to Production Supervisor and Lead Director. After a year of that in April of 2016, I moved with my bf to Maryland near the DC area. My problem is all I have experience in is production television. I would be willing to work at a part-time production assistant or anything at all in news, but I can't seem to find an ""in"" here. I had a lot of responsibilities at my old station. We worked with a virtual set, we had loads of technical issues, we were a small group so I ended up booth producing for a year, doing social media, and a multitude of other tasks that weren't really related to my job. I also did a lot of video editing, but as I did not shoot any of the footage it didn't feel right using it for a demo reel. So after two months of getting absolutely no where with the TV stations up here, I opened up my search options. In June I got a job as a Marketing Assistant with a small company doing marketing, social media managing, and event planning among other duties. The thing is - I hate my job. It's a toxic environment. My old tv station was also toxic, but at the end of the day I loved what I did. 

So I have a couple of years experience in TV and about 5 months worth of experience in marketing. My bf has tried to talk me into going back to school, but out of state tuition is ridiculous. Also, we'll be moving next August, so by the time we've been in state long enough it won't be worth it to start school. Not to mention I'm almost done paying off my student loans which has been a tremendous feat, so I'm not sure I'm ready to take that plunge again.

Does anyone have any advice for someone looking to get into the communications field who only has a few years of experience and no demo reel? I feel like I get rejection after rejection and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The only thing I know of is to network. But how do you network without coming across as someone desperate for a job?  Or does anyone suggest going back to school to get a different job? "
5e1vk1,1,2016-11-20,Waiting to apply - Stupid?,FinanceIS,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5e1vk1/waiting_to_apply_stupid/,"Contemplating waiting until CFA Level 1 results are released in August 17 to begin seeking a FT position. Why? Currently interning ~30 hours a week and taking 7 classes. I average roughly 85 hours a week between school/work. I haven't had consistent time to network and hustle hard for any FT recruitment, let alone prepare for technical interviews.

I aspire for an ER position in Chicago, with MO at a BB as fallback. Assuming I pass, my stats would look like this: 3.6 GPA, dual degree: Indiana Finance degree, Purdue Information systems, 3 years experience running the blue-collar family business alongside my father, 17 months experience as an IT intern, L2 candidate, working proficiency in VBA, Java, SQL.

The 2 month layover would be spent honing my technical skills (learning python), probably starting to develop some portfolio management software, traveling (haven't in a decade), becoming 100% fluent in Spanish again. 

Is this logic stupid? Thoughts &amp; criticism are appreciated. Thanks"
5e20sm,16,2016-11-20,Cloudera vs Yelp vs Twitter vs NVIDIA Internship,auku7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5e20sm/cloudera_vs_yelp_vs_twitter_vs_nvidia_internship/,"I have been fortunate enough to receive software engineering internship offers (for summer between my junior and senior year) from Cloudera, Yelp, Twitter, and NVIDIA, and have had difficulty in deciding between the opportunities.

Cloudera

* Would be on a team that works on a core, open source component of Apache Hadoop

Yelp

* Would be on a data mining team that uses machine learning

Twitter

* Would be on a back-end team (but not in SF)

NVIDIA

* Would be on a team doing work with AI.

I think I probably would learn more and have a diverse experience at Cloudera since I do already have a fair amount of machine learning experience already from a significant side project and have little experience in distributed systems. On the other hand, I would be able to apply much of what I know with machine learning at a much larger scale at Yelp. I would also value the opportunity to be in the Bay Area (which would be all three except Twitter) highly.

My main factors in a decision would be:

* how much will having the company and experience on my resume will help in landing interviews at top companies when it comes to full-time positions next year

* reputation of the engineering team

Thanks!

I'm a 21 year old senior, graduating in May 2017. I'm clueless to which direction I want to take my life, and I'm full of regret for not taking more advantages of the opportunities I had at college. I didn't join the debate team, the track club, nor the judo team....I partied a lot and chased women too much. Switched my major from psychology to Computer Science, double majored in math but dropped it...GPA is sitting around a 3.1 currently. Never really studied, and I have 5 withdrawals on my transcript. 

Suffered a lot of depression growing up, junior year (last year) was terrible and I contemplated committing suicide. Finally seeing someone helped a lot, I'm doing much better. I like to think I'm intelligent, and I'm confident I have very good social skills and can deal with a wide array of personality types. 

I just wanted to provide some background information about myself but ideally I'd like to work with technology in some aspect. I can program in Java and some C++ and taught myself how to do web development with Ruby on Rails. Thing is I did an internship over the summer, and absolutely hated the office life.... Would love a job where I'm active and could travel a lot. Even better if I made my own hours! but that's pushing it, right?

I grew up in California with my family when I was very young, I was an immigrant and California was my introduction to the United States. We wound up moving to New England as my dad wanted me to get to know my dying grandmother who lived there and we couldn't bring her down to California because of her health. 

My dad was a cocky entrepreneur who was on fire and believed we would have enough money to come back whenever we wanted. 

Then the dot-com bubble burst and the stock market tanked. His company died and so did our hopes of coming back home. We wound up staying in New England because we had no other choice. Soon afterwards, my family fell apart and my father started to live by himself in a cheap apartment in a run-down neighborhood. 

Fast forward about 15 years. I have been lucky enough to receive several internship offers from big companies. One of them has a location by Los Angeles, which I MIGHT be able to transfer to if I get taken on full time and am very lucky. I told my dad about potentially being able to take him back to California with me and he was extremely excited by the opportunity, to the point that it has inspired him to start trying to pull his life back together financially. However, there are risks involved with this decision. 

If I fail to get transferred to California by that first company, then they would likely make me transfer to Boston instead as that is their big initiative right now, and that is a city that I do not know much about and that doesn't excite me or my dad as much as Los Angeles does. I would get all of the drawbacks of moving by going to Boston, without any real benefits. Most importantly to me, my dad's getting old, and I want him to be happy in his twilight years where he belongs, back home in California. 

I am excited too to be honest, I have always felt that I don't quite jive with the fend-for-yourself mentality a lot of New Englanders have. I'm not trying to say they are all like that, but I definitely sense that its more common here than it should be. I'm also sick of the cold weather 10 months out of the year here, it makes me very uncomfortable. I love the warmth way more. I honestly believe moving to California would allow me to live my life more fully than anywhere else. 

Another element of this predicament is that there is another company that is offering me an internship, and I know I would like to work for that company a little bit more as I like their culture, but it does not have a branch in California. I would be stuck in my current state. 

So here's the mental dilemma I'm stuck with- 
Do I accept an internship with a company with a branch in Los Angeles, even though I may not be able to transfer to it and I am risking having to transfer to Boston instead? 
Or would it be wiser to intern with the company I like more in my current state that will keep me in stuck here, for better or worse?

I'm currently a Junior at Grand Valley State University studying Computer Science with a minor in Applied Statistics. 

Current schedule: Calc 2, Structure of programming langauges, software engineering, algorithm analysis, and a philosophy gen-ed

I would consider myself a relatively successful student academically with a 3.3 GPA. In the previous semesters, the workload was tough, but manageable. I would often find a couple hours at the end of each night to unwind. But this semester has been destroying me mentally. With the combined amount of homework, internship searching, and computing club. I find myself with essentially  zero free time. I find myself doing homework or studying anywhere from 10-16 hours a day. It's tearing me apart and I am starting to notice depressive symptoms as a result.

To top it all off, I had to put off writing a term paper until this final weekend and it's due tomorrow. I wanted to get to it sooner but other assignments got in the way. I have been working on this paper non-stop since Friday night only allowing myself 6 hour breaks to sleep. I'm now starting to realize how shitty my paper is and that I am going to have to retake this class. 

I miss having hobbies. I miss spending time with friends. I MISS HAVING FUN. All I see now is an endless cycle of sleep, stress and anxiety. Im expected to do so much and I accomplish so little. I put my heart and soul into my academics and I'm fucking failing a class. People say ""don't let your grades define you."" But how else am I supposed to define myself when I dedicate every waking moment towards my studies?  

 How do you guys manage your overwhelming schedules? Clearly I'm doing something wrong and I hoping to find an solution. Thanks for reading."

I'm feeling a bit down because I've been applying to different internships for the last two weeks but I still haven't received any reply, am I doing something wrong??

I'm currently in the last year of my bachelor's degree in computer and software engineering and i need to do a 250h internship in order to graduate. I'm studying in Italy but I want to do my internship abroad so I've been applying (by looking mainly on glassdoor) to open positions in the UK and Ireland mainly. I've sent various applications attaching my CV, my linkedin profile, my website and a cover letter but noone has gotten back to me yet. Should I change my approach? Am I hopeless and should I look for something in Italy and be done with it? Help me!:(

Bought 901/902 Professor Messer's PDF notes for $20.
Examcompass and crucial exams 
Professor Messer Videos 

I skimmed through the notes, watched the videos in their entirety, went through all exams from examcompass and crucial exams, and rewatched videos/googled/reviewed topics from the CompTia objectives I was unclear about.

Now that A+ is done (Net+ and Sec+ on the way), what entry level job do I have a viable chance of getting hired for? (read about help desk, want to broaden my search) Or should I pursue an internship instead for experience? I have a B.S. in Biology but have no tech work experience. I'm interested in a path for system admins. Would a a relevant masters degree be necessary to raise my ceiling? 

My goal is to knock out certs and get experience asap to get my feet wet. If I could get a full time position w/ an A+ under my belt, that would be great. Other option is work a part time and pursue an internship. I'll also work on learning languages to strengthen my skillset, starting with Python.

Prin certificarile iso calitatea este atestata

De fapt, certificarea ISO 9001 simbolizeaza o apreciere a calitatii actului managerial de catre un evaluator extern (organism de certificare), o apreciere a bunelor practici din organizatie. Daca o organizatie cu renume in piata in care activeaza, se afla pe o piata slab concurentiala (sau chiar mediu concurentiala), Certificarea ISO 9001 reprezinta si o forma prin care organizatia detinatoare isi poate confirma bunele prestatii efectuate. In acest caz, certificarea nu reprezinta nici pe departe un obiectiv obligatoriu pentru a se mentine pe piata sau pentru a prospera. Pentru o organizatie care se afla pe o piata puternic concurentiala, Certificarea ISO 9001 poate sa reprezinte un obiectiv obligatoriu si unul dintre scopurile organizatiei. Pe o piata puternic concurentiala micile diferente sunt in masura sa determine succesul organizatiei. viziteaza

Standardele internationale sunt indispensabile pentru afaceri, clienti, guverne, comert, consumatori, ele aducand beneficii pentru oricine. Calitatea produselor si serviciilor oferite pe piata, nivelul lor de siguranta, fiabilitatea si intercompatibilitatea, sunt si rezultate ale procesului de standardizare. Avand in vedere ca ciclul de viata al unei organizatii cuprinde o etapa importanta etapa de maturitate, iar calitatea unei organizatii depinde in mare masura de capacitatea de prelungire a acestei etape, acest lucru a fost posibil doar printr-un management eficient, capabil sa mentina organizatia la cerintele reale ale pietei si printr-un control intern dezvoltat. Succesul unei organizatii in realizarea obiectivelor propuse este direct proportional cu modul in care este condusa.

Clientii doresc mereu servicii si produse de calitate

Proiectarea sistemului de calitate se face pe baza raportului de evaluare elaborat in urma unei analize atente si corecte de catre echipa manageriala. Dupa aceasta etapa, se vor lua cele mai bune decizii pentru imbunatatirea procesului de productie daca vorbim despre o companie din acest domeniu.

Practic Sistemul de Management al Calitatii este un mod de conducere a organizatiei orientat catre client sau mai bine zis orientat spre respectarea, de catre produsul/serviciul furnizat, a tuturor cerintelor clientului. ISO 9001:2008 are in vedere o abordare bazata pe managementul proceselor organizatiei si, de aici, o structura mult mai logica, orientarea catre client si evaluarea satisfactiei acestuia, precum si angajamentul top managementului pentru o imbunatatire continua.

5e4ufl,2,2016-11-21,First time dying/bleaching color streak questions,Sarki241,Hair,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/5e4ufl/first_time_dyingbleaching_color_streak_questions/,"Hello there! I've been considering dying or bleaching a 'color streak' of a contrasting, naturally-toned color against my brown hair. This would manifest akin to certain punk hairstyles.

The streak would start from one edge of my cowlick, receding into either one side of my crown or temple, gradually shrinking before fading into my natural color. Assuming this is what my natural color will revert to, I'm aiming for a light blonde.

Now, this style choice has been something I've been considering for, say, 6 months now. So you could say I'm confident accepting this potentially-bold fashion choice (not to mention some parental resistance from my mother.) That being said, there have been a couple key questions that have inhibited me from actually getting the procedure done, as to make it as manageable as possible. Remember, this is a first-time coloring, so my hair has not been treated with any dyes before.

1. **Just in case, are there any products that would help me either make the color closer to my natural color or revert it back to my natural color?** What should I look for? When should I apply them? What is the average price range? Got any brand recommendations?
1. **Are there going to be any effects to my skin or scalp from dying/bleaching?** Like, should I expect itching, redness, etc. What does dying/bleaching actually feel like?

1. **What information would be helpful for my stylist?** Like, what are some things I should specify to them for a more accurate job?
1. **How violating is having a color streak to professional/traditional/formal dress code?** Like, if I were to apply for a job, would my employers be adamant about hiring me due to my fashion choice? Would they assign some images/stereotypes to me, and what ones? I can see myself pursuing internships in the digital arts/game development industries next year. So when I say ""job"", think about the decorum those types of employers expect from their employees (I have a hunch most companies wouldn't care.)
1. **What care should I take in my newly-colored hair?** I figure I'll need to be careful about what shampoos &amp; gels I'd use, for instance. But what are some other things that would be bad to expose to my streak?

Here are some reference images close to the hair I'm aiming for:

I'm a recent graduate considering making a career change. Although I've been using the Linux command line (Ubuntu) for years, mostly for the purpose of scientific research and programming, I have no IT job experience. If I were to get the RHCSA certification from Red Hat, would I be able to get employment afterwards as a junior adminstrator, or would I need further certification? Should I go down this route, I do intend on going further on the Red Hat chain than RHCSA, but I need to start making money ASAP.

If it helps in the job hunt, I'm willing to relocate anywhere and I'm not too picky on salary. (Also, I'm a US citizen, so no need for a visa or sponsorship in the States.) But that being said, I have no contacts or experience or internships, so... what do you think? Will this be enough to land a first job? 

Thank you for your time."
5e4vx8,172,2016-11-21,"Hello, thank you, and goodbye",joshyle,rawdenim,https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/5e4vx8/hello_thank_you_and_goodbye/,"Happy Monday /r/rawdenim family and fellow Internet pants friends! I wanted to give everyone a small update from my end. I recently left my role at Naked &amp; Famous Denim, The Unbranded Brand, and Tate + Yoko to start a new adventure and pursue an entrepreneurial dream of creating my own brand and company (I messaged the mods but haven’t heard back, so I’ll leave out the name out of respect to the rules of the community). 

First of all, I want to thank you and the community for your friendship, support, photos, comments, content, and so on for the past 1.5 years. I wasn’t the most active Tate + Yoko head, but it was my pleasure to speak and interact with many of you over PM, phone calls, in-person, IG, and email. I always browsed and made a point to visit /r/rawdenim, read and add some input to the threads, and upvote all the good stuff people posted. 

Life is journey and I think we should always re-examine what we're doing to ensure we're adding the most value to the world. I'm eternally grateful for my time serving the raw denim community, and I hope to still do so in some capacity because I think we still have one of the best communities. As I reflected on making the decision to leave to start my own company, one of the biggest reoccurring themes for me is how life is all about relationships. We are all connected through our love of denim. Some of my favorite memories at Tate + Yoko were when denimheads from around the globe would visit the store and you’d have that instant bond and camaraderie of loving denim and spending countless hours researching, chatting online, and interacting on superfuture, styleforum, to /r/rawdenim with the community and only having a handful of pants friend IRL. The most amusing scenario is when guys would come in with their (typically female and non-denimhead) partners and I would get to welcome the denimhead home to a safe denim haven and allow them the opportunity to nerd out to their heart’s content with me about all things raw denim. As I’m sure you can imagine or already experience, the partner usually is the recipient of all our denim ramblings (thankfully, my wonderful partner, Jessica, gets me and supports my denim ways. She has about 5 pairs of N&amp;F now). Some of the greatest moments in that previous scenario is when the (typically) female partner would take interest, search, and find a pair of raw denim in-store. I would shed a tear of joy, along with the denimhead’s partner, whenever we can make raw denim couples happen a reality.

I consider it an honor and privilege that I was able to interact with hundreds of thousands denimheads all around the globe through my time with N&amp;F, T+Y, and UB + the millions before through my jeans experiment. I look up to so many of you for your knowledge, passion, and enthusiasm for denim, and you’ve all served as inspiration to me in a variety of capacities. There are so many of you that exist here and on Instagram, and I’m consistently blown away by the quality of content you put out. 

(Forewarning, a long winded account of my denim story) 

I relate so strongly to so many of you because I was in your same positions about 9 years ago when one of my closest friends, Vince, told me about this crazy world of raw denim. I, ironically, thought it was the silliest thing until I saw his jeans evolve over the year and I wanted a pair. I researched forever on superfuture, styleforum, MyNudies before I eventually I got my first pair of Nudie Slim Jims. I wore them for 15 months and 3 weeks without washing them (my views on washing have changed. In short, it’s better to wash more frequently since it’s better for the overall life of the jeans. The frequency depends on you. Also, wash your jeans as you wish because it’s your story and denim, so it will turn out beautifully because they’re a reflection of your story). Before washing them, I approached one of my profs who studied textiles and bacteria with an idea for a jeans experiment, and she agreed to do a case study on them with me. We took my unwashed Nudies of 15 months and did some tests on them, we washed them, and I wore them for 13 days before we did the exact same tests. When we compared the bacteria results, the bacteria counts came back the same (or in Science terms: there was no statistical difference in the bacteria loads)!!! From there, we told our University (proud University of Alberta alum here!) and they got excited, so they sent out a press release announcing the results. My life changed on January 19, 2011 on the day of the press release. I expected a few media outlets to pick up the story, but every single local media station was there that morning!!! The story went local by the morning, went national across Canada in the afternoon, and went international by the evening. The next 2-3 weeks were insane because we got inundated with interview requests (shoutout to my brother, Jon, and family for supporting me through a crazy time). Some of the cooler things that came out was I was dissed on CNN by one of the bro male anchors for not doing other things during that 15 month period (ahem ahem), got on the Today Show Australia and the Daily Planet Canada, and [got a comic made about me by Ripley’s Believe It Or Not](http://www.gocomics.com/ripleysbelieveitornot/2011/08/16).  
   Very shortly after during the weeks of media craziness, one denim source stuck out claiming to be the #1 resource for raw denim: Rawr Denim (now Heddels). The founder, Nick Coe, was a fellow Edmontonian with a grand vision of creating the world’s best raw denim resource, and we met to chat about Rawr Denim. I loved his vision and became one of the first writers for Rawr Denim. (I’m still in awe of how he set out and accomplished his goal and that I was part of that story) I happened to have a road trip planned between Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal a month later during our the Winter Reading Week with my brothers, where I ultimately got to meet the Nudie Jeans team and Brandon and Bahzad from Naked &amp; Famous Denim. (Rewind a moment, I was messaging back and forth a month earlier in December 2010 with Bahzad to help me find the right size for the Naked &amp; Famous Denim x Blue in Green collab., so I was excited to send him a note when the news from the jeans experiment was released. [Quick fast forward, I empathize and tried my best to message and interact with every new and OG denimhead to the best of my ability because I knew the potential impact every single message could have on your life and denim experience.] Ultimately, I wore the NFxBiG in the inaugural superfuture Heavyweight Denim Championship, which was a two-year long fading battle, and I got to be one of the runner-ups. Still love that pair.) Brandon and Bahzad gave me a tour of the HQ and showed me all the cool denim goodies in their showroom, warehouse, and factory. I had a great time and kept in touch with Bahzad for a long time afterwards to the moment we became colleagues. Mad shout out to Bahzad for believing in me and fostering this denimhead to where I am today. 
   Fast forward a few months, and I decided to switch my degree to Business after being exposed and seeing the possibility of the business side of fashion. I made it a loose goal to work for N&amp;F when I finished my degree. That summer, I worked at one of the denim shops in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (my hometown) called Jaisel, which happened to be the first shop in Edmonton to carry N&amp;F, and I had a great time playing with the product, living out another passion of menswear, and setting people up in their journey of raw denim. Mad props to my former boss, Phil Chung, for believing in a young denimhead with his store. Fast forward to Business school and I wore my NFxBiG at every opportunity. Fast forward through a lot of incredible journeys and experiences of self-discovery and growth that happens during a post-secondary experience where I also grew out my hair and beard and became a [David Suzuki](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/10xr03/young_david_suzuki_doppelg%C3%A4nger_meets_actual/), [Steve Aoki](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6rTtfz4-R3o/UO4gNLAMZcI/AAAAAAAABGY/Z5MxlZjZqlM/s640/Josh+and+Aoki.jpg), and [Guy Fawkes](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12fi4q/v_for_vendetta_with_no_mask_his_face_is_the_guy/) doppelganger. In 2014 towards the end of my term as the VP Operations &amp; Finance for the University of Alberta Students’ Union (where I was wearing my Railcar X009 after meeting Steven Dang in his old shop of Arcadia, California and being inspired by his story and journey), I got the opportunity to take a 6-week French program called Explore, which is offered by the Canadian government to get Canadian students to study French in a French-speaking university across Canada. I chose Montreal. Before I told my family or girlfriend that I got accepted, I messaged Bahzad that I’d be in Montreal that summer and we had a back and forth where I ultimately secured an internship at N&amp;F before and after my Explore program. 
   Fast forward to my internship where I got to see and take part of the behind-the-scenes work of Naked &amp; Famous Denim. Fast forward to finishing the internship and I shared my desire to work for N&amp;F after I finishing my degree. Fast forward to the Fall semester of my last year in University where I did a Marketing (that was my major in Business and I minored in Retailing &amp; Services) capstone individual research project Marketing project with one of my profs where I did a feasibility study for N&amp;F. Fast forward to the end of the school year and the end of my long/short/fun/meaningful 7-year undergrad degree (no regrets) where I found out that Simon, my predecessor, was leaving his role at T+Y and I got offered the role I’ve been doing from July 2015 until 11 days ago on November 10. Mad thanks for the Svarcs, Bahzad, Risa, Tammy, and the N&amp;F team for letting me pursue my passion of denim. My denim story has been an incredible blessing and I couldn’t have scripted it any better. Thanks for taking the time to read it. That’s just the taste of the journey and there are so many more stories and journeys that happened in-between that made me who I am. I hope my story can inspire you in some way because so many people were instrumental in making this happen. 

I will always remain a denimhead. (Side note, I worked on my N&amp;F Okayama Spirit for the first portion of my time at T+Y, and then I wore the N&amp;F Tokushima Hand Dyed Natural Indigo Selvedge for a majority of the time at T+Y, rocked the N&amp;F Sakura Stretch Selvedge shorts during the summer months, and I’m currently working on my N&amp;F E5 Jacket [~1 year minus summer months – a 20oz jacket in the summer is death] + the N&amp;F MIJ3 for the foreseeable future. I’ll post pictures as they wear in!) My next chapter will be trying to serve and add value to the world through my next venture, and then who knows what will happen next.

Feel free to message and comment if you have any questions about my journey and if I can add value to your world in any way. :D 

Stay raw,
Josh

tl;dr Thanks.

5e4xde,2,2016-11-21,How do I [19/F] deal with the guilt that my grandmother [71/F] is trying to put me through?,ms-hoops,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5e4xde/how_do_i_19f_deal_with_the_guilt_that_my/,"Background: There’s my mom’s side of the family and my dad’s side of the family (my parents never married). I spent the majority of my life with my mom’s side of the family and lived with them. They were there for every milestone of my life so far, and I feel the closest to them. I only saw my dad’s side of the family during the summers, but the visits eventually became shorter or they stopped because I started to do my own thing (summer programs, internships, being there for the birth of my sister (mom’s side)). Now I go to university in the same city as my dad’s side of the family, but I still only see them a few times a semester.

This semester I’ve been pretty busy. I’m a mechanical engineering major who’s taking 17 credits, I’m pledging an academic fraternity, and I’m an officer of a club on campus. My schedule has been pretty tight to where I barely have time for myself, much less my dad’s family. I call my dad and grandmother a few times a month to see how they’re doing and everything, but I haven’t visited them at all this semester. I’ve noticed lately my grandmother has been acting very different around me. For example, I asked my grandmother about something during a phone call, then she proceeded to snap at me. It pretty much threw me off because she got pretty heated over a simple topic we were discussing. Near the end of the call, she mentions she feels a little left out and abandoned because I don’t call enough (really?) and I don’t visit. I explained to her my situation for this semester and my heavy schedule. I even told her in detail how I’ve been having tests at least once a week for the last month and a half. She seems to understand my situation and we just leave it at that. This was a month ago.

Yesterday she called me because she claimed she was thinking about me. We chit chat for a little bit until the topic of Thanksgiving comes up. She asks if I’m coming over for Thanksgiving, but I explained I already had something planned with my mom’s side of the family (this was planned months in advance). I do quickly mention though that I will stop by to visit her as soon as I finish my last final. She then says, “Sounds like grandma is on the lower list of priorities..”. I then quickly defend myself and mention AGAIN how swamped I am and how I can’t really put finals to the side. She mentions that maybe she’s just feeling neglected since she hasn’t been feeling so well these last few months. 

These last few months, my grandmother has been getting weaker and she always seems to be sick. It’s nothing fatal (hopefully), but hearing my grandmother get weaker has made me come to terms with her mortality. It’s really frustrating how she’s equating to how much I love her to how much I visit. I just wish she’d stop undermining how much stress I’m going through this semester. I’ll admit, I did make the poor decision of overbooking myself this semester, but constantly guilt tripping me about it doesn’t make things better. 

I also think my grandmother is holding some kind of resentment for me not being close to my dad’s side of the family. For example, it was never really an issue before when I didn’t show up for Thanksgiving (I haven’t had Thanksgiving with them in 5 years), but now she seems bitter about it. I’ve never been close to her side of the family. Most of our family gatherings involves me sitting awkwardly in a corner, since I can’t really relate to anyone. I do it to make them happy, especially my grandmother. I don’t visit for one semester and now my grandmother assumes I hate her. 

If my grandmother were to pass tomorrow, all I would want is for her to know that I love her and care about her. As of right now, she seems to think the opposite and it’s really emotionally crushing me.

5e53xx,3492,2016-11-21,"An unaired episode of The Food Network's ""Chopped!""",iia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5e53xx/an_unaired_episode_of_the_food_networks_chopped/,"I’m chef Geoffrey Zakarian’s personal espresso maker and latte-foam artist. Yes, that’s a real job. With benefits, in fact. Great health and dental.


One of the perks of my occupation, aside from hanging out with GZ and getting to eat many of my weekly meals at his outstanding restaurant, The Lamb’s Club, is the access I enjoy at The Food Network’s studios and associated properties. 


GZ is a pretty big deal over there, which I’m sure you know if you’ve watched the network for more than a few hours. Aside from Chopped!, which is his best-known show, he’s building a new audience with the Saturday morning feature, The Kitchen. His personality fits so well with whatever he’s in, though, and it’s just great to be a part of it.


I’m totally fanboying right now. Sorry. I hope that doesn’t sound disrespectful in the face of what happened.


GZ was shooting a few episodes of Chopped! with Aarón Sanchez, Marc Murphy, Alex Guarnaschelli, and Amanda Freitag. Ted Allen had just gotten there a bit late but immediately started poking fun at Aarón for a new tattoo on his hand that looked a little like a dick. (It totally did.)


I was in the backstage prep kitchen setting up Geoffrey’s personal Elektra Belle Epoque espresso machine. I’d shown him the preliminary designs for the three lattes I’d be making over the course of the day’s film schedule. Out of the 28, he chose *Spring*, by Pierre-Auguste Cot, *Seated Woman with a Red Kerchief*, by Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, and my favorite, *La Vérité sortant du puits armée de son martinet pour châtier l'humanité*, by Jean-Léon Gérôme. I’d save that one for last.


The first episode of the day went well. A Nigerian-born British chef led the way throughout, and it was no surprise that he won. After it was over and they were setting up for the next show, GZ brought me a piece of the truly-outstanding bread pudding dessert that’d clinched the win. Laphroaig scotch-soaked brioche sounds wrong, but in that chef’s capable hands, it was transcendental.


The four chefs waiting in the wings for the next episode were called onstage. Ted gave the rules in his inimitable style, and GZ, Amanda, and Alex sat at the judging table, trying not to laugh. If only the TV viewers knew how hard it was to maintain the air of seriousness the show tries to project.


Anyway, the appetizer round went pretty well. It was obvious the lady from Westport was going to get chopped, since she left out two basket ingredients while trying to make some weird fritters out of mussels and kale. Sure enough, when Ted lifted the cloche, her appetizer was under it. She didn’t even thank the judges for the opportunity to compete.


The entree round came next, after the crew cleaned the chefs’ stations. I was hard at work on *Spring*, but I kept glancing up at the monitors in the prep kitchen to see what was going on.


Right as Ted announced there were only five minutes left, I heard Ted and the judges gasp. Apparently one of the the chefs had cut himself. 


Now, anyone who’s watched Chopped! knows that chefs cut themselves all the time. It adds an extra element of suspense to the show as they have to wait for the EMT to bandage the wound and secure a glove, then they have to work through the pain and make sure not to get any blood on the food.


This cut was really bad. The problem was, the chef wouldn’t stop. Something was very, very wrong. GZ’s second latte was forgotten as I stared at the live feed from the studio monitors. All the other chefs stopped what they were doing as the EMT crew tried to attend to the chef. His name was Evan.


Evan was clearly disturbed. He shouted, “homemade sausage wins the round 87.2% of the time! Round one was close but this one will be a cut above!” He laughed hysterically and waved the knife at any approaching EMT. One of the producers came into the prep kitchen and dialed 911.


My eyes were glued to the monitor. GZ was calling to Evan and trying to talk some sense into him. He said he was a great chef and that he’d been to his restaurant before and really loved the Homard en Croûte. Evan didn’t acknowledge, so Aarón tried. He said something about being really proud of the work he’s done and it reminded him of himself when he was younger. No response, just frenzied cooking and prepping of the meat grinder.


Alex cried.


A pan Evan had been heating was smoking hot. To everyone’s dismay, he yelled “reduce by 25%,” then carved between his index and middle fingers all the way down to his wrist. Everyone except Evan screamed. Blood poured into the pan and steam erupted from the hot surface. The odor of boiling blood filled the studio. One of the prep chefs next to me puked into the sink.


Another EMT tried to grab Evan while he was busy cutting, but Evan reacted quickly and slashed the man’s shoulder. Not deep, but enough to make sure the EMT didn’t try anything again.


“Oh no,” I heard Aarón moan. Alex shrieked. The blood steam had fogged the monitor’s camera, so I couldn’t see anything. I stepped out from backstage and saw why they were so distraught. Evan’s hand was gradually disappearing into the meat grinder. 


GZ and I locked eyes and he just shook his head. I nodded. I felt bad for the guy. Horrified, but still sympathetic. 


More and more of the man’s hand disappeared into the grinder. This would’ve never worked with the terrible meat grinders they had throughout the majority of the show’s history. Those things wouldn’t grind a sheet of paper. These were new, though, and they were powerful. As we watched, Evan’s arm disappeared up to the elbow as bloody confetti poured out and filled the bowl on the table.


The fire alarm sounded. Apparently some panicking intern had pulled it thinking it’d get the authorities there faster. 


“Form into patties and braise in blood sauce with thyme, carrots, diced shallots, and fennel pollen,” Evan called out over the din of the alarm. “Add chocolate and poblanos to create a pseudo-mole sauce to ingratiate Sanchez and Freitag if they are judging. Add butter for Guarnaschelli. Add veal demi-glace for Zakarian.”


Evan’s arm had disappeared up to his shoulder. He wrenched the stump out. Pulped flesh dangled while blood spurted. His complexion was beige.


“Follow the braising with a quick sear. Plate with potatoes if Murphy is judging.” Marc was busy throwing up into a trashcan. 


The studio door burst open and four police officers entered the studio. Evan had dropped the knife and was busy making patties out of the meat that’d once been his hand and arm. “Bone fragments may be overlooked if the flavor profile is strong enough,” he yelled, and began to drop the patties into the pan of reduced blood. He then added the aromatics he’d cut up before going nuts.


A scent filled the air. I was overwhelmed by the most disturbing sensation I’d ever experienced; the smell was intoxicating and luscious. Everyone stopped shouting and crying and puking as their nostrils filled with the rich odor. A cop shot Evan with a taser, and Evan collapsed on the bloody floor. He convulsed for a moment, then stopped. The EMTs ran to him.


One of the producers turned off the burners and ordered all nonessential personnel to leave immediately. I looked at GZ and he pointed at his watch. I was six minutes late with his latte. Of course he’d be thinking about his latte at a time like this.


I went in back and began the laborious process again. *Spring* was a no-go. I wasn’t about to try to do it over, so I prepared *La Vérité sortant du puits armée de son martinet pour châtier l'humanité*. I hoped it would put GZ in a happier mood, if that was at all possible.


The $20,000 espresso machine hummed and I deftly painted the milk foam and espresso into the objet d'art we both loved. I listened as the EMTs took Evan out and the police questioned the chefs. It didn’t take long. They left right when I was about to finish. 


I came out onto the set with the latte and stopped dead in my tracks. My hands trembled and part of me knew my artwork was being destroyed, but that was the least of my concerns at that moment.


Geoffrey, Aarón, Marc, Ted, Alex, and Amanda stood around Evan’s station. They huddled in front of the pan, each holding a fork. Each of them was cutting off small portions of the terrible sausage Evan had made and eating it. Overcome with nausea, I dropped the latte. Everyone looked at me.


“Jesus Christ man,” GZ complained. “Was that the Gérôme one?”


I nodded.


His expression softened. “Sorry, I didn’t ask if you were okay. You good?”


I nodded again as he took another morsel of the sausage.


“Look, I know this looks strange and we all admit we’ll probably feel pretty bad about it tomorrow, but when else are we going to have a chance like this?”


Aarón chimed in, “C’mon buddy, give it a try.”


The other judges joined Aarón and GZ and encouraged me over. It still smelled spectacular. GZ cut me a tiny piece and I put it in my mouth. It was the best thing I’d ever tasted.


“Hey, is that camera still on,?” Alex asked around a mouthful of carrot and sausage.


“Hmm, yeah,” said Amanda, staring at the green light.


“Guess it’s one for the blooper reel,” GZ laughed. “For Chopped! After Hours.”


They all laughed and I backed away, not sure how to feel.


“Hey,” GZ interrupted, “anyone want a latte?”


Ted belched. “Fuck yeah.”


I went backstage and started to make their lattes. As I was turning the corner, Alex quipped, “yeah, that guy totally would’ve won the round. If he lives, maybe we should send him a card.” 

They all thought that was a superb [idea](http://unsettlingstories.com).

She just told me they're teaching her their credential program, promising that people who know credentials get paid a few dollars more. Their initial offer was $15 an hour before this new credentialing thing, and it sounds like it'd bump her up to $17-18/hr.

I'm in an ok place financially right now - I have $18k in federal student loans (bad), but I use YNAB to track my budget, and I have a $1000 emergency fund, $5400 (3 months living expenses) saved up so I can support myself for a bit if I don't get a job straight out of college.  I have money saved up for Christmas presents, I'm saving $40 each month for car repairs for when they're needed, and I'm really trying to reflect my true expenses (saving a little each month for non-monthly things the happen, like birthdays or Christmas or replacing clothing or electronics).

I make about $300/month working in the machine shop on-campus.  Over the summer, I had an internship and saved up $2000, to use as deferred income for school ($190/month), and my mom is kind enough to give me a $100/month allowance.  

This past month, I had an unexpected $200 medical expense, and $30 thing that I'll be reimbursed for later.  I've pulled both from my emergency fund, so I have $770 left in my emergency fund.

How long can I take to refill it?  I won't be getting a paycheck during January, since I won't be working during Winter Break, so I feel like I should leave my emergency fund alone for now, so I can focus on filling out my January budget with my December paychecks, and then refill the emergency fund starting in February once my paycheck comes through again.  Does that seem reasonable?

Thanks!"

So In 2011 I startet University, I studied Sound and Image (is basically Cinema, and Television) after 3 years I had my degree, and was ready to work. Until University started my life was pretty uneventful, basically because I had not many friends, and I usually stay home not talking with anyone.
With university things changed, I met a lot of people, made some close friends, got a girlfriend, and my lack of sleep was due to my existing social life instead of depression. 

After I finished my studies in June 2014 I though I had peaked, I had the best years of my life and now I would get a job and ride with it until my demise. And trust me I was fine with that boring life until death. Things didn't go acording to the plan and after  some weeks to relax I got the opportunity to go to Vienna, Áustria to do an intership(I'm from Portugal).So  Until February 2015 I went to Áustria to work in a Movie Production Company, and it was the most amaizing thing to happen in my life some months there completly changed me, I became super happy, I would happily wake up in the morning, I loved to ride the 'U-bahn' to work, and walk around Mariahilfer Str. after work just to be outside. It was a joy to be there, I still remember everyone that I met there, from the taback lady selling me my montly pass, to the guy that tried to sell me weed one night.

Anyway, that ended and since my german was not good it would dificult for me to stay there and work with them, so I came back to Portugal, and I thought it would be easier for me to get a job or internship now that I had experience. I was wrong. Since March 2015 I have been looking for a job in my field, 'Video Editor', 'Motion Graphics Artist', 'technician' and it is impossible. I worked one year in retail, and took some Motion Graphic Classes, but I rarely get calls to go to interviews.


Now I have no friends, I have no job, I can't find a reason to keep this up, I am so fucking tired. I feel so useless, and I start to get depressed everytime I think about trying to find a job. I can't live with my parents anymore, my father does everything to piss everyone off and sometimes I just want to punch him, and I'm getting afraid. When I was younger I though my 23 year old self would at least know what to do with his life.


I peaked, whats the point now?! "

 A week ago I applied to a job that was seeking a c++/openGL/CAD developer. It was a entry/mid level position. I got a call back and everything was going well, until they ask me what my desired salary is. I froze up and told then I wasn't sure. 

Here's a little background info on me.


I'm a student without a degree yet, I'm about half way through my CS degree. I have had no internships and no professional software jobs except one small freelance gig. I do have a lot of experience with openGL and c++, I've been learning c++ for the past 7 years and openGL for the past 3 or so years. I've completed data structures and algorithms at school, as well as an android, iOS, and java courses. I believe I am indeed qualified for the position and that given an opportunity to learn and further my knowledge, I would exceed in this position.


Skip to Friday. I get a call saying they'd like to setup a interview with me on Wednesday and I'm so so scared. I don't know what I'm worth, I don't know weither I lowball my salary to 30K or I do 40k, 50k, 60k. I'm currently making 20k before taxes.


I've been thinking that I just say something along the lines of:

I'm still not sure what I'm worth, I'm not really interested in how much this position pays as I am interested in the opportunities this position opens up for me. I currently make 20K and I would like to make something around x ( I'm leaning towards 35K here) as that would allow me to live a little more comfortably than I currently do. 

This is in Colorado springs, CO BTW, if that helps with anything. Thanks for the help guys, I'm just so confused. "
5e5sv2,1,2016-11-21,My SO (23F) of almost 3 years broke up with me (24M) at the end of last month so suddenly and unexpected to work on herself and be more independent. It's been really tough to cope with and would have been our 3 year today. [Warning Long Text],HeartAche123,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5e5sv2/my_so_23f_of_almost_3_years_broke_up_with_me_24m/,"Some background. I met her while at University. We were the same major and were taking the same classes for the most part. Some class we took had a lab and we were partnered together and it was just downhill from there. We connected quickly and one thing led to another and we started dating and eventually became a couple. During the time we were together, we were very supportive of each other and wanted what was best for the other person. We would do things for each other so selflessly. We helped with big investments like buying cars, internships and even jobs. Got through some tough times like family members dying, etc. Just really had each others back, rarely argued about anything or argued very conducively, and was there for each other when we needed to be. Of course we did a lot of things with each other, try new places to eat, mini trips, activities we both enjoyed, showed each other new things, etc.


She wanted to get a masters degree so she applied and ended up getting into our university's program. I graduated a little early and I was about to start a job about an hour and a half to two hours away. She had a little more to do but during the summer was going to intern in a nearby city (about 50 miles from where I got a job) before prepping for grad school. During the time I started working and she was still finishing school, we still messaged each other often, skyped and would try and visit each other biweekly or so and that continued in the summer. Everything was going great and we started talking about plans for the future and were both excited about that time in our lives.


She started school again in the fall. Still things were strong. She was taking a tough quarter, and  we talked about if it was too much but she was confident she could handle it and with her confidence, I believed in her and supported her. Anyways, fast forward, she was really stressing out. More than I ever seen her and I'm doing my best to try to help her and what not while being away. October rolls around and she was visiting that first weekend. She was starting to have very long, weekly homework assignments and midterms were coming up soon. We both agree that after that weekend that she should really focus on those assignments and tests coming up since I wanted her to do well. She told me that with the schedule she has in the next 3 weeks, she won't be able to visit me or I shouldn't visit her until the weekend before Halloween which I didn't mind since there were bigger things on the table for her. In those 3 weeks, we still messaged and skyped, though not as much as usual. 


She told me a couple weeks prior that she wanted to get out of the college town so she would visit me. Anyways, a little background, she would usually come on Friday nights. That weekend she was going to visit, she texts me that Friday late morning saying she can't make it that night but will be there the following day and that we should talk about things. Anyways, I was a little upset since it was a last minute notification and I made dinner reservations at a restaurant that night and she wasn't responding to anything. 


She comes to my place the following day and seemed a little nervous. So we talked and I asked her what’s up. She was hesitant at first but she told me she has been thinking and just feels she doesn’t love me anymore. She felt unhappy about the relationship and thought things were on thin ice. She told me how our future plans didn’t match up perfectly and told me that at times I was controlling, how she was upset that I rushed her about sex,, didn’t like how I said things, etc. and some other negative things that I have never heard before. Other things she did say that morning that irked her, she did tell me about earlier in the relationship and I was worked hard towards those faults I have but she said she saw no change and whatever. I tried fighting her points and said that maybe she is just really stressed and what not, and told her that we should work together as a team to get through this tough time since this is the first time things have gotten really rough. She didn’t want to work together, and said that she wanted to break up, work on herself and not depend on others for her happiness. She told me that I should work on myself too. I was upset and angry but told her that I still love her and want her to be happy so if she thinks this is best for her then I will agree to this. She acknowledged that out of her past relationships, she felt comfortable to be herself, trusted me with everything, that we had a strong connection and bond, and really felt I was her first true love. She said still cared for me a lot, that I was without a doubt her best friend, and she wanted me to still be in her life and continue as friends but not give each other false hopes we will be a couple. So I agree to that.


Fast forward to now, it’s been 3 weeks and would have been our 3 year anniversary today. It's been really tough but I have been working on myself: working out more, hanging out with friends, connecting with old friends, and kicking ass at my job even more so than I have been. We still do keep in contact, it was pretty bad the first week and a half, reaching out to each other constantly. But since then it has slowed down a lot. I’m forcing myself not to reach out to her. I still love the girl a lot and think about her constantly and hope she is doing well. I know there was no infidelity that went on or anything during those 3 weeks since she isn’t like that at all. But anyways, there are times when I think back to that morning, I still get angry, sad, and start getting anxious. I start questioning why it happened and what went wrong. There were no signs at all pointing that this would happen. I thought we were perfect for each other, eventually raise a family together and grow old with each other. It was like bomb was dropped on me. 


TL;DR: GF broke up with me to work on herself, told me to do the same, still wants to be friends and not give each other false hopes of becoming a couple. It’s been tough to cope with."

I wanted to be as detailed as I could. I want to live in Europe again but I’m having trouble forming a plan since I don’t know anyone who has done this before.
  
I majored in French in college and studied there twice, and I’m extremely anxious to go back. I want to live in Paris long-term, and I’ve been realizing that with my education and experience, it would be impossible to get a job there right now. So, I’ve been considering doing a masters program in Paris, then trying to find a job there. 

I just graduated from a large American university this past May, and have been working at my current job as a communications specialist since January (I started out as an intern until I graduated). I have a BA in French Language and a minor in Linguistics, and then I have an additional degree in Media and Information with a specialization in Media Management. 

I have been looking at continuing my education with a masters in communications, or something to do with digital marketing. 

I’m a native English speaker and am nearly fluent in French. I speak elementary Spanish and Dutch. I would like to do a program in English, but preferably in a French speaking country so I could still work on my proficiency. My second choices (if I can’t find a program in Paris) would be Germany, Ireland, or the Netherlands. I love learning languages so really anywhere in Europe would work for me as a back-up.

My worry with applying to grad school is that my grades weren’t exactly stellar, and I’m not taking the GRE until February. My cumulative GPA was about a 3.3. I also considered taking the GMAT but I’m a bit intimidated by how much studying it requires. I work 40 hrs/week and help my brother run an online business now, so I’m not sure I could fully commit to that much studying. But, many of the schools I’ve looked at accept both test scores. 

I would like advice from anyone who has done this kind of thing before. Would doing a masters in France help my chances of being hired in France? Should I continue to look for jobs in Paris or is that not realistic? Would I have a better chance of getting a job in one of the other countries I mentioned, or is it just as difficult as France? Another option would be finding an American company with offices in Paris/Europe, but I don’t even know where to begin looking for that.

Thanks for your help!

I'm currently making $65,000 a year salaried, working 40 - 50 hours a week, for a title/position that my recent online research has indicated averages around $80,000 - $90,000 a year. My direct boss has previously mentioned to me that I basically have a well-paying internship. I don't mean to toot my own horn but all of this leads me to believe that I should be asking for some kind of a raise of  fairly soon...

... Unfortunately a voluntary Q&amp;A breakfast meeting with our leadership team revealed that the hospital had recently borrowed a large sum of money (~ $1 million) from our corporate headquarters to meet operating costs. Our CEO voiced that we would not be receiving a Christmas bonus this year nor were employees to receive a raise of any kind until that borrowed money was paid back. We were told repayment could take several months or longer.

At my last performance review 5 months ago I was told I consistently demonstrate value, and my boss and I keep an updated excel spreadsheet detailing all past, current, and future projects so they know exactly how much I've done for them. My next review is coming up around Christmas. Would I be amiss by asking for a raise considering the circumstances, or would that be the wrong move?

Thanks!"

&gt; ""Come in.""

The foreboding man entreated his timid intruder. It was a young intern. Rowley had forgotten the boy's name. He stood at the door, a folder clutched in his hands. The Prime Minister waved him into the room and gestured to a chair by his desk.

&gt; ""Please, what can I do for you...ah...you'll have to remind me of your name, I do apologize.""

&gt; ""Edward, sir. Edward Minaj.""

&gt; ""Yes, Edward, that's it! Now, what can I do to help you today?""

The young man fumbled clumsily with his folder, opening it and shuffling the papers around before beginning.

&gt; ""Well sir, you had asked me to look into the logistics and cost of implement some sort of CARICOM-wide passport...""

&gt; ""Yes, a grand plan to show the world we are a united peoples of the Caribbean!""

&gt; ""Er...right. And you had also asked me to look into the same logistics of implementing something akin to a workers pass to allow travel between CARICOM nations ahead of the possible political union...""

&gt; ""Yes! Set our people working together. Bring down the barriers between countries. Let the Caribbean work together for the benefit of us all!""

&gt; ""Uh...right. Well, sir...It turns out that those both already kind of exist without us even needing to do anything.""

&gt; ""... ... ... say again?""

&gt; ""Well sir, the [CARICOM Passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARICOM_passport) already exists. We've been using it ourselves since 2007. It's really taken off among the Caribbean Community. Of full CARICOM members, only the Bahamas, Haiti, and Monserrat don't yet use it.""

&gt; ""...Oh, well then I guess it was a good idea after all. Good to know we're ahead of schedule implementing that step at least.""

&gt; ""...right. And well, as for the travel card program, turns out that [CARIPASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARIPASS) has that covered as well. And we've actually been a signatory since 2012.""

&gt; ""And the CARIPASS covers what exactly?""

&gt; ""It serves as a valid travel pass between the CARICOM member states, allowing simple and easy ""hassle-free"" travel. Allows access to automated gates at border or entrance checkpoints, holds biometric information, and generally just standardizes things at immigration checkpoints across board.""

&gt; ""Remind me who else is a part of this?""

&gt; ""Well, there us, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, St. Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.""

&gt; ""So the countries of the proposed union minus Suriname and plus Jamaica.""

&gt; ""Seems that way, sir.""

&gt; ""Excellent, something else we can already bill as being ahead of schedule. I'll contact the President of Suriname. See if we can't get the ball rolling there. Thank you Edward, this has been invaluable work.""

&gt; ""You're most welcome sir. Glad I could help.""

&gt; ""Which division are you technically working for Edward?""

&gt; ""CARICOM and Foreign Affairs""

&gt; ""Capital! Seems you're in the right place then. You've got a future here Edward, I can see it and I know good work.""

&gt; ""Thank you sir!""

Edward left the office beaming ear to ear. He just hoped the Prime Minister remembered to tell his boss that. He could use the raise and a promotion next time that consideration came around.

~~~

tl;dr Part of my plans included a shared passport and something to allow for ease of movement for workers between possible member states. Did some more research. Turns out those things already exist. Looks like I'm ahead of schedule!"

We are a publishing company with more than 50 employees but a majority of the sales team is contracted. I joined the company 5 years ago right out of college after an internship, and at the time the company was half the size that it is now. I was working as an assistant editor for three publications with an editor-in-chief and two other editors. Since then we took on another four publications (two in the last year), hiring another three assistant editors in the process. I have since been promoted to managing editor. We are owned by 2 publishers.


Besides the editor-in-chief (EIC) I am the longest tenured employee in our department, seconded to two other editors who came on board about a year after me when the company started to expand. The other two editors I worked with have left the company. Up until about a year and a half ago our team of five editors was a very well-suited group of people: We all got along very well, split work up evenly, took each other's criticisms to heart and learned from each other. We were all painfully underpaid and overworked, and as the company continued to grow we were expected to take on more work without extra pay. Naturally, people started to leave. Two of our strongest team members left and the EIC hired one person out of college, a former intern of mine (employee 1), and another employee who was referred to us (employee 2). A third editor (employee 3) joined our staff after we acquired another publication as part of the buyout. 



As the company expanded it's very clear that the EIC is not suited for as much responsibility as he has been given. He is relatively anti-social and doesn't communicate well, and his job has become doing what the publishers tell him and questioning nothing. Meanwhile, Employee 2 and Employee 3 are some of the most over privileged brats I've ever met. Employee 2 took my old position, but now does half of the work that I was expected to do and is never expected to take on more. When negotiations began EIC came to me laughing about the exorbatant salary Employee 2 was asking for, but she was hired the next week, so I have to imagine he met her somewhere in the middle. Even if he offered the employee 12K less than she was asking, it would still be significantly more than my salary.



Employee 3 still works under the belief that she is only expected to work on the publication we acquired when she was brought on, even though every other editor works across all 7 magazines. Employee 3 also got drunk at a work event and told me how much she makes, which is about 10 grand more than I do. Employee 2 and 3 know how to play the EIC like a fiddle; when the EIC comes to them with any work they will immediately say no, and because the EIC is very socially awkward he'll just come to one of the original three editors and ask or pay an outside writer to do it as opposed to managing the two of them. Employee 1 is overworked, and is getting a lot of shit from our publishers because she is picking up the slack of 2 extra people and getting work in late. Meanwhile Employee 2 and 3 come in late every day, take 2 hour lunch breaks and leave at 4:55. I have no problem with hiring freelancers, and I will never have a problem with working hard at something I'm good at, but if money is being taken out to cover their slack they shouldn't be making more than me.



Myself and the two other editors in this company have gone to our EIC three times in the last year to discuss this and nothing has changed. I originally went to my EIC and told him I couldn't keep living paycheck to paycheck and said I needed a raise totaling *this* much and was denied. I told the EIC I knew how much the employees made and the publishers just denied that and tried to tell me asking about salaries was illegal (which I know is a lie). I, meanwhile, have been trying desperately to get a new job but just can't get a nibble, so they know I'm stuck here. Our HR rep is just that by certification, he is actually the accountant and he's a terrifying person to be in a room with. And the EIC has been instructed to not allow any of us to speak with the publishers at any time. One of the publishers admitted to a former employee that he intentionally speed walks through the office so no one will try to stop and speak with him. At this point the three of us feel truly, truly trapped where we are. We thought about going to a lawyer but the most respected ones in our area wouldn't want to help us since they can win awards through our magazines, and none of us have any money. 



So what can we do? My one editor is suggesting storming the publishers office and demanding they work with us, but knowing the personalities of these people it would not end well. Can we write a formal complaint or something that would need to be addressed in a more professional, controlled setting? "

I have no clue where else to look at, so I wanted to see if anyone had any advice about what to do when no college seems right for them, or if anyone has any suggestions of schools I should apply to that I may have overlooked.

My stats:
-3.7 weighted GPA and 32 ACT... school doesn't do class ranks (4 AP classes and 5 honors classes throughout HS)

- To put my grades in perspective, I attend a competitive public high school (25th in NJ, 404 in nation according to USnews)

-I have fairly good extra curricular's... (President of 2 clubs, played 7 seasons of sports, involved in theater, internship for political organization, a few more)

Criteria: 

-Preferably within 7 driving hours of NYC, but not required

-Over 2,000 students

-I'm looking for a school with a cool scene. I've suffered through  years of a preppy town, and that's not the environment I'm looking for... I'd like to be by a city, but am willing to hear suggestions of schools that aren't

- I really really liked McGill University but I hate the winter and the brutal winters in Canada seem hard to compromise on... so if anyone knows schools with a similar vibe to McGill but are in a warmer area?

-I've applied to Northeastern, Fordham, Penn State, Rutgers, McGill, Lafayette, Tufts, Lehigh, BC... I liked BC and Tufts but am doubtful I'd get in

Is this just all a matter of me being too picky? Any advice would help. I don't mean this to be some annoying post, I'm genuinely am feeling extremely unsure of everything and want to see if anyone has any suggestions. Thanks so much!

Schools I've visited and didn't like: Richmond, Bucknell, Villanova, Gettysburg, George Washington, BU"

While obviously the policy will differ between organisations, if an intern is (hopefully) offered a full-time position do they generally have the latitude to move to other divisions of a company, or is the offer usually with the same team? The divisions would be in the US and this assumes acquiring a visa is possible. The salary disparity between the US and Canada is the primary reason behind this.

5e71pd,6,2016-11-21,Destination: Auburn,levilarrington,DestinationWa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinationWa/comments/5e71pd/destination_auburn/,"Slayer made an album called South of Heaven. Washington incorporated a city called South of Kent.

But most of you know it as Auburn.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzae_SqbmDE

Auburn can be reached by highway 18, which once boasted the title of most dangerous highway in the United States. That means those that lived made it to Auburn and developed a city. Like Mad Max.

And look no further than the burn pit at the Fireworks stand for the Thunderdome. Every year around The Fourth of July, people from all over the Puget Sound visit the Muckleshoot reservation to buy fireworks. I am told this is 70% of the Auburn economy. The other 30% comes from the trauma unit at the hospital.

In most Washington cities, fireworks are illegal. Or, rather, the caliber of fireworks found at Muckleshoot are illegal. For 20 dollars, you can purchase the amount of gun powder used throughout the entire Civil War all wrapped up in a cardboard burrito and ready to blow your hand or hands off.

From Whistling Petes to tennis balls full of gun powder, you are given a dirt lot to light off just about anything and just go nuts. Typically, ""just go nuts"" and tons of explosives are frowned upon in societies outside the Middle East. But in Auburn, it's encouraged. Fingers, limbs, and heads are blown off every year in order to elect a mayor last-man-standing style.

But The Fourth of July is only once a year, so you'll need to go beyond Beyond Thunderdome for the equivalent outside of July: gambling.

If you think losing your thumb and nose to a mortar rocket is painful, try losing your life savings to a slot machine based on a television show. Muckleshoot casino can offer you this. Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune, Star Wars - they all have slot machines aimed to make you think gambling is entertainment. And let me tell you something: if you win 300 dollars, then lose 400, then win 100, then lose 1000, then win 100 you are being entertained: through math.

Speaking of entertainment, Auburn is also home to Green River Community College: Home of the Whopper. You can get an AA, one menu item, and a soft drink for a student loan you'll have well into your AARP days. Keep telling yourself ""I'm transferring to the U next quarter"" as you take bong hits out of the potato gun you made last semester in Modern Art 101. Check out their Running Start program where you pay 500 dollars a quarter to intern at Taco Bell.

If you're like me, you like to kick back and watch a concert - what better venue than The White River Amphitheater. White River is becoming the go-to for top acts from music to comedy. You would think this would generate city sized crowds and you'd be right. You'd also think they'd have more than a one way dirt road in and out of the amphitheater - they don't. Let me tell you something: if you're going to see a concert at White River, you're essentially camping. Now you may choose to camp outside the theater in someone's yard or you can camp for seven hours in traffic on the road leading to Highway 18, either way you're camping.
But let's talk about lifestyles - what can Auburn offer you? Well, your cousin for starters. Do you want seconds? Auburn has a Waltons in Compton way of life that is rivaled by no other. Let's say you want to join a street gang, but you still love country music - Auburn has you covered. And boy do they: at any time in Auburn there's a 90% chance there is a gun drawn on you. This could be a gangbanger, survivalist, cop, hunter, teacher, doctor, priest, or an anti-gun protester driven to the final edge.

In addition to wild west shootings, Auburn has an array of local fast food joints. These aren't just your everyday McDonalds or Burger Kings, these are independent burger joints that serve a great meal at a reasonable price. Just don't expect fancy city things like licenses or food handling permits.

Auburn is also the home of Washington National golf course, which is home to the UW men's and women's golf teams. So, you can see how that college thing comes full circle.

All in all, you couldn't find a better city to find yourself out of a job, divorced, and wiping with a flannel shirt in an Applebee's bathroom at 1 AM because they're out of toilet paper again."

I could really use some advice. I think a timeline might be the best way to give some background:

* **Prior to Fall 2014** - Computer Engineering Major. high GPA. 1 co-op and an internship. Some issues with anxiety, but it hadn't had too much of an impact on my life

* **Fall 2014 semester** - I was doing well until November, then I started to have problems with depression/anxiety. I fail 1 class, but do well in the rest

* **Spring 2015 semester** - major depression/anxiety problems. I get some help from the university counseling center and increase my existing prescription. I withdraw from my classes except for 1 class and my senior capstone project (2nd half of year long project)

* **Summer 2015** - I stayed with my parents, occasionally helping with a seasonal rental business and not really doing anything else

* **Fall 2015 semester** - I went back to school, then withdrew after several weeks and went back to live with my parents. I had no job during this period.

* **Spring 2016 semester** - I went back to school and I pass all but 1 gen.ed. class. I went to a big university-sponsored job fair, but I panicked and didn't talk to anyone.
 
* **April 2016 to now** - Live with my parents, completed my last class online, and applied to a few dozen jobs. Bombed my only phone interview.

That brings us to today. I've been doing some job searching, but anxiety has made it difficult. I think that it's getting easier, but some days just checking LinkedIn or similar sites makes my heart race. Cover letters can take hours because I can hardly think of what to say when I feel anxious. My only phone interview opened with the questions ""Why haven't you started working yet"" and ""Why didn't you have an internship last summer?"", which gave me such anxiety that I could hardly answer those questions or any of the questions that followed. 

So, I've come to ask for advice .

1. How do you deal with job searching anxiety? I've read some tips, but sometimes it still seems so difficult to even search for a job.

2. How do I talk about my recent history? Should I tell potential employers that I had to take a medical leave? Should I try to address this in my cover letter so that they don't ask these extremely difficult questions?

Thank you in advance."

BUT as of now, I only know Java and learning Javascript at the moment.

I found an application for web development internship and I could create some web stuff with javascript, but I need to hurry up! What do you guys think?? Thanks a lot appreciate the help!

Should I apply by showing school projects? Also, I am learning javscript by creating a To-Do list through watchandcode.com. Could I show that to-do list in my portfolio? Thanks!!

Basically, I have just finished a year long internship which was not as constructive as I had hoped.

I don't need someone to hold my hand all the time, but I do need a team which will provide me with honest, critical feedback about my work and allow me the opportunity to learn new technologies and improve my abilities.

I just have not been able to land any internships due to the competition and my GPA not being high enough. I do have internships in other areas, but just not finance related or in financial institutions. I will be commencing my last semester next year, and I will be looking for a full-time position. 

I have decided that I would like to get into roles in risk (preferably credit, but operational is fine as well) or compliance (arguably BO). Is it still possible without any prior experience in similar roles or in a banking environment? Another option I would consider would be to take up a ops role first before going trying to move into risk or compliance - how feasible is this realistically? Would taking up an internship after graduation in risk/compliance be better in the long run?  

Came across the linkedin profiles of some friends in university, and I realised that I am way way behind them in terms of internships. Some of them already have 2-4 finance related internships while I have none. In addition some of them have already completed their CFA1. This serves as a huge slap across the face for me - What can I do to catch up and make myself more attractive to prospective employers despite my obvious lack of experience (and GPA)?

Will asking a friend (who works there) to refer me now change the outcome?,csinterntw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5e7z6o/submitted_application_online_for_a_software/,"I am a math PhD student. I interviewed with Google a couple of years ago for a PhD internship and got rejected (I thought I did well). I applied again this year by submitting my resume online. However, I got an email from a recruiter saying they decided not to proceed with my application.

My research is purely theoretical, hence I don't have a lot of programming projects on my resume. Since I interviewed with Google a couple years ago, I did only one big programming project (which I included on my resume). I believe this might have been a reason for the rejection.

However, I have a few friends who work at Google. I wonder if I would have got an interview if I had one of them refer me. I was sure I would get an interview by just submitting my resume online since that's how I got my interview last time, and I didn't want to bother my friends. In hindsight, that sounds stupid. So, I am wondering if I should ask one of my friends to refer me now and whether that would lead to a different outcome. I initially wanted to just move on, but now I am just wondering what's the worst that can happen (I just get rejected again)?

I'll be moving to Toronto for a 4 month internship starting in January. I've been looking at furnished 1+ bedroom apartments/condos downtown near the financial district and wanted to know what price range is reasonable for the area. 

Most of the places I've been quoted for so far are around $3000/month which seems steep but maybe what I'm looking for isn't available at a lower price?

5e8jij,1,2016-11-21,Network Domain Questions,twkemp,servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/servers/comments/5e8jij/network_domain_questions/,"So a little pre-text here. I'm a programmer. I've been designing and building apps for 4-5 years, but due to the econmony in my province, works been tough. I've done general IT and low end networks as well.

I was offered a short internship repairing computers, and managing a small network, via Server 2012 R2, mainly for office workers. 

However, the company has a group of about 50 public access machines throughout the city. Anyone can come in, use the machine without login, and access the web or use MS Office. Currently they use TeamViewer to access each on individually, login to the admin account, update policy through Client GPO, push updates, so on. 

They want to get these onto a domain server so they can just push policy / updates once a week type thing. 

Now this is literally my first day, so I'm going off what little I know at the moment. 

* -Non for prof. Running mostly refurb devices / hardware but tons of free licensing on software. 
* -Server 2012 R2 currently used for local network and active directory. Server is Xenon 6 core, 32gb ram currently.
* -Windows 7 machine used as a firewall (what i was told) as the switch they employ is older 10/100 with no firewall (I'd like to replace this with a up to date option, like a Cisco option (They have a couple lying about). 
* -ISP is cable, 25mbps/3mbps. (Can be jumped to 150mbps/15mbps. 
I personally feel this won't be able to handle the policy push effectively, but not sure. )
* -End machines will be Dell Opterix dual core i3s, 4gb ram, Win 10 pro. 
* -End machine can be on a completely random network. Could be one of 3 ISPs, behind any random router. Being public access they are normally in City buildings, Retirement centres, health centres, job centres. 
* -VPN Router / Virtualized VPN on a switch not an option due to budget restrictions, so each end machine has have vpn setup on it. 

Now this is where I need help. This is my train of thought, and I could be wrong and would love input:

* -Virtualize a new server (They would like to keep their local one separated)
* -Server needs static IP, domain routing in place (xxx.business.com ), server remote access installed, network policy / access services, update services.

* -end machine will need to be preconfigured with domain access, vpn information, named properly for for conventions and easier tracking / trouble-shooting. 

While I understand a full on certified Network Admin would probably be the best option, as a non-for-prof I'm confident its outside the budget. I'm fairly technical, and have started playing with a vm I've setup on my iMac via VirtualBox, but would appreciate any questions or feedback you'd have, any guides or direction or opinions. "

We were all pretty good friends and decided to live together and it has gone smoothly overall. I've always had a problem with our house being pretty poorly taken care of, but haven't really made a big deal over it until recently. People just don't do dishes and leave messes everywhere, the usual stuff. I have asthma and they smoke and vape in the house, or at least some of them do, and their friends who stop by do as well. I have had to put my foot down on smoking blunts in the house and they stopped and actually said ""If you want us to stop smoking in the house completely, just say the word, we don't want you to feel uncomfortable in the house."" I said I'm fine with that because at that time it really didn't feel like it was bothering my asthma that much.

I was gone this whole summer for an internship, and when I came back I realized how sick being in that house makes me. It also might be them smoking more than usual. It directly affects my asthma and I can feel it flaring up all the time. I also noticed that the house is generally more dirty than before I left. I tried to set an example and do my share of cleaning but it didn't do much. One morning I woke up and while getting ready for work I noticed smoke/vapor coming through the vents and into my personal room. I walked out into the living room and my roommate and his friend were vaping and the living room was densely packed with smoke -- I could hardly see across the room. On top of this the house was filthy from the night before. It was a struggle to make food because there was so much shit in the way.

I figured that I had no reason to be upset because I hadn't explicitly said I had a problem with any of this, but figured it was time to. So I basically sent what I thought was a very mature and respectful (but still assertive) message to our group chat for the house. I basically said that the level of smoking in the house is to the point that it is making me feel genuinely sick because of my asthma, and if they could at least tone it down I would really appreciate it. I also mentioned in the message that we should take care of the house better. I said that I know I'm not the perfect roommate either, but that our house is disgusting compared to even other college houses. 

No one responded. When I got off work I ended up meeting with one of my roommates who I'm better friends with than the rest of them. He told me that everyone seemed to take issue with my message. Basically they all talked shit on me behind my back after I sent it. I felt really disrespected and just went home and went to bed. I stayed mostly in my room and didn't really talk to anyone when I did go upstairs. They definitely knew that I was pissed about how they reacted to it and no one said anything. One of the more petty roommates definitely enjoyed me being upset about it, making little comments as I passed through the living room. 

They also bought a new bong and seem to be smoking just as much as before, and I still feel sick. They did start taking better care of the house for a little bit, probably because our landlord happened to stop by a few days after I sent the message and proceeded to threaten to evict us. 

I just don't know how to handle this. They are genuinely my friends, probably except for the one guy. It's weird to be at odds with everyone in the house and I've mostly gone back to hanging out with them, but I still feel pretty disrespected and pretty angry. I want to handle this maturely but I don't know how. I thought I did go about it the mature way, so I don't know."

I have recently completed my IT degree (majored in networking), but need to carry out a 6 month work placement in order to complete my diploma and graduate. I have had a few friends apply for Internships last year and a lot of them seem to have been a bit disappointed in what they did at the business/organisation. I take it that many of the businesses that took them on, placed them where they were short in numbers and pigeon holed them. Many friends were placed in consulting/sales roles, when they had completed Programming and Networking majors.

I understand this from a business point of view, and it completely makes sense. For me, I would like to purely focus on IT, which has led me to a fork in the road where I can start to apply for Helpdesk positions and hopefully try to work my way in with their networking team and get some proper IT experience. Or I can apply for an Internship at a business and possibly have to put up with 6-9 months of things I don't really wan't to do, just to have a nice CV with a good business on it. Am I being too ignorant about the Internship thing? It just seems like most businesses take advantage of free employees and have a different agenda set for Interns?
Thanks in advance for your help/replies :)

TL;DR Should I apply for a helpdesk and get some real IT experience, or possibly get pigeon holed in a non-IT sector with an Internship?"
5e92hf,20,2016-11-22,Dungeon Diagnosis - Puppet Master's Encore!,Iwantdevil,RotMG,https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/5e92hf/dungeon_diagnosis_puppet_masters_encore/,"Hope you got a ticket for this show! It's time to witness the Puppet Master's Encore! The 2nd (and LONG awaited) boss dungeon, it's available by defeating Janus &amp; getting it randomly selected by Craig, Intern of the Mad God. This dungeon features a large square room, with a reskinned Puppet Master in the center. He'll spawn 4 puppets in a square pattern around him, a few tiles away from him, then assault the players with a barrage of Pet Stasis shots &amp; blue damaging shots. After taking a set amount of damage, his Huntress Puppet will animate, complete with its own version of Coral Bow &amp; Doom Bow! The Huntress Puppet uses its Coral Bow first, then switches to its Doom Bow after taking enough damage.

The next puppet activated is the Trickster Puppet, which summons a group of clones to distract &amp; shield it. All Trickster Puppets will fire shots at you. Once it takes enough damage, it becomes MUCH more deadly &amp; starts spamming many more shots. Once that's down, the Puppet Master fires a wide, but slow moving, arcs of shots. Once he takes enough damage, the final 2 puppets awaken. The dreaded Puppet of Chaos &amp; Puppet of Pain.

The Puppet of Chaos is the most fearsome puppet of them all, launching Confuse shots &amp; powerful damaging shots. DO NOT sit on it, it will very likely insta-kill you! This puppet can be stunned &amp; slowed. The Puppet of Pain launches powerful Bleeding shots. This puppet can be paralyzed. Once those puppets are done away with, continue attacking the Puppet Master until it's curtains for him!

As far as loot goes, he can drop 3 different pots! Att, Def &amp; Mana! He also drops a potent new consumable, the Wooden Box. It summons a jack-in-the-box decoy that lasts for a few seconds. The decoy can lure enemies away from you, making it very useful for escaping danger, or for sneak attacks! He also drops the Jaco Pet skin, which turns your pet into a Spooky clown! Like all pet skins so far, it has 5,000 Feed. The Puppet Master can drop incs &amp; 2 powerful new UTs, the Prism of Dire Instability &amp; the LONG awaited Thousand Shot Bow!

The Prism of Dire Instability is a UT Prism that costs 80 MP to use &amp; leaves behind a decoy where you were. You DO NOT teleport with this Prism. The decoy explodes after a few seconds &amp; releases 12 energy blasts that have a range of 4.2 &amp; deal 200-320 damage each. The Prism has a 6% Fame bonus &amp; 900 feed. This is what the Ghostly Prism SHOULD have been like, leaving behind an exploding decoy that distracts enemies. On equip, the Prisms gives +2 Att, +2 Wis &amp; 40 MP. The stat bonuses aren't as generous as the Dancing Sword Prism's are, but still nice to have regardless. It's up to personal preference whether to use this or the Dancing Swords Prism for combat. Both are quite nice to have &amp; have their pros &amp; cons.

The Thousand Shot bow is a UT crossbow that fires a single piercing arrow that deals 40-130 damage. It has a 200% rate of fire, a range of 7.6, a 6% Fame bonus &amp; 900 Feed. On equip, it has -5 Spd &amp; +30 MP. It has the fastest fire rate of any weapon, as well as the longest true range of all bows! As far as DPS goes, the real question is, how does it compare to the Coral Bow?

As of now, the DPS calculator on Pfiffel's site hasn't been updated, but I was able to modify the Thousand Shot bow there to reflect its new stats. At roughly 20 def &amp; less, the Coral Bow has higher theoretical DPS. The obvious caveat is, you must land both arrows to have said DPS. This is where the Thousand Shot shines. Having to aim only a single arrow means you can use this bow to its fullest range without any loss to DPS! If you can get a Thousand Shot bow, definitely replace the Coral Bow with it! The Speed penalty can be mitigated almost completely with either Coral Silk Armor or Spectral Cloth Armor, &amp; the +30 MP bonus gives a little extra use out of your Quiver or Trap.

Grade: B. This is a definite improvement over the Lair of Shaitan. With a bigger room to fight in, as well as much more plentiful loot, this is one encore that delivers an impressive performance!"

Right, so with a mild feud going on between me and the ladies of floor 1 and Joe Donothing having made a sabotage attempt on my internship, it's understandable that I'm kinda stressed about things. My stomach fucks me up each day from that day on from pure stress.

One day, the toilet on our floor starts to leak a little. This shouldn't be a problem if not for the floor feud... You see, my dear readers, the ladies on floor 1 still hate my guts for leaving them wifi-less for at least 3 weeks. And guess what's on floor 1...

We put a call in their desk about the leaking toilet... One week passes... Two weeks pass... I walk down and ask and they tell me 
&gt; ""Just have patience, the intern will do it."" 

with a cutesy pukesy fucking smile. They're most definitely doing it on purpose. 

So I decide to solve the issue myself...

I start eating unhealthy shit for weeks, fucking my system up even more than it already was and primarily use their toilet. I won't say more or give any details, I think it's pretty clear what the result was. Within a couple of DAYS of this... Our floor's toilet was fixed. I went by one morning and said 
&gt; ""Can you say thanks to the intern for fixing the toilet?"" 

with a cutesy pukesy fucking smile... 

Give or take a couple of days and I start getting an odd amount of requests from that department. Mouses broken or missing, screens flickering, all that... Very odd shit that was fixed every time I got there, but they did have a little talk with me every time I was there. Asked me if I wanted to have a cup of coffee and stuff, asking me what IT was like, all that.

I think the biohazard I left in their toilet stall those days might've fucked up their brains...

You'd think that this is the end of the war of the floors, but it's only just beginning...

Stay tuned for Part III"

I'm in need of some advice, and would also just like to discuss this somewhere because it's bothering me.

I like programming and I'm currently in my 3rd year doing my internship. The first year of programming was great, it was all new and I learned alot. The teachers I had where interested and tried to help by discussibg with you.

The second year I feel like I learned nothing at all. The teachers made you figure out everything yourself, and I feel like I got lost alot because the material was progressing fast.

I notice that I have a strong urge to come up with clean and optimal solutions, but I have trouble finding different solutions and implementing them. i want to know how it works instead of just ""using"" it. If I don't, I lack the view of the total picture.

In my internship I feel like everyone is very competitive and wanting to be the smartest while I just really want to learn.
I'm really wondering if I'm cut out to be a coder since the competitiveness stresses me out, and I feel like I'm picking stuff up slower than others.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? And does anyone have advice on how to learn/implement things faster?"

-The coaching staff : ""Something late game"" + Cyanide back to Berlin + Deilor talking about Fnc () &gt; For me, Fnc is looking after a psychologue, but they already have their staff. Deilor as ""general coach"" as Quaye is, plus on the intern life, and Cyanide as coach for the players with Nico. 

-The 10 man roaster: 

*Top : ""Something something late laaaaateee game"". Could it be Soaz? He left Og few times before, and is free agent. If they want to build a team destinated to stay together he can be great as an experienced player. I'll see Wunder as a substitute, cause i don't see Odoamne or Cabo both leaving their structure. 

*Jng : Most difficulte to predict. I guess we all want to see RO back. He's one of the - if not- the best, and we miss him, we all feel it was a big mistake not keeping him at all cost last year. But be realistic, the structure, fnc, puts a lot in CSGO and not that much in the League team, then... Jankos would be the best solution but i don't see him leaving, and then... In my point of view there is no one that could be on a world level. Trashy as sub maybe, but we need a stronger jungler for our main team. 

*Mid : I think we are gonna keep Fabjiante and it's a good thing. He will be the best again, just give him trust. I don't see ""good sub"" except from maybe Sencuxx, but will he come to play as a sub? I don't think so, he wants to play and in Fnatic, Febiven is the favourite. 

*Adc : Rekkles, nothing else to say. I trust him and i think we all do. As a sub i see nobody else than a young player unknown, which will improve. Or maybe Hjarnan coming back? 

*Support : Lots of speculations. I think personnaly Kasing won't join cause he did his bootcamp with Vit, i don't see him leaving anymore. Jesiz seems to be the one, with or without RO, he has experience and he is still young. If not, Hybrid will be. I'm not really fan since he won with g2 but did nothing with Og (Ok, he had no adc, that count). Klaj will stay sub. 

With all of that, i think we can built a good team. Lcs level, no worries. But, from my point of view, only LCS level (&gt;NA,EU,BR,KR,LMS level) but still a chance to tilt vs LPL and no chance to win vs LCK teams. 

Quaye said to one guy that ""Og had complete at the highest level in 2015"" and ""H2k had complete with almost a full euw roaster"". I disagree : In 2k15, Og were good because they were facing fnc, all days, practicing together. Plus, they had some chance going into worlds (FW in quarters...). But they get destroyed, litteraly, by Skt in semis. Fnatic gave up vs The tigers but they could have win tho, they just tilt hard, but at that moment they had the roaster () to be champions (Even skt and former Koo said it). And for H2k in s6, they were good, ok, but still having luck beeing versus AlbN. And get destroyed in semis. So the question is, do we want to play at the highest level and try, like in s5, to win worlds, or do we just ""give up"" and still wanna just hit the top 4? Ok, u'd tell me it's a great thing, and i agree. But as a fan, i wan't the best for my team. And i think bext days, months gon'be hard, or at least ain't gonna be easy for all of us. Until fnc might decide to put more money to the lol team. 

Btw, even saying that, i'm still confident on Nico and Quaye. I'm still waiting for the announce, and open to discussion for everyone.

5eazjl,0,2016-11-22,What should I spend my last summer of undergrad doing before applying for law schools next fall to maximize my chances of getting into law school for intellectual property?,claireballoon,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5eazjl/what_should_i_spend_my_last_summer_of_undergrad/,"Edit: Reposted to the 0L thread because it's more appropriate, but I'm leaving this here just in case for visibility. 

Hi, thanks for your help. Maybe this is a bad mentality to have, but because of the oversaturation of the law field, my background, and interests I have an ""really strong IP program or bust"" mentality towards going to law school. As in, if I don't get into a top IP program (or a strong school in a good city for IP), I'll just get a job in engineering instead of investing in law. 

When I graduate, I will have a B.A. in Graphic Design, a B.S. in Computer Science, a minor in math, and a minor in Mandarin Chinese. Currently, I've had 5 jobs in college. My freshman year I was the graphic designer for a clothing line start-up. After I worked in IT on campus 10 hrs/week and was a TA for 3-4 sections of intro computer science courses in my undergrad department for 10 hrs/week. Last summer I had an internship at a software development company and while it was a good opportunity, I didn't like the company and don't want to return. This semester, I'm doing a Co-op (40 hrs/week, getting technical elective credit, taking online general ed classes) for a major car manufacturer. It is more like logistics engineering than computer science, but I love it. I'm applying to return next summer but I'm not sure if that's in my best interest for law. I mostly took the Co-op because the company is so successful and the co-op program is so selective and respected. 

In case this affects your suggestions, this is my current situation: Currently I have a 3.84 GPA (looking at you, calculus... ugh) and my practice LSAT a month or so ago was a 165. Stanford would be the dream law school for location and prestige but I'm obviously considering all options. I realize I'm not quite good enough right now, hopefully I can make drastic LSAT improvements next semester. I've signed a contract to do graphic design work for a start-up company, but my participation has been limited because we're still changing the prototype's design (and I want my branding to reflect hte product) and won't really be worth putting on a resume until several months down the road, if that. However, it's been really inspiring and I'm also interested in JD/MBA programs.

Based on that, do you think I should continue with this co-op program or try to find some sort of job at a firm (or something like that)? Should I spend the summer taking law, econ, poli sci, etc. courses since I have taken none of those in undergrad? I have an appointment with a career advisor the first week of December (soonest available) but because some locations want applications in as soon as... now, so I figured I might as well start seeking advice. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it!

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention something that is worth considering. Next fall, I'm supposed to begin work on my undergraduate research thesis for my university's honors college. They have excellent financial resources for research proposals. I could potentially come up with something to distinguish myself for and do research this summer for it. However, I'm kind of at a loss for what to do for research (I get overwhelmed with too many ideas/possibilities) and largely what my career advising appointment is for. Maybe I could get in contact with a firm and try to establish a connection with them by doing research guided by them, if anyone has any experience with this?

Also, in the event this is worth mentioning, I'm on my 8th consecutive year of Mock Trial... this extracurricular has made me hate being involved with law culture, if the kind of people who participate in this activity are any indication of the kind of people who become lawyers (which I believe it is). The egos and competition can be insufferable, but it's a little bit less so among the patent lawyers I've spoken with... probably because they come from technical backgrounds, which has an entirely different culture. I definitely don't want to be in the courtroom any more than I absolutely have to (although I'm good at it) because I think the stress and pressure would truly wear me out long-term.

**EDIT 2:** While looking up some firms I'm seeing a lot of top-tier patent attorneys with masters and doctorate degrees in their technical fields. Gosh, I hadn't even though of doing that... if any of you have opinions. 

Thank you again for reading all of this, you have no idea how much I appreciate it."

----

This gorgeous set is Basteti's first set in at least 3 DECADES! The announcement came just MOMENTS ago, and EVERY great name in the fashion industry is simply BUZZING about it! ALL of our metaversal social electronic medias are simply ENGORGED with the buzz about this BIG NEWS!

For those of you who may be, Ugh, HORRIDLY ignorant to the happenings of DIRE IMPORTANCE in the artistic clothing Elites circles, MADAME BASTETI Is by FAR one of THE most respected names to ever grace a piece of fabric. Her GROUND-SHAKING designs have a long history of REVOLUTIONIZING the way we see and use clothing. Lets never forget her A'DUBToia line, which focused on the FAN-TASTIC use of negetive space for LESS clothing in cold environmental fashion, or her P'Pooustu set, which focused EXCLUSIVELY on the use of the recently deceased in both MODEL positions in the fashion world, and as REVOLUTIONARY materials and pieces for her CLOTHING ITSELF. SUCH PASSIONATE, and DARING work is ex-trEMELY rare to find. 

Madame Basteti ALWAYS makes waves when she releases new works. Saddly, the WONDEROUS figurehead GENIUS FASHION MIND of the Madame has been quite unfortunately un-inspired in recent history! The work of a prodigy can't be rushed however! Though, her absence has left a heavy sadness weighing like a blanket over the entire industry in the previous decades since her early temporary retirement from designing. 

WHICH IS WHY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEWS IN MODERN FASHION HISTORY FOLKS!

----

Her new Lineup, which she has simply named ""[L'ensemble un peu décent ZAVORA](http://imgur.com/a/dVuFP)"" (Her longest title of a fashion line TO DATE!), is described in the Madames own words to be: ""

OH THAT MADAME, such a true, TRUE, **GENIUS** of the art world. EASILY one of the best and most influential art minds in ALL of history in the OMNIVERSE Tri-DIMENSION Areas!

We also had a moment to catch up with her newly proclaimed ""Model and Perfect Muse"", Roonic Zambora who- *Huh, whatsa?* OH, My appologize, rather it's, RINNIK, - ZAVORA. The Model/Muse that is.

In Such a SHORT amount of time, the virtually culturally invisible homeless man went from a COMPLETE unknown, to being THE most demanded model in the Omniverse! Rinnik had this to say on the matter:

I love hiking and I really want to go on a thru hike or at least go for a few days. However how do I find the time to do so? I would love to go for about a month or so, only problem is that I am a college student, and during the summer is when I work(I am a caddie). So the summer is a huge time for me to be working and make my money to pay for college. Sp finding time is very difficult. Also, I know that I could wait until after college, but that won't really work either. I most likely will be fining a job in my field right after college/last semester since my school sets me up with an internship that can possibly turn into a job, then once I have the job I can't just take off for a whole month. So I am at a loss and it is very upsetting. 

If anyone has any tips or ideas on what I could do from recent experience that would be great to share! Thanks! "
5ebx15,9,2016-11-22,Confessions of the unaware Cub,PassiveCub,CougarsAndCubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/5ebx15/confessions_of_the_unaware_cub/,"Hello recently discovered this subreddit and wanted to share my own experience I had from 17-22 in 3 different relationships with women all over 35. These were the only women I had any real relationship until I met my wife who is only 2 years older than me. I never really discussed this lifestyle with anyone but my wife so thought I would share

Honestly I did not even know the term cougar/cub until after I had graduated college and gotten married….it was not something I really researched until  I saw commercials for the show Cougar Town. I never realized I was a “cub” and will probably always be one at heart ;).

Some background when I was 10 I moved to a small town after my parents split up. I also developed a terrible case of cystic acne during puberty and did not get it cleared up until I turned 16 via Accutane. Needless to say I did not get much attention from girls my own age. To add salt to the wound my dad remarried and his new wife decided I needed to be homeschooled because the public school was too secular, I was too rebellious and most horribly of all because “Sex Education”(Oh the irony). Suffice to say I had some self-esteem issues but once the acne cleared up I was not unattractive.  I had a hard time looking people in the eye when speaking to them or being spoken too because I was ridiculed quite a bit before Accutane. 

My first was with an assistant store manager at the grocery store I was working part-time. We lived in a very small town that was about 2 hours from the nearest Walmart or Mall. She had been transferred up to our store to fill in for our manager who was out on maternity leave. By the time I was 17 I worked the evening shift with her and the last 3-4 hours was just me and her. She would handle the head clerk duties and do the closing routine while I cleaned and restocked items. My birthday is in Dec and I had only recently turned 17 but that night was snowing pretty hard and she offered to give me a ride home. When I got in the car she gently grabbed my knee and it shocked me so I looked up at her. At this moment she told me I should look people in the eye more often because I have beautiful eyes. I am not sure how it happened or if she even meant for it to happen but we started making out; she was taller than me (6’3 vs 5’10) so I do remember her pulling me closer to engage though. Things stopped after about 2 mins and she awkwardly just started her car and began to drive me home…I was full of fear at this point and thought I was going to get fired…thankfully it is a small town and the drive did not last long. She drove to her place instead and I silently followed her in. She was a great influence on me and helped me become confident in many things not just the physical. Because of her I actually decided to go to college and that was when we said goodbye but kept in touch. She eventually moved away and did finally get her own store, I came to visit her there but purely platonic as she was engaged by this point.

The second woman I had the pleasure of being with was during one of my summer internships (sophomore year). She was a senior at the firm and was part of doing the introductory audit training for new hires. One night while walking back to my hotel with my dinner to go we met on the sidewalk. She was surprised I was not out bar hopping with the other interns (only 20 at this point). She asked if I would like to join her for dinner since we were both alone. Again I was willfully ignorant of what would happen next…but for me I guess that was always half the fun . Once up there she propositioned me and made sure to set ground rules for how things were to proceed if we both wanted to after. She had some very odd requests of me but I learned to enjoy fulfilling them for her. She actually altered my first intern assignment so I would work on an audit with her. This relationship tapered off once school started back up (one or two weekend rendezvous) but ultimately it was built around her schedule and that became difficult when she was traveling so we mutually ended it. 

The final and third woman was a single mom who had transferred in my Jr. year of college. We ended up working on an accounting project together and she asked me if I would help her with her homework and such. She was struggling in a few business classes because her schedule was very tight so at first it started off innocent with her offering home cooked meals now and then. We would normally study at her place and we had started to have a few close moments late at night. This time I knew what I wanted so I started to give her a shoulder massage and eventually she just turned around and said “Let me hump you”. This relationship was the most complete of the three as there was no need for secrecy and it lasted until we graduated. We even started having “family outings” where we took her son to Disneyland and she was happy for him to have a “male figure” in place of his father. Sadly rather abruptly one day she informed me that she was going to give her husband another shot. This was gut wrenching for me but also a growing moment I suppose. 

A couple years later I met my now wife and the res tis history. As odd as it may sound I really am grateful to the three women who taught me much about life. We had much fun together but the relationships truly helped me develop into a better man.

5ecbo2,37,2016-11-22,I just finished My First Viewing. I decided to pick my top 5 moments.,mediarch,Scrubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/5ecbo2/i_just_finished_my_first_viewing_i_decided_to/,"Obviously this is a spoiler zone.

So here are my picks in no particular order:

* **[My Point of No Return](https://youtu.be/ZHmgDAolfsM)**

If I had to pick one moment as my absolute favorite this would be it. It's simply amazing. I get chills just thinking about it. I can't really put my finger on why this stuck out to me but it did. I was blown away from the instant J.D. said ""I'd have to go nuclear"". Apparently this was meant to close out the show because at the time they were unsure if they would be able to make the switch to ABC. It was purposely left open to interpretation and if the show ended this way I honestly wouldn't be mad. Also the song is just perfect. 


* **[My Soul on Fire part two](https://youtu.be/QEYcfHoWm2s)**

""Then I witnessed one of those moments that let me know in my heart that these two would be together forever.""  


* **[My Lunch](https://youtu.be/RzDoqGGs1IM) and [My Fallen Idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuzBLu_IZCw)**

I consider these one ""moment"" because My Fallen Idol is in essence My Lunch part two. This showed me a different side to Dr. Cox. It made me realize that deep down he truly cares about everyone that steps into Sacred Heart. He wants what is best for the patients and he doesn't care if he needs to bend the rules or yell at some interns to do it. That is why J.D. and Cox work well together. J.D. works hard and learns from everything to make himself a better doctor. Dr. Cox's worst enemy is someone who is lazy and doesn't care. [That is why he fired the intern Ed as soon as he realized Ed was a lost cause.]
(https://youtu.be/na5oecJbEW8) Both these episodes made me truly appreciate the whole depth of the relationship between J.D. and Dr. Cox

* **[My Screw Up](https://youtu.be/znd_5VO81hw)**

There isn't anything that I can say that hasn't been discussed before. It's a beautiful moment that shows the emotional side of Dr. Cox.

* **[My Old Lady](https://youtu.be/He9tyk_1IAw)**

Four episodes in and it brings a powerful moment that teaches more lessons than I can count. Learn from your mistakes, take time for yourself and accomplish goals, don't fear death; embrace it. This is what got me hooked. I realized that scrubs wasn't just another generic sitcom. It has amazing depth and fantastic characters. The fact that after such a short time I genuinely felt for all of the characters speaks volumes for how great the show truly is. 


**Honorable Mentions:**

* My Finale 
* My Last Words
* My Long Goodbye
* My Jiggly Ball
* My Boss's Free Haircut
* My Bright Idea
* A bunch i'm probably forgetting

Let me know what you think and what are some of your favorites.

That got internships, and thrived there. I'm the one who procrastinates when they need to get shit done, and scrambles to finish last second. I have ADHD, a very unstable and toxic home life, coping techniques that are self destructive, and I've been making do as best as I can.

I got a job offer, which is good, and they want me to start in two weeks. I'm graduating in late December, as long as I pass everything (and hopefully I will...I passed all my core classes but engineering econ and prob stats have me by the balls). I feel inferior. My gpa is shit. I feel like a substandard engineer, and I feel like I haven't learned anything in these 4.5 years. I see other people, and their grades (my boyfriend sits on youtube all day and has a 3.92 gpa) and I think to myself ""why am i such shit"". And I know it's because despite the hell I've been through during college, I needed to step up and I couldn't.

And now, I'm wondering what I can do post degree to make things better. I want to learn more, and keep competitive, so that even if my job doesn't go well (I'm going into R&amp;D and I think I'm going to love it, but who knows) I don't fall into a pit of despair.

5ecma6,2,2016-11-22,Ein paar Fragen bezüglich Wohnungsbesichtigungen bei Hartz4,g6020794,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/5ecma6/ein_paar_fragen_bezüglich_wohnungsbesichtigungen/,"Hallo /de,

kennt sich jemand mit Hartz4 aus und kann mir ein paar Fragen beantworten?

Kurze Info zu mir: (TLDR: Bin noch nicht exmatrikuliert aber mit dem Studium fertig. Suche Wohnung, bin aber offiziell noch nicht als arbeitslos angemeldet, weil die Bescheinigung fehlt.)

Lange version:
Ich habe mein Studium erfolgreich beendet und versuche momentan Unterschriften zu sammeln, die notwendig sind, um einen Antrag auf Exmatrikulation zu stellen. Das ganze wird wohl noch ein Weilchen dauern und aus diesem Grund, war es mir bisher nicht möglich, mich beim Jobcenter als arbeitslos zu melden. Die brauchen diese Exmatrikulationsbescheinigung, bevor sie mir den Antrag für Hartz4 aushändigen. Letztes Mal gab mir der Sachbearbeiter aber schon mal eine ""Mietbescheinigung"" mit und erklärte mir, dass sie eine Wohnung bis zu 300€ übernehmen würden und auch die jetzige Miete bis ich ausziehe. Ich sollte sobald ich die Exmatrikulationsbescheinigung habe zum Jobcenter gehen und mich anmelden, dann würde alles in die Wege geleitet werden. Nunja, das ganze liegt jetzt ungefähr einen Monat zurück. Mein Kolloquium fand erst Anfang dieses Semesters statt und es dauerte noch eine Woche, bis die Note im POS war. Ich dachte eigentlich, man würde mich automatisch rausschmeißen, wenn ich für das neue Semester nicht zahle. Aber es sind schon 2-3 Monate vergangen und die lassen mich einfach nicht gehen, ohne diese Unterschriften. Das verzögert meinen Austritt unnötig und das Geld wird immer knapper. Während ich also versuche, das zu klären, dachte ich, ich schaue mich zeitgleich nach einer Wohnung um und dabei habe ich gemerkt, dass mir einige Dinge noch unklar sind.

**Jetzt meine Fragen:** Kann ich mir auch eine Wohnung für z.b 350€ aussuchen und die 50€ die drüber sind, selbst zahlen? Oder lehnen die Angebote über dem Limit direkt ab?    
Auf dem Zettel steht, dass die Unterschrift des Vermieters erforderlich ist. Wie geh ich also da vor? Suche ich mir eine Wohnung, besichtige sie, erzähle dem Vermieter, dass ich (bald) Hartz4 Empfänger bin und mit dem Zettel erst zum Jobcenter muss, damit sie die Wohnung genehmigen, bevor ich den Mietvertrag unterschreibe?    
Oder gehe ich damit erst zum Jobcenter, lass mir das ok geben und besuche die Wohnung anschließend? (Welche aber schnell weg sein kann)
Mir ist die Reihenfolge noch unklar. Und wie ist es, wenn man sich Wohnungen in benachbarten Städten anschaut? Muss ich mich dann zusätzlich im jeweiligen Jobcenter anmelden oder läuft die Vermittlung intern?   
Wie lange dauert die Bearbeitung eines Antrags eigentlich? Ich muss ende Dezember aus der Wohnung raus und bekomme langsam Panik."

This is my first post so forgive me for any errors. 

Background Knowledge:

   I was EXTREMELY fortunate enough to have my parents be able to pay for my college tuition my first 3 years. I am now in my last year of Electrical Engineering at the University of Florida, however due to recent circumstances my parents are moving and are unable to pay for my last year of college. (I am unfathomably appreciative of what they have already done for me)


  I made many uneducated mistakes with personal finances and am now about $1500 in debt with a FICO credit score of only 612...Never making that mistake again. My internship at NASA pays enough only to cover food/housing etc. with a bit left over to pay around $200 a month for credit payments.


   I would appreciate any advice about certain types of loans you all would recommend I apply for to pay for my last year. I have a feeling personal loans from banks might be out of the question considering my credit history, and my parents make enough income as to where loans based off of FAFSA will not be sufficient.

Thank you for your time people of Reddit.

5eczju,3,2016-11-22,Unfair Dismissal . Long,jeff_vii,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/5eczju/unfair_dismissal_long/,"Hi,

I've worked with a central London company , for 20 months

I've never been in HR or trouble the entire time i've been there, until approximately 6 weeks ago

Situation;

I was giving graduate training to some of the new interns at work .This was something thats part of my job title, but I was asked to help by a manager, as I was a graduate myself when I joined the company and moved up the ranks pretty quickly.

One of the graduates was somewhat socially awkward, but a nice lad. Anyways , this guy requested to sit beside me when he moved onto my team and asked me to Mentor him. I thought it was sweet and agreed. I helped him sales coaching etc . I myself have ADD and I'm terrible with admin. I was spending large chunks of my day on admin, and the new guy asked if I'd like a help with the admin in return for sales training and helping him to close deals. I asked my line manager and director and they both agreed that this was fine . ( verbally)

I win the competition , and when I'm off on holidays I hear a storm has gathered in the office. One of the girls has went nuts that I got help with my admin , and said I have won the competion unfairly.

I arrive back from holidays, to get an investigation meeting on four counts of gross miss-conduct.

-That I manipulated the new hire into helping me
-That I exchanged my salesforce login details
-That I set myself up for an unfair advantage
-That i set the company up for a financial loss for my own gain

Essentially what happened when I was away, my director who was in a serious HR case , claimed he didn't know anything about the arrangement just that we were helping each other. I believe the new hire panicked upon this, and made up a BS story that I manipulated him. I was fit to prove through Skype conversation that my director was aware of what was going on, and my line manager said from the beginning he was aware and seen nothing wrong with the relationship.

I put together a strong case , and got a final written warning. I was disgusted by how the case was handled, for a number of reasons.

1. They only investigated me and not the other guy who had also committed 'gross misconduct'. All claims were against me , and none were made again the new hire ( ie is this a bs story, are these claims factual, what is the other side of the story)
2. I proved through call recordings and emails from salesforce that I done 104% of his revenue for that month ( he achieved 146% )
3. My direct line manager had went on record as saying that everyone including he, was aware of the situation and didn't have a problem with it
4. They asked me to come in for the investigation at 3pm on the same day they sent me the email. I was working from home after a late flight, and they demanded that I prepare my case , commute and digest all this information in 5 hours. I outright refused and they scheduled it for the following day.
5. The person heading up the investigation doesn't like me at all. Whilst that is a subjective fact, she works in strategy, and her bf is a direct rival for my accounts. She also sits directly across from me. She's not a manager, and I questioned HR why she was heading up the case as it was a complete conflict of interests and I felt as if It should be conducted by a member of HR as both my managers were involved in the case.
6. People who were interviewed during the investigation came to me, including the girl who reported the case. Although she was unhappy with what I done, she told me that the mannerism of the questions were completely biased towards someone already guilty, and the questions were very leading. She sent a statement to this effect.
7. All of her reccomendations and conclusions during the case were non factual and based on opinion. I questioned how she could have possibly came to some of the conclusions such as that ' their was evidence to suggest I manipulated the new hire ' . There was no link to any of this evidence , and I asked how could it possibly be the case when my manager had said during the investigation that he was completely aware


This left me in a really poor state for a month. I was really depressed and anxious. I was annoyed by the outcome and that my reputation was falsely tarnished. My director was sacked during the process ( suprise surprise ) . I planned to let the dust settle for a month , and appeal the decison. My head of sales had chatted to me about the situation, I said I wouldn't appeal if the new hire came forward and was honest that he had lied. My head of sales , who knew the employee lied ( certain claims he made about accounts got him found out ) said that we would arrange something informally the following month



Unfortunately 2 weeks later, I myself was involved in a completely rediculous sitiation , which to be fair was my own fault , albeit unintentional. I had been out for a drink at the pub beside the office , after a late sales meeting with a client. We finish at 3pm and I finished the meeting at 730pm. I had a meeting the following day with a big client, that I agreed to meet on my time off as it was a big deal. I had a few drinks , and a few more and before I knew it was 130am and I had left my laptop for the meeting in the office. I went back to the office, and banged on the main door to be let in. The office has security guards all day and night friday/saturday. I couldn't get in so went home.

Monday morning Im brought into a meeting room and suspended for two weeks. I'm told I put a crack in the main office door when banging it and went home. I ashamed at doing such a thuggish thing but was completely unaware that I had.

They called me on the Tuesday, and went through an investigation call. I got an email on Saturday morning to say I had a disciplinary meeting on the Monday. They fired me with immediate effect

1. I felt the notice was very short for the meeting ( I believed it was 48 hours working notice ) The meeting was 2pm on the Monday , and I got the email Saturday at 1120am
2. I had said that it was a complete accident, and while I was aware of how it looked , it was simply an accident that I was unaware of . I offered to pay in full when I was first made aware of it.
3. I had been on both anti depressants and anti anxiety medication, which I brought and showed my scripts for. I had taken what happened the month before quite badly. I had said I used alcohol on occasion to manage stress, but had been referred by my gp to a alcohol counselling program ( This was a bit waffley , while it was true I don't have a drink problem I just got drunk , it was only the second time in two months I'd drank at all).



Have I any case here? Sorry for the long post  "

5edle4,3,2016-11-22,Was once in the industry... looking to get back in,Dula91,oilandgas,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgas/comments/5edle4/was_once_in_the_industry_looking_to_get_back_in/,"Well I am posting on here because I literally have no idea what to do now. My buddy showed me a picture of someone who posted on a subreddit about looking for a new job and he got a lot of responses so I figure I have nothing to lose.
All my life I was told that to be successful you need to go to college and get good grades and then you will be able to get a good job.

I completed high school by the age of 16 and then went into college very underprepared and not really mature enough to go. I had too easy of a time in my prior education and I did not know how to study. I eventually learned what to do and on my way to a Major in Chemistry. I eventually hated what I was doing and after completing 2 years worth of chemistry classes I switched my major to International Business and minored in Management. I ended up getting into some pretty heavy legal trouble when I was 19 and 20 years old and it is something that will follow me for the rest of my life but I learned and coped with it and have pushed through it and graduated with my Bachelors of Arts in International Business with Minors in Management and Chemistry (since I already had more than enough credits why not add it to the degree).

Coming out of college the job market looked pretty bleak and didn't really have many prospects because of my background at the time. I had zero professional experience ( I participated in no internships, i feel like my college didn't emphasize them enough) and I live in Wichita, KS where international business isn't a huge thing. We have a predominant aviation/manufacturing industry (which I have no real desire to go into).

So what I opted to do is the one thing I knew, go back to school. I was on felony probation, jobless, but pursuing my Master's in Business Administration. I ended up getting off of probation and completed my Masters and had landed a job with a local oil company as an in house Landman. The pay wasn't too great but there were a ton of fringe benefits to the job that made up for it. I loved the people I worked with and what I did on the day to day but I wanted more.

Prices plummeted and Kansas Common was trading in the 20's. We had a full stop on drilling and we weren't even leasing new prospects. For the foreseeable future we were a drilling company that was doing everything but. For a few months we did some in house cleaning of old paper work and past projects but eventually there was a layoff in the company. Over 25% of the workforce was let go. I was one of the four in my department of eleven. I don't blame my manager for choosing me and the others, we were the logical choices. Me and my old boss still remain close (I have known him for about 15 years).

So no here I am about 10 months from the time I was laid off. I have my MBA, B.A. in International Business, and almost 2 years of experience in the Energy Sector. Since I was laid off I have been all over indeed and careerbuilder and several other job boards applying to different jobs. I am hoping for some direction. My past convictions have never affected where I work or what I can do. I am willing to relocate or travel as needed. I would love to work with developing nations. I have even considered going back to school for my D.B.A. or even taking the BAR.

I apologize for the novel but I hope all of you who have read this far may be able to appreciate my situation. I am not looking for charity, I am looking to earn my place in the workplace. Any continent, any country, any state, any city.
All advice is welcome!!! Thank you!"
5edml2,10,2016-11-22,Job offer advice...what would you do?,uiuc_17,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5edml2/job_offer_advicewhat_would_you_do/,"I'm a senior right now, and I've been pretty lucky I guess. Its Thanksgiving break and I have two job offers. I canceled all my other interviews because I'm going to accept one of these. These are places where I would definitely have signed off on if I didn't have the other.

The first is the one I'm leaning towards: It is with a three letter intel agency in DC doing something I think I would really enjoy and be good at. There are opportunities to travel and work overseas which is really attractive to me. The catch is that it is conditional on me receiving a high security clearance, I don't see there being any issues with it BUT anything could happen (I'd have to get polygraphed) and they can pull their offer at anytime if they find anything they don't like. The salary for this one is $68k but I'm hoping to get it up to at least $75k (b/c of my other offer).

The second is with a national lab also in the DC area, I'd be doing something similar to what i did in a past internship (and I enjoyed). This job is unconditional and final, I have it as soon as a sign the acceptance letter. The salary for this one is $80.5k.

I really want to do the first one, even though it is a massive risk (I did some googling and about 9% of job offers are pulled during the clearance process). But hey its good to take risks right? My parents think it would be extremely stupid to do this and that I should accept the job with a higher salary immediately.

There is a third option, one that I really don't want to do. I have another onsite interview with Raytheon that i haven't canceled and I would definitely get the offer if i decide to do it. I could accept the first option and the third and then renege when my offer becomes final. This provides a safety net, but I just think its a terrible thing to do. 

What would you do?"

Then it's off to another Ohio city where I will be working for the same company that I've done a few internships with.

As far as looks go, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, green eyes, a healthy weight (although I plan on shaping up more—in a good way of course! Not in a rounder way or anything :P). I'd say I put more effort into how I look and dress than most guys. I can show you some pictures if you'd like. I'm also open to video chatting eventually if things go well. That way you also know I'm not a random creep, of course.

I'm a very logical thinker (who does computer science, shocker), but I also have ADHD which causes me to make many illogical decisions that get me in trouble sometimes. It will likely come up a fair amount so I apologize in advance if it gets old. On the other hand, I like to think that I am very understanding of anyone who has a mental illness as well.

One of my hobbies is hanging out with my siblings, which often means playing Overwatch together online (which I am very into as well). I'm also a Rock Band guitar nerd, which I realize isn't nearly as cool as playing an actual guitar, haha. I'd also say I'm pretty musical, although I don't have a ton of time for it (I listen to a lot of music, played sax for 8 years). There are also loads of small little interests of mine that may be expanded upon greatly if they happen to come up, such as my love for Ska music and how I have yet to find another person who likes it. I also love trying new things, whether it's food or learning something new.

Anyway, if you're interested, if you could include a bit about you in your message that would be great! Looking forward to hearing from you :)"

What do y'all think about VAT? It seems like a hot field that will only get bigger as global trade increases. 

I'll be doing an internship in B4 VAT over the summer and wanted to get your thoughts. 

B4 is obviously a great place for accountants to start a career, is VAT specifically a good field? My recruiter mentioned that it is an extremely sought after department. 

How can I prepare? I figured I would continue to do some googling but was curious if you guys had any suggestions in particular. 

Finally, I wanted to thank this community for all the discussion about accounting and B4. This subreddit was helpful in preparing for interviews and learning about the field. It certainly helped me get an offer.

5eeupm,3,2016-11-22,Afraid of my gpa falling below a 3.0,ase3t,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5eeupm/afraid_of_my_gpa_falling_below_a_30/,"I am a senior studying Industrial systems engineering and maintain a 3.1 GPA. However, I am afraid of what will happen to my GPA when the semester ends. I always hear how critical it is to have that 3.0 and many jobs have that 3.0 requirement. My classes are difficult, especially mechanics of materials. I already had to reduce the frequency of going to the gym, give up a couple of my hobbies, as well as getting more take out because I barely have time to stay afloat. My friends comment on how exhausted or ask if I am ok on group work because my mental energy is shot. 

I remember how hard it was to get an internship with a 2.9 GPA. I sent out an upwards of a hundred carefully crafted resumes and cover letters online. Even then I was very very very fortunate I was chosen for the internship. There aren't any positions that I am qualified for at the company I interned at. 

I am not so much afraid of the 2.99 as much as I am afraid of not securing a job offer before graduation. The last thing I want to do is rent an apartment only to find a job elsewhere and continue paying rent. Thus I would be living at home, in a small town where nothing goes on. I would be at home stagnating. I read horror stories about engineers who are unemployed or underemployed for years and how it just gets harder to secure an engineering job due to employers preferring fresh grads. I don’t want that to be me. 

I am 25 years old, and already I feel behind the rest of my peers. A few years ago, I deleted my facebook because I got sick of seeing all my ""friends"" with their awesome careers, cute girlfriends, and dozens upon dozens of tagged pictures with their cool friends at beaches, parties, bars, etc. I still hear about people getting engaged and married.  

Getting a career would mean I can ultimately work on myself by improving my social skills, ability to read body language, taking weight lifting more seriously, taking up new hobbies, making new friends and dating a ton of girls.

When I went there they said they were pretty sure they weren't offering internships but to send my information. I met with two people in the company, one who added me on her LinkedIn account and was a programmer and I also met the CFO of the company who gave me her e-mail.

I have been trying to get together some mobile game apps to send along with my resume as I feel it would be the only thing they would really want to see, but I don't have a whole lot to show, maybe 4 small projects total and that's all. I'm debating whether to wait longer and create a better mobile app project to send along as an example of my skills, or to send in my resume now while they still remember me coming in.

 I get my associates degree in December and have already taken a number of upper-division programming courses at a CSU, but my overall GPA is rather poor at about a 2.3. I am however at least in the Honors program for my mobile programming class.


I'm worried I won't be able to send in a qualified enough resume but it would be my dream to get to work for this place and hope I can get help from this sub on what I should do/what I should send. Thank you for reading this."

Should I get a Second bachelors in CS or is an AS in CS enough?,NodeDude4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ef0ha/bachelors_in_biochem_should_i_get_a_second/,"My main priority is to get some entry level development work or internship to break into the field. I have already taken the introductory programming courses for the degree and did well in them. The AS contains all the foundational courses: Data structures, algorithms, organization and I can finish it in the next two semesters. I am also working on different projects in my free time. I don't necessarily have the funds to go after a bachelors or a Masters at the moment, but if it is necessary now I will do it. My plan was to finish the AS, try to get a job and maybe do a masters online once I gain more experience.

Because I already have a bachelors, would I still be disqualified with an AS in CS? I took some high level math and physics courses for my bachelors degree, but I'm guessing employers care about the designation quite a bit, though I have heard that programming is meritocratic than other fields, which are more stringent on designations.

I rescheduled it to July 25, 2016 because I thought ""hey it's smack in the middle of summer so there probably won't be any issues."" Come July 25, I show to the court and the clerk explains that we must be available for the next three days and guarantee ourselves to be available for the following 7-8 business days if we are selected to be on the trial. Well, the internship program I was in was sending nine interns to Oakland, CA for a business trip, all expenses paid on August 4th. I could stay the three days for jury selection but I couldn't guarantee my availability if I was selected for trial, and once again I had to postpone. I vaguely recall the clerk saying something like ""we'll send you another notice sometime in January"" because it coincides with my winter break.

Now, me and my friends want to play a trip to Seattle, Vancouver and LA on January 12-19. I haven't gotten a jury summons in the mail yet, but if I were book that trip now and get a summons later, what happens? Would I get a third postponement?

5egaj1,1,2016-11-23,Shooting for Stanford MS EE but bad GRE,pumpedcharge,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5egaj1/shooting_for_stanford_ms_ee_but_bad_gre/,"Would love to attend Stanford for a terminal MS in EE. I'm extremely interested in computer architecture, integrated circuits, and embedded systems.

Current UCLA EE senior. Overall GPA: 3.51, major GPA: 3.72.
Work experience: Apple Mac hardware engineering, Tesla power electronics engineering, and a UCLA research lab. My &gt; 3.5 GPA qualifies me for UCLA's guaranteed admission into their MS program. 
(For reference, apparently the undergrad overall GPA average is around a 2.8)



So long story short, I took the GRE today and did not do great. (160 quant, 160 verbal.) 


Part of the reason is that I haven't had significant amount of time to prep. I have a family member who is very sick and doctors found out that I have a heart condition very early on this quarter, so I've been in and out of appointments. These two issues have coupled to create a general state of unhappiness so I wasn't in the best state of mind taking this test. I've scored 330+ on practice exams so I think I could have done better with more prep and a better mindset.



I'm from the bay area and I'd love to attend Stanford for the EE MS program. I've proven my engineering capabilities by getting return offers (for internship and full time) from Apple, Tesla, and Amazon. I have designed circuits that have made it into Macbook Pros, and Tesla's Model S and X. I've conducted independent research on stock trading algorithms, written backtesting simulators in C++, and am currently in the preliminary design stages of what may be worthy enough to pursue as a startup.



I've been much more successful in industry than in academics, evidenced by the fact that a lot of my ideas have bypassed multiple layers of the management hierarchy and made it into products directly. I have to work very hard to get the grades I do, but I'm capable of doing well. It's too late now to retake the GRE since all the testing centers near me are booked until after Stanford's submission deadline. My score is not good relative to my competition and my GPA is lower. I have three strong letters of rec (2 professor, 1 manager from industry). Do I still stand a chance? If so, would it be worth explaining my situation to someone at Stanford? I live close enough to just walk over there.

The sister and I are going through college (not in our hometown, so we're not living with out parents, and I also got a paid internship not long ago, so I'm fairly close do being more-or-less independent, financially and otherwise.

Yesterday, I got a call from mommy dearest telling me that I should know that she's going to go file for divorce in a couple of days, that things haven't been working out between the two of them, and that he's madly in love with a woman he met while working, something like that. Regarding that other woman, it's the first I've heard of it (and, truth be told, I find it hard to believe that he had actually cheated on my mom in a physical manner), but it's no secret in the family that they haven't been getting along all that well in the past couple of years.

Without going into too much detail, there has been a lot of strain on both of them individually, both financially and professionally, along with some other family issues, and they have fairly incompatible personalities to begin with, so I guess that escalated.

Now, he is a wonderful man, and a father who's been a major influence on me in many aspects, from politics to musical taste, and I love and respect him quite a lot, and don't blame him in the slightest if he strayed a bit. (Even if he did anything physical, but you can't blame a man for falling in love.)
And she is a wonderful woman, and a mother who's behind most of my major life successes, and also the financial backbone of the family. I love her a lot too, and have a great deal of respect for her as well, but she has a temper vastly different than my father's, and is fairly susceptible to stress, and she started cracking a while back, throwing irrational tantrums more and more often, so it's no wonder the two aren't getting along.

So, without going any further: what can I expect to happen? How can this play out?
I'd especially like input on two scenarios:
1) if they officially go through with it (like, going through courts and all that jazz), I imagine that will cost a lot, a whole lot more than we can afford. Other than that, given that my siblings and I are all adults, can I expect any custody issues or anything like that, since two of us are still officially living ""at home""?

2) If they don't go to court (and I'm about to make a phonecall regarding that, which I do not look forward to), is there any chance of peaceful resolution of the situation? They are coworkers, and can function okay while dealing with stuff not related to the family (like business, for instance), so can I maybe expect the status quo to remain in place?

And finally, I can't really say I feel any major emotional distress regarding the whole situation, other than ""Ah, crap."" Should I brace for an emotional impact in the following months?

I tried to make this post structured, but I don't think it turned out the way I wanted it to, and most of it is fairly situational and hypothetical, so, really, any input is appreciated!"

5eha80,139,2016-11-23,"My FMIL keeps calling our guinea pig ""our child""",supercoolpckid,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5eha80/my_fmil_keeps_calling_our_guinea_pig_our_child/,"TL;DR A preview into the future assures that I will be very, very far away when when we have kids. 

First, some backstory. So my FH and I recently graduated, and are on the dreaded job hunt. I just got a very well-paying job, but my FH is having a harder time and only has an internship. His parents are well-off, and have an apartment in their basement which they graciously offered to let us live in for a couple of months until we could get more settled. I've always gotten along well with his mother, and the apartment is pretty detached from the rest of the house, so we agreed. After a long discussion about boundaries, of course. 

And it's been ... exactly what you'd expect. Boundaries? Apparently it's one of those buzz words like ""synergy"" or ""innovative productivity"" that you just spew out to sound good, I guess.  But that's for another time.

I've always had an idea that his mom would be a JNMIL. My FH has an older brother who's married (SIL) with two kids- Nephew (4) and an 18 mo little girl. My FMIL has a really strained relationship with SIL, and I've gotten the idea that she doesn't really respect their boundaries - especially with the boy. 

She goes to every sporting event invited or not, and she sees them 3 times a week. She buys TONS of toys even when SIL asks her not to, and then gets horribly hurt when they won't accept them or donate them. There are dozens of pictures of JUST the boy around the house. On mugs, pillows, you name it. It's weird. But whatever - not my business, and she still babysits all the time.  I don't judge.

So my FH and I got a guinea pig a week ago (after asking if it was okay to bring him in their house. I'm not 100% a dick). He's a cute baby who's still very nervous around people. It took several days to acclimate him to us, but he still freaks at loud noises or new things. He nips when scared and still doesn't like it when picked up. We asked FMIL and FFIL to leave him be until he could adjust. And I specifically said to keep Nephew away from him. HA! 

Instantly shes gushing about our new ""child"" and our little family and adding to it *hint hint wink wink*. Like woman, I'm 22 years old. I'm not shooting any potatoes out of this cannon for a long time. 

And forget leaving him alone, they brought their dauschund right to him. You know, the small hunting dog bred to attack small rodents? That went great. 

But now, shes got this idea that our pet somehow belongs to Nephew. She wants us to let him hold and play with him over Thanksgiving. So she can take a million pictures of her grandbaaaaby and a cute animal. They didn't even ask me, they summoned FH alone to the house and told him. Like no lady, the boy is destructive and spoiled as shit. I don't want him holding a small, scared animal. He WILL get bit and it WILL be my fault. And I love my piggy, I don't want to traumatize him or risk him being hurt by a toddler because some lady needs her photo fix.

 When FH said no, she pouted that we could just have the pig not bite him, like I'm the pig whisperer. Then she said it didn't matter because it's ""just a pet"". And it was cheap so we could always replace it.  We didn't looooove nephew and itd break his heart. That we don't want a happy faaaaamily. 

Why would it break his heart to hold a pet he's supposedly never seen? I think they've been sneaking him into the apartment while we're at work. We come home and everything's been moved. I had a feeling that they'd been snooping before, but they definitely are now. Whatever, have fun finding my sex toys. 

So now we're the monsters because we won't let our ""child"" be passed around at Thanksgiving with a toddler who can't keep a toy in one piece. It's become a power play. And the whole FM network will be there.  This is going to be fun.

As the title suggests, I'm a 22 year old female from the Netherlands. I'm a programming student in my second year of college and I really enjoy handwriting letters, poems, notes and other bippity bops. I'm looking for the kind of penpal that would like to exchange letters with a little pizzazz. You don't have to go overboard flashy, but I would love to receive fancy stationary, stickets, drawings and other little charms which I will include in my own letters as well! :) 


So, here's a little bit more about me then I guess; 
As I mentioned above, I am a programming student. I'm currently specializing in game design and very recently picked up an optional unity course in college. I plan to go on an internship in February and if you're interested in video games, I'd love to share some of this journey with you! As you might have guessed, I also really enjoy playing video games. My favorite games include: The legend of Zelda (The entire series), World of Warcraft, Fable, and the flavour of the month is Overwatch. I've played and still play a bunch more games though, but listing them all would just make this point tedious and leave nothing for the actual letters haha. 

Apart from spending my days getting sucked into my computer, I also enjoy reading, though I think that is a common interest among a lot of people in this subreddit haha. I read almost every genre, but my heart goes out to writers like Poe and Lovecraft. There's just something romantic about the way they write horror. 


Other than that I'd say I'm a cringe connoisseur, socially awkward, way too addicted to bad puns and I've got a really horrible sense of humour. Seeing as it's that time of the year and thanksgiving isn't a thing here, I've been listening to Christmas music already and absolutely loving it. 


I think that sums me up quite well for now. If this has sparked your interest I'd love to hear from you! Like I already mentioned, I'm looking for a snail mail pall. However, if you'd like to exchange a few reddit messages or emails first to get the feel for things I'm okay with that as well. Eventually I would like to send pictures and maybe even small gifts and trinkets as well, that seems like lots of fun! :) 


Hoping to hear from someone soon &lt;3 (With a lot of excitement) 

EDIT: What an overwhelming response! Thanks everyone! I'm still replying to all inbox messages but I promise I will reply to everyone! Also feel free to keep em coming haha ;)"

""One does not simply walk into Mordor,"" James cried, dramatically gesturing towards the video, ""*he flies there!*""

Massive eagles flew through the video, with tourists perched on top of them looking at Mordor with awe and wonder. It had been completely morphed into a massive theme park. The 'Eye of Sauron' was now a kitschy spire in the centre, overlooking the entire park.

The CEO raised his eyebrows. 

""Wait, wait, hold on - you mean to say we're we've got a magical Elven kingdom at our disposal, and you've decided to use *Mordor* as our main attraction?"" 

""Plenty free real estate,"" James replied quickly, clicking to the next slide, ""seeing as the orcs have left."" The slide showed Mordor's current abysmal state, and the plans to turn it into a thriving metropolis.

""If *orcs* don't want to stay there, then why the hell would anyone else?"" the CEO replied, and everyone else laughed.

James felt the presentation slipping away from him. It had seemed like such a great idea at the time.

""If you'll just wait till the end of my presentation-""

""I don't understand why they couldn't just fly there.""

The room fell silent. An intern in the back, previously unnoticed, had just spoken. 

""I literally just said that they *should* fly there,"" James said, sighing heavily, ""but if you'll just look at this next slide-""

""No no, I know that,"" the intern replied, leaning back in his chair, ""I mean the fellowship, yea? Why didn't they just jump on the eagles and fly there in the first place?""

James frowned. ""I don't think that's entirely relevant to-""

""Well it all falls down to *visibility*, see,"" said Rob from accounting, steepling his fingers, ""and the Council of Elrond felt they couldn't take their chances with such a brash, risky attempt.""

""So they thought a few goddamn hobbits and a Gollum would fair better?"" the intern retorted.

Rob scoffed. ""If you're calling Smeagol ""a Gollum"" then this discussion is-""

""-All I'm saying is if *I* wanted the ring destroyed-""

""*COULD EVERYONE JUST PLEASE SHUT UP.*""

The whole room turned to face James. He was breathing heavily. 

""Could anyone - *ANYONE* - just concentrate on my damned presentation?""

The room was silent. Everyone looked around sheepishly.

Alan, from marketing, stood up, patting James on the shoulder.

""Well, if it makes you feel any better, you have my stapler, friend,"" he said, putting it down heavily on the table.

James stared at him. ""I don't get... oh no, don't-""

""And my book,"" Gail from customer service said, slamming it on top of the stapler.

""No, *no-*""

""AND MY AXE!""

****

James stepped outside the corporate building, holding a box with everything he'd kept at the office. He wasn't proud of everything he'd done afterwards at the presentation, but it certainly felt *good*.

He stared at the distant spire. 

""Maybe I'll just see how the view is from up there, just for a little bit..."" he said to himself, as he walked towards Mordor."

It's not something that debilitates me, but it hurts and I have to make constant trips to the bathroom. I have this often, about once per month, lasts usually a day.


If I'm at home, I feel one thousand times more confortable, can even work from the toilet and dont have to worry about the smell of my condition being felt by coworkers.


I can honestly say that in this case I am far more productive at home.


I'm an intern, work 6 hours per day and always do my job, always deliver things before the deadline, my relationship with coworkers is good and they often say they are happy about my work.


I'm just worried that this can somehow undermine the confidence they have in me, as I wanna be officialy hired when my internship is over.


The only time that I miss work is when I have diarrhea and I actually do my work from home.


So...

TL;DR: Should I make an effort next time to go to work and risk not being productive and spending a long time in the bathroom?"

Help!!,ThatsAllFolks42,FinancialAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialAdvice/comments/5ej9cx/college_kid_with_credit_card_debt_help/,"I did a really stupid thing and went over my credit card limit. 100% of this situation is because I was foolish and I know that.

I got my first credit card this summer while I was working an internship. I needed the card for rent/transportation/groceries/etc because I didn't get my first paycheck until the third week. Fast-forward to midway through this school semester (I'm in my senior year in college) when my laptop died. I needed a new one fast so I bought one with my debit card with the money I made this summer. At this point I hadn't used the credit card since summer. I had acquired some debt but I was able to pay well over the monthly minimum so I thought I was okay.

The laptop expense plus some unexpected doctor appointments and prescriptions used up the money I made during the summer, money that I had hoped to make last until the beginning of the Spring semester for books. So I started using my credit card. And then kept using it. Instead of being frugal I did things like go to the movies, bought new clothes, and ate out with friends. Over the last two months I've managed to spend about $1500, which is about $300 over my limit.

I have no money at all right now. I work two minimum-wage jobs on campus but with the end of the semester and a break for Thanksgiving, I won't work enough hours to make enough to pay back my overage before it's due in two weeks. I am working on a plan to tackle the rest of my debt (working full-time during winter break and budgeting my next semester to the dime). But I don't know what to do right now.

 My parents can't afford to bail me out nor would I want them to. I know that I should call the credit card company but I don't know what to say or how to approach this at all. I looked into having my limit raised (just for this month then I would ask to have it lowered again) but since I make so little money right now, I wouldn't be a good (or even okay) candidate for a higher credit limit.

What should I do? I know this is my fault. I want to handle this as responsibily as I can.

Thank you in advance."

I don't really have any idea about Docker etc., but because the MSBuild plugin for Jenkins CI does not integrate with Pipelining (yet?), I feel as though most solutions point towards the use of Docker to some degree?

So pretty much, I am wondering if anyone has any tutorials or examples of .NET pipelining using Jenkins 2.0, or any viable alternative.

5ejiz2,15,2016-11-23,Using PackStack to deploy OpenStack with access to a physical network,robinkb,linux,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5ejiz2/using_packstack_to_deploy_openstack_with_access/,"I'm researching OpenStack as part of my internship, and I needed an OpenStack deployment to run tests on. The company that I'm interning at provided me with a second computer to setup a test environment, and naturally I used PackStack to deploy my OpenStack instance.

Unforunately, the default settings for PackStack provide an ""external"" network, but the bridge device isn't connected to a NIC. I couldn't find any instructions on how to do this either, but after a bit of trial and error, I figured it out.

So here are the instructions.

# The setup
This setup uses two computers connected on a LAN network. The workstation distribution doesn't matter, but I like to use CentOS for enterprise-y things. The real setup is actually super ghetto with both computers connected directly with a single ethernet cable, but that doesn't matter here.

| Hostname | IP Address | OS |
|-|-|-|
| packstack.local | 172.16.0.2/24 | CentOS 7 (Minimal installation)|
| workstation.local | 172.16.0.3/24 | CentOS 7 (Workstation) | 

# Prerequisites
This guide uses the RPM packages from [RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org). This part is just following their instructions, but I'll write them out here for convenience.

**On the server:**

Disable NetworkManager and firewalld, and enable the old network service.

    # systemctl disable firewalld --now
    # systemctl disable NetworkManager --now
    # systemctl enable network --now

Upgrade your system, and maybe install NTP too. Then, enable the RDO repositories, and upgrade your system again. The RDO repository overwrites a few packages on your system. Finally, install the PackStack installer, and reboot the system.

    # yum upgrade -y
    # yum install -y centos-release-openstack-newton ntp
    # systemctl enable ntpd.service
    # yum upgrade –y
    # yum install -y openstack-packstack
    # reboot


# PackStack
Now, we're going to have PackStack generate an answers file, that we will modify.

    # packstack --gen-answer-file=packstack-answers

But before you start editing, find out what your server's network device is called. Simply telling you to run `ip addr` would be a bit boring for a guide on installing OpenStack, so let's read your network device names from `/sys/`

    # ls /sys/class/net/ | grep -xv lo

I don't know if bridge devices are going to work with wireless devices, so ignore any `wlo` devices that you see.

Now open up the answers file from earlier in your favorite text editor.

Be sure to check what additional applications you want to install, because PackStack won't deploy them all by default. For example, I wanted Heat as well.

      59 # Specify 'y' to install OpenStack Orchestration (heat). ['y', 'n']
      60 CONFIG_HEAT_INSTALL=y

And now, **what you came here for**. A provider network is exactly what we want. 

     812 # The name of the Open vSwitch bridge (or empty for linuxbridge) for
     813 # the OpenStack Networking L3 agent to use for external  traffic.
     814 # Specify 'provider' if you intend to use a provider network to handle
     815 # external traffic.
     816 CONFIG_NEUTRON_L3_EXT_BRIDGE=provider

Enable the `flat` driver for provider networks. A flat network is... just a network. No VLANs or anything. Plain ol' networking.

     837 # Comma-separated list of network-type driver entry points to be
     838 # loaded from the neutron.ml2.type_drivers namespace. ['local',
     839 # 'flat', 'vlan', 'gre', 'vxlan']
     840 CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS=flat,vxlan

Here, we're telling PackStack to create maps between the external Open vSwitch bridge and a physical network. `physnet`is a completely arbitrary name, and `br-ex`is the name of default external bridge device. 

     906 # Comma-separated list of bridge mappings for the OpenStack
     907 # Networking Open vSwitch plugin. Each tuple in the list must be in
     908 # the format &lt;physical_network&gt;:&lt;ovs_bridge&gt;. Example: physnet1:br-
     909 # eth1,physnet2:br-eth2,physnet3:br-eth3
     910 CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=physnet:br-ex

This is where we connect the external bridge device to our physical device. `enp0s25` is the NIC of my server. Fill in the device name that you discovered earlier.

     912 # Comma-separated list of colon-separated Open vSwitch
     913 # &lt;bridge&gt;:&lt;interface&gt; pairs. The interface will be added to the
     914 # associated bridge. If you desire the bridge to be persistent a value
     915 # must be added to this directive, also
     916 # CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS must be set in order to create
     917 # the proper port. This can be achieved from the command line by
     918 # issuing the following command: packstack --allinone --os-neutron-
     919 # ovs-bridge-mappings=ext-net:br-ex --os-neutron-ovs-bridge-interfaces
     920 # =br-ex:eth0
     921 CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES=br-ex:enp0s25 

And here we tell PackStack what the external bridge device is named. You can rename this device if you adjust the entries above, but really, there's no point. Don't make this harder than it needs to be.

     923 # Comma-separated list of Open vSwitch bridges that must be created
     924 # and connected to interfaces in compute nodes when flat or vlan type
     925 # drivers are enabled. These bridges must exist in
     926 # CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS and
     927 # CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES. Example: --os-neutron-ovs-bridges-
     928 # compute=br-vlan --os-neutron-ovs-bridge-mappings=""extnet:br-
     929 # ex,physnet1:br-vlan"" --os-neutron-ovs-bridge-interfaces=""br-ex:eth1
     930 # ,br-vlan:eth2""
     931 CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGES_COMPUTE=br-ex 

I didn't provision the demo, because I wanted to start with a clean slate. Don't worry, I'll tell you how to configure an external network.

    1178 # Specify 'y' to provision for demo usage and testing. ['y', 'n']
    1179 CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO=n

Now save, and run PackStack with your answers file. Reboot afterwards.

    # packstack --answerfile=packstack-answers
    # reboot

# Public network

You can perform these steps on your server, but I prefer to work locally when I can. PackStack installed the OpenStack client on your server (unless you disabled the option), but you can install it on your workstation with `pip`. Or use your distribution's packages. I don't care. Heck, you can probably perform these steps in Horizon, but if I wanted to use screenshots in my documentation, I'd be using Windows.

    # yum install -y python-pip                        # if you don't have pip yet
    # pip install python-openstackclient

PackStack also generated a keystonerc file. This is a bash script that sets environment variables that are used for authenticating with Keystone, OpenStack's Identity component. Copy it over to your workstation, and source it. If you want to log into Horizon, the dashboard, your OS_PASSWORD is your password. 

    # source keystonerc_admin

Enable tab completion for the OpenStack client if you want to.

    # openstack complete &gt; openstack_complete.sh
    # source $!               # Sick Bash tricks!

Alright, enough fluff. Let's get to it. We're creating a public external network with a physical provider. *Public* means that every project can make use of this network, and *external* means that you can allocate floating IP addresses from this network to any server that one of the internal networks. The name `physnet` refers to the value that you entered in the PackStack answers file, and is the provider of the physical network.

    $ openstack network create public-network --share --external --default 
       --provider-network-type flat --provider-physical-network physnet

And finally, create a subnet in this external network. The settings have to match your LAN IP settings. Make sure that the DHCP settings don't overlap with whatever range you're using for static IP addresses.

    $ openstack subnet create public-subnet --dhcp 
       --subnet-range 172.16.0.0/24
       --allocation-pool start=172.16.0.20,end=172.16.0.254

     +-------------------+--------------------------------------+

And that should be it. Now you can create a router for every project, and connect the router to this public network. Be sure to open up ports in the security groups! You can assign ""public"" addresses from the public subnet to a server, and connect to the server with that IP from your workstation. Your servers will have access to the outside world as well.

Feel free to ask for clarification if you need any. I'm not an expert on OpenStack by any means, but maybe I can help."

5ekefr,1,2016-11-23,Econ Degree or Drop out (not as stupid as it sounds),econordropout,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ekefr/econ_degree_or_drop_out_not_as_stupid_as_it_sounds/,"Hey guys, I'm second year doing a BCS at University of Waterloo. I'm failing my math courses, I'm doing ok in my CS courses, and honestly, if I continue at this rate, I probably won't end up finishing my degree (its only going to get tougher...). However, I have 2 internships under my belt (for those unfamiliar, UW gives us 6 coops total), both at really big companies in Canada, and my next one will probably be in the US since I already had ~4 interviews with big names in cali but I suck at technical interviewing (I'm planning on spending next coop getting better at that).

I don't want to spend the next year or so failing out of CS. I have decided I should probably do one of the following:

1. Defer a year of school and find 3 coops during that year to do. This would put me at 4 coops total. During my 3rd coop, I would apply for full time jobs, and drop out completely. This seems like the safest and only way I will drop out completely. My only issue here is getting a H1B visa without a degree (how hard is this?). 

1. Switch into an Economics degree. I have 2 close friends both doing Economics (at UWaterloo) and the courses seem very interesting, much more interesting than math/CS courses. However, I really enjoy coding. The workload seems significantly lighter for econ and I would probably spend a ton of time on side projects. My only issue here is how hard would it be to find a developer job with an econ degree (specifically in the US) assuming I am just as good as the people with a BCS at web dev (what all my side projects are, as well as both coops).

Any insight would be awesome. Any other alternatives would be awesome. I know a lot of people will tell me to just stick through the BCS degree, etc, but idk if I can. I honestly feel like I will fail out. I honestly feel stupid compared to my peers when it comes to academics.

**TLDR: How hard is it to get a good CS job in the US with an econ degree? How hard is it to work at a US company full time without a degree?**"

I tried every possible ways to get an internship but no chance and that really puts me down.. I mean really down.. A month ago i had an interview with gdit (General Dynamics)  at my university and the interview went super well  because I even talk talked to guy who interviewed me later in the parking lot and even gave me he's email address and told me to email him whenever I have a question or apply to any open position which I did but never got a message back, and now I'm over this...

Later, got another interview with CSRS and the same thing happened but this time I was asked to go online and re-apply for a this position  and never heard back.. At this point I'm really out of it. I really need some help and tips. I applied to gov internships for the summer so for now I'll wait for a reply to see if I get accepted, but I don't wanna just seat and wait. I need some help and suggestions on what company I should applied to here in Baltimore or if anyone can share can share any kind f of tips just in case I get the bad news. "

1. Switch into an Economics degree. I have 2 close friends both doing Economics (at UWaterloo) and the courses seem very interesting, much more interesting than math/CS courses. However, I really enjoy coding. The workload seems significantly lighter for econ and I would probably spend a ton of time on side projects. My only issue here is how hard would it be to find a developer job with an econ degree (specifically in the US) assuming I am just as good as the people with a BCS at web dev (what all my side projects are, as well as both coops).

Any insight would be awesome. Any other alternatives would be awesome. I know a lot of people will tell me to just stick through the BCS degree, etc, but idk if I can. I honestly feel like I will fail out. I honestly feel stupid compared to my peers when it comes to academics.

**TLDR: How hard is it to get a good CS job in the US with an econ degree? How hard is it to work at a US company full time without a degree?**"

At this point in my education, I'm not sure if I'd rather go into industry or pursue graduate school after undergrad. I do feel that I am a very good fit for the product manager role in general (pretty good engineering skills + good people skills/big picture vision), but I haven't totally committed to the idea of giving up doing hard technical work/research. I have received an offer for a PM internship at pretty big (~500 employees) company that I am excited about, but I'm concerned that taking a PM internship (as opposed to a software engineering or research internship) might hurt my chances at grad school.

Also, my first loan payment is due December.

For months after graduating I've been trying to get internships and entry jobs in editorial and writing with no luck. With my grace period ending, I recently got a restaurant job in October last month. It's killing me. Literally, I've made a record of doctors visits and I've gotten stress related sicknesses so many times within the month I've been working. With the holidays coming up, they're going to work me to death now. I barely have time or energy to work on my portfolio these days.

I got the flu so I got a week of bedrest (Work chewed me out when I told them...), and while i'm resting I've taken time to start working on my writing and applying to places again. What sucks is most of the good ones are full time and I can't do it with the job I have now.

Ideally, I want to get a full-time editing job and quit my current job. I don't think I can juggle two part times because my health is deteriorating rapidly with just one of them.

Assuming a Christmas miracle happens and I get a job, my current work is gonna be pissed if I quit now since it's holiday season. What's the best way to quit in a polite but forward way? I started working around October 12th, and I know they're desperate and need me, but I think this job is way too unhealthy for me. 

P.S. I have anxiety, so I think that's another reason they take advantage of me (schedule-wise)."

5elpyr,33,2016-11-23,A Voice in the Water,TheGorillatamer,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5elpyr/a_voice_in_the_water/,"I've lived in the desert all of my life. Well, a city in the desert. Sunniest place on earth in fact. We get rain maybe once or twice a year, and when there is, people rarely leave their house just from the unfamiliarity.   The point is, this is is a really hot, really dry place. 

&amp;nbsp;
Last summer, I worked at a water park. The first this city ever had. Honestly, it seemed like a no-brainer to build a water park in literally the sunniest city on earth, but seeing how this place was run and how much water was used, it's no wonder why it isn't doing very well today. The job was relatively easy, and I got to work outside all summer. It was scorching hot even in the water and the shade. Luckily my position was at the top of one of the slides so I was under a shade and I could sit in the top of the slide when it was slow to cool off. I went through at least five or six water bottles during my shift to stave off the heat, but I did end the summer with a really sweat tan. I actually really enjoyed this job. 

&amp;nbsp;
The shifts were long from open to close. I was usually exhausted, and something about the chemical cocktail they put in the water felt heavy on my skin. I always went home straight to the shower.  This shower always felt amazing. The cool water seemed to stay on my skin well after the shower despite it not being humid at all, and I always enjoyed that.  

&amp;nbsp;
Following these showers I would play some video games and go to bed. This is where the weird stuff comes in. During the time I worked at the water park I had the same dream almost every night. It started with the sound of dripping water. Not like you would hear from a faucet, more like you would hear dropping off of someone when they get out of the pool. Then, I would feel myself floating in darkness. Not weightless, but floating nonetheless. Everything existed in shadows in the dream. I could make out parts of my room but it would shift suddenly, like jell-o or the ripples from Jurassic Park. After a bit, I could hear someone calling me. A siren-like voice, beautiful but with an underlying malevolence. I would wake up covered in sweat and late for work.

&amp;nbsp;
I didn't think much of it. It was just my brain reacting to the days of nothing but water and girls in bikinis at the park, I thought. I quit when school started again, and I never went back since I got a job somewhere else. Recently though, I took an internship in Washington and was exposed to rain on an almost daily basis. Maybe it's just that it reminds me of the park, but the dreams have come back more vivid than ever. In the darkness I can feel the voice now has a shape. A shadowy shape that I could not describe if I tried. I sometimes hear the voice when I'm awake now. It's stronger in the rain. Almost as if the voice carried in each drop. When I get out of the rain, my skin stays wet for hours and I find myself drinking more water than I ever did that summer. Walking barefoot through my apartment leaves wet footprints on the hardwood. I don't know what's happening to me. I don't know if there is something in the water. I don't know if this is something new or something that's been there since I was born. Maybe the desert just kept things dry? 

&amp;nbsp;
The only thing I do know, is that every time I walk out into the rain or drive near the ocean, I feel such a longing, almost a nostalgia, a loss. There's an opening for an internship out at sea for six months. I don't know if that would help or take me to a point of no return. But I think I have to know. "

Details,Upgrader01,Bones,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bones/comments/5elrov/season_12_final_details/,"So far, this is all the information that's known about Season 12. Information is taken [my previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bones/comments/5an5s9/spoilers_whats_set_to_happen_in_season_12/) on this, plus several new things!

**12.1 - The Hope in the Horror** -- Direct continuation of *The Nightmare within the Nightmare*. Directed by Emily Deschanel. Intern: Wendell

**12.2 - The Brain in the Bot** -- Intern: Daisy

**12.3 - The Old Tricks in the Old Dogs** -- Guest starring Ed Asner &amp; Hal Hallbrook. Intern: Arastoo

**12.4 - The Price for the Past** -- Intern: Jessica. So... about this episode... if you ask me, the title kinda hints that this is the episode that will deal with Aubrey's dad returning or something similar. Also, according to the showrunners, another ""big twist"" will happen this episode.

NOTE: According to TJ Thyne's Instagram, both Zack and Karen Delfs (the redhead behavioral analyst from three S11 episodes) will reappear in at least one of these first four episodes.

**12.5 - The Tutor in the Tussle** -- The intern for this episode is Fisher, and the title hints that he or his job will have something to do with the main plot.

**12.6 - The Flaw in the Saw** -- Intern: Rodolfo. The title makes me think about trees.

**12.7 - The Grief in the Girl** -- Intern: Clark. This is the episode where Sully returns.

**12.8 - The Scare in the Score** -- Intern: Arastoo. This might be Cam and Arastoo's wedding, but I honestly have no idea.

**12.9 - The Steal in the Wheels** -- From what I can gather, this is the Buck and Wanda episode, guest starring Stephen Fry and David Boreanaz's wife Jaime Bergman. (Intern: Rodolfo)

**12.10 - The Radioactive Panthers in the Party** -- Intern: Wendell. Betty White returns to Bones!

**12.11 - The Day in the Life** -- According to showrunner Michael Peterson, *the meaning of 447 will finally be revealed!* From what I can tell, the four ""main"" interns will all appear in this episode too. [As of 23/11, this is the episode currently being shot.]

**12.12 - The End in the End** -- Fitting title for the FINALE, huh? The only things known about it are that the Diner won't appear, and Stephen Nathan wrote the story. (No Hart Hanson though)"

Starting this semester, I have been living in a new house, along with two roommates and one other cat. I noticed after moving, she seemed to purr less that she used to in the old apartment. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was because I hadn't seen her in a few months (she stayed with my parents while I took an internship out of state). The other cat, though, does seem to kind of bother her. The other cat often messes with her when she tries to sleep, or picks small squabbles with her. Not real aggression, just more being annoying and playful (not on the same page as my cat).

Now, I'm back at my parents for thanksgiving with this cat, and she just seems happier than she does at my house. She's purring a lot and just super cuddly. We only just got here earlier today, so it might just be temporary, but what do you guys think?

If my roommates cat is making mine unhappy, do you have any suggestions?"

Any advice or insight would be much appreciated!


I got my bachelor's degree in Information Systems Management from a well known public state university in my area of the USA (not prestigious but well known throughout the state). I graduated last December but I stayed at my restaurant job I had worked during school for several years and have been looking actively for an entry level position since June. I was not able to do an internship during school. I have tried searching for internships after I graduated, but nearly all have being a currently enrolled student as the top requirement.


The main areas my major focused on were programming and database management/theory. I learned the basics of OOP, (C#, .NET, used MS Visual Studio) and SQL, as well as the fundamentals of a few other langugages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++ - as well as the basic principles of relational databases and normalization, etc. There were a couple networking courses but nothing of substance was taught.


Since beginning to search for entry level IT positions in June I have applied to hundreds, probably even thousands of jobs and have only been able to secure 2 in person interviews. At times I have been asked to speak on what projects I completed during my schooling, but there were none, only small assignments.


I use websites like Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice, CareerBuilder, Monster, Simplyhired and also check company websites directly. It seems that 95% of jobs that are labeled as ""entry level"" have 1-3 or sometimes as much as 5 years of experience required or prefered. Even if I had been able to do a couple of summer internships, this seemingly would still not satisfy the experience requirement for these so-called ""entry level"" positions. I do not use cover letters when applying due to the fact I have nothing relevant to include besides generic personal details. I am contacted by recruiters from staffing firms almost daily telling me about a certain position they have open that I might be a good fit for and I give them permission to send my resume, but never hear back.

I understand I am in a tough spot due to not having any professional experience, but is it really this bad? I am beginning to have serious doubts about whether I will be able to find a job in this field. At this point I think my best bet would be to focus on finding a support/helpdesk role rather than a database/developer role. Would you guys agree? I have had my resume looked at by the experts at my university career center and they approve - so I don't think my resume is an issue. Any and all advice would be appreciated! I envy you guys!"

How about we make sure its actually good if they do?

CHARACTERS:

- Marty McFly Jr - unknown new actor

- Watson Brown - Bill Hader 

- Tiffany - Elizabeth Banks

- Griffith Tannen - unknown new actor

- Doc Emmett Brown - Christopher Lloyd 

- Biff Tannen - Thomas F Wilson

- Marty McFly Senior - Michael J Fox

- Jennifer McFly - Elizabeth Shue

We start in BttF2 2015. Aftermath of Griff Tannen (new actor) getting arrested after smashing up the courthouse windows with his friends. The real Marty McFly Jr sees this and thinks all is well and good and stumbles on home... Until present day (2015's) Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) comes through time with the Delorean. He's distraught. He meant to fix things, but only ruined them. He tells Marty Jr that this version of 2015 will lead to a nuclear apocalypse in 2045, in most part, to a series of inventions from his own company, Doc Brown Enterprises. Doc wasn't around to see his company be run by its new CEO (due to hopping time shortly before the 80's ended) and in 2000, they made their first invention, the Food Dehydrator. They also made Hover technology, SmartClothes, self-lacing sneakers and the Mr Fusion. And the Mr Fusions will begin malfunctioning in 20 years, leading to a global disaster in 2045, ending the world. Their only hope is to go back to the year 2000, stop the future CEO of Doc Brown Enterprises, Tiffany Newton (Elizabeth Banks), and save 2015 from Hover and cold fusion technology so the world won't end in 2045! To risk damaging the timeline further, he needs Marty Jr to go on this task, not his father.

Suddenly, the person in question shows up, Tiffany Newton. She says she knows who Doc Emmett Brown is and what he plans to do, discontinue her company's inventions and bankrupt her. She pulls a gun on them and says she can't let that happen. She says how she has always loved science and vowed to one day change the world, but Doc has always had it out for her family, especially her father, and now, even her ""butthead"" of a son. That's right! Tiffany reveals her maiden name to be Tiff Tannen! Doc tries to reason with her but she won't listen, saying how she's finally escaped her family's legacy of being losers and won't let it happen again. Marty Jr fakes her out and makes her look away, and the two run to the Delorean. Marty Jr makes it in, but Doc gets shot in the back getting in. She shoots at the car, but Marty Jr drives off. Once they get close to a hospital, Marty Jr helps Doc out of the car to check on his wound. A dying Doc hands Marty Jr a tablet with an AI program of himself on it. He tells Marty Jr that he has to use the Delorean time machine go back to the year 2000, stop Tiff from joining Doc Brown Enterprises and make sure those inventions are never made, so that they can save the future! Marty gets ER personnel to help Doc from his gunshot wounds. Tiff, however, is watching them via a stealthy silent remote control drone with a camera. Tiff learns that Doc has access to time travel. She flies the drone into the back of the open car to stowaway. She starts programming some things into the drone computer.

Marty Jr uses the tablet and meets a Doc Brown AI, who will guide him on his quest. The AI says if all goes well, the 2015 Marty Jr returns to will be nothing like the one he knows, but future history will be saved and the McFlys will live a much better life, one where his father isn't an unemployed depressed failure. Marty prepares and gets ready to travel back to the year 2000 and takes the Delorean up to 88 mph to go back to Hill Valley 2000 (with a timeline and history just like ours). Marty gazes at 2000 era downtown Hill Valley (which looks as normal as anything else from 2000). The Doc AI says Doc Brown Enterprises were responsible for discontinuing mobile phones and shutting down the World Wide Web, but needs those decisions to be reversed if they plan on saving the world. Meanwhile, Tiff's drone cuts on and auto-pilots itself to her poor childhood home to meet the 20 year old super-genius Tiff. After the initial shock, young Tiffany is surprised to find the drone and intrigued to press the big red glowing power button on it. Once she does, it plays a video message on it, from her adult 35 year old self from the BttF2 2015. Adult Tiff has a warning to her 20 year old self, who was just awarded a college scholarship from Doc Brown Enterprises, the company she's always wanted to work for, considering her dad has some loose connections there to get her foot in the door.

Marty Jr will learn from the tablet that Emmett Brown has a nephew working at his company as a scientist, Watson Brown (Bill Hader). Marty eventually meets up with Watson and uses the tablet to convince him that they have to undo history to make sure none of the inventions they plan on creating come true, as they'll create a 2015 with no internet or cell phones, but more so, will end the world in 2045!

Meanwhile, Tiffany has enlisted help from her cranky unhappy car-wash-working father, Biff (Thomas F Wilson) who takes her side in believing a relative of the McFlys will ruin her future. Biff (1980s-2000s ""loser"" Biff) hates being the lackey to the successful McFly family and will do whatever he can to see them ruined, including embarrassing his boss' grandson, Marty Jr.

The entire rest of Act 2 will be Marty Jr and Watson Brown trying to sabotage Watson's own company of Doc Brown Enterprises in order to save the future, with Biff and Tiff following them and trying to hurt them or otherwise stop them from erasing the famous ""future invention prototypes"" from history.

Finally, the start of Act 3 has Marty Jr and Watson destroy the last invention prototype, the Mr Fusion cold reactor, convincing the company board that its too dangerous to sell to the public. After an empassioned speech, Marty Jr convinces the company chairmen to listen to them and not sell the product, after all. Instead, Marty Jr convinces them to invest in the world wide web and mobile phone technology instead.

Just when it seems like all is saved, Tiff and Biff follow Marty Jr and Watson, outside the company, back to the hiding spot of the Delorean, and knock them out by surprise. See, Tiff knew they would fail because everyone else in her family are losers, especially her father. So she intended to just take the Delorean instead and have all the time in the world to undo what Marty Jr did to her future as the one who would've headed these inventions into development. Tiff plans to work for Doc Brown Enterprises and reinvent all those inventions anyway. As Tiff and Biff try to figure out how the Delorean works, Marty Jr comes to and revives Watson. Marty Jr lures out Biff from the car to fight him, but Tiff doesn't take any chances and floors it. Marty Jr gets on his skateboard and takes a shortcut through the park as Tiff heads towards downtown Hill Valleys courthouse to hit 88 mph and travel back through time. Marty Jr manages to grab hold of the Delorean's door handle as Tiff hits 88 mph and travels back in time. Tiff realizes she's traveled back to 1985 (but the version Marty senior created in the first movie) as she didn't have time to program in a new date. 

Tiff gets out and wants to fight Marty Jr. He's reluctant, but has no choice. Marty Jr easily gets his ass kicked, however. But the fight stops when both see their 1985 parents, Marty Sr, George McFly, and cowardly Biff being their lackey. Once Marty Jr sees this, he understands how big of a loser Tiff's father has always been. Marty realizes from the Tannen's point of view, the McFly's are the jerks. Tiff, teary eyed, says she worked her entire life to escape the bad name of the Tannen family, and a kid and a time machine destroyed her future's legacy, anyway.

Now Marty Jr has a revelation none of the McFlys ever had until now: the Tannens have always lived awful lives full of abuse and neglect. Biff isn't an asshole for no reason. Marty Jr now realizes its not just the future of his family he has to save, but Tiffany's family of the Tannens, as well.

The two travel back to 2000, seconds after they left. Watson and Biff check on the two, but they've made amends. Marty Jr says the Tannens have had it pretty awful for generations, now. But they can fix this and don't need a time machine to do so. After talking to Marty Jr, Watson decides he'll hire Tiff on as an intern, after all, and hopes she'll do a good job in the next 15 years, as long as she promises not to greenlight those inventions which will destroy the world. Tiffany agrees, saying she's smart enough to come up with new ideas on her own. Biff says he's proud of his daughter and hopes she can break their legacy ""of being buttheads.""

Marty Jr gets back in the Delorean and returns to 2015. Only, its now the 2015 we all know of, with internet and smartphone technology, and no flying cars, smartclothes, or floating hoverboards. Marty Jr walks around modern 2015 downtown Hill Valley, which is sleek, gentrified and fancy, but realistic. Marty walks into Café 90's, but is greeted by a bully, a large black kid named Greg. He's also a cyberbully actually, mocking Marty Jr on Twitter and Facebook. But his mockery is stopped by another guy and his friends. It's actually Griffith Tannen, the 15 year old son of Tiff, better known as Griff. Him and his three friends are actually friends with Marty Jr. They're all intelligent, smart, and decent kids. They defend him against Greg, but they have to get to SAT practice, so leave afterwards, while Marty Jr makes an off-the-cuff remark, pissing off the new bully kid once more. He looks like he's going to hit him, even though Marty Jr says its 2015 and kids apparently don't resort to violence like this anymore. Greg says he's just old-fashioned then, and damages a café monitor trying to swing at Marty Jr, and Marty Jr is able to kick him in the balls and run out the 90's café.

This leads to a remake scene from BttF II where old Griff chased Marty Sr with the hoverboards. Only in our modern 2015 using our more primitive version of ""hoverboards"" (which many of the upper middle class kids can own in this affluent Hill Valley). The climax is when a car is able to pull out in front of Greg on the street, causing him to swerve, trip off his ""hoverboard"" and crash into the back of a manure truck. The police arrive to arrest Greg for the café damage and other property damage caused by him, as kids nearby take phone pics and Tweet the live reaction, which will eventually embarrass Greg online. The driver in the car turns out to be adult-aged Tiffany Tannen, CEO of Doc Brown Enterprises, who saved Marty Jr. She offers to give Marty Jr a ride home to Lyon Estates. 

Tiffany calls her son Griffith on her ""DocPhone"" brand smartphone and Marty Jr's best friend, and lets him know Marty Jr is okay and Greg got arrested. Griffith regrets leaving and didn't think Greg would be dumb enough to try violence on Marty Jr. Once home, Marty Jr sees his dad (Michael J Fox), his mom (Elizabeth Shue), the rest of his family, Biff, 2015 Watson Brown, and 2015 Emmett Brown enjoying dinner together. They were all worried about him. But Marty Jr is just glad to be back in the future.

The end."

Not to mention the physical side of things. It's not fun to talk about what was going on at home at that time, but things are soooooo much better now. 


I obviously couldn't tell my parents I got  the scholarship because I told my counselor everything they did to me, so I told them I had applied to be a Residential Assistant (RA). They believed it without hesitation. Told me it would do me good to ""grow up"" and ""help me learn to be a proper adult."" Which I can't help but laugh at since they forced me to wise up and grow up at a much younger age. Thanks mom and dad! 


Before I officially moved on campus this fall, I spent my summer doing a lot of self help and pushed myself to be more aware of my surroundings and the people around me. I was struggling with severe depression (now only mild, and still getting better). I had a problem with not realizing when I had overstayed my welcome, like in situations where friends took me in to save me from the nightmare that waited for me at home. I'm really lucky to have the friends I have. They pushed me forward by being strict and blunt and kicking me out of their safe haven. It led to quite a few nights spent trying to stay with other people on campus (sometimes on the floor of a classroom), but looking back, I'm so thankful they did it. We're all still great friends, closer than ever, and they know I appreciate all they've done for me. It helped push me to start my goal of healing myself and gaining a better sense of confidence in who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. 


I spent as much time as possible doing everything I could to be productive. Things as simple as going for a walk or as complex as learning French (yay for school sponsored RosettaStone!), everything helped me realize I could achieve anything I put my mind to. I felt more confident and more successful. My friends helped me stay out of the house as well, inviting me to events whenever my parents started getting rough. 


Currently, I am finishing up my third to last semester at my University, taking part in the Opera in the spring and having my senior recital next fall. I'm so close to graduating and hoping I can either apply to a graduate program outside of my state or get an internship at the opera house. The people at this school are pretty amazing. They've all heard about my hardships of working to stay in school while dealing with home issues, mental instability, and of my weekly counseling sessions. No one really knows the full extent of what goes on behind closed doors, but it's better to spare them the horror. 


I'd like to thank this community for telling me and convincing me to reach out for help. My school counselor is a life saver, and I owe who I am and where I am now to him and all of you guys. Thank you all for being so kind and compassionate and supportive. Every time I struggled this semester, I went back to my last post and read all the encouraging things you guys wrote, and it helped me remember how far I've come. 


I'm currently home for thanksgiving, but I feel like my parents know that I've changed, and that I won't put up with their crap anymore. There's been a few spats, but I've kept a level head and bit my tongue when I knew it wouldn't help if I spoke. Thankfully my wonderful grandfather is here to subdue the beasts that are my parents. Heaven knows what he would think if he witnessed how narcissistic they were!


If you're reading this and still struggling with you Nparents, reach out to your friends, your teachers, to the family that wants to see you do your best. There are people out there that love you and want to see you succeed and do well. I love this community. You guys rock! Thank you again!"

I have a few substantial personal projects but that is about it and I feel the lack of internship experience before I graduate worrying.

5emeqf,4,2016-11-24,"Offered an internship, but it feels weird.",3lRey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5emeqf/offered_an_internship_but_it_feels_weird/,"Hey all, 

So, after a while of looking I finally found an internship that seems pretty OK for what I want to do (I want to get my masters in Machine Learning) but to be frank it seems kind of unusual what they want and some aspects of the offer raise red flags. The official title makes me a ""Financial data intern"" mostly working with their database system (I guess the whole thing is built in C# and SQL.) During the interview, however, they said they wanted someone who would be there ""for a couple years as learning the system is very intense and takes a while.""    
    
Why have an internship position for ""a couple years?"" I'm only a sophomore and honestly do not plan on looking too many other places for work during the time period, but the whole thing kind of feels like just an underpaid junior position with a shitty title. I'm fine with that (to some degree) but if I do jump ship early, what are the consequences I'd be likely to be hit with? What are some of the pitfalls I'm not seeing? It sounds good to me to have a part time position offering 20+ as I'm in school and already have another shitty P/T job. My bills are gonna be paid and I'll be getting experience but I can't help feeling like there's something I'm missing.    
    
You guys seem to be grounded and have a reasonable expectation of the industry as a whole so any feedback would be appreciated."
5en0j8,10,2016-11-24,23/M/EU - Not sure where to go with my life; Would love to just talk and listen to others,Vitesze,MakeNewFriendsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/5en0j8/23meu_not_sure_where_to_go_with_my_life_would/,"I'm not really the person for lengthy reddit posts as I feel I can express myself far better in a one-on-one conversation, but I will make a short introduction of myself.

I've always been kind of a loner throughout my life, not because of actual social anxiety or anything, but rather because I never felt motivated to leave the door. People would occassionally invite me over to do stuff, and I was always more concerned about what could go wrong (me having to spend an afternoon being bored and people wondering why Im not a sociable chitchat and all) rather than what could go right. Anyway oddly, I was never really bothered by this. My life was going by smoothly, uneventful, and I was at peace with it.

But I am now becoming increasingly anxious about this situation and feeling motivation to change things around. I don't know how, but I want to. I have absolutely zero friends or people I talk to irl, I have some Steam friends but I wouldn't call that a social life.

My life is about to hit a critical point as I'm nearing my graduation, after which I, I dont know, hit a more permanent period in my life? College is THE time for meeting new people, having fond experiences with friends, and so on and I feel I missed out on that. In an ultimate attempt to break this routine I am in (as i truly fear living the rest of my life like this) I decided to go for a 6-month internship abroad (not sure yet where; possibly USA or Scotland) waaaaay out of my comfort zone, give it my 1000% to be sociable and active and see what will happen. I feel that the worst thing that can happen is that it won't work out, but to me that is less worse than never having tried to change things around and then being left wondering what life could have been.

Anyway, look at me saying how I am not the person to type lengthy posts, and then rambling on like this. What I am looking for right now, is some friends with whom I can chat regularly with. I figured out that although for me the barrier for talking with someone irl is big, through the internet I feel more at ease and can express my thoughts and feelings better. I do not care if you're male or female (in fact, given the fact all my close steam friends are male, it would be nice for a change to talk to a female about this) or age, though a person at a similar stage of his/her life would be better to relate to me, and vice versa. But don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for a one-way conversation; I also love just listening to people and what theyre doing in life. If you feel insecure or uncertain or whatever about things in your life, feel free to hit me up too! The last few weeks, I have been chatting a lot with an internet-friend of mine and the conversations had a good infuence on me, as in, feeling more motivation to change things around

Right now, Steam really is my go-to place right now for conversations: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053561597 Other ways of contact are possible, but Steam really has my preference as I'm online on it (and available for talks) almost always. I'm currently working on my thesis at home a lot, meaning I'm not commited much to scheduled things. I normally don't ignore a friend invitation/conversation starter, but please introduce yourself first in a Reddit PM so I know who you are :)

Die Tschechische und die Osteuropäische Filmwoche waren leider eher Retrospektiven und haben die besten aktuellen Filme nicht zeigen können. Zb ""It’s Not the Time of My Life/Ernelláék Farkaséknál"", ""Olga Hepnerova"", ""Córki dancingu/Sirenengesang"", ""Ilegitim"", ""Sierranevada"" oder ""Bacalaureat"", aber das liegt leider auch an den Kosten.  Dafür gab's die Svěrák's live, ""Son of Saul"", ""Lily Lane"", ""Mittagssonne"" und nochmal den besten Russen der letzten Jahrzehnte ""Der Geograf, der den Globus versoff"". Es gibt ja doch noch den populären russischen Film nach Balabanov und den Bodrov's, aber eher im alten Stil vom ""Fenster nach Paris"".

Wenn ich einmal eine Woche aussetze, wie zuletzt oder nächste Woche, dann weil nicht mehr als ein neuer guter Film kommt. Zur Zeit sind die meisten Neustarts eher ärgerlich, vor allem Hollywood und sogar die Festivalfilme, wie der Cannes Gewinner."
5en8yk,1,2016-11-24,Google Engineering Practicum as a sophomore?,passacaglia7,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/5en8yk/google_engineering_practicum_as_a_sophomore/,"I'm a female sophomore at a top-3 CS school, and I just got an offer from Google EP. I'm torn about whether to accept for several reasons. I'm unsure whether I want to pursue CS (was thinking about interning or doing research in a totally different field), so I haven't applied for many other technical internships. But I won't have much time to apply for other things before I need to respond to Google. The research/internship programs I'm considering applying to in my other field of interest have totally different timelines; I likely wouldn't hear back for months from now. Also, I'm unsure whether it looks bad to do Google EP as a rising junior instead of rising sophomore, since it's not the full-fledged SWE internship and the interview process is much easier (I didn't apply for SWE). Some of my guy friends have already made subtly disparaging comments. Finally, I want to specifically work in government tech and tech policy in the future, and I wonder if I should intern somewhere in this area next summer rather than Google. 

So I have a few questions if anyone has thoughts: 1) how many doors will Google open on a resume if I want to work in tech (but not engineering) in the future? 2) how much will this be diminished by the fact that I was not a full-fledged SWE intern?  and 3) if I were to apply and interview quickly for other internships and get an offer from, say, Lyft or Uber, would it be smart to choose that offer over a name like Google? 4) should the name and learning opportunities at Google outweigh the consideration of the specific field in tech I want to work in in the future?

Thank you so much, and sorry for the rambly question!"
5en9px,58,2016-11-24,Always Be Recording,ReddittFeist,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5en9px/always_be_recording/,"The theme of this post is that there are women out there who have realized what a powerful weapon they have in the form of being able to accuse men of rape, abuse, or domestic violence. And some of them are using it as a ""get out of jail free"" card.

I actually tried to talk a friend into recording his psycho STB-ex's attepts to have her brother &amp; dad beat him up, and her alienating his daughter. The guy was too much of a wuss and would ""never violate privacy."" She falsely accused him of abusing their daughter, got complete custody without having to prove her allegations, and got permission to move 800 miles away with her. He now is only allowed to see her twice a year, under supervision by some CPS pinhead, and he gets to facetime her every couple of weeks.

In a he-said/she-said case nowadays, a woman only has to allege something and a man can have his life wrecked.

A guy can only defend himself with documentatary evidence. You may hate it, but that's the double standard. Whatever changes in the system need to be made, that's not going to help you in the short term. In todays climate, you need to obtain the documentary evidence.

Story in the media: a guy in Florida gets engaged to a klepto girlfriend and finds out she's been stealing jewels from his place and shipping them to her dad.

So he calls off the wedding and sues her to get back the jewels, or at least the money if they've been fenced.

Girl calls the cops, shows them bruises on her face, and claims hes been battering her.

Now the guy is facing arrest and a criminal prosecution. Seems like she's turned the tables on him.

Bu no, he has tapes she didn't know about showing her hitting herself to get ""the batterd woman"" look.

His lawyer takes the evidence to cops and gets the charges dropped.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3763105/Millionaire-releases-surveillance-video-glamorous-ex-fiancee-beating-claiming-abused-vicious-divorce.html

You can see her antics here

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbd1VNPe6tg

Or here's another case:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op4scME3Ym4

In this case, a woman who was afraid cops might separate her from her kid went upstairs when the guy was being interviewed, bruised herself on the neck, then came down and accused him of battering her. Incompetent White Knight cops immediately arrest the guy instead of investigating properly.

Fortunately, as in the other case, the guy had video.

This has to become the new mantra for guys:

**The minute a woman shows even the slightest sign of craziness, makes a threat to call the cops on you, or expresses sympathy for women who make false accuations- ""start recording, and get away from her"".**

Guys may find the suggestions in this article helpful

______________________________________________

**Postscript**   monkey_typist has brought up the question of what guys are supposed to do when they live in ""two-party consent"" states (and countries) where laws say you are not supposed to record conversations without the consent of the other party.

Readers might find this interesting: California has the worst two-party consent rules in the country, but Mike Cernovich links to an example of a lawyer in San Francisco who literally saved his ass from jail by recording his sexual encounters. There's no question he would have gone to jail without the recordings. The guy was a lawyer, so there was no question he knew what he was doing was illegal under state law. But what's the prospect of a fine and some pobation compared to the possibility of having you life destroyed by being sentenced to 10 years in jail and being put on a public sexual offenders list?

http://www.dangerandplay.com/2011/09/21/how-to-avoid-a-false-rape-case/

FWIW, I've never heard of a person in California being successfully prosecuted for violating two-party consent when the evidence recorded has indicated a crime by the other party or exonerated an accused. YMMV.

You have been warned, though. Record, but in two-party consent states, keep what you've done **totally** secret and secure. If you do face a false accusation, and one or more of your recordings can exonerate you, you **have** to hire a lawyer, and **only** give the recordings to your lawyer. **He** must approach the police and prosecutor about the evidence.

In fact, even in 1-party consent states, keep the existence of your recordings totally secret. Did you notice that **in both the news stories above, the guys hired counsel and gave their recordings to their lawyers**, who handled the dealings with the legal system.

The guy in Texas was even a judge, but he didn't try to use the video evidence himself.

Why is this? Because police can sieze things from you if you present it by yourself. Video evidence has been wrecked when in police custody, either by nefarious design or by stupidity. 

If you give it to your lawyer it is protected by attorney-client privilege, and police almost never risk siezing things from lawyers. They are inviting a huge lawsuit if they do that.

And of course police can't sieze what they don't know about. To quote Gandalf, ""*Keep it secret, keep it safe*""

______________________________________________

And in the Holy Shit! Historical Category, does anyone remember a lady named Linda Tripp?

She recorded conversations with a young White House intern named Monica Lewinsky.

**Now** you know who we're talking about.

Well, Monica regarded Linda Tripp as a mother hen kind of figure and started baring her soul about what she was doing with then-president Bill Clinton.

Lewinsky said something that scared the living daylights out of Tripp. She said: ""*I don't want to end up like Caity.*"" 

Linda knew who Mary Caitrin Mahoney was, and what had happened to her. 

(Do a search on ""Mary Caitrin Mahoney Clintons"" if you'd like to know why Linda Tripp's blood froze when Monica said that to her)

Tripp sought advice, and her literary agent advised her that recording Monica's information and managing it so the Clintons and the DNC establishment know of its existence, but had no way to sieze it or access it, was the only way to ensure she stayed alive.

Tripp, her agent, and her team of lawyers all knew it was illegal to make the recordings under Maryland's two-party consent laws, but when the choice was between a possible fine and probation, or ending up like Caity Mahoney, the choice is obvious. What followed went down in history.

And for the record, Linda Tripp ended up not being prosecuted for making the recordings, in spite of intense pressure from DNC operatives and White House people.

http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/25/news/mn-33924

______________________________________________

**tl;dr** 

**Record** that shit. Even in two-party consent states. Be mature about it. Keep it totally secret and secure. If you need to use a recording, do it only through a lawyer with whom you have an attorney-client relationship.

5eo697,3,2016-11-24,Job proposition,Throwawayratio,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5eo697/job_proposition/,"Hello all,

I have recently received a job inquiry from a company I previously did an internship at. I will be finishing my studies in a year and half, and the company would be willing to hold the position for me. This however means that I would not be able to  to apply for other jobs of course if I reach an agreement with this company. 

From a financial standpoint I could probably make a higher salary with them compared to other companies across the US, but they are also located in Los Angeles, so the cost of living is higher than many places (I would assume). 

Reported starting salary is $150,000-180,000, plus 25% of production above a certain value (which I've been told by current employees is easy to achieve, and I was told I could ask and maybe obtain a higher base salary.)

The real shocking number will be my school loan debt which is $420,000 (I know, but I will be finishing 14 years of school by the time I'm done). 

Now I'm a guy of simple taste. Where I currently reside, I can live off $1000 a month and I'm happy with that, so I don't need much and plan to focus the majority of my salary on repaying school loans. 

So I guess my question is, should I ask for a higher base (I would also be completely happy with just a base salary and not make commission), and is it worth while potentially commuting now rather the. Wait it out another 6 months when I can start looking at more positions everywhere/anywhere (but then the company will not wait for me and search for other candidates, whereas now they would be willing to wait 1.5 years until I'm done with everything.)

Also, is it financially wise to invest lost of my paycheck in repaying my loans as fast as possible? Or should I consider investing? 

I hope this makes sense, please let me know if I can provide you any more information. 

I appreciate you all take the time to read my post and obviously any advice/suggestions!"

Company A asked me for expected salary and I have no idea how to even answer that. I also know that if company B offers me a job I would most likely accept if it was on a very specific team, otherwise I'm going to accept the offer from company A ASAP.

2 questions:

1. How can I make sure company A doesn't hate me for wanting to interview with company B? I just spoke to the recruiter and she didn't sound too enthusiastic.
2. How do I go about discussing salaries with Company A? I have never had to think about this, but I don't want to get the shorter end of the stick.

I'm graduating with a computer science degree, so I'm not worried about having trouble finding a job if I ever decide to leave the company I'm currently set up to work for. I worked as an intern for about 8 months this year and saved up plenty of money for this trip.

I'm looking to get a credit card to use overseas and to start building credit for when I'm graduated. I already have all the money I need for this trip and my dad has taught me how to manage my money pretty well. I have no plan on every getting credit card debt because I will use my credit card like a debit card. I want to start building credit because I will eventually want to buy a car and all that adult stuff. It seems like the best, first credit card is a Discover It card, but this doesn't fit my needs since I need something that will work anywhere, especially in Europe. Secondly, I probably need a card with no foreign transaction fees, which led me to the Capital One Journey student card. If you can think of a better card for please let me know.

So I graduated from college with a B.S. in Chemistry and a minor in Computer Science last spring and started working for a software company in San Francisco in September (I took a few months off between school and work to visit my family in Europe and also explore some countries I had not been to). My offer was $103k/yr salary with $10k signing bonus and no stock (private company). 

I was keeping up with interviews while working at that company in my spare time. In January I got an offer from a different company that I had wanted to work for while I was in college but was denied an internship and even full time job there multiple times. Of course, I happily accepted the offer and negotiated to $120k/yr, $35k signing bonus, and no stock (again, private company). So I started working there in late January.

Now it is November and I yet again have an offer on the table that it seems would be a shame to refuse. It's an offer for $132k/yr, $40k signing bonus, and $60k RSU. They told me that I have until December 17th to accept the offer. This company is also a very good company IMO and I would love to work there, but the only thing holding me back is the fact that I am unsure if it will affect me in the long run. In the future will companies find it strange that I worked full time for three different companies in a little over a year?

I definitely do not want to affect my future by switching jobs too often. If I go to this company then I will probably stay there for a while as they are starting to become very popular but their office is also very nice and relaxing, and the 6 hour workdays are a plus IMO. I just want to make sure it won't be a big deal having switched companies so much initially."

I'm a student currently attending the College of Staten Island for Computer Science and am currently looking for some related work.

I am open to offers, but currently looking for a Help Desk position, or Tech Support with an MSP or similiar. I'm willing to make my schedule work around the work schedule if required.

&amp;nbsp;

I have few years of experience working in help desk/tech support, including a positive work study internship at NYC Human Resources, few years managing equipment for a nationwide party planning company, and sometime with an MSP providing remote/field tech support for financial companies in NYC.

&amp;nbsp;

As for web design, I am currently learning vanilla JS, but understand HTML&amp;CSS throughly. I have the skills to make marketable web pages and do some minimal free lancing,and understand cms tools such as wordpress, but believe I should focus on JS meantime.

Please Feel free to comment or PM me if interested or if you've seen anything floating around I may be interested.

Maybe I just feel off, but lately I've been falling behind on my own chores, letting some dishes pile up in my room, and not leaving the house unless I absolutely need to, for work (which I'm having a great time at, with awesome new coworkers). Partially, it's because when I'm outside running errands, and it's cold and cloudy, I start getting sad/nostalgic. I miss the warmth and comfort of having my partner close to my side, and the fast approaching winter doesn't help. But I know these are all sort of like desert facades, in that, I don't ACTUALLY want my partner back, I'm just not used to my ex not being there yet.

I have to keep looking for a second job, volunteer events, internships, etc. and I have to be better about my food situation (I've only been eating one meal a day) and I know eventually I'll pick up the pace again, but really, I've been slacking off a little. I don't know if there's any way to shake off this newfound extreme laziness/wasting time. 

Can anyone else relate to the shut-in, lazy, not-so-productive phase post-break up? Because I'm gonna start doing my best to get out of it."

I'm looking for some advice regarding a decision I need to make. I was lucky enough to receive an offer for a 2017 Winter internship with Amazon and am now trying to decide which team I would like to work with. I have two options, and I'm not sure which would be better.

The first option is with Kindle Free Time in Seattle. I'm not really sure what kind of technologies they work with, but I know it's an established product/team and it would be at headquarters.

The second option is with a completely new team in Boston. The product is linked with AWS and I'd be working with Elastic Search, SQS/Kinesis, Dynamo DB and SWF. They described the team members in a way that sounded fast-paced and high-impact.

Right now I'm considering Boston more strongly mostly because of the location. I don't know anyone in Seattle (or the west coast) but I have a lot of friends in Boston. Boston is also closer to where I go to college, and I'd like to be able to visit my friends and girlfriend as often as possible. I also think working on a small team/new product would be an exciting experience, but I'm afraid that it may be a total flop.

What are your thoughts? Thanks!"

I'm majoring in CS and know Java, but what else should I be doing? I am familiar with Ruby on Rails and some C++, but I'm not entirely sure what direction I want to go in terms of development.  Do I learn mobile development? Do I just keep practicing with Java? 

Saw some posts about people with 2.0's getting six figures salaries so hopefully there is hope for me. Figured I should look for Spring internships(only have one internship experience) as well as jobs for when I graduate. But there's so many things I could do...so those with experience what should I be doing starting now? I have one semester before I'm out in the cold cold world. 

Reading the FAQ and googling people's personal stories atm, but if anybody has some recommendations that would be great.

I did a really stupid thing and went over my credit card limit. 100% of this situation is because I was foolish and I know that.

I got my first credit card this summer while I was working an internship. I needed the card for rent/transportation/groceries/etc because I didn't get my first paycheck until the third week. Fast-forward to midway through this school semester (I'm in my senior year in college) when my laptop died. I needed a new one fast so I bought one with my debit card with the money I made this summer. At this point I hadn't used the credit card since summer. I had acquired some debt but I was able to pay well over the monthly minimum so I thought I was okay.

The laptop expense plus some unexpected doctor appointments and prescriptions used up the money I made during the summer, money that I had hoped to make last until the beginning of the Spring semester for books. So I started using my credit card. And then kept using it. Instead of being frugal I did things like go to the movies, bought new clothes, and ate out with friends. Over the last two months I've managed to spend about $1500, which is about $300 over my limit.

I have no money at all right now. I work two minimum-wage jobs on campus but with the end of the semester and a break for Thanksgiving, I won't work enough hours to make enough to pay back my overage before it's due in two weeks. I am working on a plan to tackle the rest of my debt (working full-time during winter break and budgeting my next semester to the dime). But I don't know what to do right now.

 My parents can't afford to bail me out nor would I want them to. I know that I should call the credit card company but I don't know what to say or how to approach this at all. I looked into having my limit raised (just for this month then I would ask to have it lowered again) but since I make so little money right now, I wouldn't be a good (or even okay) candidate for a higher credit limit.

What should I do? I know this is my fault. I want to handle this as responsibly as I can.

Thank you in advance."

Reading about all the different IT career paths, ""System Analyst"" sounds like something I would enjoy doing,  but when I go ahead and read all the job requirements and experience they ask for,  I get extremely unmotivated.

I worked as a computer technician 5 years ago,  fixing computers for a small shop. Didn't learned much,  since I did the same stuff I did while building my rigs,  like system refreshes and Windows troubleshooting. 

Last year I took an ""internship"", on a big company. We where a small IT department and I was tasked with a deployment of new windows 7 machines around all the building.  I also didn't learned a lot of new IT skills,  but I had the opportunity to work on a professional environment and learnt how to deal with system users.

A lot of what's in there was acquired through gift cards from family. And when I actually had a job.

Also relevant, my battle tag is RyoutaMae#1929

I'm not terribly familiar with this sub so I'm not entirely sure how I should write out this request. I suppose I should start with a bit about myself.

**About me:**

I'm a college student (Computer Science Major) set to graduate some time next year around May. This past year has been a bit rougher than previous years since I haven't had a job this year unlike previous years and I don't exactly have time to find or work one with how difficult some of my classes are this term. I quit the first job I had during sophomore year to pursue an internship offered by a friend who works nearby (hint: It payed better). Unfortunately that place laid me off sometime around December. Not that I was particularly disheartened as it was only okay as a job, but I lost my source of income.

I won't really go into that much further since nobody really wants to hear a sob story about how I'm down on money. 

Now onto the game. I've been interested in this game for a bit but never actually thought it would be for me. I'm not particularly great at FPS games in general and I didn't know many friends that actually had the game. I actually had an opportunity to get this game earlier this year with a gift card that I had, but I decided to get a different game instead. Monster Hunter Generations. As a fan of the monster hunter series (having started with 3U borrowed from a friend), I thought it would be a better use of the gift card that I had. And to be fair, I did very much enjoy it. However, with monster hunter games, eventually after some hunded hours put into the game, your enjoyment runs dry, and my enjoyment of this game dried out faster than with previous MH titles, partially due to some of the design choices made for this particular iteration.

**Why I want this game:**

Honestly, up until this past weekend, I had completely forgotten about Overwatch, but then the free weekend happened and I decided I might as well check it out. And man I had a blast. First off, I found that I was actually somewhat decent at the game. Or at least better than most that start out that don't know how to counter a Bastion or any sniper and actually paying attention to whether the team has a healer or not. I played around with a bunch of characters, though there are still some that I didn't try out such as Soldier or Roadhog (I think I played Roadhog maybe once). The brawl modes were ridiculous and fun too, making you chose specific characters and other ridiculousness. 

And then I got to play with some of my friends who had gotten the game recently or were playing over the free weekend, and that was amazing. A learning experience with those who were clearly better than me, and just ridiculous fun otherwise in No Limits, where we were greeted by 5 Reinhardt shields coming up through an overhang. I was playing at the moment the free weekend ended and was fairly bummed I couldn't play another match.

**Why I can't get this game:**

I had heard about there possibly being a sale for the game this weekend, but I realize now that it's only for the Origins edition of the game, and while it does make it cheaper than the standard edition, I really don't have that kinda money right now. I have to stretch my budget to make sure I can pay for food for the rest of the term and the following term and pay off my bills as well.

So I'm putting this request out there, hoping possibly some kind soul would be willing to get this for me. It would really mean a lot of someone did.

TL;DR: I'm a por colleg student that wants to launch grenades at suits of armor with my friends, but I have to save money for a humane mouse trap to get this mouse out of the house.

Edit: You can contact me however you want if you do actually want to do this. Preferably through Steam or Reddit, as I'm not really ever on Battle.net since I don't really own any Blizzard games or play Hearthstone anymore.

2012: Graduated my BA in psychology, decided not to pursue Honors (necessary for a masters) because I thought I wanted to help people more directly and my psychology program was training me to be a researcher. Decide to see what the world holds for me with my new degree and seek a position to pay the bills while I try to get a feel for what I want in life. I find it impossible to find a job, even a minimum wage one, at full time and end up working a part time postion that pays $1 over minimum wage. It's enough for me to live with two friends in a basement appartment. 

2013: Spent the year working 2 part time jobs and getting volunteer hours to apply to the Bachelor of Social Work program (BSW) so I can be a social worker for the Canadian Military. This was a difficult time financially and I had to sell a lot of my stuff on amazon; namely my collection of books and video games. 

2014: Get rejected from BSW program. Have a minor existential crisis. Decide I don't want to work in mental health anymore and that it wasn't going to make me happy. I was only pursuing that career out of a sense of responsibility. Working first full time job at 24 (after quitting previous ones).

2015: Pursue CHRP (Certified Human Resources Professional) designation. Spend the year going to school part time and working full time.  I chose this field because It appeared to be growing, and the education was one year part time. Getting a CHRP would get me a one year paid internship. 

2016: Almost finished certification (just need to pass legal exam) but get promoted to manager position at work. My current job pays more than the internships/contract work I'd be facing for years as a CHRP, and there's a lot of room for upward mobility. Right now the plan is to keep my current career and use the CHRP as a backup in case I really hate my career or don't get promoted to a position I want. I'm 27 and make 30k a year.

A little background about me: I'm a Junior in college, about to start a couple internships in the spring and summer that should pay for next year's college (in-state school), but I have a dilemma about my car situation.  I currently have a 2000 Honda Accord with a rusted roof that has 230,000 miles on it that hasn't need any major repairs yet, but I'm not sure how much longer it will run.  It's a POS so if it needs a major repair, I'd just sell it and buy another cheap used car.  However, my dad is offering up his 2010 Toyota Camry SE with about 120,000 miles on it, and it is in great shape.  He is thinking about letting me have his car and pay him $200/month for the next 3 years, while he gets my car and buys a new one after selling mine.  In my opinion, $7200 isn't a lot to pay for a car that's in good shape and will continue to run for more than 3 years.

My question concerns how my summer income was taxed.

This past summer, I worked a summer internship in NYC where I earned a salary prorated from $85,000 a year to 65 days. 

For the paycheck every 15 days, I received $2,390.43. By my understanding, my salary for every 15 days should be $3,493.15. Therefore, I was taxed at just under 32%. 

I am a college student (in the U.S.) earning just under $30,000 on the year broken down into the following ways:

$15,400 from my internship taxed at 32% as shown above 
$2,500 relocation bonus taxed at 46% so I received $1,337
$10,000 signing bonus taxed at 42%, so I received $5,770
~$2,000 from miscellaneous work throughout the year 

Furthermore, while I worked and resided in NYC for the summer, my permanent residency is still Maryland.

I feel like my tax rate is too high, and likely what they tax their full-time employees earning 85,000 for the entire year. My question is the following: can anyone provide a rough estimate as to how much I am likely to receive as a tax rebate this coming spring? I understand that with only this information, an estimate would only be rough, but I am trying to figure out my finances to gauge how much I can contribute to my college tuition next semester. 

I have never before had a substantial enough income to have a potential rebate affect my finances, so I am out of my depth here. If there is any other information that would be helpful which I can provide, please request it and I will be happy to provide. Any help is appreciated. "

If you have a second, please advise.",iterationOne,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5euqzd/heavily_debating_a_career_change_to_cs_if_you/,"Hello everyone! I am 27 years old, and I have a bachelors in Fine Arts Education. I do not feel fulfilled woth my current job, and I have been considering a change to CS for about 2 years now, but I feel I can't make a decision until I hear from people in the field. I will be as concise as possible with this!

Why I want to:

1. I enjoy programming. I have been teaching myself C++ and even at the rudimental level, I love the logic of it.
2. I currently work 70+ hours a week and make 55k. I'd like to work closer to 50 hours, and make more.
3. I want to work in a field that challenges me mentally and creatively, more so than my current job.

Why I am apprehensive:

1. Beginning a new craft so late in the game is daunting. I feel like I'd be 8-10 years behind people my age.
2. It has been quite some time since I've taken a math course. I always had a high aptitude in math, but I feel very rusty. 
3. I have been reading on this sub and it seems that the salaries, job availability, and overall enjoyability of the field is not what I initially thought.

In conclusion, I feel like my previous degree and my years in the ""real world"" will give me an advantage when going back to school. I know how college works, and I know how important it is to get internships in school to be marketable upon graduation. 

HOWEVER: Am I naive? Am I idealizing the field? What the heck should I do? Any wisdom or insight would be enormously appreciated. Thanks for your time!

5eutkv,98,2016-11-25,I quit my shitty part time job just now!,Kaygarthedestroyer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5eutkv/i_quit_my_shitty_part_time_job_just_now/,"I quit my stupid job today and I thought I'd just vent here and validate myself because I feel a little bad. But also completely relived. 

It was one of those jobs that just made you dread going there everyday. I only worked 4 days before my mom passed away this month and I took two weeks off and came back.
My boss was such a weird dude and clearly an asshole but I figured he'd be maybe more sensitive since I was going through all that but of course, like most bosses, he continued to be an ass. 

This is the focal point of me quitting because he owns the place and no one else is ever there just me and him and maybe one other coworker. 

For example: 
He sat in his little office (this is a clothing boutique btw in a large city) and was on facebook the whole time. So I would have to greet customers and follow them around basically. They'd ask me questions that I didn't know the answer to (he purposely didn't tell me things because he wanted to ""handle"" it) so I HAD to ask him everything and it was just really weird for me and the customer, that I had to keep poking my head in and he never came out to greet them. 

He was so hard to talk to and would make funny jokes and I'd joke back and he wouldn't laugh or anything and just have a completely straight face. 

He would suck up to certain people that come in and then be an ass to other people that were being really nice to him. 

He was like obsessed with his dog that he brought in and would be playing with him while customers were there and he'd be short with them to get back to playing with his dog? He also would get weirdly visibly upset with people that didn't pet his dog, some lady called his dog the wrong name and he like, aggressively corrected her???  Idk 
That's just odd not really assholish.

As an asshole boss, he would for example say things like ""you don't ever need to straighten up the sale rack it will get messy anyways..."" to the next day saying ""you really think that looks acceptable?"" And make me straighten it up. 

He once yelled at me in front of customers about how messy the jewelry case was when I had just gotten back, like it was my fault? And I had to clean it while customers were there and I couldn't even interact with them. 


He would only give me 15 min lunch breaks and once made me get him his lunch which cut into my break so I didn't get to eat. 


I knew I worked weekends but it was never clear what days and what times and I had to ask him the day before. I once asked him if I was working till close and he just said no and kept doing what he was doing. So I just had no idea what time I was working till and I ended up being sent home an hour before close. Couldn't he have just said that???? 


The main thing that I really hated about that job though was the sales part. I've worked in retail before but never like this where you basically have to babysit the customer and follow them around. Now I'm definitely biased because I hate when stores do that but I really can't imagine that that kind of tactic is what gets people to buy stuff. I'd say it worked for about 1 out of every 8 customers. 

The one day that I really decided to quit was my last day last week when some dude came in and I asked him if he needed help but he said he was just occupying himself until his girlfriend meets him for lunch. Ok cool. So you literally don't need any help. Fine, I'll leave you alone. He ends up trying on a sweater so I give him a fitting room. 

I left him alone in there for maybe 3 mins and my other coworker asks how he's doing and he says it's too small yadda yadda might come back later yadda yadda explains the lunch thing and leaves. 

My boss calls me into the office to say that I lost that sale for him because I didn't ask that guy if he needed help (which I did). And how if I don't follow his instructions and I might not last at this job if I keep that up. He started raising his voice at me as I tried to explain my reasoning (dumb move, I know) and he just wasn't having it. 

So I felt really defeated and like he didn't respect me at all only cared about making sales and blamed me for something that was completely out of my hands. I was really good with customers for the rest of the day but that just wasn't satisfying in any way. I thought making him proud would make the job worthwhile but it wasn't and that's when I knew I needed to quit. 

As far as finding another job, I'm already doing an internship and my mom just passed so I have enough on my plate and my family has enough money to keep us afloat for now but I'm not really worried.  
Anyways.... just thought I'd vent because I quit via email and made the excuse about my mom and school work and I felt bad but I needed to get it off my chest. 

Has anyone else had any similar experiences with a shit part time job? 

TLDR;  boss was an asshole and I assessed that it was not worth it for my mental health and I decided to quit."

5evcjb,6,2016-11-25,"My boyfriend (27M) and I (24F) have been together for a year and a half, and we're going long-distance for almost 7 months. I want to sit down and talk about this big change before it happens - what should be on my list of things to address?",LDPrepping,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5evcjb/my_boyfriend_27m_and_i_24f_have_been_together_for/,"Thought about posting this in /r/longdistance but the sub seems to be mostly cute couple pics without much helpful advice.  I've gotten good advice here before, so here I am.

BF and I have been in a stupidly happy relationship for about a year and half now.  Due to our respective life circumstances we've been ""short distancing"" for much of it - we now live in different cities in the same state and typically manage to see each other 3-4 times a month.  Though I'd obviously like to see him more often, this arrangement has been fine and easy for the both of us.  We trust each other, we each feel fulfilled and independent in our own lives, our communication is good and the sex is fantastic.  We love each other very much.

He got a fantastic opportunity to go overseas for a half-year internship and he's obviously taking it.  I'm not overly worried about it, but I recognize that this will be a pretty big change for us.  This will be my first long distance relationship with anyone - in fact, I used to be categorically against doing long distance but he's the first person I've ever felt strongly enough about to commit to the extra work that long distance entails.  

I'm going travelling with family later this year, and he's going travelling with his family about a week after I leave.  I don't know if we'll see each other in person before he leaves for the internship in January, but regardless I'd like to sit down with him before I leave for my trip and talk some things out, just to clarify expectations and make some contingency plans for if things turn out to be more difficult than we're expecting.  

Some things already on my list:

* communication type and frequency: time zones will throw things off a bit, so we'll be relying mostly on longform written communication like email/Facebook messenger.  Frequency of Skype calls?  Are we comfortable getting a little dirty over Skype or save that for written word?  Committing to handwritten letters?  How do we feel about setting up a little schedule for care packages?

* visiting: who will have the time and availability to come visit?  How far ahead should we start planning?  If it turns out that neither of us will have much flexibility and we won't see each other at all for the next half-year, how do we compensate for the lack of physical intimacy?

* fighting: how are we each comfortable expressing concerns when talking it out in person isn't an option?  Is email too nervewracking to wait for, is Skype too uncanny?  How do we keep each other accountable to bring up problems as they occur instead of waiting for them to boil over the top?

* what happens if one of us gets tired: How do we calmly and respectfully discuss temptation, frustration, lack of intimacy, other issues that can send long distance relationships spiralling downward?  

We've had hard conversations before and we've always managed to keep things respectful, so I don't think this should be any different, but I do want to make sure all the right bases are covered before we set off on this very new, potentially difficult chapter of our relationship.  In a strange way I'm almost a little bit excited, because this will be an opportunity for us to express the love and respect we have for each other in new ways - I love the idea of old-fashioned letters, and the romantic in me is saying, ""There's nobody in the world except him I'd rather miss this much.""  But this is going to be the first thing in our relationship that will pose a significant challenge to either of us and I want to be ready.

To those who have been in or currently are in successful long distance relationships, is there anything I'm leaving out?  What are your tried and true little tips to help keep things loving and fun with hundreds or thousands of miles in between?

TL;DR: BF of a year and a half is going to another country for 6 months, we want to stay together through the distance and I'm trying to prepare myself for a very new dynamic.  What should we talk about before he leaves?"
5evjj2,3,2016-11-25,I'm in a rut in life and I don't know what to do. How should I Proceed?,wlxr,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5evjj2/im_in_a_rut_in_life_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"So I'm at a point in life where I don't know what to do. I'm going to summarize as best I can:

tldr: I've never made less than 25k a year, and now that I don't make enough money to put myself through school I don't know what to do. This isn't enough information to answer the question, but its the closest tldr I can make. I don't know if I should do the programming boot camp or if I should continue on with school.

At 19 I joined the Army, prior to that I was making 25k a year at walmart a job I had since I was 15. I put myself through some school while I was in the Army. I made about 40k (when counting for the food and housing that I got for free.) I got through about 30 college credits in this frame of time in psychology/philosophy.

At 23 I got out of the military, I supported myself with money I made while in the military until I found my first job. I continued my education during this frame of time up to about 74 college credits. I got a job working in the field in psych and fucking hated it. Job shadowing, and working directly with people who had MR. I made about 60k a year while doing this (lots of overtime...lots of it.) Due to family issues I simply couldn't stay in my home town. Its a long story, but lets just leave it at my family are pieces of shit (drug addicts, ect.) (Fun little side note I became bi-lingual while I was in the military...english and german)

At 25 I moved to a new city 3.5 hours away from my home town. I felt refreshed initially and enrolled in a new program. I quickly started suffering from depression for a variety of reasons, mostly family related. I was using the GI bill, and mostly depleted it during this frame of time. I applied to probably 30-40 jobs that all had ""Were hiring"" signs up in the windows. I couldn't even make it to the interview process, and when I did they asked me about why I moved most of them seemed shocked that I would walk away from a job paying 60k a year to get a new degree, and a new lease on life. I ended up living off of student loans and the GI bill for about 2 years. Depression was causing me to fail classes. I got nowhere in two years. The school I was going to literally took my depression and GI bill and an opportunity to just suck the money right out of me. I did get over my depression and thats how I got directly where I am now:

I wound up getting a dead-end job, but by this time it was too late. Had the same thing happened two years earlier I would be in a position to put myself through more school, despite running out of the GI Bill. The money wasn't enough to carry on with working, it couldn't even pay my bills, and the hours were horrendous. I ended up quitting to go back to school on a boat that I knew wouldn't make it to land (e.g. the GI Bill). I'm at a point where the GI bill won't take me to the end of my current degree (I need 56 credits. At best I can get 30.) I can't get a job paying me enough to matter (anything greater than 10 an hour. In this city minimum wage needs to be at least 15 an hour. And thats only if the standard of living doesn't increase) I found a programming boot camp  which touts that they ""Guarantee a job, after completion of a three month course."" I've read about it a bit and it sounds like bullshit. Lots of their alumni don't have jobs in the field of programming, or anything remotely IT related.

I'm at a point where I'm ready to give the fuck up. At every other turn in life (though I'm leaving it out) I've had an incredibly hard time. Harder than most. Just using family life as an example, I worked with a guy from a third world country while in the military and the descriptions of my home life were worse than some of the shit he's seen in a third world country by his own account. In the Army I was surrounded by people who all had severe anti-social problems, and an incompetent chain of command (e.g. The chain of command wouldn't take action when I had a guy in out unit threatening to kill me every day.) I feel like I've put in all this effort for no reason. That at the end of the day the ship I'm on is going to sink with me on it regardless of what I do. While to some extent this is my fault (Loans, ect.) its not completely my fault as I was depressed and had no one to help me when I initially became depressed. I've also had absolutely no mentors in life. Most of the lesson's I've learned I learned the hard way.

My girlfriend thinks I should stay in school, but I'm going to run out of money. The programming boot camp touts a lot, but after looking at their alumni, most of them *didn't* get a paying job, and those who did didn't get one in tech. They got a job working as an intern, or a job that wasn't in tech. They do have a few alumni there that did get tech jobs paying 40k as 'junior' programmers, but they have been in tech their entire life. 

I don't know what to do with myself at this point. I need these things out of a job so I can finish school:

A. A job that pays *at least* 12.5 an hour.

B. Provides me enough time at home to take 2 college courses at a time.

C. A way to do this with in the next 3 months.

As a total side note, I can see why a lot of these younger kids in school are freaking out on professors. They are supposed to be getting an education and they are trying to do that, but the school is just trying to do whatever it takes to get money out of them, education be damned."

I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Engineering and I'm interested in both hardware and software. At my school, we have a program where students go on these 6 month long paid internships called co-ops and I'm currently choosing between some offers that I've been given. 

For readability, I'm going to list the pros and cons out in bullet format

Company 1:
3d printing company / startup

* 30-60 min away, I'd have to get a car (which my parents are willing to help cover the cost of)

* I'd be doing a lot of hardware and software development and would be learning a lot and be exposed to a lot (electrical design, programming, circuit design, etc)

* pays via a monthly stipend, and comes out slightly less per month than company 2 (approximates to around 484 less per month)

* more open office space type of work, really well funded startup

* the people who interviewed me were very peculiar, didn't smile once during the interview and asked very ""weird"" / abstract questions 

Company 2: Well known research and development company that works with the government

* about 30 ish minutes away, can commute via subway which is really nice

* I'd be doing software testing essentially, writing code to test the test code and running lots of simulations

* pays a bit more than company 1 and also pays hourly 

* really nice area, cubicle sort of work

* interview was weird in the sense that they didn't really ask me any technical questions, but rather just about one of my experiences and spent most of the ""interview"" telling me about the company 

Essentially, I guess what it comes down to is that I have to choose between one job thats cool where I'd learn about hardware and software, both of which I am interested in, but is far away that I'd have to drive to every day (and I can probably carpool), versus a job that i can commute to via subway but might potentially be boring (software testing/simulation), but pays well and is in a nice area and I'd learn a lot about how good code is written.

If any of you have any input/perspective to offer, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!"

My several year long state of deep depression started in the middle of high school. My grades dropped dramatically, I started skipping classes and my obligations, and drowned myself in more drugs than I could have ever imagined. I became the laughing stock of my entire social group, taking on the role of the ""druggy who wouldn't amount to anything"". Somehow I was able to graduate and get accepted into a good undergrad program. Of course, I was still stuck in my previous mental state, almost getting kicked out of college and having no direction in life.

I managed to somehow pull myself out of that deep hole and rebuild myself. Since then, my GPA has skyrocketed, I've completed several reputable internships, and in a year I will be finishing up my engineering degree and pursuing higher education while employed. Of course, that will never be enough. Despite all my accomplishments, I am still viewed the same as I was during the climax of my struggles with mental issues.

I hate that despite having let go of my past and having made something of myself, I will never be treated or viewed the same as those who always had their shit together. I hate that they will never understand the pure turmoil I endured during my darkest days and how impossible it was to change anything at the time. I hate that I am still viewed as a weak, lazy idiot, and that every time I bring up an accomplishment I am quickly shut down because of my mistakes in the past. I thought it was over and could move on, but the only thing I've learned since then is that society expects perfection and that it's too late for me to prove anyone wrong, and that hurts so fucking much."

I've done what i was supposed to do and went to college. Graduated. Now i'm struggling with part time job after part time job to just afford rent. I had to move in with my brother. There's barely any money left over after bills so I can't save up. I keep applying places but they all want years and years of experience, which I could get if I were able to do any internships. But they're all either unpaid or pay even less than what I do now. 

Then our dad's health is failing and he keeps needing more and more help, which i'm trying not to get upset about because he's my dad, but it still is extremely stressful. His doctor mentioned maybe he shouldn't be living by himself, but if i move in with him, my brother won't be able to afford living by himself. And my dad is a hoarder and refuses to change and I just can't live like that. 

Then there's the fact I've been single for almost two years now. My depression just seems to keep getting worse and my self esteem is at an all time low. I can't seem to get up the courage to try and ask anyone out despite lying awake at night just wishing for someone to hold. I've tried dating sites and they never work. Nobody ever responds. I've even tried paying for one of the more official ones and still no luck. 

I just feel so lost and don't know how it's going to get better. "

I started programming at the age of 11, went to some competitions here and there and got into a high school where one of the main subjects is programming. Lately I was thinking of interning at some local IT company and I couldn't really find any that explicitly offer internships for high scholars, they are mostly for university students.  
Now here are my questions:  
  
 - What do companies expect you to know? Do you have to know , for example, C/C++ incredibly good to get an internship or do you need some mediocre knowledge?  
 - Do you need to have some kind of projects you worked on before in order for them to hire you, and if so which kinds are more desirable?  
 - Do companies actually have any incentive to hire high scholars as interns as we are a couple of years away from becoming full time workers they can profit from?

Also, I'd like to know if below listed topics we learned in school are useful:  
  
 - Backtracking  
 - Dynamic Programming  
 - Lists  
 - Binary trees  
 - Graphs  
  
Anyway, I'd appreciate any clarification on how interning works. Thank you for reading and I'm sorry if I made any grammatical mistakes as English is not my native language.

5ex65w,228,2016-11-25,"What did a medical student do to you that made you write outstanding evals for them? And, on the flip-side, horrendous evals?",TheDivineOne,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5ex65w/what_did_a_medical_student_do_to_you_that_made/,"Share your stories.

EDIT: I’ve decided to compile a guide based off professional responses on this thread. I think this guide will be very useful to future/current medical students like myself. I’ll continue editing as more responses come in. ~ /u/TheDivineOne 

**A Guide to Achieving Excellent Evaluations During Medical School and Beyond:**

* **Show up on time**

    **The most popular answer on this thread** and it needs no explanation. It is important that an MS shows respect for his/her peers, patients, and medical institution. Don’t waste people’s times. If you have some sort of medical/personal emergency just let your mentors know that you can’t show up and they’re most likely to understand. Be sure to reschedule your assignment if you don’t show up. Otherwise, don’t be late.


* **Be useful/proactive:**

    Read up on your shit, read articles and research, definitely read your patients’ charts if you have access, don’t just look on UpToDate, be somewhat familiar with your surroundings and environment. 

    Offer to help when appropriate (**this is a big one**). (Ex: “hello Dr. X, would you like me to help you with tasks X, Y, and Z? Let me know what expectations you have and how I can help you to the best of my ability.”)

    Ask questions when appropriate. Your residents and attendings signed up for a teaching-ternship so they know they are supposed to be here for you and willing to help you.

    Understand that some rotations rarely have lunch breaks, so prepare accordingly and bring a snack or two. If you have extra snacks, share em with the nurses and students! Giving food = receiving better evals.

* **Don’t be afraid to ask questions. *BE Curious***

    You are first and foremost a student, not a real doctor and not expected to know everything just yet. Ask for help. (Ex: “Morning Dr. X, I was really intrigued by the patient we saw yesterday who had [disease]. I went home and did some reading on the diagnosis and treatment for my presentation in my clinical studies class. I was wondering if you could review my project or if I could ask for your professional opinion on it?”)

    What doctors do is emotionally taxing, confusing, scary, and there is no reason for you to feel that you must be 100% competent 100% of the time. If you’re unsure about a patients status? Ask a nurse or intern. Don’t know what to do during a rotation? Ask a senior student, resident, attending, at the appropriate time. 

    Explore with your patients and mentors what drives you, what you like/dislike, and the kind of medicine they practice.

    Even if you dislike the rotation/specialty, at least be interested in learning. Know the patients in the rotation, their problems, their labs, have an idea of a plan, and see how it might relate to your field. (Ex: you might hate neurology but you have to understand and appreciate how neurology plays a part in surgery/obgyn/path, since you’ll sometimes get patients with neurological problems and it’s important to learn some of the basic neurological skills during your rotation).

    Are you suicidal/depressed? Get help as soon as possible. No occupation, even medicine, is ever worth losing your life.

* **Be clean; wear something professional.**

    Don’t wear anything you would be ashamed to wear around your grandparents. Don’t come into the hospital drunk, smelling like weed, high, wearing a miniskirt or a see through shirt, or like you just went to a party.

* **Manners**

    “Please”, “excuse me”, “sir or ma’am”, and “thank you’s” go a long way. Offer to get patients water or blanket when appropriate. Don’t talk about religion or politics. Smile, nod, and act professionally in front of your attending and residents. 

    Be kind to everyone, from your fellow peers, mentors, administrators, and even the medical instruments.

    Keep your sarcasm to yourself. If a mentor makes a friendly joke, be cool, and act as colleagues rather than buddies.

    Don’t say “ewww that’s so gross” or “holy crap this patient’s dick is super tiny”
    Don’t bitch or complain, you’re here to learn.

* **Don’t look down on nurses, patients, or other students**


    Don’t speak about your patients’ experiences and motivations like you  know them because chances are you’re still very inexperienced and it will come off as cocky (ex: don’t tell your depressed patient that he/she needs to get some sunshine “in your experience”).

    *Be kind to nurses. They will make your medical school experience very hard or easy* depending on how you treat them. They are part of our healthcare team and probably know more than you do.

    Don’t talk shit about other students, patients, or workers.

    Being an “ivy-leaguer” does not give you permission to be a dick.


* **Have situational and self-awareness**


    It’s okay to ask questions, but sometimes it’s not the right time (ex: when someone is coding).

    Know when to STFU; be conscientious.

    Walk to the side of the hallways not in the middle; make space for codes and emergencies.

    Understand that as a MS you are part of the team, but not part of the gang. You leave in a month and these residents have been here for a year or more, so understand that you still need to walk the line of professionalism and personableness. 


* **Don’t lie**


    If you didn’t do it then you didn’t do it.

    Saying “I don’t know but I can try to find out for you” is an acceptable answer.

    If you hate this specialty and/or have no interest in matching this field don’t lie and say “omg im having a medical relevation and want to match this specialty” just so you can get higher evals—it won’t work and people can see through it.


**Rotation-specific advice:**

***In general:*** know the patients, labs, images, history, vitals, nursing notes, consults, etc.. Write it down and have it available if someone asks.

**Pediatrics:** be as nice as you can to the kids and parents. Offer them some toys, chairs, blankets, a sticker. 

**Ob/gyn:** be around, aware, and prepared— babies pop out randomly in general. Try not to miss out on all the deliveries sleeping on their call

**Internal Med:** show up, be interested, learn your patients’ H&amp;P if you have access. Get out of people’s ways

**Surgery:** like all the advice, be eager, curious, and grateful to retract. Retract is what many interns have to do so it’s good that you learn. Figure out what matierals you need to do the dressing change and gather it ahead of time.

**Anesthesiology:** similar to surgery advice but also show up during anesthesia time. If the patient is already asleep by the time you come in, then you've probably missed a lot of the good stuff. Don't be afraid to ask nurses for help.

**Psychiatry:** be respectful and watch what you say. Your words can trigger patients or disrespect the service. Psychiatry is a sensitive area with a lot of vulnerable people.

**Family:** basically a summary of all the rotation-specific advice

**Emergency Medicine:** arrive early (15 min is on time). Be eager, volunteer, don’t expect to actually do anything. Only leave when the resident leaves unless otherwise told.
 
**Neurology:** same as above.


**Pro-tips:**

Evaluations are no doubt subjective. Sometimes your resident or mentor will have a terrible day and you just happen to be the unfortunate student who has to take the lash. The best thing you can do is just follow these guidelines and be prepared. It is surprisingly shocking to fail in medical school once you pass your exams and boards, so don’t be too nervous— it is alright to make mistakes. Do your best, be curious, ask questions, have manners, etc. As a student, you are still learning the ins and outs of medicine, so you are not expected to be perfect. However, since you did get into medical school after all, you have to have a bit of competency, preparedness, and professionalism (ex: don’t smell like weed in the hospital). To conclude, do your best, be normal, caring, communicate, learn, and have fun in your rotations. After all, medicine is being more integrative and inter-connected, so it helps tremendously to understand and appreciate what each specialty does.

5exeu3,3,2016-11-25,20F; don't know if I am ace or if it is a temporary reaction to negative experiences? (Very long),alsocontainsdirect,asexuality,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/5exeu3/20f_dont_know_if_i_am_ace_or_if_it_is_a_temporary/,"I'm a 20 year old woman currently in college. For much of my life, from about 12 until very recently, I have had romantic crushes - many were quite intense. Like cliche butterflies, weak-in-the-knees type crushes. I've also been interested in sex and began masturbating at around 14. 


However, I've also been incredibly inexperienced sexually and romantically throughout my adolescence. I did not have my first kiss until this past September (age 20.) I had a pretty intense crush on a male friend from my summer internship and I decided to ask him out. On our date, we ended up hooking up (non-PIV sexual activities) and it was probably one of the most bizarre and unexciting experiences of my life. I felt nothing when he kissed me. I felt nothing when he touched me. I felt nothing when he went down on me. Everything just felt so mechanical and cold. He was far more experienced than me and he seemed to know exactly what he was doing.

I felt as though I was coerced through parts of it which made everything pretty traumatizing in hindsight (couldn't eat for a week afterwards, stayed in bed sleeping 18+ hours a day, alternated between not being able to speak to anyone to just crying whenever I was alone.) I eventually stopped talking to him (blocked his number and cut off all contact) because he would only reach out to me to try to hook-up again; he was obsessed with my virginity and really wanted to ""take it"" as though it were some sort of trophy (since I declined his attempts at PIV the first time.)

I thought I knew the sort of person he was when I asked him out but I was completely wrong; he proved himself to be extremely manipulative and didn't care about me or my emotions (I told him that I had serious regrets and grievances about our encounter and he basically ignored it, and went on to suggest that we meet up again for sex.) He didn't show me an iota of respect and it really hurt me on multiple levels. 

I have since lost all interest in the prospect of pursuing anything romantic. A male friend of mine (who I have had a crush on for 2+ years) asked me out a few weeks ago and we have since been on four dates. I think he is handsome and he is very funny and very sweet. He seems to be the complete opposite of the internship guy. The most we've done is kissed, and even then he asks me beforehand and it is always just a peck on the lips. I feel really safe around him and he seems to really care about me. I talk to him 24/7 about everything and I am completely at ease in all of our conversations.

However, I feel no real romantic or sexual attraction to him, despite the fact that just a few months ago, my face would burn up if we were ever just alone together in a room. Now, our dates just feel like outings with a good friend. When he asks to kiss me, I kiss him but I don't feel anything at all, just the physical feeling of pressing my lips against his. He slipped his hand into mine while we were walking around a park a few days ago and it didn't excite or interest me in the slightest. I don't have any NC-17 fantasies about him. I don't even really react to the idea of him being my boyfriend, even though it was something I used to dream about. 

My previous crush on him used to be so obvious that our mutual friends would joke about us getting married. The fact that these emotions vanished immediately (and completely) after the ""date"" with the other guy a couple months back is really concerning. 

I don't know if this is a temporary state or if the negative sexual encounter was sort of a catalyst that revealed my genuine disposition towards sex and romance. I feel like I am mostly recovered from what happened back in September, but I could be harboring some stuff subconsciously that's holding me back - I'm not sure.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  "

She told me that her grad courses were in full swing immediately after her internship where we work got out.

I told her that I had something to get off my chest. She turned away, visibly occupying herself for an awkward minute before turning back again saying ""I would, but I just can't"".

Taking this as a cue to leave an awkward situation of my own making I went to leave. Then, she stopped me, again, reiterating the same thing. I assured her it was okay and she drew me BACK in talking about my sub schedule. Left when the buses arrived.

It was my intention to admit to her that I had a massive crush on her since meeting her at the thesis presentation week last spring. I am almost certain she knows.

So, my sister says she thinks that the girl was trying to get me to spit it out.

My question is, does this seem like trying to let me down easy? I've never actually not hidden my attraction before so I don't know what rejection looks like."

I am in the final processes of interviewing with Cloudera, and since I have a deadline very soon, upon receiving the offer, I wouldn't have much time to make a decision, so I want to know what I'm going to do in case I get the offer.

Cloudera is located in Palo Alto, and Optum is located in Schaumburg, Illinois. While Cloudera, I would assume, is the more prestigious company to work for, I have a very heavy preference to be in Optum's location for personal reasons. 

I am currently a freshman, and this will be my second internship -- my first one is at Capital One this spring. So my question is, is Cloudera worth going across the country for, and forgoing other personal preferences as well (long-distance with girlfriend, as opposed to being very close)?

My main concern about my decision, while I'm sure I will learn plenty from either of these companies, and while this may not be the most noble reason, is what is the difference each would make on my resume -- and would Capital One + either be enough come sophomore year to get interviews at big tech companies?

If Capital One and Optum is enough to get interviews at great companies, I would likely go with Optum.

Other than that I can't really find anything online that directly explains what the team does. Well, nothing that I have any experience in.

Where can I go from here?,smp501,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5expz8/got_teaching_credential_immediately_after/,"Background: I graduated in 2014 with a BS in mechanical engineering and a 3.6 GPA. I also did a 1-year co-op with a manufacturing company during that time. I only went into engineering because I was top of my class and great at math and science (and my dad is an engineer). I honestly hated every minute of it (including the co-op), but didn't change majors because I had a scholarship and I didn't want to be a ""quitter"" (I know, stupid immature bullshit). Immediately after graduating I enrolled in a 1-year master's program to get a teaching credential. It came with a scholarship that requires me to teach public school for two years or else it becomes a loan. Sounds great, right?

Now I'm seriously beginning to think I fucked up big time. I really enjoyed student teaching and there are aspects of my job that I love, but I can't see myself doing this for long at all. Here's my analysis:

* Things I like about teaching - working with high school students who want to learn. I teach high and low level math and a career/internship class. I love helping students find their passion and seeing them grow. The fact that I am around people. In my engineering internship, I was either at a cubicle fighting AutoCAD/MS Excel or working with cold, dead machines all day everyday. I was still immature and had not really started ""coming out of my shell"" during this time, so I had this juvenile idea that ""I don't need other people to be happy"" (I was also really depressed - something that left me when I left engineering). I don't mind the administrative stuff either. I actually kind of like balancing schedules, planning events, having hard deadlines to work with. I like the theory behind education, working with and analyzing data. I like reading up on the latest trends in education and trying (with what little say I actually have) to implement it. I love working with big systems with lots of moving parts and trying to figure out how to make it work better. I am also a decent public speaker and I have no problem presenting to large, medium, and small groups.

* What I don't mind about teaching - long hours. Other than my internship (where I clocked out at 5:00 exactly), I haven't really ever not worked 50+ hours per week. I currently go in an hour early and stay til around 6 every day, just because those outside hours are quiet and let me actually get shit done. I'll stay as late as I need to but I do everything I can to not bring stuff home. I don't mind working with (most) parents, dealing with (most) administrators, etc. We are encouraged to take kids on a lot of field trips, so I have to make a lot of cold contacts with people to try to set things up. I have no problem doing this.

* What I don't like about teaching - Grading. curriculum planning (our school decided to try a new teaching model, but does not have any real curriculum material available to us so we have to make it up ourselves). The content. Honestly I teach math simply because I had enough math credits and anything else would have added a year to my credential program. I don't have the love of math that my colleagues do. I got into teaching to teach students, not because I am some kind of math wizard. Shitty students who have no intention of learning, have never been taught respect, and whose grades I am responsible for. As a lifelong high achiever in school, not doing the work was never an option. I took plenty of classes I hated but I always had to try. I have kids who have grades in the single digits because they turn nothing in and miss class left and right. I have a ""you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink"" attitude. I hate to waste time dealing with those that refuse to learn because I feel like I am stealing time from those who do.

Despite all of the ""don't likes,"" I think I could put up with it except for one thing - the salary. I make shit money - less than I did as an engineering co-op (i.e. no degree). There are teachers in my building who tell me that their paycheck has actually shrunk in the last 5 years (not to mention teachers in neighboring districts were frozen on the same step for several years, shrinking their income even more). I mentioned earlier that I don't mind the long hours. However, when my take home pay comes out to about $10/hour, I really start to mind (current gross is $38k).

I am about to get married (to another teacher), and the reality of it all is hitting me like a ton of bricks. A colleague of mine was supposed to come back from maternity leave this month, but she had complications and may have to take the rest of the year. The reality of this is that if my bride-to-be ends up in the same situation, I honestly don't think I will be able to support her and a newborn. This horrifies me. My own family has to come first.

At this point I am definitely going to finish out this year and next year (I have about 25k in debt and I don't want to add another 15), but that might be it. Considering what I like and dislike about this job and my last, I am thinking that some type of business position might be better for me. I like data and numbers, but I like working with people, mentoring, and leading too.

I'm only 25 and I know that it's far from too late to change careers again, but this time I don't want to dump money into a 3rd degree to find out if I like it. People have mentioned using an MBA to get out of teaching, but I would much rather spend some time in the business world first. I would like to eventually go into some kind of management position, but I know that I need to get some more experience first. Since I am already working really long hours for a shit salary, I figure most entry-level jobs would be comparable to start, but would actually provide avenues for advancement. I have no idea where to start though. Any guidance would be much appreciated.

5eypr8,12,2016-11-26,I've never wanted a relationship with my father.,foolishmunkey,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/5eypr8/ive_never_wanted_a_relationship_with_my_father/,"TL;DR: Father was an ass, called him out on it. He's changing for the better, but I don't want him my life anymore.

To pepper in some context, I'm a 30 year old black guy who has a drunk as a father and a religious zealot as a mother. My brother died six years ago after a drug deal went wrong. He was murdered in his home after selling drugs to a guy who was fleeing the law from another state. I'm gonna draw some more context so you can understand things a bit better. 


So about six weeks ago, I had a verbal bout with my dad. Normally, I come over on Sundays to just visit and try to catch up. I work nights and I'm not a day time kinda guy and I'm pretty much a loner for the most part. I work at the hospital btw. So I talk about the stress about working there and how it sucks that the majority of people who end up there are there because of poor choices in their life. 


My father, being drunk from his morning, noon, and afternoon tonic, begins to bitch at me about getting healthy because he wants grandchildren. I tell him that he needs to be healthy for him, being healthy for someone else is asinine. As a snide asshole that has to deal with people like him who make poor life choices nearly a daily basis, I have no sympathy. I say this in a contrite fashion and with a punctuated fuck you without saying it. This rolls into a 'fuck you and you can get out of my house if you don't like what I say.'


 Now this isn't new. I've heard it all my life. From the time I was nine begging him to come to open house at school to when I twenty-six graduating from university. He was always drunk, loud, and selfish about the moment not being about him. Never wanted to be a part of anyone else's life, but wanted people to serenade him into thinking he was a good person. 


So now we have this pregnant silence in the room. A man who has spent the last forty years of his life drinking, fucking outside of marriage, blaspheming G-d, and abusing his familly on the verbal and physical level is spouting the same bullshit and wanting me to leave because I disagreed with him. My mom chimes in with just saying she was curious about my job, but she really wants him to hear this because he drinks excessively and doesn't care for his health at all. He yells at her and tells her to leave too if she doesn't like his words. 


Mom is two years from sixty and has been working at her job for nearly forty years. She doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon nor does she care about my father's exploits. So she responds with, 'I'm not going anywhere because I work and I don't see it making sense for me to leave if I'm paying the bills and facilitating the majority of the money'. 


Another pregnant pause and he begins yelling about having to do all the house work and having no one calling him and how his only son doesn't want to talk to him on a daily basis. I tell him that I work at night and I'm a loner and I barely have any friends to begin with and that every day off is a errand day because we have one car and my wife doesn't have a license. He than insults me being a bad son and not caring for his father as much. I try to rationally tell him I don't have time to baby a grown man that drinks all day and doesn't want to seek counseling or some kinda spiritual help for himself and he calls me a bitch. 


Now, at this time when I snap. I don't know if it was mom nagging at me trying to get my dad off booze or my brother off drugs, or my wife telling me to stop complaining about my dad, or my dad just calling me a bitch. I was just sick of it. 


So I let him have it.


For all the bad memories I had stored inside, I let them bleed out. I cut him off, I slapped shit out of his hands, and pointed at him for being the main reason why I'm a fucking loner, pathetic piece of shit. I tell him being hurt made be reclusive and never want to seek a permanent friendship with anyone other than my wife. Ironically, he tells me this is why I haven't found a job after graduating and I won't amount to shit other than a 'woulda, coulda, shoulda kinda nigga' and I blow back by saying 'What kinda of shit is that tell your son? Your son that never asked for a cent from you for school. Your son who woke up everyday to go to school and work at the same time. Late nights at the library studying to pass exams and driving an hour to an internship that was shit. So chasing ass and drinking would have suited me better?' 


This fucker begins to laugh at me. At the time, he laughed my accomplishments, my effort, my dreams, my life I created despite having virtually no father to help me through the rough times. I have to be honest, I cried. I never felt worst. As a grown ass man it was like someone stole my joy and pride all at the same time. Avoiding drugs, police, or being killed at a young age wasn't good enough for this piece of shit. Not buying into the bullshit like other black kids do nowadays wasn't good enough.  Working at the same place since I was 18 and climbing up the ranks weren't good enough. Being able to move out and afford a place on my own since I was 23 was not good enough. 


He just laughed. 


He just laughed as a way to polish his ego. With a burning throat I told him to go fuck himself. That he was the reason my brother turned to drugs. That I turned away from him. Why all his friends used him and never stayed around to help him. Why his wife would rather be a church helping dumb ass children learn not to be like their parents than be at home. Why should rather work until they lay off instead of being a home.  That his drinking will lead him to a long death. Not a 'switch' off moment, but liver failure that turns into a long decline of pain and agony. 


Looking back at it now, it was the best advice he's heard. He tried to cry and hug me and I told him I didn't need his love or sympathy. He forced a hug and wanted me to not so angry, but I didn't hug back. I didn't need him looking out for me for a job because if my effort wasn't good enough what good would his be. By the end of the bout, I just stood there covered in sweat and tired. He was crying and trying to be a supportive father now, but where was he when I was a kid. Where was this emotional man when I was going through dark times in my life. He was partying wasting his check while I turned to strangers for help. 


I consider my life a series of dumb lucks smashed in with effort. The strangers I knew provided me with unselfish means of help. They treated me life family and respected me as a person. Through all my dark times, the sum of my experience has led me to be the person I am today. 


I call as often as before, I ask what's going on and there's a shock of pain when he hears my voice or sees me. He blurts out, 'Oh I stopped drinking since we had that talk.' I don't care. 'Hey you want to hang out and watch the game?' I tell him I have things to do. I want him to feel the same neglect he gave me all my life. For a man that was present, he wasn't. He was father by definition but not by act.


 I think about my brother now though. I remember getting the same energy in the past and he told me to not do it. He told me telling him the truth would blow up his heart and kill him from the inside. I still do not care. I come over and he tries to be funny despite all the years of fighting and the 'talk', but I just shrug it off. I know I'm wrong, but I let him be a anchor too much in my life. I keep trying to be a good son because of his stupid brother and his actions, but I realized I did nothing wrong to him at all. That my effort to elevate the name and remove this curse on the family was wasted on him. I wasn't being selfish. 

So I feel remorse and guilt over saying it. Not because of the pain I caused him. Because he thinks this is a window for me and him to get along and talk and become buddies. Every time I think of that, I remember him laughing at me for being a decent person and it motivates me to hate him more. "

We both go to the same university and started like most couples nowadays with casually hooking up. But after a little while we got together properly. When we originally started dating it was/felt like one of those montages from a romcom. I mean we were head over heels in love. I remember we first said I love you to each other after about 3 weeks into the relationship. I'd never been in a relationship before and I honestly thought that this was going to be my last. We were only together for about a month until summer came and she left for an internship thousands of miles away and I stayed here for the summer. We agreed to do long distance over the summer, and we did. However I did begin to get quite severe trust issues with her during this time. I think a lot of that stems from my insecurities, because I know deep down she isn't the type of girl to cheat, but it certainly caused a bit of a rift between us. Regardless of this, we got through the summer and started the newest school year feeling stronger than ever. We even met each other's moms. 

Then one day early in the school year we went out to dinner, had a great evening together, and then went over to a friend's party. I got drunk and I saw this guy I hate who she used to hook up with. All of a sudden I got really angry and left, dragging her behind. We went back to my place and I exploded on her, calling her stupid, a whore, telling her I never trusted her. Things, little things, which had bothered me from the beginning of the relationship all burst out in a bout of anger I honestly didn't even know I had in me. She ran away crying and texted me breaking up with me. 

Since this happened about 3 months ago we've had a really unstable on and off relationship. We'll get together for a week, then break up for a couple days, then get back together. This cycle has literally repeated an absurd amount of times. I feel like we shouldn't be together but that I can't breathe without her. I feel lonely and worthless without her, but with her I feel angry and paranoid. When we're good together things feel like heaven. But when things are bad they're really bad. The relationship has become something which has really rocked me to my core psychologically and I feel like the last 3 months have really messed us up a lot. However, the past 3-4 weeks we have been together pretty sturdily. I'm still very upset about the fact she slept with other people while we were broken up as we were never broken up for very long, and she still feels like I think she's a whore. But honestly things were getting easier and feeling better. 

This brings me to the past week. I was supposed to go home with her to thanksgiving, and, quite frankly, I didn't want to. But I'm always a bit bad at letting people down and feel awkward doing so, so I did pretend I was going to until a couple of days before. She immediately broke it off with me only to call me a couple hours later to get back together. The next day, she guilted me into coming for a little but I backed down and she broke up with me again for a couple of hours. She was extremely harsh this time, texting me that she didn't care about me and that I didn't matter to her. After we got back together again I've felt odd and I've kinda realized that this is very unhealthy. I want to split up with her, but like I said I feel like I can't breathe without her and I'm really lonely. Furthermore, today she was texting me about how she hates it at home and hates where we go to school and that I'm the only thing keeping her at school. I know she's exaggerating a bit, but she does seem a little unstable lately so I'd feel really guilty if we did split up. I also know she would go out of her way to hurt me and make the whole process really unbearable. But I'm done wasting my time in some half-assed, unhealthy relationship. I either need to buckle down and really give this thing the dedication it deserves or split. But I'm really not sure what to do. What is your advice?

The problem is I want to try and get internship now so I don't wait until my junior or senior year and maybe not get one at all. So I think the sooner the better. But I look at all of the nearby and even a bit far out internship applications and the requirements for them are frightening. It seems like you need to know an average amount of knowledge on multiple languages and frameworks and such. Any advice on how to get an internship without that?"
5ezus6,2,2016-11-26,10y and three children,vak85,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5ezus6/10y_and_three_children/,"It was weird the way it happened.
We loved each other but we were too different and too young. We had ups and downs along the years.

We met and fell in love while I was still in uni and she was looking to start uni. She got pregnant 3 months afterwards and then made my first mistake: I decided to go on with a 5 and a half month trip I had already planned. She had to move back in with her family. She resents that to this day, although that trip provided a good entry in my CV (I spent 5 months in an internship) which provided for later oportunities for us both (moving abroad).

Then when I got back for the baby's birth we moved with my parents and my mom did not make her feel at home. 

That was fixed after a month when we moved out but her relationship with my mom was already broken at this point. She started to develop trust issues because I was out studying and working the whole day (would gat back home after 8 or 9pm some times), at this time I neglected her wishes to go on with her studies because I wanted to graduate ASAP to be able to stop depending on my parents (the were paying a hood part of our bills). She kept thinking I was having this tons of affairs (maybe because her father and brother were not good role models) but I put up with that.

We moved to the UK and we got into a good phase but she went into depression when we lost our 2nd baby. I really cared for her and she improved and then got pregnant again. My mom came to visit at the time of the birth messed all up again  (along with my unwillingness to confront and tell her to back off). 

One year after that we had a breakup that lasted a few months and we got together again and she got pregnant. Unfortunately she broke up with me while she was still pregnant, mistakes from me would bring all my past mistakes back. I kept trying to win her back but I think my past decisions hurt her too much. She is quite depressed even while in meds and I do my best to cheer her up. She keeps thinking she wasted 10y of her life and blames me for it.

Two years on... now she started to see someone else I wish her all the best but deeply wished we could still be together (I still love her, it really hurts to see her with someone else).

I feel for our children, for now we still share a house but that's probably going to end as we get on with our lives, luckly we're in good terms.

If yiu read thanks. I felt I needed to write about it :) although this is a very short version."
5f09as,476,2016-11-26,"[MA] I'm the person who reported the porn on RCN/CNN. It really happened, and now I don't know what to do.",scaredpornreporter,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5f09as/ma_im_the_person_who_reported_the_porn_on_rcncnn/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm the poor sucker who tweeted about porn playing on CNN on Thanksgiving in Boston. It's been a really fucked up 24 hours and I wanted to know if this is something that I can take any kind of legal action on. I have no idea if emotional distress is something you can sue for, but any and all advice is welcome.

Here's exactly what happened. 

At 10:30 PM on Thanksgiving, I turned on my television. I have RCN, which is a regional cable provider in MA. Using the guide, I selected the Parts Unknown marathon. Instead of CNN, there was graphic pornography playing. I immediately checked to see if I had the right channel. I did. I called my fiance into the room. We laughed about it, took a bunch of pictures, texted them to a bunch of our friends, and flipped to a movie on another channel. Between 10:30 - 11 PM, we switched back to CNN a few times to see if the porn was still playing. It was. We switched back around 11, and the entire channel had gone blank, displaying an error code. No other channels were impacted by this. 

Between 10:30 and 11, I checked Twitter and Reddit to see if anyone else had reported the porn. No one else did. So, I tweeted about it, tagging @RCNconnects, asking if anyone else in Boston saw it. I tweeted a few more times, including tagging a local news aggregator, @universalhub. I included pictures, and made a few jokes about how many an angry intern broadcast the porn. I engaged with a few friends and strangers on Twitter, and then went to bed. 

Overnight, this thing blew up. ibtimes.co.uk published the first non-local article about it, claiming that *all* of Boston viewers were affected. I was asleep when this was published, and so was not available for comment. From there it went viral--everyone was talking about it. I got a million requests for interviews, which I mostly declined (I did answer a few questions from Buzzfeed because they were very nice). However, when people started realizing that it was one reporter (me), things got really ugly. I was accused in the media of making up the story, and started receiving death threats on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. I was accused of being a shill for the liberal media, for trying to get attention, for trying to manipulate the news to my benefit. I turned my Twitter private after I started receiving threats of sexual violence, and that was taken as an admission of guilt. This is still happening. 

Through all of this, RCN refused to help me. I did DM with them on Twitter for a little while to get help in resetting my TiVo box, but after that they went dark. Yesterday evening, they made a public statement that they investigated and determined it never happened. But the thing is, they never reached out to me, never let me send them the pictures my fiance and I took, and now I'm being vilified in the media for simply trying to find out if the rest of Boston was seeing hardcore porn on CNN like I was. 

So, my question is, what can I do? A few people have suggested I get a lawyer. Is this even something I can try to sue RCN about? All I want is an acknowledgement from them that yes, this really happened to an isolated user. I want the death and rape threats to stop. I did file a complaint with the FCC, but I am not sure if I should take this further or in a different direction. 

Thanks for your help. I'm happy to answer any questions. "

The offers are identical so there's no worries there. Although MongoDB seems to be the more well-known place, Qualtrics seems like it has a huge potential for growth in the future. Yet, MongoDB seems like it has a better structured internship program. I'm also concerned about full-time, since the place I intern is highly likely the place I will return to for full-time. Which place is better for full/time? I might also try out full-time recruiting so I'm wondering which place would look better on the resume?

So I'm currently doing a yearlong internship at eBay Canada as a Strategy and Analytics intern (mix of SQL, Hive, R, Excel, Tableau, Google Analytics) but I have been looking for a summer 2017 internship in Data Science since I want to break into that industry eventually. I realize that a lot of the comments on this sub point towards Data Science being a field for a Masters/PhD holder but I think that is more in line for research-oriented jobs or those where the projects are very time/resource heavy (e.g. the DataSci team at my company is focusing on redefining our search algorithms, which is like a 2 year project).

I am more interested in jobs that are ""advanced analytics"" i.e. jobs with applied ML/Data Mining techniques, for example the following few jobs:

* [Zillow - Pricing Data Science Intern](http://www.zillow.com/jobs/openings?j=olqc4fwL)

My background is in Industrial/Systems Engineering, so I have taken a fair amount of courses in Statistics, Operations Research, Programming etc. I am also currently taking some online courses in Machine Learning (e.g. [Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and the [MIT Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-2) and I hope to follow up with some Kaggle competitions to get some more experience

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!!

5f1jfu,255,2016-11-26,How the Vive was my own positive investment.,joiemoie,Vive,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5f1jfu/how_the_vive_was_my_own_positive_investment/,"I purchased my Vive summer before freshman year of college. The experiences at the time were just tech demos, but I saw the potential. I was tired of complaining about lack of games with cool mechanics and decided to make one my own.

My longtime reach goal was to make a VRMMORPG, heavily inspired by Maplestory and Sword Art Online. This obviously isn't a project anyone can do himself, let alone a new developer who hasn't made any games. But the point was to treat it as a learning experience, and to set all the foundations. By setting this high goal, along the way, I could learn to code multiplayer, experiment with my own movement mechanics (Run in Place), figure out sword combat in VR, and learn the finer details of game development and code organization.

I stopped watching tutorials and jumped into the project, learning as I went along. Days upon days in a row, I added new features to my project. Run in Place locomotion. Swords that only damage with real swings. A perfect SAO menu. Constantly learning and trying to tackle some of the trickiest problems in VR such as dealing with sword collisions. 

One thing that fancied my interest was using a Kinect 2.0 in conjunction with the Vive to do full body tracking. While I was convinced it would never be mass adopted, I thought it would be a neat little side project. Since I was an entering freshman in Boston University, I decided to search for a professor in the University who had experience coding a Kinect and asked him if I could borrow one over the summer. He asked me what I was using it for, and I briefly summarized my VR project. 

The Kinect project never happened. The USB ports on my computer were incompatible, so I couldn't use it unfortunately. 

Freshman year starts. It's been a month since I borrowed it. The professor asks I return the Kinect. But at the email, he also asks general advice on a question:

""You worked with the Unity engine, yes? I'm training a machine learning algorithm to evaluate how messy a room is from a scale of 1-9, and I need thousands more images for training. Could you do this?""

I explain to him the Unity solution of how it would be done. Next email, he asks if I would like to work with him on the project for a paid research internship, and I accept it. $1500 for this semester, I set my own schedule and hours and work from my room, and a renewal for next semester. Furthermore, I was asked about the future of VR for social workers navigating these messy rooms, and I showed how my code from my VRMMORPG can let you traverse this virtual room.

Long story short, the Vive paid itself off entirely, I learned important skills in Unity development, and I scored a paid freshman research internship for the whole year, with a prospective future opportunity as well. The Vive was a good purchase.

Edit: As a side note, in case anyone's wondering how I fit my Vive in my dorm room, I lucked out with an amazing dorm room. It's got a bathroom, walk in closet, and 3 rooms connected to each other, with my roommate sleeping in the 3rd room. The middle room is large enough for me to set up an entire VR rig. All this luck in dorming as a freshman.

In addition, I plan on using AP credits to graduate by the end of my sophomore year, then travel abroad to explore the world and use my computer engineering degree to work on my own projects. Hopefully, everything works out well!"

Next semester, I have another internship at PwC (a big 4 firm). Hopefully one of these will turn into a job offer.
This was supposed to be my fifth (and final) year of college, due to the 150 credit hour requirement for the CPA License. However, because of these two internships taking place during the school year, my graduation date will be pushed back a year. When I go back to school to finish off my studies, I'll be 24, and pretty close to 25 when I graduate with my bachelors in accounting. 

People, including my professors and former supervisors at work will say things like, ""Oh! You're still here, or ""I thought you graduated already"". Also, it'll feel kinda awkward being 24 and being like 5/6 years older than the new-coming freshmen. I don't get why there is such a huge stigma against being a super senior. 

It's not like I've constantly failed classes left and right. I mean I failed and dropped only 3, but I always retaken them over the following summer.

5f2mi7,1,2016-11-26,If I Was a President,Gregheff,President,https://www.reddit.com/r/President/comments/5f2mi7/if_i_was_a_president/,"Here are my policies if I was a president (Caution: May cause butthurt)

Immigration:
It's not that immigration should be closed for people from certain countries. We need better regulations and better border control. We need more border police officers to control illegal immigration. Building a wall will hurt relations, but rather build a bridge with strong security.

Taxes:
The rich should pay more taxes. We need higher taxes to fund programs to fund the needy and to reduce the debt. Lower classes should pay 5%, middle classes should pay 15%, and upper classes should pay 35%.

Education:
If a student wants a good education, schools should provide after school programs and extracurricular programs. The student should be encouraged to do a minimum number of hours of community service before graduation. Public schools should do more to give a good education.

College tuition can be free if a student's performance is outstanding. Tuition should be based on a certain percentage of their household income, i.e. 5% for community colleges, 10% for four-year colleges, 20%-25% for private colleges, and 15% for all graduate studies, or 5% for associate's degree, 10% for bachelor's degree, and 20-25% for graduate's degree or higher. Financial aid should be available for people who are unable to pay it. Schools are allowed to give students interns that if they complete them, they can have the full tuition paid in full and have some stipend for personal use.

All students of public school should recite the pledge of allegiance. It's part of the cultural identity.

Sex education should be part of the education curriculum. This class is important if they ever have sex.

Abortion:
Abortions should be legal. If a state doesn't want to legalize abortion, the federal government shouldn't force them to. All abortion clinics are allowed to use weapons, i.e. bayonets, daggers, swords, spears, to give abortions. If a minor is pregnant due to incestual rape, she is allowed to have an abortion if her parents wants it.

Guns:
There should be stronger checks for gun ownership. Gun cause more violence than not having guns.

Health Care:
We need taxpayers to fund the health care system. Middle-class cannot get free insurance and cannot pay for themselves. They should have a policy that they can pay what they can afford and the insurance companies have to give what they need.

Medicare is important. Seniors cannot afford to purchase insurance for themselves.

Internet/FCC:
The internet should be open. We need some form of surveillance. This form of surveillance should only look for suspicious activities.

TV shows are allowed to be mature-themed. If a kid show wants to have vulgarity, i.e. South Park, it should be noted in the rating system. Independent TV shows can be released on Netflix, YouTube, or Hulu, but should have lax regulations that on TV networks.

Showing nudity is highly forbidden. If one wants to show nudity online, it must be self-censored. Using profanity doesn't have to be always censored; kid shows are allowed to have vulgar language, but should be noted in the rating system.

Trade:
Free trade doesn't always work. We need some tariffs for trade. It should be capped at 10%.

Welfare:
Eliminating welfare programs don't work. If a person gets laid off, he can get unemployment benefits. If a person gets a new job, he doesn't have to receive unemployment benefits. If he received all of this unemployment benefits, he can attend employment seminars and should be able to be employed again.

Banking:
Banks should give people insurance in case the bank fails. The money from the bank accounts can be transferred to a new bank of the owner's choice.

Voting Right:
Everyone should have a right to vote. When a person is eligible to vote, he or she should be registered automatically. He or she shouldn't be harassed for voting.

Civil Rights:
Everyone have the same rights. It is okay to speak up if a person's rights were violated.

Environment:
We need to invest in renewable energy. If we use unrenewable energy, the Earth will likely be unsustainable.

Supreme court:
The supreme court judges should support both sides of the political spectrum. This way, both sides are considered.

Porn: 
Porn shall be legal with the exception of unanimated child porn. It helps with the economy. Sexually suggestive content is not pornographic but is considered obscene.

Prostitution: 
Prostitution should be legal. It prevents illegal prostitution and is good for the economy.

Drug Use: 
All drug paraphernalia are illegal with the exception of medical marijuana and up to 10oz of some controlled substance. Studies show that medical marijuana does wonders.

Gambling: 
Gambling should be legal and regulated. It is beneficial to the economy. However, if a person loses all of their money, they should be kicked out right away.

Death Penalty: 
Death penalty should be abolished as it is not a deterrent to crimes. Live imprisonment with or without parole is much more cost-effective.

Nuclear Weapons: 
We need to negotiate other countries. With nuclear weapons, humanity will disappear.

NATO: 
The NATO is important if Europeans countries are attacked by enemy states. The US should use drones to attack enemy strong points.

Terrorism/ISIS: 
We need better intelligence operations. We need to use drones to attack strongpoints.

Murder: 
All murders are punishable to life imprisonment with the exceptions of murdering one's children, especially mentally impaired ones, relatives, anyone who insulted you, and testing a new sword on a person within 1 hour of acquiring it. Such murders need an eyewitness to be justifiable.

Sex crimes: 
All rape are punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment with the exception of the use of condoms for fornication of corpses, animals, and relatives, and executed people without a condom within one hour of being executed.

Glass-Steagall: 
This policy is important. We need regulations that will prevent another recession or lessen the impact of a recession.

Population Control: 
If the population growth continues with our current trends, the Earth will be unstable. In order to control the population, people should have less offspring or kill others indiscriminately.

Waterboarding: 
Waterboarding is ineffective as it causes harm and is considered torture. To interrogate effectively, we need lie-detection technology and manipulation.

Religion/Freedom of speech: 
Everyone has a right to believe in their own religion. People are allowed to join another religion if they want.

People are allowed to use online forums to have discussions of various sources. 

Email use/Social media use: 
I will use an encrypted secondary email account if the FBI allows and/or use Facebook and Twitter to let people voice their concerns. These emails will be responded by my cabinet members to see what laws and regulations need to be changed or implanted.

Video games: 
To allow violent video games, we need a video game rating systems, not to ban them. This rule applies to tv shows and movies.

Corruption:
Corruption is a crime as people take other people's money for their greed. Anyone committing it shall be imprisoned for 5-10 years and have their property confiscated."

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies of the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past their shrill laughter.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too.
But one day, a fellow partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

Its late one night, and it feels like all the partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You saunter into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, and I’m the only person in the room. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and I can’t seem to reach the plate from the top shelf, even in my heels. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I stretch. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

And then you notice the lipstick.

I am in my third year electrical engineering in Toronto, Canada. I recently got an internship that starts in May 2017 for 16 months. During the interview, the manager was explaining the ASIC design process, starting from RTL and going to physical design and so on until tape out. 

Then, he told me what his team does is, they get less important yet needed circuits (Intellectual Property) from external sources and use them in their own chips (GPU/CPU/PCI/etc). What his team does is, they make sure that those IPs actually work, and comply to the specifications and designs that this company gives them (or something like that) and that it can integrate into their chips, and that they don't do RTL and things like that. and for example if the IP doesnt work, it will involve report typing to explain the issues, using simulations etc to show them what we mean when we say it doesnt work.
 
He also said that i would be analyzing hybrid circuits (ie. look like logic gates but really arents, depending on where you put the input/output in mosfets, etc)


The job description as at the end. Now, my question is, after reading the description + reading what the guy told me during the interview which differs slightly from the description, does it seem like a physical verification job? or ASIC design job? are the ""WHAT YOU WILL LEARN"" actually useful and used in the industry? (i dont know what some of them mean, but will learn them in the job). 
Can what I learn from this job be applied in other jobs in microsystems engineering in real life? I am just worried that i will be wasting a year of my life doing just testing/report writing.

Please enlighten me, thank you very much.

I've gotten a bunch of offers and i've narrowed it down to 2 places. These are places where I would definitely have signed off on if I didn't have the other. I'm in engineering but not a CS/ECE major, but both of these are software engineering positions (i took a fuckton of cs classes).

1) The first is the one I'm leaning towards: It is with a three letter intel agency in DC doing something I think I would really enjoy and be good at. There are opportunities to travel and work overseas which is really attractive to me. The catch is that it is conditional on me receiving a high security clearance, I don't see there being any issues with it BUT anything could happen (I'd have to get polygraphed) and they can pull their offer at anytime if they find anything they don't like. The salary for this one is 10K less than option 2, I'm totally fine with taking less money for this job though.

2) The second is with a national lab also in the DC area, I'd be doing something similar to what i did in a past internship (and I enjoyed). This job is unconditional and final, I have it as soon as a sign the acceptance letter. The salary on the higher end of what i was expecting and 10k more than option 1.

I really want to do the first one, even though it is a massive risk (I did some googling and about 9% of job offers are pulled during the clearance process). But hey its good to take risks right? My parents think it would be extremely stupid to do this and that I should accept the job with a higher salary immediately.

3) There is a third option, one that I really don't want to do. I could accept the first option and another job offer, and then renege when my offer with job 1 becomes final. This provides a safety net, but theres a 91% chance I would renege and I would be burning a bridge. 

What would you do?"

Are there events or ""parties"" within these companies? I'm just worried it will be a never ending circle of work, sit in the apartment, sleep.

It feels so near yet so far from me. I still find it hard to believe what happened to me. It’s been a difficult year for me, I’ve done everything I could to cope with it, even if at times it feels like I haven’t. I have had a quite busy year despite spending the majority of it at home recovering.
 
When I was first released from the hospital after being held there for around six weeks, I was pretty much on my own with this disorder. There was no family history of bipolar, so it was a surprise that I had it although I did suspect I had something. I felt very lonely at the time and didn’t have anyone to really talk to about my condition. At first, I found it very difficult to explained what happened to me, having a manic episode is an almost explainable feeling where you experience a million racing thoughts and almost completely unbridled energy. It would be hard for anyone else to relate to how that feels like. Eventually, I did get better at explaining how it feels like after spending months deconstructing what happened to me. After many months, I became more comfortable about being bipolar, it took much soul searching before I came to terms with it. I wasn’t happy about being bipolar, but I knew I needed to accepted it if I wanted to move on with my life. 

The initial recovery period wasn’t easy; my mind was a tangle for the first few months after I came out of the hospital. I lost my sense of self, I didn’t know who I was anymore. What I remembered most from that time was how confused I was, I felt completely disconnected from the rest of the world. I remember spending hours on end just thinking of what happened to me. I would write page after page in my journal to untangle what was in my mind. Even after a year, I can’t fully explain what happened to me but I’ve gotten better at it.  

Initially after I was released from the hospital, I was advised to not go to work for about a year from my psychiatrist, I was even advised not to do internships or go back to school to prevent another relapse. It was a difficult time for me, but looking back, it was necessary since it took me a long time to come to terms with being bipolar after having a serious manic episode, I needed the time just to be on my own to try to understand everything that had just happened to me. I would spend my nights and days reading whatever blog or article I could find on bipolar. I learnt a lot from it, it was useful for me to comes to terms with what happened to me and to help me feel not so quite alone. 

Eventually as I got progressively better, my psychiatrist allowed me to take an internship which I have been doing for the past two months now. It been good for me and has finally allowed me back on focusing in forging a career for myself. I am still getting used to working life after being essentially unemployed for over two years. My bipolar hasn’t been an issue so far with regards to work, I haven’t had any episodes since my moods have settled. Things are now boring stable, it might be good for my bipolar, but I do get bored of it sometimes. 
Because of my bipolar, directly or indirectly, I meet a lot interesting people, it’s probably one of the good things that happened to me from my bipolar. Recovering from bipolar forced me to go out and explore myself and the world around me. I started doing art and writing to help me come to terms with having this disorder, it’s helped me a lot with understand and accepting what life has thrown at me. 

If I have known I had bipolar earlier, I would have done everything differently. I had a painful time at university not knowing what my problem was. Looking back, it explains so much about how I felt at the time and why I had so many problems. I don’t regret going to university but I think I would have coped a lot better if I knew what my problem was. Knowing now that I have bipolar changes my whole perspective on how I was at university, it’s been a long time already, but it’s hard to forget how it was like for me. I’ll never forget how depressed I was when I was in university and all those sleepless nights spent in anxiety. 

Being bipolar hasn’t stop me from living my life. After a while, I accepted that I was fundamentally the same person I was before, just this time with bipolar. I don’t think change me in a bad way, if anything, it’s made me a better person now. It’s given me a very different perspective on life and on myself. I’m a lot more resilient now after what happened to me, I’ve built up the strength to stand up again after falling so low. Seeing the world from both the high of mania and the low of depression changes the way you look at the world. Mania awakens you up to what is possible in the world opening your eyes to an endless slew of possibilities while depression brings you down earth and unravels some of the deep truths of reality that we would otherwise keep hidden away. My life is now richer than it was before and while I still live with the possibility of another episode, I have learnt to live with that fear and not make it stop me living my life.

There was a lot going on and he didn't want to worry about a relationship on top of his internship for work, going to school, and commuting. It was a horrible few months, but we agreed to go no contact for at least a year to get over each other.  In that time we both started dating other people (I found out later on that he had a new gf through our mutual friends).

2 months later I started casually seeing this new guy [m/26] my friend introduced me to.  He's the nicest guy I've ever been with and he treats me so well.  The only thing is, we don't agree on the ""big"" issues like religion and politics.  However neither of us see this as a deal breaker because we get along literally perfectly in every other aspect. 

Come this past week my ex started talking to me again.  He wrote how he wants to try again and aside from him breaking up with me we never had any problems or real arguments.  We agree on everything and I know I'm still in love with him.  

So, do I stay with the guy who I know I could be happy with but don't necessarily ""love"" (I feel it's too soon to tell, since we've only been dating a few months), or give my ex who was my everything a second chance? "
5f4tkf,712,2016-11-27,My mum thinks my brother is a demon and it is slowly destroying my life.,afropunk95,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5f4tkf/my_mum_thinks_my_brother_is_a_demon_and_it_is/,"My mum is from Ghana, Africa. I was born in London, so I am black British. This is important to know, because my mum comes from a culture where the belief of black magic, witch doctors and exorcisms are prevalent. I've seen some fucked up stuff growing up. People telling me that if I eat certain foods, I will die. 

My mum thinks my brother is a demon and its tearing me apart. I think she has a mental illnesss but I can't tell. Growing up, it was tough. My mum physically and mentally abused my brother for being a demon (because my Dad's sister, who is also a demon, gave my brother some yam, so therefore he must be a demon too) whilst she praises me and loves me. She would force me to watch the abuse and force me to partake in her verbal abuse. Not long after, it became a belief for me. My brother is a demon. At 6 years old, I hated my brother. I can't believe I was a stupid idiot. I believed her for so long, but now? Fuck all of that shit. Fuck all of it. 

But whenever I mention my brother, whenever I hang out with my brother, she flips. She screams at me and says that I'm ruining my life. She wont help me out financially. When I was young, she used to hit me over it. My mum prays everyday for hours, like one hour or two hours, sometimes three. She believes in spiritual warfare. She tells me I'll never marry if I hang out with him, that the reason why I'm not dead is because she keeps praying for me. That I could become paralysed for life if I chill out with him. That my brother tried to give her cancer, that he stole her hair, stole her husband (my Dad divorced my mum when I was four years old.)

My mum kicked my brother out at age 16. She told me shit like my brother has married me spiritually, so I won't get married. Shit like 'he's trying to kill me' or 'if you talk to him too much he'll kill you.' I am currently doing a masters degree in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice. I have come down this weekend to visit her in London - this morning, I heard her praying that God should take my brothers life, that God should use his holy fire to burn my brother. What the fuck? When I won a mini pupilage to work in a law firm, my mum said ""don't even tell your father, because demons are watching you."" It's like constant paranoia. I told her I hated it, and said she wouldn't stop. Its like she doesn't care about my feelings, she does what she thinks is right regardless of anyone.

She will never listen to reason. When I tell her she's hurting me she doesn't listen. She's too stubborn. She never understands anything that's not in her reasoning and she starts arguments when you try and correct her. She starts screaming and shit. She can never be wrong.

The thing is, I know she loves me. She buys me clothes and tells me everyday, she helps me pay for my tuition for my masters, but if she knew I was contacting my brother, she wouldn't.


This cultural tradition/belief is very prevalent in Ghana, it's everywhere. But it's eating me alive, I don't believe in it. But I've got a lot of trust issues, independent-syndrome issues. Usually, I'm really good at blocking it out, but not today.

I know my mum loves me. She prays for me to get married, for me to be successful and shit... But enough is enough. Last year, 2015, I went to see my Grandfather, who doesn't talk to my mum (my mums father doesn't even talk to her. What the fuck?) I went with my brother. When my mum found out, she told me that no man would love me as long as my brother is alive. That all of my friends have boyfriends and that I'm the only one that doesn't (she puts an incredible amount of pressure on me to get married) That its a sign that I'm fucking up my life.

That put me in therapy. I contemplated suicide. My mum has hit me once for seeing my dads family, and that my dads family is demonic. Growing up, it was really hard for me to make friends. I didn't have any until I was 14. I was so alone, but my mum said it was better that way. She says God should kill my brother. But my brother... He is a warrior. He is alive, he wants to be a teacher. Everyday he goes to the gym, everyday he makes something of himself. He has a girlfriend, a flat, he quit drugs. He is amazing. He is my role model.

I've decided that I love my mum, but I have to cut her off emotionally. I can't be sane and love her entirely. She barely has any friends, but she's okay with that. My step dad told me its my job to fix the family, that this is what its about to be an adult. But its not my job. I am not going to let my family life control me, because I'm not the one who broke this family. He knows what is happening between my mum and my brother, but he always puts pressure on me to fix it. My brother wants nothing to do with my mum and vice versa. I still live with her. I'm 21 years old.

I will not let my mum destroy my brother. I told him no matter what happens, I will always love him. I eat the food she says he's poisoned, I talk to him when she says he's going to kill me and marry me spiritually so I never have kids, that I'll never be successful. But I graduated with a 1st class law degree against the psychological abuse. I have a boyfriend. I have a part time job and I'm paying for my masters tuition. I won a mini pupilage. I did an internship and went to the European Commission in Brussels. My brother has  forgiven me for when we were young.

But I will never stop achieving. I am determined to achieve with him in my life. We will show everyone. We will show everyone what the power of sibling love can do.

I still live with my mum. She puts pressure on me to pop kids and get married, but not yet. Not until I'm the best, with my brother by my side. I will show her. I will show everyone who ever doubted him.

I will not allow my demons to surface. I am not useless, I will not die. I won't let my insecurities beat me. I am not going to die because of my brother, or demons, or anyone. 

I will face my demons.
I am not afraid.
I will love my brother, unconditionally, forever.
I am not afraid.

I will show them all.
I am not afraid,
never again."

**Derrick Barry, Shantay you Stay**. You may leave the stage.

**Ivy Winters**, you have left an everlasting impression on us all, but for now, **Sashay Away.**

- - - 

Now, on to this week's main challenge, **Casting Chaos**!

This week's challenge is an acting one! The queens are acting out a 2-part scenario. 

Scene 1 is about a Newsroom casting new news reporters and new camera operators. The professionals are teaching the novices how to use the respective equipment and then they go on air. Everything is going to plan but then the rookie cameraman breaks the camera, causing the bosses to cuss them out and have a full on fit on live tv.

The second scene is a separate news reporters reporting on the obscene way that news reporters acted, with the cameraman who messed up over-exaggerating what happened), the news reporters (telling the t) and boss (defending themselves incessantly and getting visibly violent and irritated) as witnesses. They get interrupted by some teenage wannabe star who keeps jumping in the shot, causing a commotion, making everyone in the group irritated as they can't get the interview finished because of this teenager wanted their 1 minute of fame.

In my head it sounded so much better, but i just couldn't get the description out as well as in my head. sorry

Now the two groups were chosen randomly and are as is:

&amp;nbsp;

**GROUP 1:**

**Mimi Imfurst** as the narcissistic and entitles boss who goes off at the interns

**Delta Work** as the professional news reporter reporting until the debacle happens. Frustrated at the novice news reporter.

**Pandora Boxx** as the novice/rookie news reporter, constantly screwing up. 

**Mrs Kasha Davis** as the rookie Camera woman who messes up.

**April Carrion** as the professional camera woman who is prompting the novice on how to use the camera properly.

&amp;nbsp;

**GROUP 2:**

**Latrice Royale** as the different News reporter who is reporting on the obscenities that was shown on live tv

**Courtney Act** as the Boss (who Mimi is playing previously) defending herself, getting visibly violent and irritated at how she is being portrayed *it was just the editing*

**Jessica Wild** as the camera man that messed up (who MKD is playing previously), over-exaggerating what happened

**Morgan McMichaels** as the rookie news anchor (who Delta is playing previously), saying the t, what really happened.

**Derrick Barry** as a crazed teen who who jumps into the frame and interrupting the interview for their minute of fame.

- - - 

Now, with that out of the way, the voting is left in **your** hands. Who do you think will rise to the occasion? Who do think will fall, hard? This week you will be voting on which group would win this and ranking the queens performances [Vote here to make your voice heard](http://polljunkie.com/poll/sjddny/onyxs-fantasy-season-2-week-6). Keep in mind, that the winner **will** receive immunity next week.

Gentlemen, start your engines and may the best woman....... **win!**

Again, the concept seemed a lot better in my head so if you have any questions about it please ask. Sorry if its confusing or anything."
5f56f8,1,2016-11-27,Read plenty of success stories here so I'll give it a shot,cru42,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5f56f8/read_plenty_of_success_stories_here_so_ill_give/,"I'm 28. 

Moved back home last year after breaking up with my fiance. 

Started a minimum wage job changing tires last year and was promoted to assistant manager last month. 

Just paid off my car. (It's going to need some work done soon)

About $5000 in debt. (Also, it's not my responsibility because my half sister is supposed to be paying for it, but my father's funeral in 2009 was $6500. To date my sister has yet to pay a dime. Its not something I HAVE to pay but I would like to pay it off if I could. They are a great funeral home and I was very thankful for the service they provided us.) 

Nothing in savings. 

Just applied for a community college for cyber security. (First time going to college)



I need to find a new job. I've had several places tell me they're hiring (starting pay per hour: $11.40, $11.50, $13.00, $14.50, and $16.50. All entry level. As assistant manager I'm only make $11/hr now). But I don't know what my class schedule is going to be if I get accepted. (My friend told me I should come work with him at a customer service job. He doesn't think they hire part time but if they do, working part time there I'd be making more than what I'm making now as an assistant manager working 50+ hrs/week). My manager is a great guy (met him through my ex's family and used to work together at a different job) and he was there for me when I was really down and out and did me a huge favor by getting me this job. However, he can be very hard to work with and as a manager has very little management or coping skills. The only reason I haven't just up and quit yet is because I'd feel bad for abandoning him just as we're coming into our busy season. But something has to change. If I get into college, the semester starts in January and I can't work this job once I start school (I can't work this position specifically as its a mandatory 50 hrs/w but I'm currently taking a college transitions course and my teacher doesn't think I should be here at all while I'm in college since taking 1 class, 1 night a week I've already missed enough because of work that if I miss another I can't complete the class)

I'm meeting a woman on Wednesday for coffee that a mutual friend got me in touch with. As far as computer related degrees go she has just about every letter after her name you can get. She says there's amazing job/intern opportunities in a nearby city where she works. If I can I'd like to try and get an entry level or intern position in a related field so I can be gaining experience while attending college.

I took the 'Dave Ramsey financial peace' course through my church so I know a little about budgeting but I've never managed to put anything in place (and lately it's been hard. 12+hrs a day, 6 days a week, nonstop physical work, I pretty much crash as soon as I get home, and if not don't have the energy or motivation to get much done)




Any advice/direction you guys could provide would be greatly appreciated.

5f5hj4,0,2016-11-27,"I finished my Multimedia Designer education and I'm feeling a bit lost, how do I proceed forward?",artoriaas,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/5f5hj4/i_finished_my_multimedia_designer_education_and/,"I finished it in 2016 June. I wasn't the best in the class and not the worst. Bad choices led to me doing bad on the final exam, but I passed. Probably not the best start to getting a job. I figured I learned something from the experience and also figured that if it hadn't happened then I would have done better. Also, it doesn't seem like my field cares that much about grades as what you can do. I definitely burned a bridge with the firm where I did my paper at. Never heard back when I mailed them what I had managed to make. Doubt they would want to work with me, and I don't blame them.

To make matters worse I made a mistake with my union so my grant from them stopped in late October. I've been doing what we in Denmark call ""cash help"" for a few weeks now. It's shitty factory packaging, but it's paying bills for now. It's temporary as fuck. I'm gonna get suicidal thoughts if I have to stay there for months. So I absolutely have been doing stuff to find something else to do. I've been applying for jobs, sending unsolicited applications to firms hoping for just a month break from that shitty work we do right now.

I hope to find a job at some point that just pays my bills and lets me build up a new benifit period at my union. Although that takes 1924 work hours so I'm not sure if I would reach that before finding something better to do. As in continue my carrrer as a multimedia designer / web designer.

I'm hoping a small company will take me on. I think I could fit in there. I feel that my internship went very well, but of course, there would be a lot less time to do the things I did there. For example, did some work on their website, edited together a video / ad than another person had shot. Made some suggestions to their papers they sent out to their members. Started on an video ad for the place, but that never got completed due to time and getting overwhelmed with doing it all by myself.

I feel so out of touch with my field since I haven't done much since my education. If I was passionate about my field I should want to work on my field even though I don't have a job, right? I have been thinking that I might be in the wrong profession, but this education was definitely an upgrade compared to Web-Integrator which was mostly programming. I keep hearing about this burning desire to work in your field. Like you're supposed to fucking psyched to work on it anytime of day. And I guess I just don't feel it that much.

Ever since I got on the ""cash help"" I have been trying to work on stuff in the spare time. Like, I'm trying to get better at using Bootstrap. It also looks good that I can say I'm not stuck doing nothing just because I don't have a job.

Multimedia Designer is a very broad education, so I know 30-40% about a lot of things. Another narrowed education might be what I need to land a job in my field. That's why it's tough for me to sell myself. I know HTML5 and CCS3, then I've had lessons in PHP and MYSQL, but it would be a stretch to say I could just start using it from Day 1. I would definitely have to catch up on a lot of things before I could even think about writing anything worthwhile.

Designwise I'm in a better place, I'm not useless in Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro and After Effects, but I still have a bunch to learn.

I've also been thinking about what do I like doing the most because that should surely be what I should be pursuing, right? Well, that's the problem too. I do like coding HTML5, CSS3. I do like editing videos and I do like designing.

I just spent the weekend watching season 2 and almost done with season 3 of Silicon Valley and it got my brain thinking. The spirit of SV is kind of infectious and made me want to get this sorted.

Anyone been in a similar position? Got any good advice for moving ahead?

Please let me know if there is a more suitable subreddit for this kind of question, I just figured there might be some people here who have been in the same situation.

And lastly sorry for making this so long. Thank you if you've lasted all the way to this sentence."

I've narrowed it down to the two listed below. This will be my last internship so any suggestions of preferring one over the other are welcome.

1) SE Intern at leading search engine company - machine learning project - team matching got me matched up with my prospective manager.  
 Pros - Not surprisingly, he knew exactly what he was talking about, was really motivating throughout our talks and had an open mind when i suggested some small changes to some of his project ideas. I could see myself learning a lot if i join them this summer. Also, have never interned at a pure tech firm/at bay area before so would love to do so!

 Cons - They does not have a direct return offer policy, instead you go through ""exit"" interviews and i've seen a lot of smart people at school not make it through those. If i were to return as a full timer, the impact factor for a starting position is generally low in such a huge company.

2) Quant Researcher intern at a leading hedgefund in Chicago - project not decided yet.
 Pros - Known to a pretty intensive program which i see as a fun challenge to take up and also try to get in par with the rest(who mostly come from a more math background than me - pure CS). Additionally, its a lot more personalized since the intake numbers are quite few so a lot more attention is paid to pairing you up with a team(which will only be done after i sign) and making sure you learn.

 Cons - Previously interned there as an SE intern so might not add much diversity to my resume(although i didn't mind that earlier, i'm told i should be taking that into account). If i were to return as a full timer, Chicago winters are going to constantly remind me on the better weather opportunities that i've passed up on :(

P.S. - I understand that ""quant researcher"" is a broad term but i expect to be working on a project which needs a skillset similar to the one required for the tech internship project.

I've put this decision off for as long as i could and can't delay it any longer. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
5f5phx,3,2016-11-27,Would this be career suicide?,shade_21,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5f5phx/would_this_be_career_suicide/,"22m, I currently have a job in a very specialized engineering field. I've worked the field as an intern for 2 straight summers at a high profile company and got a job out of college at a different high profile company and have worked here for a year. I have done research in this field including one publication that was awarded at a in- field symposium. 

Okay, now that backgrounds out of the way, I need a break and am thinking taking a one year break just to try and travel a little and fulfill some personal goals. Would it be career suicide to quit now for this break and try to find a job again maybe a year give or take some months later? I am worried if I quit at this early stage it may be hard to get back into an engineering career due to that one year 'gap'."

I've completed the first half of my first semester in college. Yay? Anyways, I came back home for Thanksgiving break. I had not realized how much I was unknowingly/subconsciously missing my friends and family. The break is super short (11/24-11/27), so I just spent a lot of time with my parents and one of our family friends, two of my best friends, and (unfortunately as I am looking back on it now) my ex-girlfriend.
Seeing my parents and telling them about all the interesting people and things I've learned was exciting. They and the family friends kept on telling me I appeared so much more content, aware, and well-cultured. I definitely recognize that I was speaking about everything with enthusiasm, so, yes, I do feel happy with what/who I have been exposed to. I'm experiencing life, if you will. If anything, however, I would like to have more face-to-face contact with my parents, but at the same time I recognize going away is to a certain extent necessary for me to blossom into my own person. I feel happy that my parents are well, that they perceive me well, and that they are ever confident/beyond proud of what I've accomplished in terms of college admissions (yes, we are one of those ""work your ass off, get into an Ivy/good school, and continue climbing"" families, so it feels good that all the uncertainty and pressure of college is said and done with).
Seeing my friends, I realized how much I ****ing missed our weird/questionable dynamic, the level of trust we share, and the shamelessness we have with one another. I really want to find friends like that in college. I've been feeling lowkey lonely and depressed because I can't be my weird self in college. Sure, I've made friends (maybe one or two good friends, too) but I still have not reached the same level of connection/closeness with them as I have with my friends back home. Correct me if I'm wrong, i feel like there is a necessary amount of time/experience you need to have with people in order to reach that ""I can say anything the f*** I want and I won't care what you think because we're friends and that ain't changing :)"" level. I guess what I am trying to say/ask here is: does it get better and how? How can I be more outgoing and or make more close friends? I feel like it might be hard to make super good friends again because it's college: everyone is so wrapped up in their studies, getting f***ed up, internships, jobs, etc. Highkey I feel like I'm surrounded by so many people who are moving toward the degenerate side (but not insofar that they are degenerates) due to the lack of supervision. I'm scared.
FML. Why did I see my ex-girlfriend? We had such an amicable break up the few weeks before college: we told each other we'd stay friends and try to talk regularly or every now and then. But the first month in, she got a bf. I became utterly sad with myself because I want(ed) that level of intimacy with someone and to see her move on so quickly and deeply (like how??) with someone else hurt(s) like a b****. What's worse we hung out last night (I thought she and her bf had broken up, lol I was wrong) and I basically gathered: she is verging on pothead status, sleeps at her bf's dorm a lot (this is just such a shock from the ""nice"" and somewhat ""up-tight"" person she used to be), and erfijerwoigjiojfoijoieqjf. I feel like I am ""better"" than her; that is, she doesn't deserve me and yet I can't tell if I really miss her or miss the idea of being close with someone. I honestly don't know if I'm jealous, depressed, angry, broken, or all of those. She was my first and to see her change so much, so quickly, and with that dead-end f***boy bf of hers for some reason makes me want to cry. How do I cure oneitis? I don't want to feel like this again; should I avoid relationships in college? I am literally crying right now :/
tl;dr: It's my freshman year in college. Coming back home from college, seeing people change, and realizing I've missed certain people is conflating into me feeling lonely and depressed. I've contemplated suicide while in college because I missed the closeness I had with friends/my ex before college and because I was (still am) having a hard time finding ""good"" friends and closeness with people. I feel so much heartache right now because I foolishly decided it'd be a good idea to see my ex last night. Does life just get lonelier from here on out? People who prefer closeness/connection over mere socializing, how do I develop closer relationships with people in college?
Background info: I'm casually involved in 3 clubs right now (no important positions), I work out a lot, eat healthily, dress ""normally,"" and (I would say) have a decent work regiment for school."
5f66zr,1,2016-11-27,Need some advice/objective input on where to go from here (balancing grad school and work)?,wickedfreethinker,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/5f66zr/need_some_adviceobjective_input_on_where_to_go/,"Over this summer I was offered a position with my dream company. It's part time and does not pay benefits but it was close to twice the pay I was making prior to. And it's in my field of study, which is crucial to have as a doctoral student. I passed up an assistantship for this position because on paper it looks 1,000 times better. And I thought I would be more likely to be better off in the job market. I've done some internships, but mainly my experience is in academia, which is not what I plan to do. 

Fast forward a few months, the role is not consistent with what I was told it would be, I have to pay over $300 a month in marketplace insurance premiums and none of my doctors or meds are covered. They promised me full time hours a few months in (with benefits) but that is not going to happen because the other girl I work with raised hell about not having enough hours. She was an intern previously so it's understandable, but it was not conveyed to me there would be a pecking order in who receives more hours/benefits. There is no work life balance, people are texting each other 24/7 because my bosses are always out of town. It's obvious I don't belong here but I feel so stuck. 

The issue is, this is my dream company, and eventually I was hoping to work my way up. It might burn a bridge if I quit, but I found a job on campus. 

It would be half the pay, but would cover my tuition and health insurance. It would be a pretty mindless position, that I am overqualified for but in a sense it might be better for my mental well being. I could still do my research and work, there would be plenty of time for that. In fact, I might even be more productive because of the convenience. Any advice? 

I realize I am lucky to have a job and be in this position to choose, but I also must say, I am torn on what decision to make. All of my professors would tell me not to leave, my family tells me not to leave because of the money, but worse case scenario, I can take out loans if I need to. At this point I have a lot of educational debt accumulated from doing a Ph.D. I am just trying to reach candidacy. Then school will be significantly cheaper and I can work more hours. I am in so much debt now, I realistically do not think even a small pay cut will make much of a difference at this point. I have been educating myself on my loan payment options but I'm just really frustrated. "

Both associations have a big-little program where you are paired up with an older student who acts as your mentor. They are supposed to be like a family member, like an older brother or sister. I paired up with a big from each organization pretty early on. Both of my bigs are board members for their respective organizations. I didn't know this when I first met them, it just turned out that way. 

Later they both encouraged me to try interning for their organizations. Interns help the board for the spring semester, and they are more likely to be part of next year's board. I thought it would be good for some experience and so I could spend more time with my bigs etc. I probably would not have enough time to intern for both organizations so I would probably have to pick one. 

Organization A: I am closer to my big from this org. My entire lineage (line of bigs and littles) has been a part of board for as far back as my big can remember. He wanted to continue the tradition so he pressured his littles to try out. Org A also does a bit of ""hazing"" where they pressure new interns to drink. My big told me that it wasn't absolutely mandatory and he would not force me. 

Org B: this big did not pressure me as much to try out. However I heard from the grapevine that the day before intern applications were due, the org only had 3 submitted applications. I figured I would have a fairly good chance of being admitted so I decided to submit an app. 

I thought I did ok for the org b interview and I figured I would get the position because I didn't think there were many applicants. For the org A interview, my big told me that I did above average so my hopes were high. I usually don't hope because I'm used to being let down and then it just feels worse. For a few days, I thought I had a good chance. I worried about which organization I would have to pick if I was accepted by both. 

Turns out both rejected me. 

I know at least one person who interviewed for both orgs and got in at least one so I know that wasn't the problem. I got interviews for both orgs. Org B sent me a formal rejection email, which surprised me because I thought they would be short on staff. Org A did not send out an email yet, but my org A big told me that I didn't get in. Since he's friends with people in Org B, he told me that I was a close pick for both orgs. Both orgs probably picked like 6-8 interns each and I didn't make either. 

It reminded me of college applications all over again. Maybe I was close but the bottom line is: I didn't make it. For some reason, I wasn't enough. And now I feel foolish again for hoping. How naive of me, how utterly stupid, how silly to think that I'd ever get something right. That I'd succeed. 

My parents used to ask me what my dream school was when I was applying. And I refused to pick. I figured I would decide once I got my acceptances. And it was a good thing I didn't spend too much time trying to pick my favorite school, because only two accepted me: the two lowest ranked schools that I applied to. 

It's not that they're bad schools. I know I'm already fortunate enough to be able to pursue a higher education. I guess it was just me being foolish, thinking I'd get lucky and another school would want me. Instead my two options were one of the most expensive private schools in the country and my state school, which I thought of as a complete last resort. I wanted to go to school far away from my overbearing helicopter parents. And although the state school is pretty good, it's definitely looked down upon within the state. It just hurt. 

It hurt when everyone was so excited to go to school. I didn't tell anyone where I'd be going unless they asked. And they'd ask me out of politeness, to include me into the conversation, and I'd just say ""oh, I'm going to [state school]"". Which was not cool or exciting in any way. And they would say, ""oh,"" and continue their conversation of how excited they were to go across the country, and live in a new place, and have a fresh start, and see what it was like in a new state. 

 And even here, at this state school where I thought I could stand out a little more, I'm not enough. I can't excel. I'll always be a nobody. If I can't get a position when they're taking multiple applicants, how could I ever get any job? A funny thought. 

TLDR don't hope, it'll just hurt more later when you fail yet again. 

Edit: adding on... basically I had connections in both organizations. I have previous leadership experience from a sports team and marching band in high school. My gpa was high. I thought I did ok in the interview. One org didn't have too many applicants. And I still wasn't accepted to either org. I just wonder... where did I go wrong? What's wrong with me? Why can't I win for once? I know a connection can't guarantee me anything. It just feels like an extra kick in the face. "

So I have to do some catch up. I'm currently taking 18 credits Cal 1, Physics 1, Programing class and Digital Fundamentals. In high school the only difficult class I had was my honors math classes and they barely any work, so I did not have to do a lot of work and had 3.9 GPA when I graduated. 

Freshman year of College I would always hear the professor say ever hour in class is equal to 2 hours at home and that was not the case for my last year. But this year I'm taking 18 credit and right now it's hitting me like a truck. 

I have never had a grade lower than B minus in my life but now I have a D minus in my physics class. I don't know if I will be able to get it up to a C and it's making really stressed which is making me depressed and that is making my grades in other classes lower as well. 

My biggest problem is that I used to do my homework last minute because it was so easy but now I can't do that and it has been difficult because it has turned to a habit of always leaving my homework to the last minute and because I have so much I can't finish and hurts my grades. 

I found this sub Reddit and the more I read the more I felt more stupid compared to all of the people here. You guys have internships, CO OPs, work and good grades.

If some of you that have/had had Ds or lower, how did you deal with it?

Also I really really want to do Software Engineering. 

Sorry for the long post any type of help would be appreciated.

I suffer from insecurity issues and when I graduated school in Dec 2015 with a degree in Electrical engineering, no internship, co-op or experience, I didn't apply to places for 5 months because I felt really dumb. Possibly the most idiotic and worst engineer and nobody wants me. I have a 3.00 GPA but I'm so pitifully ashamed of it.

I've been working at retail for about 8 months. Since the beginning of August, I've applied to 87 places exact and I only heard back from 3 places for interviews. 1 didn't pan out. I'm waiting on 2 of them but I'm not expecting much since it's been 1 week+. I've gotten 15 straight out rejection letters.

I had my heart set on one place and put all my basket on one place because I really really wanted it and I put my focus and attention to that one company but it's been 2 weeks+ since the interview. The interview was on the 10th of this month. They told me at the end of the interview, ""We have a few candidates that we need to interview. Expect an answer from us in 2 weeks."" Thinking bout it now, that sort of sounds like a rejection statement. Two weeks pass by and it's thanksgiving holiday. The company has off on Thursday and Friday. I plan on calling on monday to see the status of my application. I've read on glassdoor that a lot of individuals got offers within a week. (They never said what time frame that they would get it.) I've read on glassdoor that some individuals heard back after 2-3 weeks and like 1-2 people got it a month later.

For the whole situation with hearing back, I heard that companies vary. Big companies take several weeks. A lot of people hear back in a few days or a week. My friend who had an interview with Boeing got an offer 6 days after. However, I don't know if he were told the time frame or the situation in when to expect an answer. I've heard people say they got an offer 2-3 weeks after or worst case scenario 2 months after. I honestly don't know what to think.

I don't know what to do. My parents are quietly disappointed in me. They support me but they are disappointed. They tell me to go back to grad school but I don't want to spend any more (of my parent's) money nor have the drive or will to go back to school and study. But if I can't find a job, should I just go back to school? Applying online sucks a lot and I'm feeling less and less motivated to continue on.

I've applied to 70+ companies using Indeed and I've been getting more responses from Monster but not much. I use the same resume but I custom tailor my cover letter. I get a lot of differing opinions on this and I don't know what to think. It feels like custom tailoring my resume every damn time is just such a time sink and a complete waste of time because in the end, I don't have experience or a lot of relevant experience since I'm just a fresh graduate. I had my resume tailored by my uncle who is doing incredibly well. He graduated from MIT and has done a lot of interviews. He says my resume looks great (minus the experience part) and I've been doing everything he told me to but I still can't get anything.

I can't give up. But I'm growing ever so paranoid and depressed and feeling incredibly worthless. I don't know what to do.
For those thinking that I'm having a pity party, I don't want sympathy. I don't care if you won't give me sympathy because I don't have experience. It's not the point of my situation. What is done is done. All I want is something genuine. Any advice, tips and/or stories?"

5f8wdv,756,2016-11-27,"""Please buy yourself a £130 router for £50.""",artofcode-,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5f8wdv/please_buy_yourself_a_130_router_for_50/,"LTL, FTP, and all that. To be clear, this isn't a customer complaint though some of it may seem that way - spoiler: I end up sorting the issues out with a contrived solution myself.

I've spent a number of years being family and friends' go-to tech support, which has left me with excellent Google-fu and a mind for unconventional solutions. I recently started university (Computer Science) about 150 miles away from my home in $LargeUKCity. So, of course, new house, new landlord, except the contract's in my name now. Scary, right?

It's a 7-person house, split over three floors (2 ground, 3 first, and 2 second). Everything went swimmingly well for oh, about an hour. At which point we discovered the landlord hadn't arranged for anyone to come and do the incredibly technical job of putting the router in for us. In short: we had no Internet.

At this point I should probably add some detail about $Landlord. $Landlord was a small company - one man, his wife, an assistant, and an intern (third-year Business &amp; Management student who knew how to check her emails and that was about it). None of them knew tech very well, so they left whatever they could to their contractors - the builders who refurbished the house over the summer, for example (who returned several times over the first few weeks to finish the things they hadn't done... small things, like the hob and oven not working), or the electricians (who also returned in the first few weeks... to assess the electrician who wired the house to start with). They were all... rather anxious, shall we say, about letting students anywhere near any technology they had, in case it broke and they couldn't fix it.

So, first day, we have no Internet. Excellent. (For context, this is a cable fibre service from $BigISP.) Because we had strict instructions not to ""mess with the electronics"" (really?), I make a call to $Landlord, and get $Intern on the phone.

&gt; **$Intern:** Hello, you've reached $Landlord, $Intern speaking, how can I help?  
&gt; **$Me:** This is $Me at $Address. Our router has been left unconnected. I'd connect it, but your boss left us instructions not to mess with the electronics.  
&gt; **$Intern:** Oh no no, don't connect it yourself. We'll send the builders to connect it - how does Thursday next week sound?  
&gt; *It's Saturday.*  
&gt; **$Me:** I appreciate the offer but all 7 of us are starting our courses on Monday, and will need access to online resources. I'm quite happy to connect it myself and call you back if I need any more details, I'd just like to check with you first.  
&gt; **$Intern:** No, don't touch it! $Boss doesn't want the equipment to get damaged. We'll send the builders as early as possible, probably Tuesday or Wednesday.  
&gt; **$Me:** *having previously told them what I study, am now a touch peeved that they think I'm incompetent* Thanks, but we'll need service earlier than that. I'll connect it up tonight, and I'll take liability for any damage that occurs.

Some spluttering happened, followed by a prompt hanging-up. They called on Monday morning to check what was happening. I'd connected up, no problems, and no damage. They slowly started to trust me with tech after this.

Fast forward to about three weeks ago, and the Internet had been playing up for the past month-and-a-half. Sporadically kicking devices from the network, dropping out for extended periods of time, and no service at all on the top floor (they ended up buying themselves Powerline kits). I'd been through every setting on the router's control panel, and couldn't find a thing wrong. Apart from the fact that we were trying to serve 35 devices on a router designed for no more than 10.

I sent $Intern an email (she was our Designated Contact), detailing the issues and explaining that we needed a new router. On a gamble, I also explained that as the house was a 7-person house and students have more than one device per person, they should have provided a router that would be capable of serving more than 10 devices. They didn't buy that strategy, unfortunately, and the return email told me that as the router was an ISP-provided router, they'd be contacting the ISP to see about obtaining a replacement.

Two days later, the ISP offered them £50 to sort the problem out themselves (""here's £50, find yourselves a new router""). That got forwarded to me. I spent a good while searching but couldn't come up with a single router that advertised itself as supporting 35 devices for under £50 (the cheapest was a Netgear something-or-other at £130), and relayed that information back.

&gt; **$Intern (email):** I'm sorry but £50 is all we can offer. $ISP has also made it clear they will not be sending an installation team, so you'll need to do this yourself.

So, armed with nothing but a £50 budget and Google-fu, I went hunting...

...and came back with a contrived solution involving 21 metres of Ethernet cable, a switch, and two new routers. Under £50. Which, to my amazement, $Landlord approved.

I spent a couple hours the day after the deliveries arrived installing everything. The original router remained in place. I connected the switch to the original router, and then one metre of the Ethernet cable went from the switch to one of the new routers. The other 20 metres I spent an hour cable-clipping from the switch along skirting boards and door frames up the stairs so that I could put the second new router on the first floor, and we'd finally have signal on the top floor. I connected everything up, powered on, and to a large smile from me, it all worked first time.

You'll be pleased to hear that I also spent some time securing the whole thing - good passwords on both networks, changed the admin credentials, disabled WPS, etc etc. We now rest happy on 50 Mbps connections.

**TL;DR:** Landlord gives me £50 to solve a £130 problem, and I manage it by mangling networks in a way that many people here will want to lynch me for. *But it works.*

EDIT: $Landlord sold the property to a new landlord shortly afterwards - people who are slightly more technical, and offered to pay me for fixing the issues. Free money - I won't object."
5f8ycn,1,2016-11-27,Choice of College?,izcosmosis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5f8ycn/choice_of_college/,"Hey guys! I'm 18 and I'm planning on transferring from Weber State University (Utah) to the University of Utah after I obtain my Associate's of Arts Degree this semester. I'm worried if this is not the right choice for majoring in Computer Science. Thoughts? I always felt that University of Utah is more spacious and a quality school compared to Weber State. I know they offer workshops where you can meet with notable companies such as Google, Adobe, etc (which I haven't seen at Weber).

I have one more semester of paid tuition at Weber State whereas I have to pay $1000+ at the University of Utah for the Spring Semester; however, I am planning on doing a Summer Internship to help pay for the rest of my semesters at the University of Utah. Also, I know I qualify for a $5000 scholarship at the University of Utah for the next Fall Semester.

I'd appreciate all the responses!

5f9299,2,2016-11-27,"I got my first job out of school, but what now?",roharia,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5f9299/i_got_my_first_job_out_of_school_but_what_now/,"So a little bit of background. I graduated in May with a bachelors in CS. I applied for about 4 months before I got a job and it got pretty depressing sitting at home doing about nothing. 

I was applying in many different states including MA, NY, CT, WA, CA, CO and NC. No dice. I applied reluctantly near home in KY (I was very against this at the time but was getting desperate). I landed an interview that same week and got the job the same day I interviewed. The pay is pretty bad honestly, I feel insanely undervalued. I commute about 2 hours every day for this not so great pay and honestly I am not learning a lot. I am mostly employing what I already know. It's a small company and I am actually the only programmer here. There isn't really anyone to learn from in those terms. When I'm between projects I keep myself busy and I have been teaching myself new stuff, but sometimes it is just better to learn from more experienced people.

Everyone at work is very nice to me and my boss is a really cool guy that doesn't care what I do as long as I get the job done. 


So here are pros/cons

Pros:

Everyone is nice, boss is pretty chill, I get to live at home rent free for now. I will say that my parents are moving in a year so I won't have that luxury after that.

Cons:

Just plain bad pay, nobody to really learn from (self teaching mostly), I don't really see an opportunity to move up here, not so great commute (which I wouldn't mind if there were less other cons), and I really hate living here.

I have been focusing more on NY recently (because I went to school in CT and frequented NY a lot and have a lot of family there too) and I would very much love to get a job there. Preferably as some sort of full stack/front end web developer. I have most of my internship and current job experience with C# type applications though. (I wouldn't be opposed to getting another job like this, but I much prefer the web stuff as I feel like I am best at it).

I'm hitting the 3 month mark soon at my current job and I already want out honestly. How long do you think I should stay here before I start applying again out of state? I don't have a contract, rather the contract is at-will meaning I can leave at any time. I was thinking that I start applying seriously at 6-8 months? I have sent out an application here or there since I've started, but very little. Maybe like once a week or something when I reflect on this job.

I understand everyone has to start somewhere, but I would prefer that somewhere to be somewhere else right now. I should be thankful, I have friends that are still looking and nearing the 6-7? month mark I believe. But again. I am trying to think about 

My career,

My pay,

and where I want to live where I will be happiest. 

I also attached my resume if anyone would like to critique it (not necessary, but if you're feeling generous!): http://imgur.com/a/oQ28K

I also have a website, but I won't list that here. If for some reason you want to see it please ask and I will PM you.

Thank you so much."
5f98gm,1,2016-11-27,Quitting?,RedHeadAlex,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/5f98gm/quitting/,I am very seriously considering leaving my current job at the start of 2017. I graduated from college in May of 2015 and have been at the same company ever since. I did an internship with this company the summer before I graduated and they offered me a full time position. I wasn't in LOVE with the job but it's pretty good pay and I was really nervous about graduating and not having a job so I took it. A year and a half later and I am in the same role at the same compamy and am totally miserable. I have been looking for a new job but haven't really gotten anywhere. My current job is just so exhausting. During the week I feel like I work and work and even when I am home I am still thinking about work. It never ends. I am nervous about quitting and not being able to find another job but I have a fair amount of money saved up so that wouldn't be a big issue. I just don't want to make a decision that will fuck up my future. I know the general advice is to not quit your current job until you have secured a new one but I am just so miserable. Advice?

5f9tcq,347,2016-11-27,I think a lot of you are going through something similar and I wanted to share this so you know you're never alone **Long Post**,[deleted],DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5f9tcq/i_think_a_lot_of_you_are_going_through_something/,"I am from downtown Boston, I actually live on the same street where the Boston Major will be held. I have been playing Dota 2 since TI3, I had played a little Dota 1 before that so I could appreciate how amazing of a tournament it was.

I began playing Dota more and more when the ranked system was introduced, and I want to share with you how so many days of these last couple weeks have been, and how depression can creep up so quickly with this game as a catalyst.

I am rolling around in bed, and I finally start to open my eyes for the last time before fully waking up and I turn over to my phone and it says 5:00pm. It is already dark outside and I had just been sleeping for about 10-12 hours, playing until 5 am last night. I am lying around too tired to get up right away so I watch twitch on my phone, a quarter final of a tournament is on, or a Russian streamer is blocking his minimap, playing Antimage or huskar and I watch them last hit and yell at them selves. I am so hungry but I get up and play one game before I eat because that's my way of waking up. I eat a lot, because it usually will be the only meal of the day before I begin playing again, I'll probably have some snacks in between games but for the most part this is it. I feel good and strong after I eat, I take a shower and return to my computer to do something productive. But I say to myself one game won't hurt, but I promise myself after one game I'll do something productive. I win the game and I feel like this is the beginning of a win streak, and that I finally figured out my problem with Dota, that "" I haven't been doing ""x"" so I say, fine I'll give myself a treat ""play until you lose!l"" I win 2 before I decide to random and go offlane, everyone flames me and we lose. Why would I random in ranked if I care about ranked? It seems that solo MMR is just work, if you are willing to not have any fun while playing than it will go way up, but after the first couple games, And everyone starts insta locking core, running around blood lusting people doesn't sound fun at all, even though that's often the path to victory, so I random instead and I lose. I'm upset but I realize I did this to myself, so I'm about to go to the gym when i get a message, ""Dota?"" It's a message from the guy I often party que with now, we've gotten so close now that we've friended each other on Facebook and support each other IRL, using the game as a platform for our mutual respect. I say to myself ""well when  I said play until you lose I meant solo que, I guess I'll play one with my friends."" We win, and everyone says ""g next"" and I played well last game and I want to carry them again, because it feels good to have their weight on my shoulders!


We play 2 more and it's approaching 11pm, and I haven't left Dota yet, but my brother texts me and says ""hey I'm coming home and I'll be 20 min, I can play a few games."" Well, I never get to play with my brother and we need one more! So we play, and play, and play because we aren't losing and everyone is happy, and now I'm the one convincing people to not go to sleep and continue playing, because you get a high when you're on a winstreak. 


It's 3 am, my room is a mess, and the kitchen even worse with dishes everywhere unwashed. I start to get depressed, I see that all the problems I had before the game started are here again, and I'm even further behind all my deadlines. I say to myself, ""tomorrow I'll just have a productive day and no Dota until I get ""x"""". I decide fine, if you are truly going to make tomorrow a productive day, I'm going to go to bed and watch some TV shows and fall asleep, it's 5am again and I look over to see how messy everything is again. I remember how good I felt at the end of a long run, or when I made my best friends proud of me. When I que, I always feel like I'm letting down my parents, my close friends, and just about anyone who cares about me in real life. So here I am trying to make people I don't know on the internet proud of me, instead of trying to make the people who actually care about me, proud. II have a friend who I am so close with, I actually use her name for my in game name and she just told me ""you know I don't understand the game, but I know that you are destined for bigger things than sitting in front of a computer all day."" We know each other because we went to this really competitive business program together, and we both started a company out of the program and came back to the program to become interns and teach others what we learned a year before in the program. She knew the running, jumping, and business minded version of me so when I told her about this side of me she was confused but I could tell she cared. She said ""you need to get rid of this game, and when you start making money, I expect a Hermes bracket."" The bracelet came up because we were talking about Christmas gifts, I felt so inspired by getting her that bracelet that I made it my background on my phone and decided ""ok, no more Dota"" but we know better, we know that Dota is a game for life. It isn't about if we are making our close friends proud or members of our party stack proud, it's whether or not we are making ourselves proud.

The reality is, when I am playing my 300th TA game and hitting my timings it feels more like a procedure than me playing a game. Ok, wraith band faire Fire, branch, and can I have two tangos please? Bottle, boots, blight stone, treads, Aquila, 13 min blink, 17 min deso, smoke Rosh get aegis and try to get outer towers with the team. Every game of Dota is different but when j play my most played heroes, I just think about my timings and it's like I'm playing single player. That's not fun for me anymore, I don't enjoy it, I get a little kick when the +25 hits but besides that, it just feels like I'm doing a procedure. Dota is not fun for me when I play my best heroes but it is the only way I can consistently win. My only driver is that I'll consistently be in games with pros soon, but for what? For them to flame me being one of the lowest Mmrs in the game, what has all of this been for?

After thousands ofmatches what is my motivation, I don't want this to be all for nothing. I message a member of my stack who I see still playing Dota at 5am and i tell him how I feel and he says ""I feel the same way, a legit copy."" So we say ""okay we are going to take care of each other, let's uninstall and not come back until we really achieve something!"" I share my problems with people that play the game because the reality is that some of you guys if not most know how this feels and when others say ""I need to see someone"" I try it but that someone doesn't play Dota that have no idea how it feels to hit a good sunstrike , it's like if I was a basketball player and had issues I'd want my therapist to play basketball, I know that might not be the best way to think about it but that's where I'm at.

I want to make one thing clear, I love Dota and I think it is a beautiful game. People often discuss the concept of The Void, that if I was not playing Dota it would be watching football or some other game, and I think people are right to a certain extent but you wouldn't watch football until 3 am and have a ridiculously messy room. The issue with Dota is that it starts bad habits, that instead of eating a full meal you just nibble on a snack, there is so much more to talk about and if anyone feels a similar way, you can just message me and we can talk.

TL;DR So many of your close friends have said ""you are so smart, you don't amount to just playing a computer game."" Well just do what makes you proud, not your friends, and maybe not even your family because if they really love you they will be proud if you are proud. Seriously, if you feel a similar way and are coming to the major I would be happy to have you stay with me, see you guys."

5f9vln,1,2016-11-28,Me [23M] with every girl. I have major issues.,Solinloveplzhelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5f9vln/me_23m_with_every_girl_i_have_major_issues/,"Hi /r/relationships. I have loads of issues with women and I'm hoping that one of you can talk some sense into me because this latest incident is really causing me to go insane.

I have never been lucky with women. I didn't get my first kiss until I was 18 and haven't had one since I was 20. I've never been in a real relationship before and am still a virgin. I see my friends getting in and out of relationships multiple times when I can only get a date or two. Anyways, this latest issue basically sums up my social life the past 6+ years. 

I met this girl this summer at my job. We'll call her Mary. Mary [21] came to my town from out of state for a temporary internship where I worked. We met for the first time at an after work thing and we really hit it off. We have loads in common and she sent me a friend request that night which never happens to me. Later that week I took her and a few other new interns to a nearby city they had never visited and I spent most of my time with Mary. I was later pressured to ask her on a date by these other interns. Mary agrees and I take her on a drive into the mountains and we spend all day together and she appeared to have a great time and agreed to another date later that week. This goes on for a few weeks before out of the blue, Mary tells me that she doesn't see me like that and this ""relationship"" is a bit one sided. Her reasoning includes that she will be gone by the end of the summer and that she doesn't want to start a serious relationship until she's like 27 (wtf?). She also said she didn't really feel like what we went on were dates because I wasn't being pushy for a kiss and we agreed to split expenses for the most part. I was hurt but I've been rejected multiple times before this. It would just be harder this time because I see her nearly everyday at work. 

Fast forward a few more weeks and I go to another after work get together at a local bar. I have no clue if Mary will be there or not because I've been trying to keep my distance for my own sake. Mary comes a bit after me and we start talking like normal. I mention an incident that happened at work and she leaves the conversation for about 15 mins (it was a touchy subject that was fresh on everyone's minds). I thought I upset her so instead of potentially making it worse, I go and talk to other people. I sit down outside and start having a nice conversation with a woman I haven't met but she was visiting and helping out at my job for a couple weeks. Mary comes back out and immediately sits right next to me (I mean RIGHT next to me like we're a couple). At this point I think she only had one beer so she's not drunk. As the night goes on, Mary starts holding my hand and other things that one would think indicates she likes me. She had another beer and at this point she's real tipsy. She starts taking off my boots and putting them on her own feet, she starts heavily leaning on me and falls into my lap, and shes basically cuddling with me. Some of my coworkers definitely notice and if they didn't know about the dates we went on earlier, they definitely know about us now. I am entrusted to take Mary home at this point. As we walk to my car, she has her arm in mine like a couple would have. I am a mix between excited and confused at this point. I had no intentions of doing anything bad to her. I just wanted to get her home (she was staying with another coworker who left earlier that evening). When I dropped her off I was so close to kissing her but I decided not to.

The next morning she texts me and apologizes for her behavior and asks that I don't take it the wrong way. I agree with her but who can really take what happened the previous night any other way? Any ways, another coworker was having a party that I was invited to. I asked Mary if she wanted to join me and when I asked my coworker if it would be ok to bring someone with me, they knew exactly who I was talking about.

I pick Mary up and everything is normal until we get to the party. Mary is pretty much ignoring me and trying her best to avoid me the whole night. I know I shouldn't have been thinking the way I was but I really thought that she was coming around to me after the previous incident. When I dropped her off that night, we had a long talk about how I was feeling and she told me the same things I've always heard from girls who reject me. After this I still had people asking where my girlfriend was when I would go to things without her. It was a rough summer. In the days before she was leaving, I wanted to see her again because I'm stupid. She kept ignoring me until she finally responded that she had already left. I didn't even get a goodbye. 

These past few months I text her about once every couple of weeks with updates about work which she asked me to do. Whenever I inquire about school or her life I get ignored. I'd pretty much gotten over her until tonight when I see on facebook her mentioning that she has a boyfriend. I know she has the right to change her mind but seeing that brought all these thoughts back to me. I was going to send her a card and small gift for Christmas but now I'm thinking I want to unfriend her because she just brings an unhappy rollercoaster of emotions to me whenever I see her statuses. I have really no desire to find someone else because I fell for this idea of Mary that wasn't real and no other girl can match up to that to me at this point. I'm at a real loss what to do right now because even though I thought I was done with her, I was still harboring a crush and a slim hope that eventually we could have something. 

Any advice on how you guys got over this sort of thing and how I can better myself to not be set up for disappointment again in the future?

TLDR: Met a girl, I fell hard, she leaves after leading me on, has a new boyfriend, I'm reeling."
5fa40h,6,2016-11-28,Not much faith left,doodlesdaturtle,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5fa40h/not_much_faith_left/,"Hey, everyone. I'm in a bit of a dilemma and wanted to see if anyone had some good advice or encouragement. 

I have been raised in the church and have considered myself to be a Christian for my entire life. I am a senior in college now, and throughout college I have been an officer in Cru at my university, participated in worship team, gone to retreats, etc. My faith was probably at its peak during my sophomore year but at this point it's all starting to get old. 

I don't have the motivation to pray or read my bible much anymore, I don't really feel any desire or benefit from it. Church feels very repetitive (worship, announcements/meet&amp;greet, sermon, leave). There are so many more things I could say but those are the basics. Everything about Christianity seems outdated and passive, and I feel like I'm seeing so many conflicting viewpoints in my bible study, sermons, and online because the Church is so fragmented. I have a very good head knowledge of Christianity so I'm very good at going through the motions for now.

At this point, I guess I'm trying to decide which side of the fence I want to be on. If I'm to continue to be a Christian, I don't want to be passive about it. But to me it seems that doing anything less than giving up everything (Luke 18:22) and going off to be a missionary or something, I'm being passive and I should be doing better. Every time Cru pushes missions trips I feel like an awful person because I'm choosing to work at an internship for my engineering career instead. But at the same time, I don't want to ignore my education and an engineering career. And I'm not sure how to be a Christian when I don't have any motivation to read my bible, pray, or ""share my faith with others"". 

Right now I'm single but if I meet a Christian girl, I don't feel like I would be in a good position to lead her spiritually. In fact, I am avoiding relationships right now because I don't want to put myself in a situation where my lack of faith could hurt someone else. I don't want to date a nonChristian either because that goes against the mentality I've grown up with, so I guess single is a good place to be.

I feel like I'm in a state of spiritual limbo, and I'm not sure what to do. I want to talk to someone about this, but I don't feel like I have a good adult mentor figure around, just lots of college students. Since I'm a Cru officer, I feel like I would rock the boat too much if I talked to someone at school about this. I feel like the other officers have it all together and I don't belong anymore. Help!

5fa5ff,1,2016-11-28,(Relationship) Me [22M] lost as to where to go and what to do about my relationship with depressed girlfriend [21F],b-nav,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fa5ff/relationship_me_22m_lost_as_to_where_to_go_and/,"(Tl;dr at bottom - posting this on iPhone late at night so my apologies about the lack of formatting)


Hey reddit,

First timer here, sorry if my protocol is out of whack. This is gonna be a doozy. I didn't want to turn to Reddit if I didn't have to but I think I'm at a point in my relationship where like I'm truly lost as to how to go forward. I really hope I can get something on here because any advice going forward is so appreciated. 

Context time -- I met my girl almost two years ago and it was a meeting out of a goddamn movie. I locked eyes with her across a room at a party, I never talked to her all night but whenever I looked at her, her eyes were locked with mine. She's fine as shit, black dress holding a glass of wine, damn. So right as I'm about to leave the party, my buddy nudges me and motions over to her. One foot out the door, I said fuck it and walked over to her and said ""I'm gonna kick myself in the ass repeatedly if I don't get your name."" She laughs and intros herself, I hug her goodbye, add her on facebook, and take her to coffee, and off we were. The honeymoon phase was fantastic; we were spontaneous, intimate, it was awesome. She had her social life and I had mine and I was in love. I told her I loved her and we had an amazing relationship. I was at a good point in my life, so was she, it was great. 

Now, she had told me a few weeks into us dating that she had gotten over severe depression but still suffers from it. Her anxiety didn't help either, but I was able to learn a lot and recognize when she would feel down. I was glad I could help. 

Fast forward to now, almost two years later. Her depression has resurfaced and she doesn't have much of a social life anymore outside of me as her depression keeps her from being able to make friends or come out to very many things. I've tried to bring her to a lot of my events but she doesn't like my friends. She's made efforts to come out and I think they've gone well but I think we've fought almost every night out. We've gotten into an argument because she would accuse me of being into friends of mine, because any time I would say anything she would see it as an attack on her, and then after all that, that if we ever break up I'll be okay because I have people but she won't because she doesn't have people. 

I love this girl, I love her with all of my being. We have had some amazing times but lately it's been gnawing away at me and I realized that I've lost a part of who I am because I've spent all my extra time with her, often cancelling on friends repeatedly to do it. I realized I have my own shit to deal with but I feel guilty for asking for nights to myself to  mentally recuperate by just being alone with my thoughts or playing video games even. Back two summers ago, she had said that she wouldn't want to spend every night together (I was on internship all last year, hence the two summer gap). She had also said that if we broke up, she would be okay. I loved that about her, how she could be so strong. But this past summer, we broke up; I kept trying to tell her that I wanted to talk and realign and figure stuff out together but she dropped the ""if you're going to break up with me, just do it"". She wouldn't entertain me for hours, so I finally told her that I wanted to call it quits. We were texting, she was at work, and she called me crying, and we talked it out and said we're still together and we can talk the following night after work. 

She came down, we talked it out, and decided that we would stay together. But I still feel that it's one sided. She has no desire to have sex with me even remotely as much as she used to, would get irritated whenever I asked and occasionally would do it (she says she does it when she wants to but part of me doesn't buy it and thinks she only does to appease me) but would get irritated if I didn't massage her one night (I do every single night before bed, I'm over at her house or we're at mine almost every night). I know massages and sex are different, and we got into a fight because she was able to finish herself and wasn't in the mood anymore and almost broke up again. I'm someone who views sex as a really big part of the relationship and she said that for her it's not, so after the argument we had, we decided to try and work last this issue but there has been no working past it haha.

Her parents don't know about her depression, she's struggling with stress and school and her placement, she sees psychiatrists but not regularly enough, and since I'm a massive piece of horse shit, I'm slowly not being able to handle these fights because they feed into my pathological inferiority complex because for whatever goddamn reason I attribute all of this to me being a worthless pile of trash. I have my own baggage and ways of feeing more grounded in the world, but I don't have time to self care because most of it is spent with her or around her. 

She doesn't have anyone else unfortunately and refuses to talk to anyone I recommend. She won't tell her parents and I'm scared that if we do break up, she'll hurt herself because she's told me she has before and still has feelings of them. Unfortunately, with my issues, I don't know if I'm mentally able to care of myself and be able to be there for her at the same time. 

But she's also cool as fuck and puts up with most of my nerdiness and superhero crap, she bought me badges, she Pokémon battled me a few times, and we watch shows together and I do love being with her. I just feel like a piece of shot because I don't know how to stand up for my feelings and be there for her, since me doing that is attacking her. And then cue the ""sorry I won't ever bring this up again goodnight, I love you"". And repeat circle of good and bad. 

tl;dr my girlfriend's depression is starting to affect me, I feel like I can't deal with my own baggage and be there for her, she makes it very hard for me to leave because I love her and it's almost like she guilts me into staying but I'm a fucking mondo piece of shit for wanting out a little bit.

5fa6rc,1,2016-11-28,Question about peculiar situation with internship interview,dawgisyoumadornaw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fa6rc/question_about_peculiar_situation_with_internship/,"About six days ago (last Monday), I got an email from an Intel software engineer asking me if I was interested in an internship (I had a family friend who is high up in Intel distribute my resume to a bunch of people he knew). I'm really new to the internship scene since I've never held an internship before and I'm only a sophomore in college. I told the engineer that I was and we had around a 20 minute phone call where we went over what I would be doing during the internship if I did accept it and some behavioral interview stuff. He then said he would send a recommendation to HR to send me an offer letter - does this mean that I've got a verbal offer? And how long does it take for them to extend an official offer letter?

Additionally, Intel is a hardware company but I'm really interested in software and mostly back-end development. The engineer said during the internship I would writing Python code to test hardware and some other stuff (I'm not too sure what it was - my memory is a bit hazy). But I'm afraid I won't get an internship with any other company that's as big as Intel. If I do get an offer, should I take it?

I've accepted an offer at a big 4 firm starting in audit next fall, and while I was initially excited about it I'm starting to have second thoughts. Throughout school I've always enjoyed my finance classes and excelled in them, and am looking forward to taking investments soon, and as I think more about starting in audit I'm feeling like I made the wrong choice.

My internship wasn't hard, and I loved the team I was on, but I think I'm realizing that I want to pursue something more finance related like investment banking. My school has excellent alumni connections, is it something where it would be terrible to reach out now to see how I could best transfer after a short time in audit? 

Sorry for the length of this, maybe I just need someone to remind me that I'm making a good choice, thanks!"

5fbg9p,1,2016-11-28,[23] Confused,creamCabbage,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/5fbg9p/23_confused/,"I am looking for advice as a 23 y/o male student. I read TRP and PPD for several months. Since then, I got into lifting weights, got a more attractive body and show some muscle from only 2.5 months of work in the gym. Proud of it so far. However, lifting does not solve my issues. You see, reading stuff online and after some thought, it seems that I severely lack in some fundamental building blocks of a normal human. First, I find that one of the most limiting factors is attractiveness of a human being. Never had success with girls. I had interest shown but I was very retarded with regards to social queues and these girls were not attractive to me. So, I left high school being a virgin. This never bothered me but having done some research, I found that male face is important and from my post on amiugly some time ago, one person said that I should get rid of my mild acne(agree, but this shit is not easy), and that my side profile shows receding chin and I lose points just from that. I was not called ugly but a bit below average looking. Never was too conscious about appearance but honestly this hit me very hard because I can't control that.

Secondly, after doctor's inspection, he stated that I have depression and wants to put me on meds. I can pinpoint what causes my unhappiness. One: lack of success with girls and people in general, two: my appearance, three: my studies. I study Computer Science. I am not bad at it, I am in like top 10% of students in top 10 school in the world but I find my interest in it dwindling and my depression and other mentioned issues hit my performance hard in my degree. He suggested to seek counselling but talking about these issues won't solve them. I know why depression is there and need to take action to fix these issues. Drugging me and yapping about positivity won't fix shit. Confidence only improves when achievements are unlocked. Gym is prime example of this.

On paper I am okay: several internships, study subject in demand etc. but I truly lack happiness and purpose in my life. After consideration, I know that girls would not fill this hole. I'd say becoming more attractive would help to my confidence, having more social action as well. I have no success with women because of how I look and act. I lived in 3 different countries so far and women are mostly repulsed by me. Can see it from body language and their expression on their faces.

I will cope with my studies somehow, but it seems that my life is held back by my looks, lack of social skills etc. I am not the kind of guy who gives a shit about looks to be honest but it is other people who care and inhibits my success in life with others.

Lifting lifts around 20% of my depression. A large part of it would be relieved by being more attractive and getting more attention. 20-30% would still remain, mostly because not feeling in my place or having a clear mission and being good at something. How do I smash through attractiveness barrier? I understand that some women just won't touch you without great face but I am depressed when I study at uni with 70%-30% men ratio and am still single. Something is very offputting about me.

Any advice guys?"

Can someone please help me out?,SurpriseJohnCena,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5fbpfh/ive_never_told_anyone_how_i_feel_and_this_is_the/,"I've felt lost since the later stages of high school when it was time to apply to colleges. I've never been a great student or on top of my work, been a messy and unorganized person and never felt motivated to better myself. I like to think that I'm a smart person, but I feel so much pressure all the time about how I've messed up in the past and never took anything seriously until it was too late.

I'm in the later stages of college now. After failing admission to my major of choice, I've settled for studying economics because that's what my older sister studied and she is very successful with it so I thought I'd try it. It's not important, but the material makes sense but once again I feel no motivation to actually study it. I'm at a 2.8 GPA and seriously struggling to find anything in terms of internships or anything that can prepare me for when I'm actually an adult, and the pressure is killing me.

I looked at my grades this morning, and I've got 3 C's, and only taking 3 classes. Another semester I'm destined to screw up, and one semester closer to having to finally deal with the consequences. When I see my grades, I feel the temporary motivation to do work, but that quickly dies off when I convince myself nothing matters. I feel like i need to desperately grasp at the depression that I feel when reality hits me once in awhile to finally get me in the right place, but it feels so terrible all the time when you let it get into your head.

I'm just so worried because my parents didn't have much and they worked so hard to allow me to go to college and I just feel like I'm disappointing them whenever I think about it. My sister graduated with a 4.0 and now works for one of the most prominent I-banks in the world, and I can't muster the motivation to keep myself on track when I'm studying or doing homework.

Whether it's school or relationships with friends or decisions I've made, I never feel like I'm doing enough or anything right. What do I do? I don't know how not to feel like this. I don't know how to fix my motivational issues or start doing the right things, because I know that I'll do it once and all of that motivation will be gone until the next time I suck myself back into the same issue. I feel like I'm stuck in a loop. "
5fbthc,9,2016-11-28,story time: how I kinda sorta went NC,peri_enitan,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5fbthc/story_time_how_i_kinda_sorta_went_nc/,"hi dear redditors,

due to an inability to let the past be the past I'd like to share what I can recall about how I went NCish with most of my extended exfamily.

So theres been two really big fights I had with my core exfamily. They were similar in structure and I think I remember the second one better. I'll recount what I can:

At one point I was doing a studies related internship in my exparents hometown. I was 19 at the time and slept at my exparents place in my old room. (Which my exmother had made into her room the moment I moved out. My exmother welcomed this, I was too ""difficult"". Namely I insisted in pointing out that I'd like to sleep and eat the way I please through my actions. My exparents truly did help me move out, they knew control came in different ways.)

I don't remember what we fought about only that I wanted to take a walk to cool down but unable to verbalise/justify my need. My exmother raged terribly. The rule was nothing happens until she allows it. You needed to justify yourself to her holiness. Both my exbrother and my exfather somehow ignore that. Only I wanted to be good enough to make her happy in the false assumption you can make her happy.

So my darling exmother violently kept me from leaving the house. She smashed me on the stairs hard and I locked myself into her new room, packing. I truly only wanted to take a walk before. Now I wanted to go away. She in turn wanted to force admit me to psychiatry. I had made countless experiences of authority figures siding with my exmother and she may have well manipulated everyone to do her bidding that day.

Eventually my exfather came home from work, playing judge, because even her holiness defers to him. He said she can't call an ambulance on me and needed to let me go. So I left and travel to my student flat. I waited 40 mins at the train station for the next hourly train. It never occurred to me to talk to anyone. I knew trying to get help was futile because my exparents were very successful in taking away my ability to describe my troubles in a way that someone would listen.

I hurt for three days on my back, the place where my exmother had smashed my spine against the edge of the stairs. I did what I always did. I kept on keeping on with my internship. Talking to no one. My reference says I was passive but otherwise brilliant.

When I was walking home to my flat I met an old exbf of mine whom I wasn't in contact with anymore. My exparents later called him and asked if I was still alive. He said yes and they ended the call.

I didn't talk to them for half a year. They tried contacting me but only after tat time I answered a call from my exfather. We talked I said I had a cold, he drove to me immediately with some medication. (Control, its not like hed drive me to a doctor to get prescription... Also hoovering/lovebombing I guess.)

The next time I actually met my exparents was when I visited my exmothers older sister (those who follow these longwinded texts going nowhere in particular: that the fundamentalists) and her family. This excousin (the oldest of our generation) just had a new little minion (the first of the next generation) everyone was working on shaping into the dysfunctional mold. (How CUTE!) The little one did help me stay grounded a little. I must have been mortally scared but I don't feel my emotions. 

We slowly had more contact over the next years again. But I think this was still the first christmas I spent away from my exfamily. My exmother did walk on eggshells around me. I could tell she was terribly scared and hurt by how I abandoned her. She was also utterly disinterested in working on ways to not loose her temper anymore or stop being so entitled and controlling. 

The closest they ever got to acknowledging my needs was when I was to cat sit my earliest and bestest friend. I still miss him violently. I sent my exparents a shopping list of foods for the week and they bought all the items on it. This comes from the exfather who insisted I wouldn't mind the onions if he cut them small enough and the exmother who sat at countless lunch and dinner tables watching me spend a stupid amount of time picking out onions while everyone ate.

And they got me to move again. For public student housing to a flat one of their friends had in the town. Of course they helped. I remember how much my exfather harassed me over my messy tendencies when packing. Doesn't have anything to do with how they use materialism to control and how I was supposed to hold on to everything not matching my tastes, sensory issues, size or practical uses.

When I was in my early 20s (23 maybe??) the last big fallout happened. It was quite the drama in a few acts and all. It started when my then bf and I had a fight and I reached out online to my exbrother for support. I first asked him if exmother was around. I didn't want her to interfere, knowing her histronics or whatever cluster b disorder she suffers from. I told my exbrother this (in less psych terms) and explained how I was fighting with this person and that I think about breaking up. 

My exbrother in his infinite wisdom explained to me how I had to accept any and all sorts of abuse because I was wearing sunglasses. His unexplained but no less heard reasoning was this: he didn't like it when I wore sunglasses, I wear them anyway. Thus I don't care about his feelings thus no one should care about mine. He was of course utterly amnesiac of any explanation concerning autism and light sensitivity. I did something he couldn't control, thus everything including cancer as such is all my fault. You know sometimes the fundamentalists seem more logical.

I went offline shortly after chewing him out a bit because I wanted to cool down. I wrote him again in the morning how this was hurtful and unacceptable. He was thoroughly unremorseful and impressively unrepentant. I was at my wits end and decided to stop talking to him because he doesn't listen to what I say anyway. I still wrestle with this. It may have been silent treatment, it may have been wrong but I still don't know any better way I could have handled it. Over the next months he was badgered by our two younger cousins to apologise and eventually sent me something that was so impressively unapologetic that I needed to have another dysfunctional ""friend"" point out to me that this was supposed to be and apology. The basic message was ""I'm sorry you are hurt by how I'm pointing out the truth. I can't help that tho."" 

I kept not talking to him. At all. I am autistic and have been raised by an exfather who is also on the spectrum and very fond of the silent treatment. Said exfather is also so detached and aloof its sometimes hard to distinguish between silent treatment and him just being as unresponsive as ever. I have inherited this trait through nature and nuture I can be very aggressively and toxically silent.

Meanwhile my interfering female relatives kept interfering presumably. I mostly got lectures by exmother. I kept telling her how this was between me and my exbrother and how we were both grown ups. Apparently my exbrother told her the same thing. But of course no one does anything without her approval. She had a remarkable skill to forget and keep wearing us down for months. I still think she may truly forget things that don't fit into her world view. Meaning depending on her world view she remembers different things. Some entirely fabricated. I fear I might be similar.

I'm not sure if anyone worked on my exbrother except my exmother. My exfamily plays a game of controlopoly. Whenever theres something that doesn't fit someones view of reality they attack it in the name of ""caring"" until it goes away (no compromises, no hostages, this is war, where you attack things that apparently threaten your life or something). At the end everyone was just a lot more tense and nothing is solved. You know the way loving families are supposed to be.

It predictably came to an explosion (many headstrong people in my exfamily too) when I was visiting my exparents and I again left my exparents home. My hurt exmother who wanted me so badly to never abandon her again of course didn't see that coming. Another rule is no ones needs are more important than controlopoly. By this time my exparent still didn't actually know what my exbrothers and my initial disagreement was about. My brother and I simply were attacked for violating the rules. The specifics didn't matter as much. (They tried to get us to talk but neither of us budged until this point.)

I ended up staying away for good this time. I never set foot in my exparents house since then. The student flat I lived in was still rented out by the pastor who had married my exparents and christened me. Control does come in many ways.

I sent my exmother (who is the one to talk about emotions at all in my core family, usually for the sake of drama but I think you all already knew that) an email declaring I needed time to sort through this. How my diploma thesis was approaching and how I'd get back to them when I was ready.

Of course she accepted that...

... until controlopoly was too important again. So after another christmas away I got my christmas gifts per mail after they had received my christmas gifts per mail. They had a little plastic comic toy and invited me to join them watching the musical spin off in the city the cousins lived in. Mind you not the actual ticket. They somehow thought they could bribe me back again.

I agonised for days. The violation of my boundary was of course nothing new, but I felt scared to spend time surrounded by these people, including two 5 hour drives. In the end I flipped this on them. I told them I would go if everyone accepted that I wasn't talking to exbrother. I got a martyring email from my exmother how she couldn't see that or anything concerning us as a family working at all. So I didn't go and they couldn't paint me as the bad guy. I was quite proud of that even if I really wanted to see the musical. Still do. One day when I'm well enough to work again...

Over the years my exparents made various attemps to manipulate me back. My exmother was ""dying"", exfather was ""dying"" and disowned me when I didn't visit him in intensive care. He never said he wanted to see me and my exmother didn't tell me details about where he was. Just drama drama TALKTOMEGODDAMMIT, then my maternal exgma was ""dying"". The fundamentalist exaunt gave me her number in hospital and I called. Saying goodbye and feeling filthy. Then my exmother ""died"" again. I kid you not. Then my maternal exgma died again. This time someone actually died. Sometime my paternal exgma called and left a voicemail how my paternal exgpas BIL died (paternal exgpas sister was the last person I still visited regularly, I stopped about a year before this happened.)

My personal highlight was an SMS my exmother sent me. She told me about the second time my exgma was in hospital and how if I wanted to know more I should cal... SMS stopped in the middle of the word. Second SMS soon after how this was sent to me by accident. I was never more happy to receive confirmation of how she intentionally kept information to get someone to call. I doubt there was any other person she needed to contact this way.

I didn't react to any of these except my exfather. I got a funeral invitation from my middle exaunt. 2 days before the funeral, which was in the middle of nowhere 3 hours away and had no personal message at all. Last thing they know I have no drivers license and no car. Still true. Maybe I was supposed to grow wings and fly there. Or use the awesome powers of ""all my fault"" to warp spacetime. Or it was the millionth attempt to get me to contact an exfamily member.

Me not showing up at the funeral apparently made the message of I refuse to be manipulated sink in deep enough to have my exmother stop guilting me about my extended exfamily health issues. 

The next thing that happened was that my exfather unilaterally decided to withdraw the disownment 2 years after the fact because it didn't get him what he wanted. He visited me unannouced. My exflatmate let him into the house and he walked into my room while I was still asleep. Now he wanted to talk. I still remember how he tried to press every button they ever installed in me just by looking at me pitiful, nonthreatening and well meaning. The buttons he pressed fired like crazy and I still sent him away. Not because I felt it was a good idea but because I KNEW it was a bad idea to let him have this. He left, sending a vague email about my landlord (his friend) being concerned about me as soon as he got home. Which I also didn't respond to.

Somewhere along the line I blocked fundamentalist exaunt because she wouldn't stop calling and messaging me, preferably at times my then crazy sleep rhythm had me be asleep for 3-4 hours. I also blocked another cousin who called me asocial for not submitting to her controlopoly. (I was supposed to be the good little daughter to my exmother because my excousin wanted it.) I think my exmother has replaced me with her and honestly she isn't nearly meek enough to endure this even the ""grown up daughter"" variety. One excousin has attemoted to FM me about the missed funeral (see my submissions for detail if this is seriously not wordy enough yet). The spouse of one excousin has quitely unfriended me, another has apparently cooperated with some excousin or other to watch my FB wall and had his FMing blow up in his face (another submission of how he knew what happened during my childhood better than I...). The spouse of another excousin (I don't seem to run out of cousins and spouses of excousins doing weird shit...) made a habit of undermining my competence on my fb wall and when I fired back called me out on not attending ""family"" meet ups. I asked her why I'd want to meet up with people who seem to think a science diploma didn't mean I was qualified to do basic math. She deleted the entire thread in a huff. I think she also unfriended me.

By now I moved again. Without the help of my exparents and to an address unknown to them. No more christmas controlopoly strings. Slowly getting rid of past controlopoly strings (among them I need to accept therapy and religion will not be helpful, whole different cans of worms) and working on improving my health. I have gained almost 25% of my former weight and have now a healthy weight, treated Vitamin D deficiency, found an antidepressant that helps with my sleep issues and generally have raised my energy levels among other ways by reading posts in this sub. Slowly trying to separate wheat from chaff, learning what is right and what is wrong, what I need and how to feel things and how to do dishes, clean floors, do laundry and the like. Thanks everyone for listening to my rambling before I managed to find whats important to put into words and what isn't! 

I still ponder if I should let police know about any of this, most of it happened too long ago I think and I violated my own request for them to stop contacting me multiple times. They don't seem the type to pull this shit in a place where they don't know the landlord. Also no one will easily let them into the room I'm sleeping in anymore. They'd need my consent or I assume some police person to help them gain entrance. I'd hope police would contact me without them first.

Thank you all again for your attention!"

We've been together for 5 1/2ish years and I don't think love is enough anymore. I know he loves me deeply and will stay by my side forever but I feel like I need more than that for us to be happy and thrive when we grow older. 

He went through depression which massively delayed his degree (he went to counselling and took medication for this). He finishes next year and expects to get a job straight out of college with no experience. He does not do any part-time or casual work and gets an allowance from his parents ever since he finished highschool. I pushed him to apply for internships or part-time work and he didn't want to as he was ""afraid of rejection"". I have communicated to him in many different ways the importance and benefits of work for his career and self-esteem, but nothing came of it. 

It's come to a point where I can't wait around for him to get his act together anymore. I have had numerous talks about this and how I can't stay with him if he continues this. But because I haven't left yet he knows I won't be going anywhere. His days revolve around video games and reddit. I don't understand, all his friends have their shit sorted but he doesn't care at all. 

I am just so frustrated! I feel like our shared goals (moving out, looking for a house) are delayed because of him and I can't help but feel resentful. Sometimes I feel bad for feeling like this because he is genuinely one of the most kindest, selfless people I have ever met and he has done so much for me. There was a point where I knew this was the man I was going to marry and be with for the rest of my life but now... I feel like a fool for even trying to believe that. I won't lie but I am scared of leaving in case I make the biggest mistake.

This isn't the first time I felt like this. I have had these doubts perodically but usually push them out because I love him and want to believe he will change. But it's been so long that I feel like he will stay like this forever. He always tells me to wait after he graduates and that he won't obviously be like this forever but his actions and decisions show otherwise.  

I have graduated (also worked and interned during my studies) and work full-time in my field. Have we just grown apart? Has the relationship run its course or am I just finding excuses to leave? Am I being shallow? 

I am sorry if this post is all over the place. I am hoping someone can shed some light for me. 

TL;DR: been with my boyfriend for 5 1/2 years who is still studying and is unemployed throughout our entire relationship. I have doubts about our future and can't see myself marrying him. Has the relationship run its course or am I just finding excuses to leave?"

5fc2en,1,2016-11-28,Is Matt Nagy the next great NFL coach?,ZandrickEllison,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5fc2en/is_matt_nagy_the_next_great_nfl_coach/,"Before we dive too deeply into that title question, we should answer the obvious elephant in the room first.

**who the hell is that?**

Let's start with Matt Nagy's basic background. A successful college QB at Delaware, Nagy's limited physical attributes led him to the Arena League. He had a good six-year career there, where he put up stats that any fantasy football fan or Madden player would envy, including 85 touchdown passes in 2006 alone.

After his playing career, Nagy worked as a coaching intern with Andy Reid's Eagles team in 2009. The team actually signed Nagy to be a player-coach, figuring he could serve as a 3rd QB as well, but the NFL league office nixed that plan. Nagy focused on coaching instead.

Since then, Nagy's tagged along with Andy Reid and worked his way up the ladder in Philadelphia and now Kansas City, going from QB coach to now co-offensive coordinator (along with Brad Childress) this season.

All in all, the 38-year-old Nagy still has a thin resume, as far as NFL head coaches go. Despite that, there are a few promising comparisons we can make on his behalf.

**the Doug Pederson corollary**

Nagy's following in the footsteps of the Chiefs' last offensive coordinator, Doug Pederson. Like Nagy, Pederson was an Andy Reid QB, then an Andy Reid QB coach, then an Andy Reid offensive coordinator.

Pederson had three years in that last role before he got hired as the head coach in Philadelphia. At the time, there were plenty of question marks about the move. After all, Pederson had basically been hidden in Reid's shadow his entire coaching career. Reid calls the plays (as he does now), and filters that through his offensive coordinator. What the OC contributes to that process and game plan in KC is still murky, which made Pederson's coaching prospects murky as well.

Wisely, Pederson surrounded himself with a series of veteran assistants in Philadelphia. His defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has always thrived in that role, and also comes armed with head coaching experience. Pederson even employed experienced assistants on offense as well, as both OC Frank Reich and QB coach John DeFillipo have been coordinators in the past.

Carson Wentz and the Eagles have been up-and-down in 2016, but by and large, I don't think any Eagle fan would ask for a mulligan on the coaching hire. The playoffs may not work out this season, but the future still looks bright in Philly.

**the Jay Gruden corollary**

Doug Pederson's the obvious comp for Matt Nagy, but the success of Jay Gruden should be considered as well. 

Like Nagy, Gruden cut his teeth in the Arena League before joining the NFL. Gruden played QB and coached -- sometimes at the same time -- with great success, including two Arena Bowl championships.

While there are obvious differences between playing styles, that Arena League experience has colored Gruden's coaching so far, especially in Washington. He attacks all over the field, and has made Kirk Cousins (seen as a game manager) one of the most productive QBs in the league.

Now, it may be unfair to compare Matt Nagy to Jay Gruden, given how much more experienced Jay Gruden was at the time of his hiring in Washington. Gruden had 10 years of head coaching experience in the Arena League, as well as two years of being the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati, where he took far more ownership over the offense than Nagy has in KC. 

Still, Jay Gruden shows that Matt Nagy's AFL background shouldn't be seen as a slight; in fact, it may make him more aggressive of a play caller than other Chiefs coaches have been so far. 

**the Luke Walton corollary**

This off-season, the hottest coaching prospect in the NBA was a 36-year-old Luke Walton, who had been best known for his playing career. (okay, really, best known for his father.)

After only two years as an assistant in Golden State, Walton had been tapped as the interim coach for an injured Steve Kerr. The team raced out to a 39-4 record, although it was hard to credit Walton too much for that. After all, this was the Warriors. Basically any coach in the league (aside from Mark Jackson) could roll the ball out there and have the team score 110 points.

When the Lakers hired the young Walton this off-season, there were some question marks about whether he was ready or not. There were also those question marks about whether or not he had simply been riding the Warriors' gravy train. After all, the last Warriors' lead assistant, Alvin Gentry, had been off to a poor start in New Orleans.

So far, so good for Luke Walton and the Lakers. He's managed to install the Warriors' offensive concepts well, and helped milk the most out of a young squad. The Lakers' players seem to love him, and view his youth and relatability as an asset rather than a negative.

Obviously coaching in the NFL is a different animal (and much more complex), but there's something to be said for getting in on the ground floor.

######**conclusion**

Given his inexperience, Matt Nagy wouldn't be my first choice as a head coach for 2017 (that would be the more proven young star Kyle Shanahan).

However, if I couldn't land Shanahan, Nagy would be someone that I would at least interview for the job. After all, when you look at the landscape of possible head coach openings, you see a lot of franchises that are going to need to develop a QB (Jacksonville, possibly Chicago, Los Angeles, the N.Y. Jets...) Nagy would appear to be a good candidate to help steer a young QB in the right direction. If paired with a proven and veteran defensive coordinator, he may turn out to be an inspired selection."

This is the end result of lurking here for a long time and combining suggestions from several templates and resources. The Profile section and the relevant coursework will of course get modified to match the skills the job description mentioned, but this is my best hack at it before any application-specific changes. 

I do have some additional work experience, but it's typical teenager-summer-job stuff and I'd rather eschew it for more of the meat.

Some things I'd like to change but am a little stuck on: 

- In ""Grew to fill a void in the team..."", I'd like to be a little stronger - maybe ""Took initiative to expand responsibilites"", but that doesn't sound quite right. What else could I say here?

- I want to make it clearer that I'm pretty damn good with Excel - IF(), SUMIF()/COUNTIF(), VLOOKUP()/HLOOKUP(), INDEX(MATCH()), pivot tables/charts, slicers, conditional formatting; no VBA yet, but I'm working on it. The bullet points further down do a good job with that, but what's a better way to quickly describe this in-line in the Profile, beyond ""advanced experience with Excel,"" which can mean basically anything?

- The second point under Intern is a bit weak, but my work at that time was pretty anaemic in terms of the ""wow"" factor. How could I best punch it up a bit?

Any other criticisms are welcome as well - thank you so much for the time and attention!"

I want to do a project over winter break both for my own amusement and as an experience to make myself a more appealing candidate for an internship. 

I have some experience with Android studio and would like to be able to communicate with my pi from an Android app via Bluetooth.  I have found some tutorials that do this.  However, some tutorials use an arduino.  Are there any other good ways to set Bluetooth up with a pi?  

I have some experience with robotics and my end goal is to be able to have a robot setup that I can control from my phone.  It doesn't have to be too advanced.  Maybe almost like a remote controlled race car. I have also looked at the pi sense hat and think that that would be an interesting tool to work with and integrate into a design.  How would I set this up to communicate with my phone?  Are there any really good tutorials that you would recommend?

5fcuhh,3,2016-11-28,23/M/EU - Not sure where to go with my life; Would love to just talk and listen to others,Vitesze,MakeNewFriendsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/5fcuhh/23meu_not_sure_where_to_go_with_my_life_would/,"I'm not really the person for lengthy reddit posts as I feel I can express myself far better in a one-on-one conversation, but I will make a short introduction of myself.

I've always been kind of a loner throughout my life, not because of actual social anxiety or anything, but rather because I never felt motivated to leave the door. People would occassionally invite me over to do stuff, and I was always more concerned about what could go wrong (me having to spend an afternoon being bored and people wondering why Im not a sociable chitchat and all) rather than what could go right. Anyway oddly, I was never really bothered by this. My life was going by smoothly, uneventful, and I was at peace with it.

But I am now becoming increasingly anxious about this situation and feeling motivation to change things around. I don't know how, but I want to. I have absolutely zero friends or people I talk to irl, I have some Steam friends but I wouldn't call that a social life.

My life is about to hit a critical point as I'm nearing my graduation, after which I, I dont know, hit a more permanent period in my life? College is THE time for meeting new people, having fond experiences with friends, and so on and I feel I missed out on that. In an ultimate attempt to break this routine I am in (as i truly fear living the rest of my life like this) I decided to go for a 6-month internship abroad (not sure yet where; possibly USA or Scotland) waaaaay out of my comfort zone, give it my 1000% to be sociable and active and see what will happen. I feel that the worst thing that can happen is that it won't work out, but to me that is less worse than never having tried to change things around and then being left wondering what life could have been.

Anyway, look at me saying how I am not the person to type lengthy posts, and then rambling on like this. What I am looking for right now, is some friends with whom I can chat regularly with. I figured out that although for me the barrier for talking with someone irl is big, through the internet I feel more at ease and can express my thoughts and feelings better. I do not care if you're male or female (in fact, given the fact all my close steam friends are male, it would be nice for a change to talk to a female about this) or age, though a person at a similar stage of his/her life would be better to relate to me, and vice versa. But don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for a one-way conversation; I also love just listening to people and what theyre doing in life. If you feel insecure or uncertain or whatever about things in your life, feel free to hit me up too! The last few weeks, I have been chatting a lot with an internet-friend of mine and the conversations had a good infuence on me, as in, feeling more motivation to change things around

Right now, Steam really is my go-to place right now for conversations: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053561597 , or on Skype: xphantazm. I'm currently working on my thesis at home a lot, meaning I'm not commited much to scheduled things. I normally don't ignore a friend invitation/conversation starter, but please introduce yourself first in a Reddit PM so I know who you are :). I would not be unwilling to meet up with someone in real life either, but only after chatting I feel really comfortable with that person.

I am about to have mental breakdown.",reallyannoyedstudent,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fczff/me_23f_with_my_2_classmates_2027_they_are_the/,"I'll call one of them E and the other on S. 


I first met E two semesters ago. E was that person in class who would constantly ask unrelated and unimportant questions during class, and it would only slow the lecture down. E constantly brags about their grades and their almost perfect GPA, however, neglects to acknowledge that they are only taking 10 credits, does not work, and still lives with their parents while collecting welfare (this person has no disabilities or dependents). 


A few weeks ago, E and I were assigned a project together, and had to spend excessive time together because of it. The whole time, E belittled my religion (because I wear a symbolic necklace), and told me, ""No offence, but I went through that phase, too"" as if my lifelong religion was a phase. E is constantly disrespecting my religion and acts like some high and mighty atheist. I try to respectful of them, but I always feel attacked. 


E is also apart of a club that I am president of. E has tried to take over multiple times because they do not work or have any responsibilities, so they dedicate all of their time to write ups and proposals. E has tried to call me out for not being involved enough, when no other member has a problem with my level of involvement. I should also mention I work a fulltime internship while taking 15 credits and am disabled. I don't collect disability or welfare and live on my own, so my patience for E and S are very limited. E also tries to belittle my mental illness, telling me that, ""it's not really a disability, so it doesn't matter"". 


E is also an extremely jealous person, and is extremely jealous of me. I recently was offered two internships with big companies, mainly because I broke my back over networking and extracurriculars. E has tried to diminish the accomplishments my bragging about their scholarships and being on the dean's list, and insinuates that they will get a job that's better than mine. E will also shit talk any successful student or person to their face if they are jealous of them, which means that I get backhanded remarks directed at me. 


S is a very good friend of E's, and is just as loud in class as E is. S is slightly more tolerable than E, however, S will not stop bragging about the things they buy (with their welfare money) and about their grades. S also lives at home without a job and is on welfare. While S is more tolerable than E, S's constant bragging (which is directed at me because my GPA isn't as high) is extremely draining, and it is for other students as well. 

You may ask, why not just avoid them? Well, in my major, there are only 20 of us, so we are a small group who is forced to stick together. 

I don't know how to handle them, please help.

5fd3xy,2,2016-11-28,How should I explain a 1+ year gap?,werzor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fd3xy/how_should_i_explain_a_1_year_gap/,"I graduated from college 18 months ago. I haven't had a job since graduating, so I'm wondering how I should tackle the question when an interviewer asks.

Honestly... the reasons for the gap aren't so good.

- Shortly after graduating, my gastrointestinal system started acting up (rapid weight loss, nausea, etc), and I went to see a few doctors. They did some tests over the span of a few months, but ultimately didn't find anything wrong. I didn't want to start a new job at the time because it was between all the tests, even though I felt OK most days.

- Even after the tests finished, I wasn't sure that I really wanted a job... I only applied to a few close-by jobs during the time since I don't feel comfortable going too far away from home.

- In the meantime, I didn't do much by way of extracurricular activities... No volunteer work, no travel... Just a few online Coursera courses, which I took for free (so no certificate, either). The rest of the time was spent doing my own thing (not relevant to CS/software, unfortunately).

Everyone I've talked to so far recommended not talking about being sick, since it's still ""undiagnosed"" and I still have problems with it sometimes (mostly nausea). 

Since it's been over a year, I'm thinking the gap will just get tougher and tougher to explain, so I guess I need to find any sort of CS-relevant job now. (I've mostly been looking at entry-level stuff, or even internships.)

How should I explain the gap as it is now?"

5fdg5m,49,2016-11-28,Ghosts are not my biggest fear.,yoink1777,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5fdg5m/ghosts_are_not_my_biggest_fear/,"I suppose this all started with my girlfriend’s “haunted” apartment. I say haunted, but in all honesty, that was her belief and hers alone; I’ve always been quite disinclined to believe in the supernatural. I was never the one shaking in his boots, when my dad would tell me and my brothers ghost stories around the campfire, but even still, I have to admit that there were some very peculiar things that transpired at my girlfriend’s apartment.

About a month after she moved into her new place, she started complaining to me about little things happening: hearing footsteps at night, things being in different places than where she left them, hearing soft breathing when she was alone. You know, just your typical ghost stuff. I always just brushed it off, assuming she wasn’t used to living without any roommates and wasn’t used to her new apartment. I started staying the night with her pretty often, and I remember very specifically the first night that I started to believe something was up.


I was in bed next to Ava when I heard the footsteps. Ava stirred beside me, and I knew she was awake. 
“You hear that too, right?” She whispered, as she pulled herself tight against me. 
“Don’t worry, babe. It’s probably nothing. I’ll go check it out.” I whispered back, only half believing what I said. 

The footsteps quieted, and the only thing I could hear now was my heart rhythmically malleating my rib cage. I whispered to Ava to stay right where she was. I grabbed the .22 that I had brought over, and crept up to the door and threw it open. I couldn’t make out much in the darkness, so I flicked on the lights and found absolutely nothing. I checked the rest of the kitchen and peeked in the bathroom but only found a whole lot more of nothing. 
“There’s nothing out there. It must have been someone walking around on the floor above us. You can go back to bed.” I reported as I walked back into the bedroom.

I still locked the door when I came back in though. And I still held Ava especially tight as my mind drifted off to far away places, because skeptical of ghost or not, I swear somehow I knew there was something wrong right then and there. 

The next day we were a little shaken, so we decided to take a trip down to our favorite spot, a secluded little beach surrounded by a mangrove preserve. Before we left, I decided it would probably be best to relinquish my bowels before venturing out to a beach in the middle of nowhere. Sitting on the toilet, I heard Ava call out to me.
	
“Hey James, have you seen my keys?”
	
“No. I haven’t seen them since yesterday.”

Well haunted or not, this is one hell of an apartment, I thought as I looked around the bathroom. It was furnished with candles and pictures of little Italian towns. There was even a huge closet next to the shower that could be filled with towels, soap, shampoo, and what have you. Sure as hell a luxurious apartment. Ava came over and opened the door as I was washing my hands.

“I haven’t seen them since yesterday, either.” She said with a frown. “And we can’t leave without locking up.” 
We retraced steps, but came up empty. We checked out the entire apartment and found nothing. Finally, I rechecked the bathroom, and there they were. Right by the sink. 
“Found them, babe!” 
“I never ever put them here. I swear this place is haunted.” She muttered. “Let’s go. I want to get out of this place.” 

We spent the entire day holding each other and watching the waves stroke the shore. We set up a blanket and felt so small as the sun started to disappear into where the sea becomes the sky. The day’s last rays of sunlight danced on Ava’s dirty blond hair, and I couldn’t help kissing her. Next thing I know she’s wrapped around me, and we’re wrapped up in the darkness of the night. 
“Let’s go back to the car. I don’t want to get you all sandy.” she whispered with a smirk. Her breath tickled my face, and I could smell the winter mint gum she always chewed.

We walked back to the car hand in hand. We were the only car parked outside of a little shack that rented out kayaks during the day. The road that led to the beach was a straight shot to the shore, but there was also a cul-de-sac off to the side, tucked into the mangrove forest where the shack was situated. 


The less clothing we had on, the more the windows started to fog as we messed around in the back seat. Ava’s hand’s fluttered around the strings of my bathing suit, but then she quickly pulled them away.
“Shit! Look someone’s coming.”
I look up to see headlights. There was a car coming down the road. It turned into the cul-de-sac, and we could see it was a beat-up pickup truck. 
“Babe, put some clothes on, this might be private property.” Ava, said as she threw a shirt at me. 
But whoever was in the truck didn’t bother us. Hell, maybe it was just another couple looking for a spot to bang. The truck lurched around the entire cul-de-sac, stopping only briefly to look at us. 


“Well, uhh, that was weird. But let’s get back to it.” I chuckled while Ava kissed my neck. But after another five minutes or so, the truck came back, and did the same thing, and again we stopped only to watch It slowly circle the cul-de-sac. When it happened for the third time, Ava groaned as she saw it. 
“The truck is coming, again.”

 I was getting pretty tired of this shit. 
	
“Well the truck isn’t what’s supposed to be coming right now. There not going to do anything anyways, so let’s just ignore it.” 
	

And with that it was settled. The truck left the cul-de-sac, and the outside world disappeared to us. We held hands and locked eyes as our bodies fused together. I winced with pain and turned my head to the side as she gave me a deep scratch down my back. That’s when I saw him. There was a man standing right outside the side window staring and standing dead still. He was dressed in a hoodie with a ragged flannel over it. He had a huge frame, but that was about the only distinguishable feature because he wore a hat and his hood up so that shadows enshrouded his face.


“holy shit! Put on clothes babe. Put on clothes. There’s someone outside.” I ordered as I scrambled off of her. 
	

“Roll down the window, once we get our clothes on, babe. He probably just wants us to leave.” Ava said, trying to hide how flustered she was. 


“Well, he sure as hell doesn’t look like he wants to chit chat.” I responded. “I mean look at him, he’s still just standing and staring. Not that I blame him, you do have a pretty nice rack.” I burst out laughing, but Ava didn’t think it was so funny. She threw on her shirt and started to reach over to roll down the window, when suddenly the man leaned forward and pressed the brim of his hat against the window. The darkness from the hood still obscured the view of his face, but you could tell he was facing at Ava. He cocked his head sideways and pointed a finger right at Ava, then retracted away from the window and took a step back. 


“Lock the door… lock the doors right now.” Ava said. 
I looked around to find the lock button in the darkness. I finally found it, and the locks clicked shut. I looked back up to the window, but couldn’t see very far into the darkness because of the fog on the window. I opened the door, gripping the baseball bat that I keep in the car with white knuckles. But the man had disappeared, and the only thing I heard was the sound of a truck driving off into the distance. 

	

“Do you have any idea who that could have been?” I asked Ava as I handed her some coffee. She had decided to stay the night at my place after that strange encounter, and I couldn’t blame her. Despite the unnerving nature of what happened, I tried to offer some more optimistic explanations.


“You know maybe he was just the owner of the kayak shop, and he wanted to scare us off. Maybe he thought we were trying to steal something.”

Ava was sitting on the coach in the fetal position with her hands wrapped tightly around the coffee mug. She pulled a tissue from her pocket and stuffed her winter mint gum into it, before taking a sip of her coffee. She looked up at me, and I could see her eyes were a bit red. 
	

“I think I know who it was,” she said. “A man from work that I met about two months ago. Right before you and I started dating.”
	

Ava interned at a private practice for clinical psychology. She was trying to build up a little work experience before pursuing her dream of going back to school and getting her masters then opening up her own private practice. She did a little bit of everything at her job, everything from paperwork to making the obligatory intern coffee runs. She even got to sit in on some therapy sessions, and I know she really enjoyed that. She also really loved her boss, Dr. Higley. I’ve never met him, but he seems to be a great guy from what I’ve heard. The type of guy who really cares about everyone around him. Anyways, I couldn’t really imagine anyone from her work doing something like that, but I listened as she continued.
	

“There was a man who would come in to see Dr. Higley pretty often. I would see him around the building and catch him looking at me every now and then, but I didn’t think much of it. We started having small talk every now and then, and then one day when I was walking to my car he approached me, said we should go out for coffee some time. Kyle was his name, and well he was brave enough to ask me out, but something about him just gave me bad vibes, so I told him it was probably best if we didn’t because it could get messy mixing work and dating. He didn’t really know how to take it. He just kind of stood there for a second, opened his mouth as if to say something, but nothing came out. His lips just quivered as he tried to form words. After a while, he turned around and darted off. I dreaded the inevitable awkwardness of seeing him at work after that, but he never came back.” 
	

“That was a pretty long time ago, Ava. Are you sure he was that hurt by a little rejection?”
	

“Yes. I’m getting there, babe. You see, after I turned him down, I got a text talking about how he couldn’t believe I would embarrass him like that, and how insulted he was yada yada yada.”
	
“How’d he get your number?” I chimed in.
	
“I’m not sure. I think it was through facebook. I used to have my number in my facebook information, and he knew my name, so that would be my guess.”
	
“Well, what happened after that?” I asked.
	
“Nothing really. I didn’t respond, and I never heard from him again. But look James, I think I should just stay here with you tonight, and then pick Dr. Higley’s brain about Kyle tomorrow. I know he is pretty adamant on patient confidentiality, but if I tell him the situation I think I can squeeze some information out of him about what this guy’s problem is, and if he really would hurt us.”



Ok. It’s 6:30. She really should be back by now. I thought to myself. My finger nails were starting to hurt from incessantly tapping the table I was sitting at. I’d called her three times and got nothing, so I decided to give Dr. Higley’s office number a call. I found the contact in my phone, and he picked up after a few rings. 
	
“Hello, Dr. Marten Higley speaking.”
	
“Hi, Dr. Higley. I’m sorry to bother you at work, but this is Ava’s boyfriend James, and I was just trying to get in touch with her.”
	
“Oh. Yes. James, I’ve heard plenty of good things about you. But I’m afraid I’m not entirely sure of Ava’s whereabouts. She stuck around after everyone left because she had a few personal questions for me. However, she left the office about a half hour ago.” 
	

It felt like there was a weight in my stomach when I heard that. If she left a half hour ago, there is no reason she shouldn’t be back by now. I grabbed my wallet, ran down to my car, started the car, and started dialing 911 when I finally get a text from Ava:
	
Sorry, babe. I was driving back to your place, when I realized I’m going to need to grab some more clothes from my place for tomorrow. Would you mind meeting me at my apartment? I don’t want to go in by myself.
	

The heavy feeling in my stomach subsided when I saw her text. I replied, then started on my way to her place. I tried calling her on the way, but she wouldn’t pick up for some reason.
	
I got to her place, and panic started to set in when I didn’t see her car. I raced up to her door, and found it was unlocked. 
	

“who the fuck is in here?!” I screamed into the apartment. 	
But the only response was utter silence. I dashed to Ava’s bedroom and grabbed the .22 that I had left on the nightstand. Clutching the gun, I checked the rest of the apartment, but it was empty. As I passed by the bathroom again, I noticed something different. The closet in the bathroom was open. I walked into the room, and looked in the closet. It was empty except for multiple wrappers from cereal bars and other various discarded food scraps. 
“Holy shit. I think I would have preferred ghosts.” I muttered.
I went back out to the kitchen to grab my keys that I had thrown onto the table, and that’s when I noticed what Kyle had left for me to find. On the table, there was a picture of Ava sleeping with a message scribbled on it – if you call the police, I’ll kill her. 


Okay there has to be a way I can find out where she is, I thought. I decided on texting her phone. Kyle must have it, and he must have sent me the text to get me here, pretending to be Ava. I grabbed my phone, and despite my hands shaking like I had Parkinson’s, I wrote this: I won’t call the police. Just tell me what you want, and we can work something out. Just please don’t hurt her.
 Eventually I got this text back: Come to the beach. You’re next.
I grabbed my keys and my .22 and dashed to out to the car.

	

My tires screamed as I made the sharp turn into the cul-de-sac. I threw the car into park right in front of the kayak rental shack, jumped out of the car, and started yelling Ava’s name. The only response I could hear was the sound of a mosquito buzzing around my ear. After about a minute of yelling, I saw a flashlight blinking at me from about forty feet deep in the mangrove forest. I kept the gun hidden as I started to make my way through the convoluted roots of the mangroves. 
	

The cover of the mangroves created a new kind of darkness. The kind of darkness that could swallow you whole if you weren’t careful. I could just barely see enough to avoid getting my feet caught in the mess of tangled roots that, in some areas, rose up from almost every inch of the muddy ground.  All of a sudden, I heard a deep, gravelly voice from behind me.
	
“Are you scared, James? Are you scared of the dark?”
	
I twirled around to see the shadowy outline of Kyle’s huge frame looming ten feet away from me. 
	

“Where is she?!” I demanded.
	
“Don’t worry. She might be still alive.” He chuckled as he took a step towards me. 
	
I pointed the gun at him, and I could feel my hand shaking with fear as I aimed. 

“Don’t come any closer. I’ll…I’ll fucking kill you!” I screamed. But he didn’t stop. He got within five feet of me and stopped right where there was a break in the canopy, and a few rays of moonlight shined onto him. He was wearing that same old hoodie and hat. The moonlight also revealed the shine of a knife big enough to go all the way through me. 

There wasn’t any time to think once I saw the knife. I pointed the gun right at his gut, and pulled the trigger. I expected the forest to explode with light and sound, but nothing happened. I tried it again and again, but every time, the gun responded with just a meager click. 
“Fuck…fuck…” I started to stumble backwards, whacking the gun with my hand, hoping some concussive maintenance could get it to fire. I look up to see Kyle reach into his pocket and then hold his fist out in front of him. He opened his fist, and I watched the .22 caliber bullets fall to the ground. I tried to turn and run, but my foot caught on a root, and I tumbled to the ground, and just as I fell I heard Kyle charge towards me. I grabbed a handful of dirt and flung it at his face. The dirt caught him just before he was in striking distance, and he let out a yell. It wasn’t enough to stop him though. With the blade of the knife facing down in his fist he swung down at me. At the same time, I landed a kick to his thigh that sent him stumbling backwards. The knife still grazed my inner thigh, though, and I felt the burn of the knife separating skin.	


I managed to get up in a split second and put some distance between us before he could strike again. I dodged root after root until I saw a four-foot-long piece of drift wood on the ground, and an idea popped into my head. I stumbled down, and let out a yelp, making it look as if I rolled an ankle. I could hear Kyle stomping through the mud behind me. When the footsteps were close enough I made an attempt to get up, but then tumbled back down, pretending my ankle couldn’t support me. I knelt still on the ground and found the piece of drift wood with my hands. I gripped it and waited for Kyle to get close enough. When the footfall was close enough I stood up and whipped around, brandishing the piece of drift wood. Kyle had the knife raise in his right hand ready to come down on me. I spotted it and swung the wood across my body at it. The wood connected right at Kyle’s knuckles, and I saw the knife fly out of his hand. I saw Kyle’s head follow the knife as it flew to the ground, and before he could even turn his head back to face me, I landed another blow right on his temple. The wood was moving so fast I heard it cut through the air, and I felt it splinter as it connected with his temple. He fell to the ground, and I was on him in an instant. Pinning his arms with my knees, I landed punch after punch, screaming “ARE YOU SCARED, MOTHER FUCKER?! ARE YOU SCARED OF THE DARK?” I punched until I couldn’t feel my knuckles, and then I punched some more. 


When I stood up, it looked like Kyle wouldn’t be conscious for a while. I searched his body and found the flashlight he had, then found the knife that was on the ground a few feet away. I made my way out of the forest as quickly as I could manage. The cut on my leg wasn’t too deep, but it was bleeding pretty profusely. 


Back at the cul-de-sac I saw where Kyle’s dilapidated truck was and immediately checked to see if Ava was in it. I looked all around the interior of the car but there were no indicators of where she could be.  I started scouring the area around the truck, checking every inch of ground with the flashlight, hoping to find something – anything. And that’s when I saw the light of the flashlight reflecting off the shiny wrapper of a piece of gum in the middle of the road. It looked just like the winter mint gum Ava always chewed. 

Maybe… just maybe… I thought as I ran up to the gum and started looking for another piece in the vicinity. About twenty feet down the road I noticed another shiny wrapper and ran to it. It was the same winter mint gum. I followed the trail down the road and into the mangrove forest, but after a bit of trudging through the forest I lost the trail. Either she ran out of pieces or the incoming tide washed them away. The water was now about two inches high, and the tide was rushing in fast. 

I screamed her name into the darkness, and thank God I got an answer. It was a strained hum from off in the distance. It was quiet, but undeniably a response. I moved towards the sound and the flashlight finally caught something. It was Ava, and she was lying face-down in the mud. 

I scrambled over to her, and as I got closer I saw her hands and feet were tied down tightly to mangrove roots. Her mouth was duct taped shut, and half of her face was submerged in the dirty water. She had her head twisted to the side as far as it could go, and her nose was just barely out of the water. A few minutes longer, and her head would have been completely underwater.
I cut her lose with the knife, and embraced her as the tears flooded out of our eyes.



This all happened about a year ago, but I haven’t even shared the most unsettling detail yet. You see, we called the police, and helped them search for Kyle's unconscious body once they arrived, but we never found it. He must have woken up and stumbled deep into the preserve. Multiple search teams never found him, and hell maybe he swam out into the ocean and drowned, or maybe he got away and is living on the streets somewhere. Anyways, Ava has since moved to Miami to get her masters, and I came with her. Turns out Dr. Higley had diagnosed Kyle with neuroticism, paranoid schizophrenia, and a laundry list of other problems. It feels good to be living across the state from where this all happened, but there's still a part of me that is scared of the dark. A part of me that snaps awake at the sound of footfall at night. A part of me that expects to roll over at night and see him standing there...because deep down I know he's still out there somewhere.

  ---  

So I dated a good friend of mine who I have known for over a year. We are both coworkers and it started as a friendship that moved into a flirtationship that ended with a relationship. We both went through tough times (his divorce finalized and my relationship of 8 years came to an end) which is what ended up helping us bond.

We dated for two months, which isn't a lot, but in those two months a lot happened. He has kidney failure because he was born with a horseshoe kidney (one kidney fused together) on top of diabetes which means he has to do dialysis and needs a transplant which is scheduled for next year. He was also diagnosed with Stage III lymphoma a few weeks after we started dating, and he gave me the option of backing out. I was adamant on being there for him, but he ultimately ended the relationship about a month after chemo started because he felt useless and like less of a man, but I told him those feelings never changed and made my presence known.

After the breakup, a dream opportunity presented itself, an opportunity I had let him know about well before dating that he was okay with the prospect of. This opportunity entails moving from CT to Florida for 6 months for an internship for school. He was okay with it at first, but he completely dismisses the idea now. About a month after he broke up with me he went into remission and started coming around more and dropping hints he wanted to get back together, but when I told him I was leaving for my internship he froze and refused to even talk about Florida. He was also recently re-diagnosed with cancer and had to begin treatment again, which resulted in his depression coming back.

I've been honest and up front with him about where we stand, but he doesn't want to admit he has feelings or doesn't want to talk about it at all. I get frustrated and will avoid talking to him at work or outside of work, but then he gets upset and wonders why I freeze him out. He'll call me beautiful, surprise me with gifts, take me out on dates and talk about the future one moment and then the next he shuts down and dismisses those acts like they didn't happen.

The biggest frustration I have in this relationship is that there are girls at work who keep butting in and keep trying to get involved with our ""relationship."" He's had his car keyed out of jealousy, they've told him they've seen me dating other men. What hit the nail on the head was receiving a phone call from him today telling me someone close told him I am dating another person who is constantly over my house, which means I am being followed home or someone is stalking me and monitoring my social life. What bothers me is that anytime I talk to another guy he gets jealous but I constantly remind him we aren't dating, that I'm not his property but I also remind him I still care about him. I get frustrated because of this emotional bubble I'm in where he acts like a boyfriend at work and outside of work but doesn't want the labels, which I don't care about. However, he can't get mad and accuse me of sleeping around when I'm not even in a relationship to begin with and the fact I now have to live in fear in my own house because the girls at work are relentless is ridiculous. And no, HR is not an option. I leave in less than 6 weeks, it's better not to poke the dragon now since it is retail and will make things worse.

I care about him deeply, he is a good man with a good heart who went through hell and is emotionally scarred. At the same time, whenever I try to move on I feel guilty knowing all his health ailments and the fact his time is short and that is why he struggles emotionally, because I feel that is his biggest issue right now. I can't get him to open up, I'm at a complete loss.

tl;dr: Guy friend has me friend zoned but gets upset when I try to move on, is sick with cancer and kidney failure

I was recently offered a PM internship at a great company for the upcoming summer, which I'm really excited about and plan on accepting before it expires this Thursday. 

However, last summer I interned at a local software company doing software development. The internship went well, and they invited me to continue my internship during the school year part time, which I accepted. 

The main problem is I am not really sure when/how I should tell my current employers that I will not be returning next summer. They have not mentioned next summer to me at all, but I assume they might want me to be back based on them extending my internship. I feel like I should tell them soon after accepting the other offer, in order to give them a fair shot to get another intern to replace me. 

Can anyone give me some advice on what to do? Thanks in advance.

I want to apply for an internship for the summer and am trying to figure out if I am going to be outclassed by others applying for the same positions as me. The college I attend has a small Computer Science department and the course load has overall been light, so it leaves me to worry that I may not be up to par with my peers. I have a 3.69 gpa and have a decent understanding of both c++ and java.

I understand inheritance/polymorphism, functions, file IO, classes among other basic topics, and understand/can use linked list/double linked list, hash tables, binary trees, stacks, ques, arrays, and vectors and a few sorting algorithms to go with it. 

How important are topics and knowledge from assembly language/operating systems? I took the classes and passed but a lot of the material from this went in one ear and out the other sadly.

Are there any key tools/information I should learn before attempting to get an internship and getting in an interview? Overall I'm trying to figure out if I have a little bit of impostor syndrome or if there are things that I actually need to know and have been missed in my education.

So I'm second year University student. I'm currently in applied physics program. Last year in spring I found myself somekind of intership that is relevant to my studies. It is in laser micromachining field. Although just before I found it I wanted to apply for intership in software engineering for summer but my knowledge of programming wasn't good enough. So instead of working some job like waiter or something like that, I took that Intership in laser micromachining. During summer I did some practical work like working with laser and optics elements. I kinda enjoyed that. From fall I continued being involved in this field. I got employed in physics and technology science center for 1/4 time for minimum wage. Since summer I wasn't doing any practical work, just learning, attending seminars for students that work there too and we are also doing book club on relevant subject. By the way I enjoy physics overall but don't get very good grades only because i don't get myself studying enough. I don't know if it is because I'm lazy or I don't like undergraduate physics as much. So If i stay there and work hard i could see myself having good career there but from time to time I get this feeling and a lot of thoughts that I don't enjoy this that much. I'm thinking that maybe I would like programming more. But I came so far there, got great opportunity, so it would be weird if i just dropped it and other people that supervise me wouldn't see it coming and it would be weird for them too. So I'm really stuck in my thoughts about what should I do. If I left this work if can call it this way, I would probably would like to get into programming, i have some basic knowledge of few languages and probably could get internship or work for summer. If I stay I will continue deepen my knowledge in laser micromachining and optics. But i don't know if I can see myself being like somekind of researcher in the long run. And I probably would think from time to time again that I don't think that I actually want to do it. 

Sorry for such long text and for not quite correct english grammar.

tl;dr - I'm involved in internship/work in physics/engineering branch and I don't think if I enjoy it. If I left it would be a big deal because nobody would have seen it coming and it is very good opportunity for me because not anybody could be in my place, so I got lucky. If I left I would probably ditch physics career but stay in university and go for programming.

I hate struggling with these thoughts and really would like to get sincere and comprehensive reply. Thanks!

5ffafu,3,2016-11-28,How much difference does your Adderall prescription make?,Helga_22,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5ffafu/how_much_difference_does_your_adderall/,"-First time joining a support group. Yay for positive action.

**TL;DR**   {Long story short. After some struggle I have begun to embrace my ADHD identity. I have a counsellor and I am now taking 20 mg of adderall. The difference isn't significant.  What experiences have you guys had with medication in college? How much difference does your Adderall prescription make?}

 **BACKGROUND:**  As a child my parents discovered my ADHD and tried pretty much every medication except Adderall. We moved and I no longer received medication. I made it through Jr. High and two years of high school with out medication. I became a fan of lists and an expert procrastinator. My Junior year I tried strattera, convinced that it caused the blues I stoped taking it. I made it through high school with difficulty but maintained a decent GPA and was very busy.

**CHALLENGE:**   Now I am a Sophomore in college and I’m hitting a wall. I want to earn a Biological Sciences degree and continue to what is next.

**COLLEGE:** Freshman year was rough but exciting. I passed enough classes to continue as a sophomore. Although my second semester GPA was low enough to knock me down to the warning status on scholarships.  
      I forgave myself and promised myself that the next year would be better, after having learned so much about myself and college. 
    That summer I entered my first real relationship and a successful busy internship. Then I jumped into my third semester of college retaking two of my failed classes. Now I’m a part of many academic groups, and have scholarships all depending on my GPA. Yet I can not crank out the work or focus needed to achieve that GPA.

**CONFLICT:**    I began to build immense pressure and anger with myself. I no longer laughed readily or freely shared my energy. I wanted to implode. I also hated myself for dragging my ever loving boyfriend through my constant, intense, and confusing breakdowns. I did not consider my ADHD legit and began to fear I did not want my ambitions bad enough, that I was a lazy and looking for excuses. Here I was with everything set up for me, yet I was making things harder for myself. 
    
**ACTION:**    I went to student health and counseling and after my Dad recommended that I seek medication for my ADHD (he also has ADHD). After about a month I had a prescription for Adderall.

**CURRENTLY:**    Now I am up to the 20 mg dose. When I take it sometimes I notice my heart goes faster and my need for food strikes harder. Sometimes it seems to help me level out and perk up in my environment, but I have not done better at staying on task or focusing in class. I have more support but I’m still failing to do what I sit down to do. I continue to throw time in the air that I can not afford to waste.
      Working with myself can be so frustrating, despite this I can see growth. I’m learning to embrace myself positively, and understand more about ADHD.

**QUESTIONS:** What experiences have you guys had with medication in college? 
  How much difference (if applicable) does your adderall prescription make?

I want to find a job related to it, but not for a video game company since that industry is too volatile, but I am interested in AR/VR for other applications.

* Had a short experience with the PSP homebrew scene in 2007. [Released one simple puzzle game](http://forums.qj.net/psp-development-forum/76544-release-pick-o-mania-v0-2-beta.html), though not very complete.

* This summer [I created a software renderer in JavaScript](http://ccajas.github.io/JS-TinyRenderer) that loads polygonal models and textures, using no external libraries. It emulates a rendering pipeline where you can use ""shaders"" as external JS files.

These things have very little relevance, if at all, to web development, so I don't bring them up a lot in web jobs. I'm also unemployed at the moment. But I still would like to work for a company like Magic Leap. Are there any employees here that know a good place to start with in getting familiar with what they're looking for?

5fg9d7,11,2016-11-28,Why not to attend University of Toronto's School of Public Policy and Governance for your Master of Public Policy,seriousjane1990,PublicPolicy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/5fg9d7/why_not_to_attend_university_of_torontos_school/,"the working title for this article, before I ran out of steam and insights, was ""how incompetence and greed have spawned yet another fruitless policy degree""

I am a recent graduate of UofT’s School of Public Policy and Governance (SPPG), and I am unemployed. I cannot tell you how public policy is formulated (I do know it is generally a governmental response to something), or how to write it (charts are important but who knows how to make those). I could not pick the best public policy document out of a stack and tell you it was the most feasible (I would probably choose the one with the most charts, and jargon). For the two-year all-in price tag of $35,000 (the most expensive public policy program in the country), here is what I can tell you: income inequality is rising in Canada, Canadians are having less children, immigrants are great for the economy, many public policies reflect the interests of certain groups, “program evaluation” is a field which exists although no one understands it, an opportunity cost refers to the savings realized by not doing something, the Ontario Public Service is one of the largest and best employers in the country, and I think that about covers it. In other words, I would equate the SPPG MPP education to regularly following articles in the Globe and Mail. 

The program suffers from a myriad of issues which are mainly due to choices made by SPPG administration and the University of Toronto, and few of which are due to the larger challenges plaguing higher education in Western Nations. Most significantly, SPPG itself is not its own department within UofT, which from my understanding, significantly curtails its autonomy and authority in deciding how it is run. When the program doubled its cohort in size from 40 to 80 students at only a few years since its inception, despite its obvious growing pains and shaky foothold within the Ontario public policy landscape,  that was probably a decision made out of greed at higher levels of UofT’s administration. The Munk School of Global Affairs incidentally suffered the same fate. This is the first way in which greed has negatively impacted students of the program.

The second way in which greed has affected the program, is through the decision to have it structured as a two year offering, rather than one (such as the $9,000 program at Ryerson which boasts higher graduate placement rates, or the $7,000 program at Queens which acts as a feeder program to the federal as well as provincial government). While a two year professional program could certainly be designed to benefit students, through more in-depth training of skills actively sought by employers (including actual quantitative analysis, project management, and report-writing) SPPG uses its two years as a cash-cow of billings for professors from other faculties, which peddle lukewarm and at times clearly out-of-touch  mandatory courses including: “Ethics in the Public Sector”, “Legal Analysis in Public Policy”, “Comparative Public Policy”, “The Social-Context of Policy-Making”, and finally the disturbingly impractical “Capstone” final course. 

The third way in which greed has affected the program, is through its annual appointment of high-level public sector “fellows” such as former Premier Dalton McGuinty, Ontario Public Service head Peter Wallace, and Liberal MP Bob Rae. SPPG finances the sponsoring of these individuals, which may make the occasional speech at program events, or teach the odd session, on the backs of its students. The program’s tuition rises yearly by around $1000, another appointment is made, the school attracts attention and higher enrolment due to the fellowship appointment, and the actual cohort receives zero benefit. The pristine, empty offices of the fellows (which all reside on the top floor of the Canadiana building) are surely a sting to the program’s actual professors as well, which reside in the basement, four floors down. And for those who might think that fellows bring with them a network of connections to which students can access, or short-cuts to employment, let me assure you no such benefit exists at all. Dalton was all smiles at the orientation and kick-off to the fall 2015 orientation of the program, but come May 2016, he was nowhere to be seen.

Speaking of the program’s professors, SPPG’s non-departmental status has had much more insidious effects on its cohort than its current bloated size (future students: prepare for “seminar” courses with 20+ students in boardrooms which require you to take seats against the edge of the room, or lecture courses in UC which require you to ask professors if they would refrain from writing at the bottom of the whiteboard, since it is challenging to see from 10+ rows back). The most negative effect of SPPG’s current status has been on its faculty recruitment. Most of the professors at the school have no experience in government whatsoever. As such, the MPP degree is more accurately described as an extension of an undergraduate degree in political science, rather than the “professional degree” which it touts to be. For evidence of this, look no further than the program’s recent appointment of its new director, Peter Loewen, an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto. The University claims Loewen was selected after an international recruitment campaign, but having read his exclusively academic credentials, and complete lack of public sector or policy development experience, such claims due a poor job at covering the fact that the organization of UofT has found a nice nesting spot for one of its own – to the detriment of MPP students.

The recruitment of Peter Loewen is reflective of another dysfunctional trend at the program, faculty departures. The two year period 2014-2016 saw the departure of the founding director Mark Stabile (unfortunately founding administrator Anita Srinivasan did not follow suit), former Mowat Centre director Matthew Mendelsohn (one of the only professors at the school with actual public policy experience), etc. Loewen’s first official act himself as new Director of SPPG speaks volumes about the kind of policy school SPPG is, for it was to take sabbatical at Princeton University.

Turning to curriculum, perhaps the greatest failure of the program is its lack of professional development, or teaching of hard skills. To this end, the program offers one 3-hour workshop on writing a briefing note, and a few optional introductory type courses on Excel and data-visualization software Tableau. Upon graduating, you will not have a portfolio of professional work that any public or private sector employer will be impressed by during an interview. You will have a handful of academic papers with proper citations.

If in the event I have not persuaded you to not attend SPPG. Maybe because the glowing call of “University of Toronto” is enough to overshadow the money you’ll save, and real employer-sought skills you will learn elsewhere – I will end with some final remarks on how to best navigate the program, based on observation and my own experience:

Your job first and foremost, should be to network. There are no awards or employment opportunities for getting high marks on assignments.

·         All of the professional development events organized by the school are useless, in that their ratio of employer to SPPG student averages around 1:10. Strike out on your own, start by talking to professors and affiliated

·         The vast majority of graduates who find employment after graduating from the program are hired back on to their internship units from the previous summer.

I am a incoming junior in a BS in CS program and a non traditional student (I'm 26). I also have a solid work history from the time I was 18 until 24(military).  My career before college had nothing to do with CS. I am dying to re-enter the workforce and finish out my degree at night and I feel like a coding bootcamp could land me that entry level developer job I dream about. I feel like there are many others in a similar situation to me that feel the same draw to bootcamps even though there is a light at the end of the CS degree tunnel.  To sum it up I was wondering if the classes/knowledge I already have under my belt (object oriented principles, data structures, sql/database design, all maths for BS in CS complete, algorithms, etc...) plus the more practical skills I would learn in a bootcamp could land me a job as a junior dev?  Or... am I just being an impatient idiot and I should just put my head down and finish out the 3 semesters of school do an internship etc?  

Thanks for any responses just searching for some guidance.

side note: The GI bill will pay for the coding bootcamp so funding is not an issue (Uncle Sam is the richest of rich Dads)
side note 2: I love the programming we CS majors learn in school, it is challenging and rewarding. The skills I have learned have been invaluable when learning new things on my own.

I was a biology major for a few years before deciding to go into accounting. Unfortunately, I was dealing with some personal problems the last few years and really messed up my GPA. Currently it is a 2.43 and with something like 85 hours left out of the 150 required to take the CPA exam, I will have to do exceptionally well every semester from here on out to bring it up to a 3.0. I am very smart (although my GPA begs to differ) and eager to do whatever possible to help myself advance.

My questions are:

-When should I start thinking about internships with my GPA being so low right now?

-There are a couple of firms I'm interested in and they are in a different city. How would I go about contacting them to see if they are looking for interns?

-Also, on my resume, would it be okay to list the most recent semester GPA or last few semester GPAs? I feel like my GPA unfortunately doesn't reflect my intelligence very well at this point (my own fault) so I'm not so confident in looking for internships.

-Do any of you guys know any firms in New Orleans that I could possibly look into?

Will move posts if more appropriate elsewhere!

I recently started a relationship with this girl in uni about 45 minutes away from me, and I'm a Senior in high school. She only comes down to our hometown, the one I'm in, on the weekends for her parents, church, me, and our mutual friends. She's absolutely amazing, but that's part of the problem. She's technically a sophomore at this university because she's so ambitious for her major and will probably graduate a year early because of said amibitions, as there is a internship program that in a couple years down the road she can choose from either Washington DC, Paris, or Texas's capital. She's also fluent in French because she loves the language, so all three are very possible. I on the other hand will be staying in my hometown after I graduate and will be attending the junior college here, which has an excellent music program, and will transfer in two years to UT at Austin for music and hopefully music education.

On top of that I partake in summer music programs where I travel across the United States of America, so during the Summer I would not see her very much.

I just feel that throughout our relationship it will be filled with long distance and the forseable outcome that we decide on different paths. It seems the only way things will truly work out is when I attend UT in two years she decides to intern at their capital and move there as well. The only issue is that I can tell she feels more led towards the others and with how young our relationship know I can't really discuss this because we're just not at that level of committment yet. I can't ask her now to choose, and in two years I don't know if she would for me. We're crazy good together and after dating a few times in high school and really understanding relationships I can tell she'd be one to keep.

My problem is is the distance and wait and possible outcome worth the wait? Should I just stomach what the future might look like and bank that it'll be alright? I don't have intention to follow her and I know she doesn't have intention to follow me. Should I consider ending the relationship now in hope that we save ourselves from letting a relationship affect our careers?

5fhhum,141,2016-11-29,"Maruti and the blatant crony ca[p]italism of the Gandhi's. Also extortion, thuggery, goondaism, nepotism, corruption in the highest places",Randiathrowaway1,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fhhum/maruti_and_the_blatant_crony_capitalism_of_the/," all starts with Maa ka Ladla, Sanjay aka Sterilization king Gandhi returning back home from a 3 year internship stint at Rolls Royce in the UK. Even this must have been only because of Maa ka influence because, in keeping with family tradition he never completed college. In case you are wondering, Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv, Sonia all at some point in their life joined some college or uni, but never completed it. In Rajiv and Sanjay's case, they just sucked at studies. Indira, was supposedly a very good student, but ill health came in her way. Anyways, moving back to the topic, Sanjay bhaiya returns from the UK, all full of ideas for a People's Car!

Now, the small hitch is, Indira had pretty much nationalised everything, and the few private companies left, like Hindustan automobiles or Premier automobiles or even Bajaj of the Chetak fame had stringent licensing norms, and buying even a chetak meant at least a year in queue after paying the money...if you were lucky. No matter, what Ladla wants, he gets.

In 1971, with ZERO experience in this field, no degree, no nothing, the GoI awarded a contract to this unknown entity to produce 50k cars (when even as late as 1991, India had a total car sales of some 100,000, in the 70's, this was around 30k units per year). No tender, no competition...nothing! Cronyism max...and it is just the start.

The moment this was done, everybody had to fall head over heels to satisfy the Prince. So, the Congress CM of Haryana promptly offered all the land the Prince wanted. But it was in a sad place in Haryana...our Prince had his eyes set on prime farm land and land belonging to the ordinance factory....Land Acquisition bill you say? Naw, rules didn't apply to his empress son. Land was acquired at dirt cheap prices, the army made to give up its land and the factory was put up.

Now, they offered a prototype for testing...it failed all the tests, but no matter, safety mafety....the contract was upheld!

Bad? It gets worse.

Industrialists were literally extorted into buying shares of this company...if you didn't, you had family members thrown into jail till you paid up. Listing rules for the share market were outright broken to allow special provisions to this company. If you had applied to be a dealer, you were shit out of luck as you were threatened to buy shares (literally using goons and threat of violence) in the company...or else. Even if you were not applying to be a dealer, you were fucked. Some random guy, applying with the Harayana Govt to buy some land...was told that he had to buy shares in the company, or kiss his licenses good bye...he got the shares!

Businessmen who complained...including to the then Minister of state for finance, our Hon President Mr Mukherjee (who did nothing) were then arrested under various acts, including the infamous MISA. Yes, if you protested, you saw jail time bitch!

Cement, Iron and Steel procured to build the complex (strict quotas were in place for anybody without the Gandhi surname) were then promptly resold in the market for a profit, and more quotas kept getting alloted to this company.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Many share holders listed never existed, huge monies were laundered through this sham of a company, many of Sanjay Gandhi's official documentation and requests were never dated or signed. Minutes of shareholder meets either were manipulated or didn't exist at all....it boggles the mind what the Gandhi family could do and still can tbh in its solo, singleminded quest for power and money.

After the Janata Gov took power, they rightfully scrapped this company, established a commission, whose report you can read [here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/141617759/Report-of-A-C-Gupta-Commission-of-Inquiry-on-Maruti-Affairs-31-05-1979).

This is why when Rahul Gandhi or his supporters talk about crony capitalism, I launch a full blown belly laugh! Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv (our man was the lead negotiator for an aircraft fighter deal...talk about being brazen), Sonia (Augusta) are all the biggest crony capitalists of them all."

So I've been working at a big company on their projects team (focusing on CRM and Data warehousing) for one of their business domains for almost 3 years (I started my internship in 2nd year). I started out as an intern before receiving what was essentially a title change and took on more responsibility while in school for my undergraduate degree. I've led projects and also been mostly a generalist (integrations, ETLs, process design, business cases) I was salaried and got paid during my exam periods and my manager allowed me time off which offered a lot of flexibility. 

My pay annualized is something around 38k? 

I've done some research via glassdoor and the job title I received states that technology project analyst earn something in the range of 50-60k + cash bonuses. 

I know there is no set formula for calculating your worth but is a 58% increase a huge step change? I'm not too sure how to strategically plan going forward. As I'll be graduating this April, should I be doing interviews right now to gauge offers or should I have this discussion with my manager now (I'm on contract until then).

Thank you in advance! "

Should I continue?,stealthtaccount,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fi735/weird_experience_with_seattle_big_tech_company/,"So I've been interviewing like crazy since this semester started and since it's my last year. I realized that my resume wasn't very good part way through, because a high GPA and only 1 internship with research projects doesn't seem to trump personal projects. 

I ended up interviewing with some pretty good companies, and have a couple of offers (100k Bay Area). 

Now, I have already pushed back the deadlines for all these, because I have been waiting on this tech company in Seattle. Location was a big deal for me, and I wanted to see if they wanted me. I ended up getting ""rejected"" after a video interview, but then a few weeks later, received an email, telling me they wanted to fly me out for the on site. However, these are in January, and they are completely booked. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, except for hope that they manage to fit me in within the next two weeks (unlikely). I don't want to be that person that accepts an offer, then changes their mind, nor do I want to be the person that goes on site with no intention of accepting the job. 

I'm not sure what to do, because I really want to work in Seattle, and this is also a company I want to work for (no need to warn me about anything their work life balance, etc ). 

I want to accept the best offer I have, and then interview more in spring, hopefully with a handful of personal projects under my belt that expands my skillset.

I am preparing application for IT Bachelor in polytechs while self-learning C#.

At the moment , I have few candidates in my mind 

* Ara Institute of Canterbury(former CPIT)
* Weltec
* Computer Power Plus


I tried to search following information on Internet:

* teaching quality and performance in these polytechs
* opportunity of internship during study
* future job opportunity

However, there is no much information really useful. 

Most articles are propaganda or outdated(more than two year ago).

I tried to ask my acquaintances too. But none of them have any idea.


From what I have gathered on Internet:

* Wellington seems like have second largest demand in IT field in NZ. This may suggest that there have many potential opportunities of internship.
In addition, Weltec has internship program on their website, which seems attractive. 

* Christchurch looks like it doesn't have many IT job opportunities comparing to Auckland and Wellington, which may suggest lack of jobs and internships. 


Can someone provide me advices or opinions about study programming in these polytechs? I will be very grateful to any suggestion. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Updated on 11/30**


Thank you for all your reply. I read every reply again and again. They are really helpful for me. I want to reply to everyone, but it will make this thread a mess, so please let me response on this post.
&amp;nbsp;
I have to say sorry that I forgot to mention in my first post that I am going to apply for a bachelor course in a polytech. I was considering a 2 years diploma course before. But I found that getting a degree has more flexibility for me as a IT newbie.

&amp;nbsp;

*Why don't I apply for a university?*

I did want to go to university when I made the decision to go back to school.
However, from what I read on Internet, most articles say that universities are more focus on theories and polytechs are more practical-oriented. 
I learn stuffs faster by practicing instead of just reading them on books.
So I think a polytech is more suitable for my study style than a university. 
I am not saying theories are not important, but I prefer to know what they can do first before digging into the principles behind them. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Why not studying in Auckland?*

I know Auckland has more IT demands than other cities in NZ. But the living cost is pretty high if comparing to other places, especially its housing prices. 
If I want to study and work in Auckland, rental will make me very painful.

&amp;nbsp;

*To become a coder, I don't have to go to school*

I regard the graduate certification as my stepping stone for entering the door.
My ultimate goal is to become a developer with solid foundations and abilities to work in related fields. 
I have no doubt that self-learning can achieve that , but it will possibly take me a long way to arrive.

&amp;nbsp;

I still welcome any suggestion about courses of studying programming.

Pretty basic work (really just troubleshooting quick fixes with printers, computers, etc.), and the pay $12/hr, which isn't half bad for me. However, the drive to work is about an hour or so, and I do that drive every other day. I honestly don't think the pay is really compensating for the drive (between the cost of gas and how long it takes, it REALLY cuts into my time, especially having to go to school and having a similar commute time). I did some quick math and pretty much found out that I'm making $50 a month with all my expenses included, and that's if I actually work all my shifts (job is VERY unconventional, so I often won't work if there's a few other coworkers there at the same time as as I don't have anything to do).

I'm fortunate to have found a part-time job in the IT field that can accommodate my schedule, but compared to working retail where I would work 20-30 hours a week, getting $10.30/hr, a much shorter drive, I'm making nothing. I know an internship is the primary focus for getting experience, but I'm not to worried about getting one. 

Should I stick it out because the job offers me permanent ""experience"" with pay (as opposed to a 12 week or so temp internship), or should I try to find work a little closer to home? I'm worried about being considered a ""job hopper"" as well since I've only been here for 4-5 months. Though I was at my first/previous job for 4 years.

I have no idea if this is even the best place to ask, but I just wanted some insight from others. Thank you."

I have been working full-time (as a commercial real-estate project manager) and going to school full-time for the last year or so.  Prior to that I have been working full-time and chipping away one class at a time on my prerequisites.  I will have completed all prerequisites and will transferring to a University to start the actual CS program this January.  Luckily, my wife and I have saved up enough money to allow me to quit my job and go to school full-time.

I have only recently started following this sub, but it looks like internships are pretty seasonal as most companies are expecting interns to be on a typical schedule of their school year starting in the fall.  My school year is essentially starting in January, but I still have a full ""two years"" (six quarters) worth of course work.  I expect to have summers off (and therefore time for an internship).  

My main questions are:

- Should I be qualified for an internship this coming summer? (After just two quarters of CS classes.)
- If so, when should I be applying for these internships?
- If I were to get an interview for these internships, would I need to be prepared for the data structures/algorithms type questions that seem to be common in actual job interviews?
- If I have to choose between working on personal projects and studying for coding interview questions should I choose studying for coding interviews?
- Will I have a chance at an internship at a Big 4 company with my weird school schedule?  Assuming I check all of the other boxes. (I am fortunate enough to live in the Seattle area and have some connections to a few of these companies)

&gt; The Social Security Number or Date of Birth you entered does not match the Army Personnel System.  Please contact your Army Education Counselor if you are a Soldier.
Please contact your local Civilian Personnel Advisory Center (CPAC) if you are an Army Civilian or DA Intern.

I'm just part of Army ROTC and I didn't even know what CPAC was before I had to go through this process (and to tell you the truth I still don't know what that is)

 I've tried using their ticket system but haven't heard back from them yet. How can I ensure that my issue is being addressed and that I have provided enough information for them to be able to fix it? I've tried calling about it but I have yet to speak to an actual person.

Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated."

I have a first phone interview tomorrow with an incredibly reputable company for a software engineering internship. It'll be my second programming interview ever. I have been cramming hardcore, but I am currently most nervous about being questioned about what projects I've worked on. My expectations for getting a second interview are realistically low, since it's my second programming interview ever.

I have only been out of school for a few months, and have only been a programmer for a year and change (though I studied SDLC, UML diagrams, and other topics related to software engineering prior to this in my CIS program at grad school). I have spent the past year reading programming books, and studying programming in school/in continuing ed programs after graduation, but I haven't yet contributed to any programming projects outside of my classes. I am planning to in the near future, though, so I can learn from experienced programmers/learn from looking at quality code.

Anyway, my question is how should I answer the inevitable question about what projects I've worked on? The only things I can think of are: 

1. I've made a password-generation program that I use in my current job as an sys admin. It's been reviewed/tested by coworkers, and I've been updating it as needed. It's not that involved, really, but has been a good way to continue learning and implementing more efficient practices.

2. I have a few concepts that I am going to prototype with an Arduino. I have in the past month started reading an Arduino book/looking at online tutorials/putting together the Arduino, so it's early on. 

3. I can mention the areas of programming that I'm passionate about, and what kind of projects I'd LIKE to contribute to.

So how bad/acceptable are these answers? That's all I've got! Feel free to skewer me. Any suggestions for ways I can more effectively answer this question, while being super green would be helpful. Thanks."

Lately since it has been the holidays and finals (Grad school) papers being written I have been doimg mall binges quite a bit and put on 7 lbs over the course of November. So I decided that yesterday was a start over day. I went back to meticulously using myfitnesspal and started working out. Yesterday was horrible because my internship was supposed to get out at 4pm. Then I was gonna hit the weight room. My meeting went 2 hours past time so I had to skip the gym so I could get home (1 hr commute). Pluz they had brought in tons of sweets and stuff. I didnt eat any. A client canceled this morning so I flew to the gym and hit it hard. I feel great.

 

 

 

Its not all about losing the weight either. I have joint pains and tendontis brought on by psoriasis. Work outs help so much with the pain and inflammation as well. For anybody interested I downloaded bodybuilding.com's Bodyspace App to track my workouts. I'm doing the hercules work out."

The first job, the one that I already accepted, is an on-campus job working on event planning/execution and social media advertising for my school's live-on promotions team. As this is on campus, it means I wouldn't have to commute to and from the job. The job involves biweekly meetings and weekly-ish shifts running events (but that all depends week-by-week).

I was told to come here for suggestions as to what laptop I should buy.  I currently have a Macbook Pro and want to switch to Windows as more games can run on it, so I would like to buy a gaming laptop that is on sale for Cyber Monday for a reasonable price.

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
USA, preferably under $1000 USD

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life is a must.  Specifications don't have to be perfect, but just reasonable.  Absolutely no 2 in 1, it's too much of a hassle for me.

* **How important is weight to you?**
Pretty important, I would like something that is easily carryable in a backpack or gym bag.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows 10

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
13-15 inches

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
I am a video gamer and do some occasional movie/Netflix/TV show/anime watching.  I will also mostly likely need to do programming and media editing for future internships and jobs (RStudio, Eclipse, Photoshop, etc.).

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
I play 2 games mostly.  One of them is League of Legends, which is pretty well done; I can get 60 FPS at low settings on my Mac already.  The other is Blade &amp; Soul, which is infamous for horrible optimization and inability to run on multiple cores, so I need a laptop with a good CPU that has strong individual cores (because a quad core won't really help, at least not with the current client).  I get about 10-15 FPS in combat in lowest settings, 5 in very crowded zones (but this is probably attributed to the fact that I am playing on a Mac), and I would like to get about 60 on lowest settings.  I also may or may not play Overwatch in the future, and I heard that is very graphic-intensive as well.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Must have a good keyboard with capability of putting a keyboard cover.  Absolutely no touch screen.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
Other requirements are 256+ GB SSD, Intel i7 2+ GHz processor, nVidia GeForce GTX graphics card, and DirectX 9.0.

Thanks for any suggestions ahead of time!"

I am pretty conflicted right now. I have 2 companies I can intern with currently. 

My head tells me to go with company 1, and my gut tells me to go with company 2. 

1 has a better hiring rate (80-90%), better starting pay, better full time pay, and is growing rapidly. My head says go with this one.

2 has a better culture (at least from what I can tell), but a worse hiring rate (55-60%), lower pay, but also more stability as a company. My gut says go here. 

Clearly, the first has a better short term outlook (more likely to hire full time, better pay, etc.), but the second one is better long term (company isn't going anywhere anytime soon, revenues don't spike or drop much year over year). 

I have two friends who i consider pretty similar to myself, one who's interned at each company. The person who went with company 1 seems pretty happy with it, and got taken on full time, though he didn't seem to be very fulfilled by the work.

The person who went with company 2 had fun and learned he hated the industry, but wasn't taken on full time and is lost in life now....

Any thoughts? I can answer more questions about these companies if needed. "

My parents bankrolled my college tuition and my rent for two years while I had two internships and went to school. When I graduated my parents went through a nasty divorce and financial help froze. Moved back to my home town on credit cards and racked up $4000 cc debt in two months, $3000 on a cc that had a 23% APR and $1000 on a cc that had an intro 0% APR for a year. (Dumb I know, but I didnt see myself having another option)

Currently I am still in debt $3,300 on 4 different credit cards.

I make about $37,000 before taxes and between rent and other bills I cannot pay this debt off in full. For the past year, I have been making payments upwards to $300 dollars a month and it seems like I haven't made a dent whatsoever. The only charges made to these accounts after the initial 4k were for emergencies, totaling $550. 

I think what I'm basically dealing with is compounded interest from the CC I originally had 3k on with 23% APR? So I opened two separate credit cards that had 0% APR and did balance transfers. 

Here's a breakdown:
Amounts shown are debt/max for each card

* CC $1290/$3000 (APR 23%). 
* CC $770/$1000 (Intro APR 0% that expires next month, then 23% APR)
* CC $970/$1000 (Intro APR 0%, expires in 6 months, then 22% APR)
* CC $270/$500 (Intro APR 0% that expires in 6 months, then 23% APR) 

So finally, I'm at a loss for what exactly to do because it seems like I'm in the exact same place I was a year ago. 
Should I consolidate the debt from the cards with high APR to get a lower interest rate? 
Should I just ride it out and let hurt my credit score for a while and just pay the interest I'm at? 

To end, lets just say I learned my lesson with credit cards the hard way. Seriously considering burning these things after all this is paid off. 

Any help is appreciated. "

We've got that research project where we have a subject, and have to find research papers talking about it, and write a paper ourselves, using these resources.
It's kind of the shit project of the year, no one wants to do it, but we have to validate it. I got a crappy group, right off the bat, and got a subject I didn't want to, because I let someone in the group convince me.

Now the deadline is tomorrow, I'm the one managing the group, and I've already done so much work, I've finished my part and even more, I've told people what they had to do in a really simple way, but this bitch just won't do her part.
Everytime we have to meet up with our tutor, once every two weeks, she makes up excuses to not go, because she still doesn't understand the project, doesn't want to work, and she's afraid to face the consequences.

Earlier today I told her ""Hey, you know the deadline is tomorrow right ? We're still waiting on your part"". She dropped me a ""I don't give a fuck"", and simply walked away. I didn't even answer, I wasn't expecting this answer at all.
So, you're gonna join a group, influence its members to choose a subject you like, you end up not liking it, and you're gonna dodge work, and try to not do anything for months ?

That's why I hate group projects. Anyone can just be like ""I don't wanna work, if you guys want a good grade, you'll have to do my part."", and they use that ""grade"" and deadline pressure to get you to do the work in the end.

This project is fucking aweful, I know it. It's fucking annoying to look for specific research papers on really accurate subjects, and try to make something of it. I know we all have so many projects to do, and an internship to find. But FFS, you are not special. Everybody is in the same position, we're all in way over our heads, but we need to make time for the work, and get it done. How are you ""special"" ? What's your excuse for not having to do your share of the job, when the task is really simple, because I've been fucking bushwhacking the subject to make it clearer, and made the plan, introduction, conclusions, and some other parts.

I fucking hate this. I wish you could just tell teachers : this guy did nothing, he shouldn't get a mark at all.

Do people think they will get away with it for their whole life ? Today it's school, but tomorrow it will be work, and if you want to be successful, and keep your fucking job, you'll have to work, and stop fucking hiding, lying to people around you, and lying to yourself.

I seriously just want to slap some sense into these people.

I already checked a lot of reviews and quite a lot of reddit too regarding the models in the title.
I'm concerned that MBPr 13 2015 would get out-of-date too soon as it's already 1,5 years old. Macbook Pros 2016 are too pricey.
On the other hand any Lenovo can't deliver as much battery life as Mac. When it comes to Lenovo x1 carbon 4th gen I'm concerned about build quality - I read some reviews about cheap plastic used in the new models and keys falling off.

I live in southern Europe. I have a B.Sc. in Physics, and I'm about to start a ""master"" in High Performance Computing. I write ""master"" between quotes because that's how they call it, but it's not an actual Master's Degree (M.Sc.); it's rather a more practical course focusing on practical skills. It's also shorter than a M.Sc. (but not by much, it's 9 months courses + 6 to 9 for the thesis project). I'm worried that not doing a real M.Sc. will hinder my chances of finding a good job and making a decent career.

I'm also wondering what professional figures exist in the world of HPC, both in industry and in academia, and what title they have/need: what I've seen up to now is that they are mostly divided between engineers (who set up and manage machines) and scientists (who know how and for what applications to use them), but both these positions require at least a Master's degree, if not a PhD. I'd love to do scientific computing, because I love programming and I love science... but will I be able to do it with my curriculum? If not in academia, is there enough request in industry for non-M.Sc.s with practical experience? And will I have a decent career path or will I be stuck in junior positions for life because of my lack of titles?

Some notes in random order: * I'd rather not become a sysadmin: first because I don't have the right education for it, and second because I don't think I'd like it. If I had to choose, I'd say ""scientific software developer"" would be my ideal job. * I considered some M.Sc. programmes in Germany and Spain, and they're cool, but I'm too late to apply for this winter semester, so I'd have to wait at least 6 months to see IF they admit me, and meanwhile I would lose my place in this ""master"". * I already had some experience with HPC during my Bachelor's thesis and with a 2-months internship at a research center; that's what made me like the field. The ""master"" will also involve a lot of hands-on work, and also a project thesis as I said, so I will have some experience under my belt after it.

I'm trying to decide what I want to do, but I'm a bit lost, so I'd like to know what my possibilities will be if I pursue this route vs. a real Master's Degree.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion.

I tried every possible ways to get an internship but no chance and that really puts me down.. I mean really down.. A month ago i had an interview with gdit (General Dynamics)  at my university and the interview went super well  because I even talk talked to guy who interviewed me later in the parking lot and even gave me he's email address and told me to email him whenever I have a question or apply to any open position which I did but never got a message back, and now I'm over this...

Later, got another interview with CSRS and the same thing happened but this time I was asked to go online and re-apply for a this position  and never heard back.. At this point I'm really out of it. I really need some help and tips. I applied to gov internships for the summer so for now I'll wait for a reply to see if I get accepted, but I don't wanna just seat and wait. I need some help and suggestions on what company I should applied to here in Baltimore or if anyone can share can share any kind f of tips just in case I get the bad news. "

My GPA is 2.75 and should be about a 2.95-3.00 after this semester. I have improved as a student greatly since last year. However, I have had nothing but problems getting an internship for the summer. I applied at Consumers Energy (Michigan) and got declined. I also applied at a local small engineering firm with no luck. I'm currently looking into DLZ and a couple of other places. I know my resume isn't in the best format and probably has some unnecessary info on it considering it's 3 pages long. I was also trying to see if it would ever be a possibility to intern at a place like SpaceX or Tesla. Any suggestions? Any advice is appreciated.

Note: I quickly came to realize that the engineering program I am in doesn't teach things like CAD or MATLAB or other technical skills until my fourth year. How could I learn these on my own in order to make myself more competitive?"

I'm getting a little desperate and thought this might be a space where people could relate.  

Trying to get back to writing asap so sorry for the brevity and inevitable incoherency -- I thought I'd come here for help to see if anyone has advice...

I've been struggling with major writing anxiety for several years. I feel like I've regressed as a writer, and quite honestly overall as a person. I have a lot of difficulty finishing things and have felt like I'm intellectually incompetent and incapable of completing writing assignments.

I can't remember the last time I've genuinely finished a piece of writing with satisfaction, and it's not just perfectionism but I literally just have not completed putting the thoughts together and I feel like I don't understand at all what I'm trying to say. I submitted a shit thesis not too long ago and it was honestly one of the most psychologically torturous thing I've ever been through, I still feel incredible shame thinking about it.

I don't know how to move forward. I used to have a regular counsellor but since I graduated I don't have that service on a regular basis anymore. I didn't think I needed it anymore, but am now reconsidering. Generally I no longer get major feelings of anxiety as often anymore - used to have common symptoms of shortness of breath, tight chest, paralysis, feeling faint/nauseous.

I understand a little better how to manage but have no idea how to move forward psychologically, have a huge research paper for an internship I'm involved in and have been constantly delayed in deadlines. 

If anyone has thoughts/experiences/strategies/suggestions for how to move forward and finish this huge piece of writing, I would really really appreciate it.

Thank you~

I'm a recent CS grad who got laid off from a startup I have been working with for the past 8 months (I was a grad intern there then a software engineer). Now I got offers from two different companies and am totally confused which one to take. I did work with a couple of startups before.

A: The first one is a smaller (1-10 people) Fintech startup. My work would be based on Rails, Angular and Android (Same as my previous job).

B: SAP Solution Delivery Center - Offered a job with lesser pay but would give me training and free certification exams in the internal courses. Would be joining the Mobile and UI team if I choose to accept it. They would give me training in their internal tools. 

I'm totally confused which one to choose. Also, I might be planning for a good grad school in a couple of years, if that helps in any way to make a choice."
5foxic,1,2016-11-30,Tired of College Bullshit,BobbyBunk,helpme,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/5foxic/tired_of_college_bullshit/,"I love learning. I enjoy meeting people with similar passions. I like to listen to inspiring people. College, for the most part, has provided this. I've learned a lot about myself and my major. There is a lot I love about college.

I don't love the fucking roadblocks, though. I hate mandatory attendance. I work to pay for this, and these forced lectures make my schedule tight. The professors meander quite a bit with subjects, leaving me only about ten actual minutes of valuable information per lecture. Paired with this are mandatory discussion sections, where a TA struggles to conduct a classroom of productive thoughts. If this was optional, I'd be ecstatic. But it's not. If you miss one, they chop a third of a letter grade off of your OVERALL GRADE. It's beyond fucked up. I have little time to study and do assignments so these lackluster classrooms cost me a lot of sleep and destroy my patience for this system. This is just one annoyance among many others.

I want a degree. I want to do well in school. I want to pursue my major and perhaps even enter the academic world as a teacher. But is it worth easing through bullshit like this? I've witnessed so many classes fueled entirely by a professor's political agenda that it's making me fucking ill.

Is it worth it to just quit and look for something else or should I persevere? Do things get better in grad school? I was excited to start college finally (at 23 I feel a little late to the party), but I feel very let down by my experience and it's honestly sent me in a downward spiral.

I was thinking of dropping out and maybe looking into internships in journalism or publishing companies. Would this be too difficult without a degree or would I be able to get by?"

To put it simply, I like to think the primary focus of my life is actually STEM. I love everything about computer science/programming/engineering/math, and I consider it my life purpose to make amazing things. Luckily I've gotten to pursue that dream by attending Cornell and majoring in Computer Science (and hopefully also pursuing Electrical Computer Engineering), and to be honest that's all I really want. I joined an insanely amazing autonomous robotics systems project team and it's just been a dream for me, up until now.

I've felt myself very, very gradually but consistently feel lower and lower over the course of this semester (I'm a sophomore btw). At the beginning of the semester I was overwhelmed with the prospects of my really interesting classes, project team, research team, and the actual real potential for a relationship with a girl I met last semester (very much a first experience for me). Regardless, the one thing that seemed to pull me down at first was how quickly everybody around me began to engage in their great search and application for impressive summer internships. I told myself that I really wanted one, and I feel extremely qualified for one (even though I'm just a sophomore I have a lot of background in CS/ECE), for some reason the thought of having to put my credentials on paper and apply to something just absolutely terrifies me to no end. It's crippling. Two years prior when applying to colleges, I woke up every day for 1.5 months or so with crippling stress/anxiety during that October/November window most people apply to most universities in, and I could not even get myself to begin the application process. I was so freaked out, believing I was a failure for not amounting to what I thought I should be at that point and was entirely overwhelmed and intimidated hearing how everyone else's progress was. Thankfully I got to a place I love, but even after the deadlines had passed I was thrown into what my parents kept insisting was depression for a few months afterwards. I guess I've felt much of that feeling this semester, which was only amplified by the rest of my responsibilities.

Anyway, it's near the end of the semester, and things have begun to take a bit more of a darker turn than I could have anticipated. I've failed to make any progress whatsoever on my internship search, failing to even put together a resume that showcases my accomplishments and skills I know I have. I slowly participated less and less in my required writing class, being unable to turn in papers, then feeling so guilty for being so stupid that I couldn't bear the thought of waking up in the morning and looking my professor in the face while everybody else had actually done the work. I talked to that professor multiple times begging for extra time and trying to help him understand, but each precious opportunity he gave me to try to receive some credit for my nonexistent work, I blew. I've had to withdraw from the class, leaving a permanent mark on my transcript (and the second one of this sort too...).

I dropped a physics class as well, and although I was performing stunningly well in my other three classes, I've since regressed to a point where I've begin miserably failing those as well. I have officially reached the point where I have so much shame, guilt, anxiety, and overwhelming dread about how I let everything collapse for seemingly no reason that I can no longer get out of bed / my dorm at all. I have not been able to leave my dorm more than a few times total within the last month, and have not gone to class once within this period. I have become practically nocturnal as a result of not being able to bear the thought of waking up at a normal time and actually going at my day, and have been averaging eating only 1-2 meals a day. Last week I actually did leave and met with professors and my adviser and tried to explain everything, explaining that I was in no way prepared to take their upcoming exams and had no idea what to do. To my surprise, my professors were extremely willing to work with me, but time is running out very quickly for me. I've also been almost entirely ignored everybody that I talk to up here, including everyone in my classes, project teams, group project / lab partners, and that girl I felt pretty connected with from before, and it hurts so badly just to think about how horrible I have to be to pull that off.

I have two options: if it comes down to it, I can decide to take a medical leave from Cornell in which my entire transcript from this semester is wiped (and most other penalties are gone), but I would be forced to wait until next fall to return. To me, the idea of doing this is absolutely devastating as the only thing I really want in life right now is to stay here and continue studying what I love, and leaving seems to me like throwing away a year of my life and completely severing all of the extremely meaningful connections I've made here. I would have to decide this within the next two days, however. The other option is to try to make up all of the work I've not done over the last month of so and be prepared to take my finals, but each passing day of my inaction makes that seem less and less viable. All I feel like I can do right now is continuing cowering in my room, laying in my bed and trying to imagine this reality does not exist.

My largest concern of all to me, no matter how /r/iamverysmart it sounds is what I fear the most is losing my capacity to do what I love. I have real fear that my sedentary, malnourished lifestyle recently has physically and permanently damaged tissue in my brain and that I'll never be able to think as creatively and well as I did before, and that terrifies me to no end.

While I appreciate and love them for that, there should have been a limit to their overptotectiveness. I understand that they just wanted what's best for me, and that they must have been traumatized because my eldest sister died back then from health issues. I get it. But they raised me to be very dependent on them. I remember my mother wouldn't even let me hold a knife and cook for myself. Nor would she let me go outside on my own. I thought nothing of it when I was younger, but I'm now 24 and she still treats me like I am 4.

It's starting to affect me. I've become very dependent on them. I'm scared to go outside of my own, talking to people on the phone scares me. I get easily nervous. I can't drive and take myself to places I need to go because, like I said, going outside makes me nervous. It's just so hard, I feel helpless and I couldn't do anything on my own. What's worst is that my parents are disappointed in me for not being more independent now that I am older. I know they think I'm worthless. I can read between the lines. 

I started working at our family's company as a secretary and I just sat there at a table like an idiot. My mother expects me to already know what to do in the office even if I have absolutely zero experience. I asked her to train me but she doesn't. She expects me to go around asking people what I should do. I felt like an idiot just sitting there. Even now, she just gives me small tasks even a small child with basic computer knowledge could do. It's a part time job, I get it, but even the unpaid interns were given more work than me. I felt ashamed because there were people YOUNGER than me in that office who do more important work than what I do and I still get paid for it. They think I'm worthless. i am convinced I am worthless. i can't do anything right. I'm too dependent on them and it scares me. They can't live forever, my dad's 74 already damnit. It scares me that they'll leave me and I'll be nothing. This has been bothering me for a while now and I keep wishing I could just wake up dead. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but I am sure I will never actually do anything to hurt myself. But these thoughts just won't go away... If I tell my parents I am depressed, they'll just dismiss it as a tantrum. I cried in front of them back then, and told them about everything I felt like how helpless I am and how they keep treating me like a child. They played victim and said 'you can't get mad at us, we're old already!'. I don't know anymore.

I know there are people suffering more than me, but I just don't know where to go to at this point. No one could understand me. I am still very scared for my future and I always wish I could die before my parents. "

As of yesterday, I have committed to my first major job that is an awesome opportunity, I have a great family, and an awesome boyfriend. However, I am not happy. This is obviously a lot of change, I’ve gone through a few transitions since May, as I waitressed through the summer, took a post-grad internship this fall. I lost both my grandmother and a friend suddenly over the past two months, and just this past weekend my childhood dog (which has hit me the hardest). 
	I’m in a position where I have left my negative friends behind all with the support of my boyfriend and family (they were toxic), but I feel as though that has left me with nobody. I am an independent person and do not like to rely on anyone, so I have an inner battle with this whole being alone but not wanting to need anyone.
	I lash out at my family and at my boyfriend which is straining both of our relationships. I can pinpoint most of this to my PMS/birth control, but I can’t live like this anymore. I am totally not myself and nothing is more frustrating than being fully aware of that but feeling so helpless about it. This is all for only about a week a month (again, I am pretty sure it is a result of serious PMS) which makes getting help hard. I saw my therapist last month, but by the time the appointment hit I felt totally okay again, and thought it was silly.
	Does anyone know what to do about this? Obviously it’s going to be to see a therapist and I know that, but I really think its more related to the birth control that I am taking and my hormones. I am so sick of a silly few days out of the month ruining my relationships and things around me but I feel totally helpless. "

as the title says, I recently finished my bachelors degree in Computer Science at the age of 19. It worked, because I was studying from home while still in school. I finished with a 2.0 grade, but got a 1.0 in my bachelor thesis about Software-Development. I'm from Germany btw.

Now I'm not quite sure what to do next and would love to hear your advice!
I think I should definitly persue a masters degree at some time, even if it's only to get a glimpse at real student life ;), but I want to wait atleast another year before I do that, to have some time to travel and gain some work expierence.  

* Do you think it's worth/possible to get a full scholarship at the elite universitys like MIT with my qualification? 

In the meantime (next year), I want to make some money to be able to afford travelling.

* Will I be able to get a good paying job for 6-12 months with almost no expierence other than my bachelor thesis? Or can I only hope for paid internships?

* Or maybe do you think it would be better to stay home anyway and collaborate in open source projects and do some freelancing?

I can live with my parents for the next year if I want, but apart from that they can't really help me much financally. If you have any questions feel free to ask! Thank you in advance

I started at $10/hour as an intern, and negotiated a raise to $15/hour, then to $20/hour as an intern. This came with the ability to do my software development remotely from school, which was too far away to be physically present. There are 2 developers, myself and a senior member, and we work on separate projects, rarely directly collaborating on a project. We will however often discuss how to tackle certain problems, I'll ask his advice, and we are a team, but just working on different things.

In July, I was offered a more permanent position as a Junior Software Developer which I gladly accepted. This didn't come with a pay raise, and if I should have expected one, then that's another matter entirely. I'm not sure if I missed an opportunity or if it was wise to accept what they were offering and continue chugging along.

Using Glassdoor.com and salary.com, for my skills (2 years of full software development in the company, and a sophomore in college working towards a Computer Science major with a minor in Math), I should be compensated about $30/hour without a degree, and with my Bachelor's degree about $35/hour, so I understand my expectations aren't some six figure Google salary, which I'm fine with. 

I enjoy working at the company as I get along with everyone, can work remotely, and its only one town over from where I live, so a 15 minute drive. They also work with me and allow me to attend my local college and work around that schedule, where I put in 15-20 hours a week. I then work full time summers and vacations.

Recently, I was working on a project that took about 3 months to complete, and when reviewing the final product, the CEO decided to change a fundamental requirement, meaning we have to rewrite the software, missing our soft launch date, and taking another 2-3 months for another production-ready release. Both my manager and I are annoyed, but apparently that's the business world. To be clear, I was congratulated on my work, as I was not at fault for this change, rather, the business requirements changed.

Admittedly, I had a feeling of defeat, since now I have to rip apart my work and redesign the entire thing, since the current design does not allow us to solve the new requirement change. But this got me thinking that I should research what I should be compensated for.

I would like to negotiate to a $30/hour rate, but given my circumstances, should I wait for this project to be completed, or should I ask now? I don't know the inner workings of the business world, so does this time make a salary adjustment more or less likely?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

5fqp8g,307,2016-11-30,We are the American Honey Bee Protection Agency! We're here to talk about bees and bee conservation! AMA!,AHBPA,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5fqp8g/we_are_the_american_honey_bee_protection_agency/,"Hello reddit! We are the American Honey Bee Protection Agency. We’re a Texas based 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We specialize in bee conservation through no-kill bee removal and relocation, as well as bee education to the public. Bees play a vital role as pollinators in the environment and we’re here to raise awareness about bees and bee conservation! 


What we do is if someone has a wild beehive on their property they want gone (Bee it in a tree, under flooring, in a wall, etc.) we send out one of our bee wranglers. Our wrangler removes the hive rather than having the property owner kill the hive. We then take the hive back to one of our three bees farms, one in Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. There we maintain the hives and eventually adopt them to folks who want to keep bees on their property. We then either maintain the hive for the property owner or we give them all the equipment and education they need to maintain the hive themselves. Either way bees are re-introduced to an area and they can pollinate the local ecosystem. Additionally, having honey bees on their property often gives the property owner an agricultural tax exemption that can save them thousands in property taxes, making it a win-win for both the bees and property owner. Also they get LOTS of delicious honey!


We’ve been working for a little over ten years rescuing as many bees as we can. We also work with schools ranging from elementary to high school to educate students about the important role bees play as pollinators in our ecosystem. Additionally we work with local and state government to advocate for bee-friendly policies. We worked with the 2015 Texas legislative session to have western honey bees declared the official state pollinator. Similarly, in 2011 we convinced the City of Austin to change its primary bee policy from extermination of the hive to removal and relocation.


We are self funded through bee products we produce and the bee services we provide. We harvest honey from our rescued bees and sell it through our sister company, Epic Honey, with most 	all proceeds going back to fund AHBPA. Additionally we ask for donations for our bee removal (Though we do do pro bono removals for those who can’t afford it) and hive adoption.


So ask us anything about bees and bee conservation! We’re going to be answering questions from 11am CST Wednesday to 11am CST Thursday. I, Arlen the reddit proficient intern, will relay questions to our various staff member and then paste their un-edited responses. We’re going to try to answer every question but do be patient.

You can also check our website to learn more about bee conservation and the work we do: http://honeybeekind.com/

EDIT: One interesting thing I'd like to add. By pure chance a Harvard researcher who studies hive collapse did a [science AMA a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5fbfa6/science_ama_series_hi_reddit_im_alex_lu_associate/) . [His work](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/colony-collapse-disorder-pesticide/) pointed to a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids as large contributing factor to bee population decline. The mostly widely used of the group is a pesticide called imidacloprid. One very good thing for bees you can do is to make sure any pesticides that you or those around you use aren't imidacloprid and aren't in the neonicotinoids  group.

EDIT 2: Alright folks, we're gonna wrap up here. Glad to hear all your questions. If you ever want to contact us or ask us more about bees you can do so through our facebook or info@ahbpa.org Thanks and Bee Well!"

I thought at one point I had a passion to be a youth pastor and did an internship with FCA and actually did youth group before I did the electronics part that I volunteer now in. Sometimes the church comes to me and asks about helping and I feel bad but I really feel like I don't have a passion. How do I get over feeling bad for saying no. I feel like as a Christian and saying no to a church is just weird and hard for me to do. 

Is it ok to not volunteer at every little thing at church and is it ok that I don't have a passion like maybe I thought I did. I feel like the body has all different parts and people are good at different things. Some have a huge passion for youth and this gives another person in the church an opportunity to volunteer. "

5fr1qs,1,2016-11-30,How do I best rebuild our lives?,DecadesofSun,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5fr1qs/how_do_i_best_rebuild_our_lives/,"Okay, so this is going to be a long-winded post. First time posting here also, so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong as far as reddit is concerned and I'll change it. There's two different stories going on here, so be warned. Anyway, here goes.

I'm a 22-year-old male with gender identity issues, a vocational degree in a field I'm not currently working in, and I have an internship with a branch of AmeriCorps working in one of the U.S.'s greatest national parks as an environmental conservationist. This is my second time working for AmeriCorps after I served in another park four years ago at 18, and between the two I'm due to have a year and a half's worth of time in AC, with a maximum of two years' time being allowed (AmeriCorps guidelines) across different agencies.

I joined AC with a group known as the MCC right out of high school and before this it was the highlight of my life. I was in a place where I could be more open about my personal issues than I had been in the past, and I enjoyed the work enough to want to continue it in the future but after the season ended, decided to try some other stuff before going back. Two weeks later, my father died right after I moved across the country, and that ruined things for the next three years. Eventually, I decided to go back to school and, rather than getting myself locked in debt like the rest of my family, earned my vocational degree for a much lower cost with the hope of going into the trades. I did well in school, but afterward the market for my craft fell through and I rejoined AC, this time with a group known as the SCA. It was a major step up for me, even if it wasn't in the field I had studied for, and again I moved halfway across the country to pursue better options.

At the same time all this is going on, my mother remarried her high school sweetheart less than a year before my father died (they had divorced and Dad was out of her life at that point). Soon afterward, she ended up having to move her own father, who is in his late eighties and riddled with Alzheimers, dementia, etc., closer to where they were living in order to help take care of him. He was in a senior home for a little while, but that soon proved to be too expensive and they eventually began looking for a place where they could live with him and she would be his caregiver. Mom and my stepdad found a house on the west coast that was perfect for all three of them, and so she quit her short-lived career as a teacher to focus on Grandpa's care.

Meanwhile in trade school, my identity problems began flaring up worse than ever and it nearly ruined my chances of getting into the industry. When I was re-accepted into AmeriCorps with the SCA instead, I was overjoyed. It meant I could be more free to be myself. Not only that, but I was offered another position in a third partner with AmeriCorps, call it the WCC, and between the three groups (MCC&gt;SCA&gt;WCC) I was set to complete my full two years' worth of AmeriCorps as noted, across three different national parks. It was the best news I've received in years.

Then it happened. Halfway through the SCA internship, my stepfather was killed, leaving Mom taking care of her father by herself with me gone and the rest of our family spread out in other areas of the country. It was like losing my biological father all over again. I had to leave the internship for a month to help take care of Mom and Grandpa, and when I finally returned to work I did so knowing Mom would be alone until I got back. At that point it didn't matter what my own hopes were, all that mattered (and still matters now) is that I'm there for her as best as I can be. We're honestly just waiting for her father to pass on so she can be free to rebuild her life. I know that sounds cruel, but it's the truth. In addition to that, my accepted position with the WCC is now on the line and my future in conservation is limited because I only have a vocational degree, not a bachelors' degree. 

Basically at this point I have two options. My internship with SCA is set to end in the spring, and Mom and I have both agreed for me to move back closer to her when it ends to help her out until Grandpa is gone. I can either honor my obligation to the WCC at that point and serve six months' more in AmeriCorps, thus completing my full two years and earning the full education awards they provide, which I need to pay off my vocational degree. It would mean, however, that I'm away from Mom for six months' longer right when she needs me the most, and none of our other family are available to help. The only benefit for her would be that I'd be much closer to home and could see her more often, and it would allow me in-state residency to go back to complete my bachelors' at my dream school.

Option two: I complete the SCA but forego WCC, thus bringing my AC time to a year and a half. I wouldn't have the education award I'm after from the WCC, but I would be able to not only deal with my identity issues that much sooner instead of putting my own needs off for the sake of the job, but also be there for Mom more readily. Not only that, but I'd be able to go back to school elsewhere at 23 instead of waiting until I'm 24, which was the plan I was on until my stepdad died. It's not the best option, but it would allow me to pursue goals outside of conservation a little bit quicker. I'd just have to find a job closer to home (not likely part of AmeriCorps, I'm afraid) and I'd be able to go back to college while helping Mom at the same time.

I'm honestly torn and I really shouldn't be. I keep telling myself that family comes first and that being there for her and Grandpa should be more important than anything I want, and that includes my own identity issues and the possibility of transitioning before he passes. She definitely needs someone else in her life to help out, and with my stepdad gone I'm the only one who can really do it. But if I don't do this final stretch next year with AC, I'll lose not only the opportunity to serve in my favorite park, the one I fell in love with years ago, but also the opportunity to enroll in my dream school and pursue a transition there. I'd be less than a state away from Mom, so I'd be there for her a lot more than I am now, but that's still more time where we're both on our own without help from one another. I feel trapped either way, and she's even more so. I have to get back in school wherever I end up- the voc. degree has proven to be near useless and I can't continue in conservation past AmeriCorps without additional education first. I'm hoping to leave conservation after either SCA or WCC for awhile anyway, but I still hope to go out on a high note and see this through till the end.

**TL;DR: Dad and stepdad are dead, both right after I moved halfway across the country. Mom is stuck taking care of Grandpa alone, my first degree is useless, I need to go back to school soon but also kind of need to complete the internships I have scheduled first before I can do that, or even hope to transition because loltrans. Mom's life is in shambles, I don't know what to do.**

I know this is a lot, but if there's anyone out there who has struggled with similar issues, even just one of these problems, and has a way around any of it I would love to hear your input. Thanks for reading this far."
5fr44f,1,2016-11-30,Is is the right time to negotiate a raise?,SuperSpaceNova,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5fr44f/is_is_the_right_time_to_negotiate_a_raise/,"As a little background, I began at this small company (~30 people) in my senior year of High School. I started at $10/hour as an intern, and negotiated a raise to $15/hour, then to $20/hour as an intern. This came with the ability to do my software development remotely from school, which was too far away to be physically present. There are 2 developers, myself and a senior member, and we work on separate projects, rarely directly collaborating on a project. We will however often discuss how to tackle certain problems, I'll ask his advice, and we are a team, but just working on different things.

In July, I was offered a more permanent position as a Junior Software Developer which I gladly accepted. This didn't come with a pay raise, and if I should have expected one, then that's another matter entirely. I'm not sure if I missed an opportunity or if it was wise to accept what they were offering and continue chugging along.

I am thinking about putting in my two weeks because  I have been working until 9-10pm most days since starting and we aren't even in busy season yet.

I was fired, with no explanation other than that I had made a series of small mistakes. They sent an email, and did not ask to see me in person. 

My father passed away earlier in the semester and I was almost fired then because of how distracted I felt. I took a break, came back, and asked them to let me know if I continued to be distracted. I was given no warning the second time, which was about 2 months after his death. 

I'm also worried because I feel as though they are going to talk about me. They would say ""Fucking Alice (their last intern, not her real name) was a fucking terrible intern,"" and ""Fucking Alice was useless."" In front of me and the other intern. When I told my boss that my father passed, she immediately told the other intern and the accountant without my permission. Similarly, one of the interns didn't come to work after Trump's election because her family is undocumented. She sent this information in an email to my boss, who immediately told me. I don't think I have a right to this information. 

I know I did make mistakes, and I know they behaved rudely towards me. But is rudeness the norm in the face of mistakes? A few people have been telling me, this is what the industry is like. I just want to know: do I have a right to be outraged, or should I be steeling myself for future internships or jobs like this? Is this similar to anyone else's experience, particularly in the publishing industry?"

I live in eastern Europe. I have a B.Sc. in Math/Physics, and I'm thinking of starting a master in High Performance Computing. I'm wondering what professional figures exist in the world of HPC, both in industry and in academia: what I've seen up to now is that they are mostly divided between engineers (who set up and manage machines) and scientists (who know how and for what applications to use them), and both these positions require at least a Master's degree, if not a PhD. 

I'd love to do scientific computing -- I am more interested in the applications of HPC in other fields such as math and physics, such as simulations with aircraft, the universe, etc... This masters degree focuses more on the architecture of computers and parallelization, etc. I am concerned if this would be the correct move for me, and if getting a math/physics masters would be a better choice for the path I am trying to do, since as I mentioned, I like the applications of it more.

Some notes in random order: * I'd rather not become a sysadmin: first because I don't have the right education for it, and second because I don't think I'd like it. If I had to choose, I'd say ""scientific software developer"" would be my ideal job. * I already had some experience with HPC during my Bachelor's thesis and with a 2-months internship at a research center; that's what made me like the field. I'm trying to decide what I want to do, but I'm a bit lost, so I'd like to know what my possibilities will be if I pursue this route. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestion."
5fs80u,3,2016-11-30,Would I find more opportunity as a Freelance Writer or Web Developer?,brokeasswriter,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5fs80u/would_i_find_more_opportunity_as_a_freelance/,"I graduated from college several years ago and fell flat on my face.  There’s really no nice way to put it.  I graduated with a B.A. in English Lit, but since I commuted and worked all through school, I hadn’t had the time to make any kind of professional connections or take an internship or anything like that.  To make matters worse, I graduated at the height of the recession.  There were absolutely no jobs related to my degree in the area, and there still aren’t.  As a result, I tried to take advantage of my long time hobby, computers.  

I was able to get a very low paying entry level IT position that expected me to know every aspect of IT as well as programming and operate on a nonexistent budget.  Worse yet, the commute to the job added over three additional hours to my already extended workday and cost a fortune in gas.  It also taught me exactly how much I hate being stuck behind a desk.  So, I left believing that there would certainly be better opportunities.  

I spent all of my time applying to jobs and trying to teach myself whatever in-demand skills I could.  That wasn’t enough.  I couldn’t find any full time work, especially not in my area.  At that point, I turned my attention towards remote and freelance work.

That’s what I’ve been doing since, rather unsuccessfully.  I’ve been able to squeak out a meager income from a combination writing for content mills and low paying websites and making the occasional WordPress website.  It’s been about the equivalent of working part time at a minimum wage job.  Over the course of that time my car’s lease ended, and I couldn’t afford a new one, so I have no car.  I’ve been looking for any kind of work that I can get, but can’t find anything nearby, and neither freelance business has taken off.  To put it mildly, I’m stuck.

Now, I’m in my late 20’s and my career is a total non-starter.  I love writing, and I wish that I could do that and make a decent living, but I can’t seem to figure out how.  I like technology and programming.  I’m actually really good with Linux servers, and I know several programming languages and web technologies at a beginner to mid level.  I wouldn’t mind doing that either, but I don’t have any qualifications.  I don’t know which to invest the most effort in or if investing any more effort is even worth it.  I need to work freelance or remote at first at this point.  I can’t get another car, and there is no work other than garbage level retail positions anywhere around me.  I don’t mind working hard.  I’ve been doing that all along, but my efforts have been mostly wasted.  I just need someone to point me in the right direction and say, “Do these things and you will succeed.”  Does anyone have any advice or insights into how I can get out of this massive rut?"

***

I do not want to spend an inordinate amount of time beating a dead horse, Sherry has been thoroughly digested here on TMM. I will do my best not to repeat that which has been said a thousand times. I will not spend much time at all on her deviation of protocol, only to mention that **had she followed her own procedure, she would have been forced to decide the test was contaminated, and the result was therefore inconclusive.**

**Quick Excerpt: Avery Trial - SC Cross Examination:**

&gt; JB: *Ma'am, you do not know how that control became contaminated, do you?*

&gt; SC: *Not 100 percent for sure, no.*

***

Sherry is a main player. Whether or not she planted the DNA, she was the one who said the result was valid. *She literally put Teresa in the garage.* It was her call. She ~~could~~ should have followed procedure and recorded the test as inconclusive, but then again, remember who she works for. She would have been unable to *put her in Avery's house or garage.*


***

This post will focus on:

+ Culhane's CV

+ Culhane's past relationship to Avery in 1985 as well as 2002-2007 (and now 2016)

+ September 2005 - Sherry sends a package to Remiker.

+ February 2006 - Kratz sends an E-mail to Sherry

+ Contamination, Suspects and Exemplars


***
### Responsibilities v. Experience

***

First off, here is Sherry during her direct examination explaining what her job entails:

&gt; Sherry Culhane: *I also have technical leader responsibilities. Those include things like* **training new analysts,** *monitoring our quality control procedures, monitoring proficiency tests of the analyst. I'm also responsible for any new techniques, new equipment that is brought on line at the laboratory, for signing off on those procedures and making sure that they are tested properly. And* **I'm also responsible for case flow,** *making sure that we meet court dates, our cases are prioritized, and* **we get them out in a timely fashion.**

***
**If you thought** the above sounded impressive, **hold that thought...**

**Cross Examination Begins**

&gt; Jerry Buting: *Okay. You got your bachelor of science in 1978?*

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

&gt; JB: **You did not go on and get a master's degree,** *right?*

&gt; SC: *Correct.*

&gt; JB: **Never** *in all your years* **since,** *have you gone back to try and get a master's?*

&gt; SC: *That's correct.*

&gt; JB: **I don't see anything in your CV that shows that you worked as a research scientist,** *right?*

&gt; SC: *No,* **I didn't.**

&gt; JB: *You have* **little or no publications** *in the field?*

&gt; SC: *No,* **I have no publications.**

***

And now some slight shade from JB

&gt; JB: *Now, is that a position that requires* -- **Well, obviously, your position doesn't require a master's degree, right?**

&gt; SC: *Actually, it does.*

&gt; JB: *Okay. So you were sort of grandfathered in with this other way of getting some additional educational miles, right?*

&gt; SC: *Right.* **And because of my experience.**

***

No masters degree. Got a bachelors degree ~~way back~~ in 1978. Did not work as a research analyst. No publications.

She was grandfathered in to her position ... *Because of her experience.* **Just saying.**

***
### Sherry (to Remiker): ""Here, you might need these..""
***
After Jerry attempts to pass Sherry an exhibit, Gahn wishes to be heard outside of the jury, essentially admitting he needs to review the exhibit because he hasn't the foggiest idea what it is. Gotta love that Manitowoc work ethic.

***

&gt; BUTING: *Judge,* **what it is,** *is a  record regularly kept in the course of her business.*  **She's going to be able to easily identify it.** *She's talked about the  exoneration.* **It shows that  Mr. Avery's buccal swabs --**

&gt; THE COURT: *Is your microphone on?*

&gt; BUTING: *Yes. It shows that* **Mr. Avery's buccal swabs, that used to be in the custody of the Crime Lab, were sent back to the   Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department** *in 2003.*

&gt; THE COURT: *All right. I had understood that the blood that was in the Clerk's Office was going to be the subject of the defense.* **How does this exhibit relate to that defense?**

***
I find it hard to believe that Willis couldn't piece this together. He, I imagine, is using an often abused tactic. Some judges, no matter how obvious the facts of the case are, will not do the attorney's job for them.

Luckily I believe Jerry has had plenty of experience cross examining lab workers and arguing for his right to press them on certain issues.

***

&gt; ATTORNEY BUTING: Judge, this witness has testified that there's DNA found on items that she  said she didn't see any blood, which could have come from buccal swabs. So she's already testified to that, **so it's in play** - whether or not the Manitowoc Sheriff's Department had any of Mr. Avery's DNA in another form, **which they did.**

&gt; Willis (to himself): *Fuck.*

**SMASH CUT TO**

&gt;&gt; *(Jury Present)*

&gt; SC (to Buting): **Could you slide it over just a little bit?**

&gt; JB: *Sure.*

&gt; SC: *Yeah. It was released from our lab on* **September 25th, 2003.**

&gt; JB: *Okay.*

&gt; SC: *And* **it was signed for at Manitowoc Sheriff's Department** *on* **10/13/03.**

&gt; JB: *And* **the name of the person who is signing it is Detective Remiker,** *or Dave Remiker?*

&gt; SC: **It appears to be.**

&gt; JB: **Manitowoc Sheriff's Department,** *right?*

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

&gt; JB: **Do you know Mr. Remiker?**

&gt; SC: **No.**


***

### Training Ducklings

***

&gt; JB: *Let's talk about 2005 and 2006,* **you had a number of new analysts that were sort of under your wings, right?**

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

&gt; JB: *And you would train them by -- kind of like you see on doctor shows, where you have the main doctor and the interns following along, right,* **like ducklings?**

&gt; SC: *Well, part of their training --*

&gt; JB: *Okay --*

&gt; SC: *-- involved that.*

&gt; JB: *And part of that training would mean* **they would follow you when you went up to your lab bench to do something?**

***
I imagine she pauses here.

***

&gt; SC: *Sometimes.*

&gt; JB: *Okay.*

***
I imagine another *longer* pause here.

***

&gt; SC: *Not that often.*

***

~~Sounds~~ Looks bad right? Reads like a bad lie.

***

### Jerry talks Ken Kratz' Opening and Avery's DNA

***

&gt; JB: **So you cannot tell this jury,** *with any degree of certainty, scientific or otherwise,* **that Steven Avery was, himself, ever inside that vehicle, can you?**

&gt; SC: *No.*

***
JB (to himself): *Good God.*
***

&gt; JB: *No --* **Meaning correct?**

&gt; SC: *That's correct.*

***
After Jerry has her repeat that distinction about four times - *not even kidding* - he moves on to bring up Kratz.

***

### One of many

***

&gt; JB: *And, so,* **if Mr. Kratz, in his opening statement, told this jury,**  *with a power point slide, right up here showing that, with the circle around that rear door, and said that that would --* **there would be evidence that Mr. Avery's DNA was on that door handle, that would be wrong, wouldn't it?**

&gt; SC: *Based on my results, I didn't find Steven Avery's  DNA on that sample.*

***

Exactly Sherry. Exactly. Who the hell else would be providing Kratz with results? It is not just that Kratz was *'wrong'*. Someone was lying, him or you?

*(Formatting post now. Still sifting trough the opening statements to find that particular moment.)*

***
### Sherry the Saint

***
Sherry's immediate and not so immediate past comes back to bite her in the ass.

&gt; JB: **One of the things that you** *in fact* **said you do is control priorities and case flow** *of what gets tested when, right?*

&gt; SC: *Correct.*

&gt; JB: *All right. Mr. Gahn pointed out that* **you were actually the analyst who did the tests that resulted in exoneration of Mr. Avery in 2003,** *right?*

&gt; SC: *Correct.*

&gt; JB: *So,* **had you done that test as soon as it came in,** *the evidence being in September of 2002, I believe,* **Mr. Avery would have been exonerated then, wouldn't he?**

&gt; SC: **Correct.**

&gt; JB: *So Mr. Avery sat for another year, in prison,* **because of the delays that resulted in your Crime Lab;** *isn't that right?*

&gt; SC: **Correct.**

***
Interesting how she did not trying to dress up that answer a bit. It reads as a rather cold response. She doesn't even offer an explanation. Heavy case load that year, Sherry? Equipment malfunctioning in the lab that year? Nothing?

*So you let Mr. Avery spend an unnecessary year in jail?*

*What of it?*

***

### An Unbiased Witness?

***

At this point I am going to **take a break from Sherry's cross examination.**

The below will **focus on the opening statement in Steven's trial as well as some back and forth between JB, DS and KK by way of written motions submitted to Willis.**

Above, Jerry was on his way to exposing Sherry as a *not so unbiased witness,* as Kratz and Gahn had tried to portray her as.

***

[**Opening Statement, Avery Trial - Ken Kratz**](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jury-Trial-Transcript-Day-1-2007Feb12.pdf)

&gt; Kratz: *The Judge told you that there was a lawsuit which was filed against Manitowoc County and many of you, in fact, virtually all of you, knew something about Steven Avery before serving on this particular jury. Mr. Avery achieved some degree of notoriety back in 2003 when* **he was exonerated for a 1985 sexual assault conviction.**


Kratz uses the term **sexual assault conviction,** no 'wrongful' included at all.



&gt; Kratz: *You should know that the exoneration was based upon DNA evidence.* **You should know that that DNA evidence was performed by** *the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory and it was performed by an analyst, the head of the DNA unit in Madison,* **a woman by the name of Sherry Culhane.** *I want you to remember that name because* **you are going to hear that name later on in this case**



Kratz is trying to lend some much needed credibility to SureHands Culhane. He know her testimony will not be very convincing. So he says, *""Hey, Jurors. This nice lady with killer hair works for me and she was the one who did the test that exonerated Steven Avery from his wrongful conviction sexual assault conviction.""*


***

Of course, the *Sherry is a Saint* narrative was building long before the trial.


[**Defendants Motion to ensure fair forensic testing**](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Defendants-Motion-to-Assure-Fair-Forensic-Testing.pdf)

&gt; **The Court, the prosecution, Mr. Avery, and Manitowoc County residents all have an interest in assuring that the handling of this case exceeds the normal standards, and that its fairness is beyond reproach or question** ... *It seems only prudent to take reasonable steps to ensure the transparency in the testing in this case. Mr. Avery was wrongfully convicted once and spent eighteen years in prison. It is not asking too much to ensure fairness throughout the investigative process in this case now.*

[**State's reply (written by KK) to Defendant's Motion to ensure fair forensic testing**](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/States-Response-to-Defendants-Motion-to-Assure-Fair-Forensic-Testing.pdf)

&gt; *Why does Mr. Avery's Case deserve to exceed normal standards?*

&gt; *The defendants perception of bias on the part of Manitowoc county is irrelevant because Manitowoc county is not conducting any of the forensic testing of evidence.*

&gt; *The state finds it* **astonishing** *that Mr. Avery wants to baby sit and look over the shoulder of* **the same crime lab analyst who exonerated him a few years ago.**

***

The narrative was already building. **Sherry was the one who exonerated him, and therefore she would never falsify a test to put him back in prison.** Kratz does this often, he offers this part of his argument for trial, which at least let Dean and Jerry know how they could go about discrediting her opinions when she was on the stand.

[**State's reply cont..**](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/States-Response-to-Defendants-Motion-to-Assure-Fair-Forensic-Testing.pdf)

&gt; *Allowing outside viewers to the testing process is contrary to the state crime lab's adherence to the strict controls necessary for accreditation. Two of the distinguishing features for a forensic laboratory are the requirement for security and* **the requirement to reduce the risk of contamination** *during the testing process.* **A few shed skin cells or just a cough may needlessly put testing results in question.**

***

Turns out the few shed skin cells that put the results in question came from a cough, or did it happen while she was talking / training? **If only we had video of the testing process.**

***

### Back to the Cross Examination of Sherry Culhane

***

**Jerry exposes Sherry's past to the jury.**

&gt; JB: **Another thing Mr. Gahn didn't point out is another irony in this case.** *Not only were you involved in the  exoneration of Mr. Avery, but* **you were also involved in the 1985 conviction of Mr. Avery,** *weren't you?*

&gt; SC: *I worked evidence on that case, yes.*


&gt; JB: **You testified as a witness for the prosecution** *at trial in that case,* **didn't you?**

&gt; SC: *To be perfectly honest,* **I do not remember** *my entire testimony from 1985.*

***
*Satisfying moment in* **3...2...1...**

***

JB: **Well, I have it here,** *if you need to refer to it. But I don't know that we'll get into that much  detail.*

***

That was good. Wonder how much color dropped out of her face.

We are treated to a similar moment not far off when Jerry grills Sherry about her 1985 opinion on **microscopic hair comparison analysis,** a long outdated and inaccurate method of identifying hairs via *microscopic comparison.*
Self explanatory?

Good.

***

&gt; JB: **So, for instance, in the  1985 trial of Mr. Avery, there were some hairs found,** *head hairs I think, found* **on a T-shirt that he was wearing on the day of this poor woman's rape, right?**

&gt; SC: **I don't recall** *exactly.*

&gt; JB: *Okay. Do you recall giving an opinion that  one hair found on Mr. Avery's T-shirt appeared to be similar to or consistent with a head hair standard of the victim in that case?*

&gt; SC: **No, I don't recall** *exactly. I'm assuming it's in my report, but I don't have independent recollection of that --*

&gt; JB: **Would you like to take a moment to review --**

&gt; SC: *(Gulp)* **Yes -- **

&gt; JB: **-- a portion of your transcript?**

&gt; SC: **Yes, sir, I can.**

***

Gahn to the rescue!!

***

&gt; ATTORNEY GAHN: *Your Honor, at this time* **I just question the relevancy of this** *to the testimony that Ms. Culhane gave in this case, the relevancy in this case.*

&gt; THE COURT: *Mr. Buting.*

&gt; ATTORNEY BUTING: *Mr. Gahn tried to present her as a* **totally unbiased witness** *for them, in the event that because she -- her test in 2003 resulted in the exoneration.* **I think the jury needs to hear that she's also testified the other way for the  prosecution at the beginning of the trial.**

***

And now we see one of the very few times where we believe Jerry made a mistake in not simply agreeing with the judge. A simple, 'Correct, your  honor' may have served him better here:

&gt; THE COURT: *As I understand your line of  questioning, it's an attack on the methodology that  was used at the time, not on her credibility.*

&gt; ATTORNEY BUTING: *Also a question on her opinion and the validity of her opinions.*

&gt; THE COURT: *No, I'm going to sustain the objection.*

&gt; ATTORNEY BUTING: *Alright.* (To Witness) *At the time you were presenting testimony* **you expressed it in terms of a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, didn't you?**

&gt; SC: *In 1985,* **I do not remember** *how I stated that.*

Must be something in the water.

***

### ~~Blind~~ Testing

***

After a truly embarrassing moment where Jerry must explain the meaning of a double blind test, we come to this moment below. It happens right before Buting puts her notes from her phone call with Fassbender up on the ELMO wherein Fassbender requested Sherry 'put [Teresa] in Avery's house or garage.'

***

&gt; JB: *Not only do you know who it is you are testing, but* **you have some idea whether they are considered a suspect in the case or not?**

&gt; SC: *That's correct.*

&gt; JB: **You know that because you talk with police and prosecutors?**

&gt; SC: *That in part and it comes into the laboratory with a suspect and a victim's name.*

&gt; JB: **Oh, okay.** *So when you get it,* **you already know** *who the suspect is?*

&gt; SC: *If there is a suspect, yes.*

&gt; JB: *And in this case,* **there was a suspect.** *And the name given to* **that person was Steven Avery,** *when it came to your lab;* **isn't that right?**

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

&gt; JB: **Not only that,** *you get messages, phone messages and phone conversations, in this case with* **Mr. Fassbender,** *right?*

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

***

Then we get the moment from the documentary where she shifts and squirms while saying, *'I had that information, but that had no bearing  on my analysis at all.'*

***

### You've got mail

***

&gt; JB: **You also had some emails with Mr. Kratz, correct?**

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

&gt; ATTORNEY GAHN: *Your Honor,* **the State would like to be heard on this outside the presence of the jury.**

***

Shocker

***

&gt; ATTORNEY GAHN: *Our position, your Honor, is that* **this email is dated February 7, 2006,** *and this is well after charges being brought in the Criminal Complaint against Mr. Avery. This is clearly work product on the part of Mr. Kratz. He's talking to his witness, Ms Culhane,* **and basically talking trial strategy,** *how to go about the case,* **testing certain exemplars, or items of evidence,** *and it's just clearly a work product.*

***

**Anyone else sense that panic?**

Wonder why?

[Read the email.](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trial-Exhibit-343-Kratz-Email-to-Culhane.pdf)

I always wondered how the defense managed to slip that exhibit in there, allowing us all to marvel at Kratz and his **absolute lack of subtlety while discussing the case over email.**
When I first saw this email, it was a true WTF AHA moment. Kratz wasn't fucking around.

[**Excerpts from Kratz' E-mail to Culhane:**](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trial-Exhibit-343-Kratz-Email-to-Culhane.pdf)

+ *I don't intent to do into a lot of the ""science"" of the DNA analysis for the jury.*

+ *... it's amazing, however, how much weight the public attributed to that finding locally. ""The FBI confirms that the remains are that of the victims""! We were careful not to say that at all, but perceptions are what they are. Didn't the RFLP testing use the 7 loci for a* **""match.""**

+ *I do not need your profiles generated on ALL the results ... the way you did your last report is fine.*

+ *The only thing I do still want is a profile developed for the* **3 men that submitted elimination exemplars** *(Chuck Avery, Early Avery, Bobby Dassey)* ... **In this case the only men on the property.**

+ *Mark Weigert is checking the* **1985 Manitowoc blood sample** *taken, to make sure what it was. So* **YOU** *tested that sample back then?*

***

Also, notice how Gahn, in his argument to Willis, admits Kratz and Sherry were talking strategy in the email.

Strategy should not be what they were talking about. They should have been talking about ... you know ... results and results only ... preferably from a double blind test.

***
Buting points out that **""if it is work product, that privilege is waived by  turning it over in discovery""** and luckily Willis bends.

Just imagine the lump in Culhane's throat when she was presented with the above linked email. She would probably be very confused as to why Willis was allowing this email to be used in open court.

***

### Elimination Nation

***
&gt; JB: *And when you were asked to do a profile for each of them, those samples were referred to you as* **elimination standards,** correct?

&gt; SC: *Yes.*

&gt; JB: *Which to your mind, and your understanding,* **would seem to indicate that you were not to consider any one of those three, Chuck, Earl, or Bobby, as suspects?**

&gt; SC: *That's not entirely correct.*


Buting (to himself): *I can fix that.*

&gt; JB: *Sure. But* **the very fact that the items come to you with that designation, elimination standard, tells you  something about what the police theory,** *or what  they believe those samples relate to,* **whether they are a suspect or not?**

&gt; SC: *Correct.*

***


### Because your lab objected to it

***

**Back to the bullet.**

Jerry, while grilling her over her contamination of the bullet fragment, brings up the motion for fair forensic testing in front of the jury:

&gt; JB: *And you were aware, I believe,* **because your lab objected to it,** *that the defense filed a motion to assure fair forensic testing to allow the defense to have a witness there when you do any tests that would result in using up all the evidence?*

&gt; GAHN: *Objection, your Honor, relevancy.*

&gt; THE COURT: *I'm sustaining the objection.*

(Gahn or Kratz could probably say, ""Objection your Honor, this line of questioning makes me nervous."" And Willis still would have replied with ""I'm sustaining the objection."")

&gt; JB: *Well, in any event, because you used up all of the sample, not only could you not re-extract it, the defense had no opportunity to retest that, did we?*

&gt; SC: *You didn't have any opportunity to test the original item, but* **my extracts are available for retesting.**

*(Jerry makes her spell it out.)*

&gt; JB: **Did you retest them?**

&gt; SC: *No.*

&gt; JB: *And why not?*

&gt; SC: *I would have gotten the same thing.*

***
The bottom line is, in this case, if she had followed the protocol of her own lab, she would have had to file a report that says any DNA tests on that bullet were inconclusive.

But at least ... Celebration! The testing has been approved. Sherry is part of it yes, but she will not be the one conducting the tests.

The blood will come back as planted. 100%.

Testing the vial will help solidify that. The state only allowed testing on material that has Avery's DNA on / in them. Other than the blood in the RAV the only other material they allowed for testing was the swab - Avery's DNA pulled off the hood latch. While I am positive about the blood, I am not sure how that test will go.

***

Now:

+ If Zellner and her team can prove both the Blood and the hood latch DNA was planted she will have removed Avery's every connection to the RAV.

Then:

+ Imagine the enormous road block the state would have encountered if it was not for Sherry choosing to put Teresa in that garage.

So I recently started an internship where I'll be in charge of 3d printing prototype enclosures basically. My lead told me that he's interested in buying anywhere from 2-5 printers to add to our arsenal, preferably under 700 bucks each. 

His requirements were:
Auto bed leveling,
Can print abs, pla optional,
Can use third party filament,
Decent quality and speed for printing,
Sub $700.

The best printer I've found so far that fills these requirements seems to be the XYZ DaVinci 1.0 pro, except that the bed doesn't auto level.. but it does guide you through leveling. 

I would appreciate any advice or suggestions.
Thanks!"

Looking for general feedback and especially punctuation correction.

To whom it may concern:

After hours of watching over my brother’s shoulder, it was finally my turn; Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans, my introduction to Blizzard Entertainment. From this point on, I was an ardent Blizzard fan. This gaming passion coupled with a nerdy love of analytics, marketing and data that makes Blizzard a perfect fit and the business operations MBA internship the best starting point for my skillset.

Attached you’ll find my resume outlining my prior experience and qualifications; what you won’t find however is how well Blizzard’s core values match my own. Particularly embracing your inner geek, committing to quality, and making sure every voice matters. I have applied these and other values both as a high school teacher, creating an environment where the football captain could geek out over Einstein's theories, and as a content producer, where I meticulously scrutinize my work before it is published.


Along with these core values, you’ll find I’m especially suited for the business operations intern position. I have not yet started my MBA program and will be applying to several for Fall 2017, yet I already posses the skills you seek. I have a strong analytical mind, which steered my education towards biology and chemistry and gave me a love for numbers and problem solving. I have been involved in many scientific research projects working with a team to analyze and solve complex problems and am now ready to transfer these skills to a business environment. Blizzard Entertainment is that environment.

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications in person. Feel free to contact me using the above information to set up an interview. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration.


Best regards,

5fsjgo,1,2016-11-30,Help me edit my personal statement? Content/structure/grammar etc.,Deathbyhighered,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/5fsjgo/help_me_edit_my_personal_statement/,"Below is the first draft of my personal statement. I have really been struggling with writing a PS and this is my cleaned up first draft - hopefully free of any glaring errors. Any help would be much appreciated. Tear it up, and don't be nice. 

Personal Statement by S.M.

“Again,” said my instructor, as I stared at her, hoping she saw in my eyes that I had given up. Of course, that would not have prevented her from drilling me into completing another pirouette. I was working on a triple pirouette. I could never quite get it, and I was really sick of trying. Knowing that turns were not my strongest area in ballet, I always avoided them when possible. Staring back at me with her narrow, dark eyes, she repeated, “Again.” I complied, assuming the perfect starting pose for a pirouette. Glaring at my instructor in the mirror, I whipped around again, still falling short of the perfect three turns. I had mentally given up, but she did not care. This situation repeated itself thirty-seven times until she finally realized that today was not going to be the day. I quietly rejoiced when she finally let me go home.


After the class that day, I stormed into my house and threw myself onto our brown leather couch. As I complained to my mother about the abuse I had endured in class, my voice dripped with thirteen-year-old angst. When I recounted the terrible events of the day, my mother softly smiled, and with a twinkle in her eye, she said, “You never try anything hard. You’re naturally good at so much, and you give up at anything that challenges you.” How dare she think that about me? As I pondered this for the rest of the night, I soon realized how right she was. Her motherly insight into my personality had proven true yet again, and it had really affected me. I did not want to be someone who balked at challenge and dodged adversity. My simple venting to my mother about my harsh ballet teacher had turned into a grim glance into my own self. That night, I promised myself that I would be different, not just to work harder at pirouettes, but to try difficult things. No longer would I avoid activities with a higher risk of failure. I went into my next ballet class with a different mindset and attacked that pirouette with everything I had. It took extra hours in the studio, but after weeks of trying, I finally got it, and it felt good.


I did not know how much that evening of realization would affect my drive as a friend, a spouse, or a student. I stopped shying away from challenge and began to embrace it full force. I stopped choosing the easy path and started to try in a way that I had previously never done. I threw myself into trying hard things, things I had avoided because the thought of failing scared me. I began reading books that I had worried were over my head. I registered for the harder math class, stuck through the tough friendship, learned to do a pull-up, and went to soccer camp. The changes seemed small, but they forged a new mindset in me that carried me through my adolescence and established how I approached life.


This new outlook also changed the way I conducted my life as a college student. I gained an inner desire to prove to myself that I could do difficult things. I stopped making decisions based upon what was easy for me due to my natural abilities. Instead, I started setting goals for myself that I knew would entail major challenges along the way. In middle school, these changes looked very different from how they looked in college, but the underlying mechanism was the same: try hard things. In middle school, it was to do the pirouette. In high school, it was to register for calculus. In college, it was to take the internship, aim for graduate school, and complete the research project.


I still see my mother shaking her head at me as she shared with me the glaring insight she had into who I was. I know that I have become a different person since that day in my dance studio. Now I would keep trying until I hit that triple pirouette. When I shifted my goals from psychology to law, I saw the challenges ahead. I knew what I wanted, and I knew that my passion for justice and truth had given me a desire to attend law school. I have learned to ignore my natural instinct to shy away from possible failure. Instead, I am determined to try hard things. I know the road ahead will not be easy, but I am eager to embrace the challenges that this next chapter of my life will bring.

5fsks2,9,2016-11-30,I miss my friends and I love them.,JackApollo,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5fsks2/i_miss_my_friends_and_i_love_them/,"I'm a 15 year old boy. Beat me up all you want, there's nothing I can do about it. It's also 2 am. I'll probably fix this post in the morning if I find any stupid mistakes. 

I was diagnosed with depression when I was two years old. I have anxiety, ADD, abandonment issues, and I've tried to kill myself twice. Once in 2014 and once in 2015. I've basically given up on trying anymore, there's no point in dying. 

Every summer I go to a summer camp for 3-5 weeks that specializes in preforming arts, since I love theatre and singing. The people there, staff and kids, are the best people I've ever known. They know what it's like to be depressed, scared, empty, alone. They love the things I love, they do the things I do, they inspire me to help other people and to be a better person to everyone I encounter every single day. Whenever I'm there, I feel like a completely different person. I'm not afraid to try new styles, I'm not afraid to try something out of my comfort zone in front of a lot of people because I know none of them are going to judge me, shit talk me behind my back, bully me, make jokes about me, and ruin my confidence like the people back where I actually live. 

As I said before, I have really bad abandonment issues, which I don't think I've picked up from any certain 'tragedy', like my therapist or the Internet says. I cannot cope with the idea of having conversation or working with a person, just to have them walk out of my lives and never be seen again by me. It hurts my heart and head just thinking about it. So, considering how big of an impact these wonderful people from my camp have made on my life, never seeing them again terrifies me every day, because some of them I know I'll never see them again in real life. 

A lot of my best friends from this camp are around the age where live begins to smack them in the face. Starting college with summer internships, searching for colleges, etc. And the people who are 18 are not allowed to come back as campers, they must either choose to work at the camp or to not come back. 

Some of them live pretty close to me (I'm around a 10 minute drive from Washington DC) some living in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. But there's others. Others who live in places as far as Illinois, where I can only see them once a year, when I go to Chicago for Thanksgiving. It's really hard to see them, because I can't drive, my parents don't want me to buy bus tickets to New York on my own, and nobody's ever available.

It's difficult. It's difficult when I'm treated like shit at 'home' by my fake friends, bullies, ...anything really. My life has no purpose here. I sit at home going to school, playing video games, sleeping, repeat. Over and over again. No wonder I tried to off myself lol. 

Anyways, I'm getting sidetracked. What I wanted to say in the beginning is that if anyone from camp is reading this, I love you all so so much. You're the reason I'm still alive right now. I love you so much and I wish I could spend every waking moment with you. You make my life, and I miss you. I miss you."

I am a undergraduate student in my sophomore year here studying Government, B.A. and Urban Studies, B.A. I've been looking into both programs and I can't seem to tell any difference in terms of outcome. 

It appears you both get the same certificate, but I can't exactly tell what's separating the two in terms of outcome. One thing I noticed is that the course work for UTeach Urban Teachers is only 18 hours, while UTeach Liberal Arts would've been about 42 hours for me (since you have to take all the required coursework within your major, such as all the history, geography, etc., that I wouldn't be required to take otherwise). 

For anyone participating in the UTeach Liberal Arts program, are they pretty strict about the requirements within your major (like the coursework that isn't directly related to education, such as specific history courses and specific geography courses, etc)? Because that is my main problem with the program compared to UTeach Urban Studies, because it looks like UTeach Urban Teachers doesn't require all that, so I would graduate quicker.

I also noticed that UTeach Urban Teachers sets you up with a paid internship during the summer in Austin, but UTeach Liberal Arts doesn't seem to do anything like that.

**Overall, it looks like UTeach Urban Teachers is more on-the-field based certificate while UTeach Liberal Arts is more learning by professors? Is this right or no?** 

**What are the differences between the two, any pros, cons, any thing you want to share?**

Thanks so much in advance,

Opie is fucking ATROCIOUS in every sense of the word -- we know this. You don't call in when Bobby Kelly is in the room and talk about how their conversation is boring...you talk about how Opie specifically is boring, unfunny, his YouTube videos are creepy and pathetic, and he just suffered through the utter embarrassment of having his intern steal his show, only to have dirt kicked in his face yet again by them literally taking his name off the channel.

No one is listening to the show, no one believes for a fucking second that Sirius wanted him to stay for longer than a year just to have a grace period where they can gradually phase him out, and he is literally unable to inject any type of creative or humorous thought into his own show.

Oh, and Bam fucked his wife, who will also be gone once the checks dry up. *hang up*"

My bosses have been telling me to only learn the React/meteor frameworks to build our product. They like React due to its modular nature, but I have heard that the industry standard is still Angular 1 and Angular 2 will be great for scalability[I don't know enough to qualify this statement just heard it from my engineer friends]. However, since my bosses have a bias toward Angular, I will not be able to learn anything on it while at work. 


So for Angular 1 and 2, should I put in some of my own personal time to learn Angular 1 or 2? Or if not will this negatively affect my prospects of a future job somewhere else? "
